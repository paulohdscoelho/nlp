do she breath mr carter smile just go on with what you re do now find jane finn ye butwho is jane finn mr carter nod grave ye you re entitl to know that i think he lean back in hi chair cross hi leg brought the tip of hi finger togeth and began in a low monoton secret diplomaci which by the wai is nearli alwai bad polici doe not concern you it will be suffici to sai that in the earli dai of a certain document came into be it wa the draft of a secret agreementtreatycal it what you like it wa drawn up readi for signatur by the variou repres and drawn up in americaat that time a neutral countri it wa dispatch to england by a special messeng select for that purpos a young fellow call danver it wa hope that the whole affair had been kept so secret that noth would have leak out that kind of hope is usual disappoint somebodi alwai talk danver sail for england on the lusitania he carri the preciou paper in an oilskin packet which he wore next hi skin it wa on that particular voyag that the lusitania wa torpedo and sunk danver wa among the list of those miss eventu hi bodi wa wash ashor and identifi beyond ani possibl doubt but the oilskin packet wa miss the question wa had it been taken from him or had he himself pass it on into anoth s keep there were a few incid that strengthen the possibl of the latter theori after the torpedo struck the ship in the few moment dure the launch of the boat danver wa seen speak to a young american girl no on actual saw him pass anyth to her but he might have done so it seem to me quit like that he entrust the paper to thi girl believ that she as a woman had a greater chanc of bring them safe to shore but if so where wa the girl and what had she done with the paper by later advic from america it seem like that danver had been close shadow on the wai over wa thi girl in leagu with hi enemi or had she in her turn been shadow and either trick or forc into hand over the preciou packet we set to work to trace her out it prove unexpectedli difficult her name wa jane finn and it duli appear among the list of the survivor but the girl herself seem to have vanish complet inquiri into her anteced did littl to help us she wa an orphan and had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small school out west her passport had been made out for pari where she wa go to join the staff of a hospit she had offer her servic voluntarili and after some correspond thei had been accept have seen her name in the list of the save from the lusitania the staff of the hospit were natur veri surpris at her not arriv to take up her billet and at not hear from her in ani wai well everi effort wa made to trace the young ladybut all in vain we track her across ireland but noth could be heard of her after she set foot in england no us wa made of the draft treatya might veri easili have been doneand we therefor came to the conclus that danver had after all destroi it the war enter on anoth phase the diplomat aspect chang accordingli and the treati wa never redraft rumour as to it exist were emphat deni the disappear of jane finn wa forgotten and the whole affair wa lost in oblivion mr carter paus and tuppenc broke in impati but why ha it all crop up again the war s over a hint of alert came into mr carter s manner becaus it seem that the paper were not destroi after all and that thei might be resurrect todai with a new and deadli signific tuppenc stare mr carter nod ye five year ago that draft treati wa a weapon in our hand todai it is a weapon against us it wa a gigant blunder if it term were made public it would mean disast it might possibl bring about anoth warnot with germani thi time that is an extrem possibl and i do not believ in it likelihood myself but that document undoubtedli implic a number of our statesmen whom we cannot afford to have discredit in ani wai at the present moment as a parti cry for labour it would be irresist and a labour govern at thi junctur would in my opinion be a grave disabl for british trade but that is a mere noth to the real danger he paus and then said quietli you mai perhap have heard or read that there is bolshevist influenc at work behind the present labour unrest tuppenc nod that is the truth bolshevist gold is pour into thi countri for the specif purpos of procur a revolut and there is a certain man a man whose real name is unknown to us who is work in the dark for hi own end the bolshevist ar behind the labour unrestbut thi man is behind the bolshevist who is he we do not know he is alwai spoken of by the unassum titl of mr brown but on thing is certain he is the master crimin of thi ag he control a marvel organ most of the peac propaganda dure the war wa origin and financ by him hi spi ar everywher a natur german ask tommi on the contrari i have everi reason to believ he is an englishman he wa progerman as he would have been proboer what he seek to attain we do not knowprob suprem power for himself of a kind uniqu in histori we have no clue as to hi real person it is report that even hi own follow ar ignor of it where we have come across hi track he ha alwai plai a secondari part somebodi els assum the chief r le but afterward we alwai find that there ha been some nonent a servant or a clerk who ha remain in the background unnot and that the elus mr brown ha escap us onc more oh tuppenc jump i wonder ye i rememb in mr whittington s offic the clerkh call him brown you don t think carter nod thoughtfulli veri like a curiou point is that the name is usual mention an idiosyncrasi of geniu can you describ him at all i realli didn t notic he wa quit ordinaryjust like anyon els mr carter sigh in hi tire manner that is the invari descript of mr brown brought a telephon messag to the man whittington did he notic a telephon in the outer offic tuppenc thought no i don t think i did exactli that messag wa mr brown s wai of give an order to hi subordin he overheard the whole convers of cours wa it after that that whittington hand you over the monei and told you to come the follow dai tuppenc nod ye undoubtedli the hand of mr brown mr carter paus well there it is you see what you ar pit yourselv against possibl the finest crimin brain of the ag i don t quit like it you know you re such young thing both of you i shouldn t like anyth to happen to you it won t tuppenc assur him posit i ll look after her sir said tommi and i ll look after you retort tuppenc resent the manli assert well then look after each other said mr carter smile now let s get back to busi there s someth mysteri about thi draft treati that we haven t fathom yet we ve been threaten with itin plain and unmistak term the revolutionari element as good as declar that it s in their hand and that thei intend to produc it at a given moment on the other hand thei ar clearli at fault about mani of it provis the govern consid it as mere bluff on their part and rightli or wrongli have stuck to the polici of absolut denial i m not so sure there have been hint indiscreet allus that seem to indic that the menac is a real on the posit is much as though thei had got hold of an incrimin document but couldn t read it becaus it wa in cipherbut we know that the draft treati wasn t in ciphercouldn t be in the natur of thingsso that won t wash but there s someth of cours jane finn mai be dead for all we knowbut i don t think so the curiou thing is that thei re try to get inform about the girl from us what ye on or two littl thing have crop up and your stori littl ladi confirm my idea thei know we re look for jane finn well thei ll produc a jane finn of their ownsai at a pensionnat in pari tuppenc gasp and mr carter smile no on know in the least what she look like so that s all right she s prime with a trumpedup tale and her real busi is to get as much inform as possibl out of us see the idea then you think tuppenc paus to grasp the supposit fulli that it wa as jane finn that thei want me to go to pari mr carter smile more wearili than ever i believ in coincid you know he said chapter v mr juliu p hersheimm well said tuppenc recov herself it realli seem as though it were meant to be carter nod i know what you mean i m superstiti myself luck and all that sort of thing fate seem to have chosen you out to be mix up in thi tommi indulg in a chuckl my word i don t wonder whittington got the wind up when tuppenc plump out that name i should have myself but look here sir we re take up an aw lot of your time have you ani tip to give us befor we clear out i think not my expert work in stereotyp wai have fail you will bring imagin and an open mind to the task don t be discourag if that too doe not succe for on thing there is a likelihood of the pace be forc tuppenc frown uncomprehendingli when you had that interview with whittington thei had time befor them i have inform that the big coup wa plan for earli in the new year but the govern is contempl legisl action which will deal effectu with the strike menac thei ll get wind of it soon if thei haven t alreadi and it s possibl that that mai bring thing to a head i hope it will myself the less time thei have to matur their plan the better i m just warn you that you haven t much time befor you and that you needn t be cast down if you fail it s not an easi proposit anywai that s all tuppenc rose i think we ought to be businesslik what exactli can we count upon you for mr carter mr carter s lip twitch slightli but he repli succinctli fund within reason detail inform on ani point and no offici recognit i mean that if you get yourselv into troubl with the polic i can t offici help you out of it you re on your own tuppenc nod sage i quit understand that i ll write out a list of the thing i want to know when i ve had time to think nowabout monei ye miss tuppenc do you want to sai how much not exactli we ve got plenti to go with for the present but when we want more it will be wait for you ye buti m sure i don t want to be rude about the govern if you ve got anyth to do with it but you know on realli ha the devil of a time get anyth out of it and if we have to fill up a blue form and send it in and then after three month thei send us

hasten to explain we haven t kidnap your cousin on the contrari we re try to find her we re emploi to do so mr hersheimm leant back in hi chair put me wise he said succinctli tommi fell in with thi demand in so far as he gave him a guard version of the disappear of jane finn and of the possibl of her have been mix up unawar in some polit show he allud to tuppenc and himself as privat inquiri agent commiss to find her and ad that thei would therefor be glad of ani detail mr hersheimm could give them that gentleman nod approv i guess that s all right i wa just a mite hasti but london get my goat i onli know littl old new york just trot out your question and i ll answer for the moment thi paralys the young adventur but tuppenc recov herself plung boldli into the breach with a reminisc cull from detect fiction when did you last see the deceyour cousin i mean never seen her respond mr hersheimm what demand tommi astonish hersheimm turn to him no sir as i said befor my father and her mother were brother and sister just as you might be tommi did not correct thi view of their relationship but thei didn t alwai get on togeth and when my aunt made up her mind to marri amo finn who wa a poor school teacher out west my father wa just mad said if he made hi pile as he seem in a fair wai to do she d never see a cent of it well the upshot wa that aunt jane went out west and we never

got the dollar well would you believ it my conscienc got busi kept knock me up and sai what about your aunt jane wai out west it worri me some you see i figur it out that amo finn would never make

save all right but thei didn t seem abl to hear of her over thi side i guess thei weren t hustl ani so i thought i d come along over and speed thing up i phone scotland yard and the admiralti first thing the admiralti rather choke me off but scotland yard were veri civilsaid thei would make inquiri even sent a man round thi morn to get her photograph i m off to pari tomorrow just to see what the prefectur is do i guess if i go to and fro hustl them thei ought to get busi the energi of mr hersheimm wa tremend thei bow befor it but sai now he end you re not after her for anyth contempt of court or someth british a proudspirit young american girl might find your rule and regul in war time rather irksom and get up against it if that s the case and there s such a thing as graft in thi countri i ll bui her off tuppenc reassur him that s good then we can work togeth what about some lunch shall we have it up here or go down to the restaur tuppenc express a prefer for the latter and juliu bow to her decis oyster had just given place to sole colbert when a card wa brought to hersheimm inspector japp cid scotland yard again anoth man thi time what doe he expect i can tell him that i didn t tell the first chap i hope thei haven t lost that photograph that western photograph s place wa burn down and all hi neg destroyedthi is the onli copi in exist i got it from the princip of the colleg there an unformul dread swept over tuppenc youyou don t know the name of the man who came thi morn ye i do no i don t half a second it wa on hi card oh i know inspector brown quiet unassum sort of chap chapter vi a plan of campaign a veil might with profit be drawn over the event of the next halfhour suffic it to sai that no such person as inspector brown wa known to scotland yard the photograph of jane finn which would have been of the utmost valu to the polic in trace her wa lost beyond recoveri onc again mr brown had triumph the immedi result of thi setback wa to effect a rapproch between juliu hersheimm and the young adventur all barrier went down with a crash and tommi and tuppenc felt thei had known the young american all their live thei abandon the discreet retic of privat inquiri agent and reveal to him the whole histori of the joint ventur whereat the young man declar himself tickl to death he turn to tuppenc at the close of the narrat i ve alwai had a kind of idea that english girl were just a mite mossgrown oldfashion and sweet you know but scare to move round without a footman or a maiden aunt i guess i m a bit behind the time the upshot of these confidenti relat wa that tommi and tuppenc took up their abod forthwith at the ritz in order as tuppenc put it to keep in touch with jane finn s onli live relat and put like that she ad confidenti to tommi nobodi could boggl at the expens nobodi did which wa the great thing and now said the young ladi on the morn after their instal to work mr beresford put down the daili mail which he wa read and applaud with somewhat unnecessari vigour he wa polit request by hi colleagu not to be an ass dash it all tommi we ve got to do someth for our monei tommi sigh ye i fear even the dear old govern will not support us at the ritz in idl for ever therefor as i said befor we must do someth well said tommi pick up the daili mail again do it i shan t stop you you see continu tuppenc i ve been think she wa interrupt by a fresh bout of applaus it s all veri well for you to sit there be funni tommi it would do you no harm to do a littl brain work too my union tuppenc my union it doe not permit me to work befor am tommi do you want someth thrown at you it is absolut essenti that we should without delai map out a plan of campaign hear hear well let s do it tommi laid hi paper final asid there s someth of the simplic of the truli great mind about you tuppenc fire ahead i m listen to begin with said tuppenc what have we to go upon absolut noth said tommi cheerili wrong tuppenc wag an energet finger we have two distinct clue what ar thei first clue we know on of the gang whittington ye i d recogn him anywher hum said tommi doubtfulli i don t call that much of a clue you don t know where to look for him and it s about a thousand to on against your run against him by accid i m not so sure about that repli tuppenc thoughtfulli i ve often notic that onc coincid start happen thei go on happen in the most extraordinari wai i dare sai it s some natur law that we haven t found out still as you sai we can t reli on that but there ar place in london where simpli everi on is bound to turn up sooner or later piccadilli circu for instanc on of my idea wa to take up my stand there everi dai with a trai of flag what about meal inquir the practic tommi how like a man what doe mere food matter that s all veri well you ve just had a thunder good breakfast no on s got a better appetit than you have tuppenc and by teatim you d be eat the flag pin and all but honestli i don t think much of the idea whittington

femal crook answer to the name of rita i am not i propos to reason in a logic manner that man danver wa shadow on the wai over wasn t he and it s more like to have been a woman than a man i don t see that at all i am absolut certain that it would be a woman and a goodlook on repli tuppenc calmli on these technic point i bow to your decis murmur mr beresford now obvious thi woman whoever she wa wa save how do you make that out if she wasn t how would thei have known jane finn had got the paper correct proce o sherlock now there s just a chanc i admit it s onli a chanc that thi woman mai have been rita and if so if so we ve got to hunt through the survivor of the lusitania till we find her then the first thing is to get a list of the survivor i ve got it i wrote a long list of thing i want to know and sent it to mr carter i got hi repli thi morn and among other thing it enclos the offici statement of those save from the lusitania how s that for clever littl tuppenc full mark for industri zero for modesti but the great point is is there a rita on the list that s just what i don t know confess tuppenc don t know ye look here togeth thei bent over the list you see veri few

with the same infinit pain he revers hi former tactic all went well and with a sigh of relief the young man rose to hi feet there wa a certain bulldog tenac about tommi that made him slow to admit defeat checkmat for the moment he wa far from abandon the conflict he still intend to hear what wa go on in the lock room as on plan had fail he must hunt about for anoth he look round him a littl farther along the passag on the left wa a second door he slip silent along to it he listen for a moment or two then tri the handl it yield and he slip insid the room which wa unten wa furnish as a

knew a guard came along and inform me mighti polit that i wasn t in a smokingcarriag i hand him out half a dollar and that settl that i did a bit of prospect along the corridor to the next coach whittington wa there right enough when i saw the skunk with hi big sleek fat face and thought of poor littl jane in hi clutch i felt real mad that i hadn t got a gun with me i d have tickl him up some we got to bournemouth all right whittington took a cab and gave the name of an hotel i did likewis and we drove up within three minut of each other he hire a room and i hire on too so far it wa all plain sail he hadn t the remotest notion that anyon wa on to him well he just sat around in the hotel loung read the paper and so on till it wa time for dinner he didn t hurri ani over that either i began to think that there wa noth do that he d just come on the trip for hi health but i rememb that he hadn t chang for dinner though it wa by wai of be a slapup hotel so it seem like enough that he d be go out on hi real busi afterward sure enough about nine o clock so he did took a car across the townmighti pretti place by the wai i guess i ll take jane there for a spell when i find herand then paid it off and struck out along those pinewood on the top of the cliff i wa there too you understand we walk mayb for half an hour there s a lot of villa all the wai along but by degre thei seem to get more and more thin out and in the end we got to on that seem the last of the bunch big hous it wa with a lot of pini ground around it it wa a pretti black night and the carriag drive up to the hous wa dark as pitch i could hear him ahead though i couldn t see him i had to walk carefulli in case he might get on to it that he wa be follow i turn a curv and i wa just in time to see him ring the bell and get admit to the hous i just stop where i wa it wa begin to rain and i wa soon pretti near soak through also it wa almighti cold whittington didn t come out again and by and by i got kind of restiv and began to mouch around all the ground floor window were shutter tight but upstair on the first floor it wa a twostori hous i notic a window with a light burn and the curtain not drawn now just opposit to that window there wa a tree grow it wa about thirti foot awai from the hous mayb and i sort of got it into my head that if i climb up that tree i d veri like be abl to see into that room of cours i knew there wa no reason why whittington should be in that room rather than in ani otherless reason in fact for the bet would be on hi be in on of the receptionroom downstair but i guess i d got the hump from stand so long in the rain and anyth seem better than go on do noth so i start up it wasn t so easi by a long chalk the rain had made the bough mighti slipperi and it wa all i could do to keep a foothold but bit by bit i manag it until at last there i wa level with the window but then i wa disappoint i wa too far to the left i could onli see sidewai into the room a bit of curtain and a yard of wallpap wa all i could command well that wasn t ani manner of good to me but just as i wa go to give it up and climb down ignomini some on insid move and threw hi shadow on my littl bit of walland by gum it wa whittington after that my blood wa up i d just got to get a look into that room it wa up to me to figur out how i notic that there wa a long branch run out from the tree in the right direct if i could onli swarm about halfwai along it the proposit would be solv but it wa mighti uncertain whether it would bear my weight i decid i d just got to risk that and i start veri cautious inch by inch i crawl along the bough creak and swai in a nasti fashion and it didn t do to think of the drop below but at last i got safe to where i want to be the room wa mediums furnish in a kind of bare hygien wai there wa a tabl with a lamp on it in the middl of the room and sit at that tabl face toward me wa whittington right enough he wa talk to a woman dress as a hospit nurs she wa sit with her back to me so i couldn t see her face although the blind were up the window itself wa shut so i couldn t catch a word of what thei said whittington seem to be do all the talk and the nurs just listen now and then she nod and sometim she d shake her head as though she were answer question he seem veri emphaticonc or twice he beat with hi fist on the tabl the rain had stop now and the sky wa clear in that sudden wai it doe present he seem to get to the end of what he wa sai he got up and so did she he look toward the window and ask somethingi guess it wa whether it wa rain anywai she came right across and look out just then the moon came out from behind the cloud i wa scare the woman would catch sight of me for i wa full in the moonlight i tri to move back a bit the jerk i gave wa too much for that rotten old branch with an almighti crash down it came and juliu p hersheimm with it oh juliu breath tuppenc how excit go on well luckili for me i pitch down into a good soft bed of earthbut it put me out of action for the time sure enough the next thing i knew i wa ly in bed with a hospit nurs not whittington s on on on side of me and a littl blackbeard man with gold glass and medic man written all over him on the other he rub hi hand togeth and rais hi eyebrow as i stare at him ah he said so our young friend is come round again capit capit i did the usual stunt said what s happen and where am i but i knew the answer to the last well enough there s no moss grow on my brain i think that ll do for the present sister said the littl man and the nurs left the room in a sort of brisk welltrain wai but i caught her hand me out a look of deep curios as she pass through the door that look of her gave me an idea now then doc i said and tri to sit up in bed but my right foot gave me a nasti twing as i did so a slight sprain explain the doctor noth seriou you ll be about again in a coupl of dai i notic you walk lame interpol tuppenc juliu nod and continu

tuppenc felt much like a rudderless ship it wa curiou that juliu who wa undoubtedli much clever than tommi did not give her the same feel of support she had accus tommi of be a pessimist and it is certain that he alwai saw the disadvantag and difficulti which she herself wa optimist given to overlook but nevertheless she had realli reli a good deal on hi judgment he might be slow but he wa veri

will excus me if i sai that i do not see how it bear on the subject of your inquiri it bear on it in thi wai is it not a fact that mr vandemey commit a young rel of her to your charg juliu lean forward eagerli that is the case said the doctor quietli under the name of janet vandemey i understood her to be a niec of mr vandemey s and she came to you as far as i can rememb in june or juli of wa she a mental case she is perfectli sane if that is what you mean i understood from mr vandemey that the girl had been with her on the lusitania when that illfat ship wa sunk and had suffer a sever

interest there wa someth rather ghoulish in the littl man s satisfact and she rememb noth said sir jame slowli noth prior to mai after that date her memori is as good as your or mine then the first thing she rememb is land with the survivor everyth befor that is a blank she did not know her own name or where she had come from or where she wa she couldn t even speak her own tongu but sure all thi is most unusu put in juliu no my dear sir quit normal under the circumst sever shock to the nervou system loss of memori proce nearli alwai on the same line i suggest a specialist of cours there s a veri good man in parismak a studi of these casesbut mr vandemey oppos the idea of public that might result from such a cours i can imagin she would said sir jame grimli i fell in with her view there is a certain notorieti given to these case and the girl wa veri youngnineteen i believ it seem a piti that her infirm should be talk aboutmight damag her prospect besid there is no special treatment to pursu in such case it is realli a matter of wait wait ye sooner or later the memori will returna suddenli as it went but in all probabl the girl will have entir forgotten the interven period and will take up life where she left offat the sink of the lusitania and when do you expect thi to happen the doctor shrug hi shoulder ah that i cannot sai sometim it is a matter of month sometim it ha been known to be as long as twenti year sometim anoth shock doe the trick on restor what the other took awai anoth shock eh said juliu thoughtfulli exactli there wa a case in colorado the littl man s

though i alreadi know you quit well thank you sir said tommi with hi cheer grin he scan the great lawyer eagerli like tuppenc he felt the magnet of the other s person he wa remind of mr carter the two men total unlik so far as physic resembl went produc a similar effect beneath the weari manner of the on and the profession reserv of the other lai the same qualiti of mind keenedg like a rapier in the meantim he wa consciou of sir jame s close scrutini when the lawyer drop hi ey the young man had the feel that the other had read him through and through like an open book he could not but wonder what the final judgment wa but there wa littl chanc of learn that sir jame took in everyth but gave out onli what he chose a proof of that occur almost at onc immedi the first greet were over juliu broke out into a flood of eager question how had sir jame manag to track the girl why had he not let them know that he wa still work on the case and so on sir jame stroke hi chin and smile at last he said just so just so well she s found and that s the great thing isn t it eh come now that s the great thing sure it is but just how did you strike her trail miss tuppenc and i thought you d quit for

d be sure to bring her along that would hardli be possibl said sir jame grave why becaus the young ladi wa knock down in a street accid and ha sustain slight injuri to the head she wa taken to the infirmari and on recov conscious gave her name as jane finn whenahi heard that i arrang for her to be remov to the hous of a doctora friend of mine and wire at onc for you she relaps into unconsci and ha not spoken sinc she s not serious hurt oh a bruis and a cut or two realli from a medic point of view absurdli slight injuri to have produc such a condit her state is probabl to be attribut to the mental shock consequ on recov her memori it s come back cri juliu excitedli sir jame tap the tabl rather impati undoubtedli mr hersheimm sinc she wa abl to give her real name i thought you had appreci that point and you just happen to be on the spot said tommi seem quit like a fairi tale but sir jame wa far too wari to be drawn coincid ar curiou thing he said dryli nevertheless tommi wa now certain of what he had befor onli suspect sir jame s presenc in manchest wa not accident far from abandon the case as juliu suppos he had by some mean of hi own successfulli run the miss girl to earth the onli thing that puzzl tommi wa the reason for all thi secreci he conclud that it wa a foibl of the legal mind juliu wa speak after dinner he announc i shall go right awai and see jane that will be imposs i fear said sir jame it is veri unlik thei would allow her to see visitor at thi time of night i should suggest tomorrow morn about ten o clock juliu flush there wa someth in sir jame which alwai stir him to antagon it wa a conflict of two master person all the same i reckon i ll go round there tonight and see if i can t ginger them up to break through their silli rule it will be quit useless mr hersheimm the word came out like the crack of a pistol and tommi look up with a start juliu wa nervou and excit the hand with which he rais hi glass to hi lip shook slightli but hi ey held sir jame s defiantli for a moment the hostil between the two seem like to burst into flame but in the end juliu lower hi ey defeat for the moment i reckon you re the boss thank you said the other we will sai ten o clock then with consumm eas of manner he turn to tommi i must confess mr beresford that it wa someth of a surpris to me to see you here thi even the last i heard of you wa that your

awai but for the girl sir no sir jame smile a littl it wa lucki for you she happen toertak a fanci to you tommi appear about to protest but sir jame went on there s no doubt about her be on of the gang i suppos i m afraid not sir i thought perhap thei were keep her there by forc but the wai she act didn t fit in with that you see she went back to them when she could have got awai sir jame nod thoughtfulli what did she sai someth about want to be taken to marguerit ye sir i suppos she meant mr vandemey she alwai sign herself rita vandemey all her friend spoke of her as rita still i suppos the girl must have been in the habit of call her by her full name and at the moment she wa cry out to her mr vandemey wa either dead or dy curiou there ar on or two point that strike me as be obscuretheir sudden chang of attitud toward yourself for instanc by the wai the hous wa raid of cours ye sir but thei d all clear out natur said sir jame dryli and not a clue left behind i wonder the lawyer tap the tabl thoughtfulli someth in hi voic made tommi look up would thi man s ey have seen someth where their had been blind he spoke impuls i wish you d been there sir to go over the hous i wish i had said sir jame quietli he sat for a moment in silenc then he look up and sinc then what have you been do for a moment tommi stare at him then it dawn on him that of cours the lawyer did not

knife and fork sharpli ha anyth happen to miss tuppenc hi voic wa keenedg she s disappear said juliu when a week ago how sir jame s question fairli shot out between them tommi and juliu gave the histori of the last week and their futil search sir jame went at onc to the root of the matter a wire sign with your name thei knew enough of you both for that thei weren t sure of how much you had learnt in that hous their kidnap of miss tuppenc is the countermov to your escap if necessari thei could seal your lip with a threat of what might happen to her tommi nod that s just what i thought sir sir jame look at him keenli you had work that out had you not badnot at all bad the curiou thing is that thei certainli did not know anyth about you when thei first held you prison you ar sure that you did not in ani wai disclos your ident tommi shook hi head that s so said juliu with a nod therefor i reckon some on put them wiseand not earlier than sundai afternoon ye but who that almighti

and open the middl drawer a photograph carelessli thrust in face upward caught hi ey for a moment he stood root to the ground then he took it out shut the drawer walk slowli over to an armchair and sat down still stare at the photograph in hi hand what on earth wa a photograph of the french girl annett do in juliu hersheimm s writingt chapter xxii in down street the prime minist tap the desk in front of him with nervou finger hi face wa worn and harass he took up hi convers with mr carter at the point it had broken off i don t understand he said do you realli mean that thing ar not so desper after all so thi lad seem to think let s have a look at hi letter again mr carter hand it over it wa written in a sprawl boyish hand dear mr carter someth s turn up that ha given me a jar of cours i mai be simpli make an aw ass of myself but i don t think so if my conclus ar right that girl at manchest wa just a plant the whole thing wa prearrang sham packet and all with the object of make us think the game wa uptherefor i fanci that we must have been pretti hot on the scent i think i know who the real jane finn is and i ve even got an idea where the paper ar that last s onli a guess of cours but i ve a sort of feel it ll turn out right anyhow i enclos it in a seal envelop for what it s worth i m go to ask you not to open it until the veri last moment midnight on the th in fact you ll understand why in a minut you see i ve figur it out that those thing of tuppenc s ar a plant too and she s no more drown than i am the wai i reason is thi as a last chanc thei ll let jane finn escap in the hope that she s been sham thi memori stunt and that onc she think she s free she ll go right awai to the cach of cours it s an aw risk for them to take becaus she know all about thembut thei re pretti desper to get hold of that treati but if thei know that the paper have been recov by us neither of those two girl live will be worth an hour s purchas i must try and get hold of tuppenc befor jane escap i want a repeat of that telegram that wa sent to tuppenc at the ritz sir jame peel edgerton said you would be abl to manag that for me he s frightfulli clever on last thingpleas have that hous in soho watch dai and night your etc thoma beresford the prime minist look up the enclosur mr carter smile dryli in the vault of the bank i am take no chanc you don t think the prime minist hesit a minut that it would be better to open it now sure we ought to secur the document that is provid the young man s guess turn out to be correct at onc we can keep the fact of have done so quit secret can we i m not so sure there ar spi all round us onc it s known i wouldn t give that he snap hi finger for the life of those two girl no the boi trust me and i shan t let him down well well we must leav it at that then what s he like thi lad outwardli he s an ordinari cleanlimb rather blockhead young englishman slow in hi mental process on the other hand it s quit imposs to lead him astrai through hi imagin he hasn t got anyso he s difficult to deceiv he worri thing out slowli and onc he s got hold of anyth he doesn t let go the littl ladi s quit differ more intuit and less common sens thei make a pretti pair work togeth pace and stamina he seem confid muse the prime minist ye and that s what give me hope he s the kind of diffid youth who would have to be veri sure befor he ventur an opinion at all a half smile came to the other s lip and it is thisboi who will defeat the master crimin of our time thisboi as you sai but i sometim fanci i see a shadow behind you mean peel edgerton peel edgerton said the prime minist in astonish ye i see hi hand in thi he struck the open letter he s therework in the dark silent unobtrus i ve alwai felt that if anyon wa to run mr brown to earth peel edgerton would be the man i tell you he s on the case now but doesn t want it known by the wai i got rather an odd request from him the other dai ye he sent me a cut from some american paper it refer to a man s bodi found near the dock in new york about three week ago he ask me to collect ani inform on the subject i could well carter shrug hi shoulder i couldn t get much young fellow about thirtyfivepoorli dressedfac veri badli disfigur he wa never identifi and you fanci that the two matter ar connect in some wai somehow i do i mai be wrong of cours there wa a paus then mr carter continu i ask him to come round here not that we ll get anyth out of him he doesn t want to tell hi legal instinct ar too strong but there s no doubt he can throw light on on or two obscur point in young beresford s letter ah here he is the two men rose to greet the newcom a half whimsic thought flash across the premier s mind my successor perhap we ve had a letter from young beresford said mr carter come to the point at onc you ve seen him i suppos you suppos wrong said the lawyer oh mr carter wa a littl nonpluss sir jame smile and stroke hi chin he rang me up he volunt would you have ani object to tell us exactli what pass between you not at all he thank me for a certain letter which i had written to hima a matter of fact i had offer him a job then he remind me of someth i had said to him at manchest respect that bogu telegram which lure miss cowlei awai i ask him if anyth untoward had occur he said it hadthat in a drawer in mr hersheimm s room he had discov a photograph the lawyer paus then continu i ask him if the photograph bore the name and address of a californian photograph he repli you re on to it sir it had then he went on to tell me someth i didn t know the origin of that photograph wa the french girl annett who save hi life what exactli i ask the young man with some curios what he had done with the photograph he repli that he had put it back where he found it the lawyer paus again that wa good you knowdistinctli good he can us hi brain that young fellow i congratul him the discoveri wa a providenti on of cours from the moment that the girl in manchest wa prove to be a plant everyth wa alter young beresford saw that for himself without my have to tell it him but he felt he couldn t trust hi judgment on the subject of miss cowlei did i think she wa aliv i told him duli weigh the evid that there wa a veri decid chanc in favour of it that brought us back to the telegram ye i advis him to appli to you for a copi of the origin wire it had occur to me as probabl that after miss cowlei flung it on the floor certain word might have been eras and alter with the express intent of set searcher on a fals trail carter nod he took a sheet from hi pocket and read aloud come at onc astlei prior gatehous kent great developmentstommi veri simpl said sir jame and veri ingeni just a few word to alter and the thing wa done and the on import clue thei overlook what wa that the pageboi s statement that miss cowlei drove to chare cross thei were so sure of themselv that thei took it for grant he had made a mistak then young beresford is now at gatehous kent unless i am much mistaken mr carter look at him curious i rather wonder you re not there too peel edgerton ah i m busi on a case i thought you were on your holidai oh i ve not been brief perhap it would be more correct to sai i m prepar a case ani more fact about that american chap for me i m afraid not is it import to find out who he wa oh i know who he wa said sir jame easili i can t prove it yetbut i know the other two ask no question thei had an instinct that it would be mere wast of breath but what i don t understand said the primeminist suddenli is how that photograph

with on accord tommi wa call upon for a full and complet explan you ve been too darn close about the whole busi juliu accus him you let on to me that you were off to the argentinethough i guess you had your reason for that the idea of both you and tuppenc cast me for the part of mr brown just tickl me to death the idea wa not origin to them said mr carter grave it wa suggest and the poison veri carefulli instil by a pastmast in the art the paragraph in the new york paper suggest the plan to him and by mean of it he wove a web that nearli enmesh you fatal i never like him said juliu i felt from the first that there wa someth wrong about him and i alwai suspect that it wa he who silenc mr vandemey so apposit but it wasn t till i heard that the order for tommi s execut came right on the heel of our interview with him that sundai that i began to tumbl to the fact that he wa the big bug himself i never suspect it at all lament tuppenc i ve alwai thought i wa so much clever than tommybut he s undoubtedli score over me handsom juliu agre tommi s been the good thi trip and instead of sit there as dumb as a fish let him banish hi blush and tell us all about it hear hear there s noth to tell said tommi acut uncomfort i wa an aw mugright up to the time i found that photograph of annett and realiz that she wa jane finn then i rememb how persist she had shout out that word marguerit and i thought of the pictur andwel that s that then of cours i went over the whole thing to see where i d made an ass of myself go on said mr carter as tommi show sign of take refug in silenc onc more that busi about mr vandemey had worri me when juliu told me about it on the face of it it seem that he or sir jame must have done the trick but i didn t know which find that photograph in the drawer after that stori of how it had been got from him by inspector brown made me suspect juliu then i rememb that it wa sir jame who had discov the fals jane finn in the end i couldn t make up my mindand just decid to take no chanc either wai i left a note for juliu in case he wa mr brown sai i wa off to the argentin and i drop sir jame s letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it wa a genuin stunt then i wrote my letter to mr carter and rang up sir jame take him into my confid would be the best thing either wai so i told him everyth except where i believ the paper to be hidden the wai he help me to get on the track of tuppenc and annett almost disarm me but not quit i kept my mind open between the two of them and then i got a bogu note from tuppenceand i knew but how tommi took the note in question from hi pocket and pass it round the tabl it s her handwrit all right but i knew it wasn t from her becaus of the signatur she d never spell her name twopenc but anyon who d never seen it written might quit easili do so juliu had seen ith show me a note of her to him oncebut sir jame hadn t after that everyth wa plain sail i sent off albert posthast to mr carter i pretend to go awai but doubl back again when juliu came burst up in hi car i felt it wasn t part of mr brown s planand that there would probabl be troubl unless sir jame wa actual caught in the act so to speak i knew mr carter would never believ it of him on my bare word i didn t interpos mr carter ruefulli that s why i sent the girl off to sir jame i wa sure thei d fetch up at the hous in soho sooner or later i threaten juliu with the revolv becaus i want tuppenc to repeat that to sir jame so that he wouldn t worri about us the moment the girl were out of sight
