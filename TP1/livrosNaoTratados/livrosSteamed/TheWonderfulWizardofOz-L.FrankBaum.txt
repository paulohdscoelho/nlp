our home ar we peopl of flesh and blood would rather live there than in ani other countri be it ever so beauti there is no place like home the scarecrow sigh of cours i cannot understand it he said if

while we ar rest ask the child the scarecrow look at her reproachfulli and answer my life ha been so short that i realli know noth whatev i wa onli made dai befor yesterdai what happen in the world befor that time is all unknown to me luckili when the farmer made my head on of the first thing he did wa to paint my ear so that i heard what wa go on there wa anoth munchkin with him and the first thing i heard wa the farmer sai how do you like those ear thei arent straight answer the other never mind said the farmer thei ar ear just the same which wa true enough now ill make the ey said the farmer so he paint my right ey and as soon as it wa finish i found myself look at him and at everyth around me with a great deal of curios for thi wa my first glimps of the world that a rather pretti ey remark the munchkin who wa watch the farmer blue paint is just the color for ey i think ill make the other a littl bigger said the farmer and when the second ey wa done i could see much better than befor then he made my nose and my mouth but i did not speak becaus at that time i didnt know what a mouth wa for i had the fun of watch them make my bodi and my arm and leg and when thei fasten on my head at last i felt veri proud for i thought i wa just as good a man as anyon thi fellow will scare the crow fast enough said the farmer he look just like a man why he is a man said the other and i quit agre with him the farmer carri me under hi arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick where you found me he and hi friend soon after walk awai and left me alon i did not like to be desert thi wai so i tri to walk after them but my feet would not touch the ground and i wa forc to stai on that pole it wa a lone life to lead for i had noth to think of have been made such a littl while befor mani crow and other bird flew into the cornfield but as soon as thei saw me thei flew awai again think i wa a munchkin and thi pleas me and made me feel that i wa quit an import person by and by an old crow flew near me and after look at me carefulli he perch upon my shoulder and said i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in thi clumsi manner ani crow of sens could see that you ar onli stuf with straw then he hop down at my feet and at all the corn he want the other bird see he wa not harm by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there wa a great flock of them about me i felt sad at thi for it show i wa not such a good scarecrow after all but the old crow comfort me sai if you onli had brain in your head you would be as good a man as ani of them and a better man than some of them brain ar the onli thing worth have in thi world no matter whether on is a crow or a man after the crow had gone i thought thi over and decid i would try hard to get some brain by good luck you came along and pull me off the stake and from what you sai i am sure the great oz will give me brain as soon as we get to the emerald citi i hope so said dorothi earnestli sinc you seem anxiou to have them oh ye i am anxiou return the scarecrow it is such an uncomfort feel to know on is a fool well said the girl let us go and she hand the basket to the scarecrow there were no fenc at all by the roadsid now and the land wa rough and until toward even thei came to a great forest where the tree grew so big and close togeth that their branch met over the road of yellow brick it wa almost dark under the tree for the branch shut out the daylight but the travel did not stop and went on into the forest if thi road goe in it must come out said the scarecrow and as the emerald citi is at the other end of the road we must go wherev it lead us anyon would know that said dorothi certainli that is why i know it return the scarecrow if it requir brain to figur it out i never should have said it after an hour or so the light fade awai and thei found themselv stumbl along in the dark dorothi could not see at all but toto could for some dog see veri well in the dark and the

it is veri uncomfort walk in the dark soon after the scarecrow stop i see a littl cottag at the right of us he said built of log and branch shall we go there ye inde answer the child i am all tire out

ad that she would be pleas to have hi compani so the tin woodman shoulder hi ax and thei all pass through the forest until thei came to the road that wa pave with yellow brick the tin woodman had ask dorothi to put the oilcan in her basket for he said if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oilcan badli it wa a bit of good luck to have their new comrad join the parti for soon after thei had begun their journei again thei came to a place where the tree and branch grew so thick over the road that the travel could not pass but the tin woodman set to work with hi ax and chop so well that soon he clear a passag for the entir parti dorothi wa think so earnestli as thei walk along that she did not notic when the scarecrow stumbl into a hole and roll over to the side of the road inde he wa oblig to call to her to help him up again why didnt you walk around the hole ask the tin woodman i dont know enough repli the scarecrow cheerfulli my head is stuf with straw you

empti answer the woodman but onc i had brain and a heart also so have tri them both i should much rather have a heart and why is that ask the scarecrow i will tell you my stori and then you will know so while thei were walk through the forest the tin woodman told the follow stori i wa born the son of a woodman who chop down tree in the forest and sold the wood for a live when i grew up i too becam a woodchopp and after my father di i took care of my old mother as long as she live then i made up my mind that instead of live alon i would marri so that i might not becom lone there wa on of the munchkin girl who wa so beauti that i soon grew to love her with all my heart she on her part promis to marri me as soon as i could earn enough monei to build a better hous for her so i set to work harder than ever but the girl live with an old woman who did not want her to marri anyon for she wa so lazi she wish the girl to remain with her and do the cook and the housework so the old woman went to the wick witch of the east and promis her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriag thereupon the wick witch enchant my ax and when i wa chop awai at my best on dai for i wa anxiou to get the new hous and my wife as soon as possibl the ax slip all at onc and cut off my left leg thi at first seem a great misfortun for i knew a oneleg man could not do veri well as a woodchopp so i went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin the leg work veri well onc i wa us to it but my action anger the wick witch of the east for she had promis the old woman i should not marri the pretti munchkin girl when i began chop again my ax slip and cut off my right leg again i went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out of tin after thi the enchant ax cut off my arm on after the other but noth daunt i had them replac with tin on the wick witch then made the ax slip and cut off my head and at first i thought that wa the end of me but the tinsmith happen to come along and he made me a new head out of tin i thought i had beaten the wick witch then and i work harder than ever but i littl knew how cruel my enemi could be she thought of a new wai to kill my love for the beauti munchkin maiden and made my ax slip again so that it cut right through my bodi split me into two halv onc more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a bodi of tin fasten my tin arm and leg and head to it by mean of joint so that i could move around as well as ever but ala i had now no heart so that i lost all my love for the munchkin girl and did not care whether i marri her or not i suppos she is still live with the old woman wait for me to come after her my bodi shone so brightli in the sun that i felt veri proud of it and it did not matter now if my ax slip for it could not cut me there wa onli on dangerthat my joint would rust but i kept an oilcan in my cottag and took care to oil myself whenev i need it howev there came a dai when i forgot to do thi and be caught in a rainstorm befor i thought of the danger my joint had rust and i wa left to stand in the wood until you came to help me it wa a terribl thing to undergo but dure the year i stood there i had time to think that the greatest loss i had known wa the loss of my heart while i wa in love i wa the happiest man on earth but no on can love who ha not a heart and so i am resolv to ask oz to give me on if he doe i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marri her both dorothi and the scarecrow had been greatli interest in the stori of the tin woodman and now thei knew why he wa so anxiou to get a new heart all the same said the scarecrow i shall ask for brain instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had on i shall take the heart return the tin woodman for brain do not make on happi and happi is the best thing in the world dorothi did not sai anyth for she wa puzzl to know which of her two friend wa right and she decid if she could onli get back to kansa and aunt em it did not matter so much whether the woodman had no brain and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he want what worri her most wa that the bread wa nearli gone and anoth meal for herself and toto would empti the basket to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever at anyth but she wa not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she wa fed the cowardli lion all thi time dorothi and her companion had been walk through the thick wood the road wa still pave with yellow brick but these were much cover by dri branch and dead leav from the tree and the walk wa not at all good there were few bird in thi part of the forest for bird love the open countri where there is plenti of sunshin but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild anim hidden among the tree these sound made the littl girl heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walk close to dorothi side and did not even bark in return how long will it be the child ask of the tin woodman befor we ar out of the forest i cannot tell wa the answer for i have never been to the emerald citi but my father went there onc when i wa a boi and he said it wa a long journei through a danger countri although nearer to the citi where oz dwell the countri is beauti but i am not afraid so long as i have my oilcan and noth can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witch kiss and that will protect you from harm but toto said the girl anxious what will protect him we must protect him ourselv if he is in danger repli the tin woodman just as he spoke there came from the forest a terribl roar and the next moment a great lion bound into the road with on blow of hi paw he sent the scarecrow spin over and over to the edg of the road and then he struck at the tin woodman with hi sharp claw but to the lion surpris he could make no impress on the tin although the woodman fell over in the road and lai still littl toto now that he had an enemi to face ran bark toward the lion and the great beast had open hi mouth to bite the dog when dorothi fear toto would be kill and heedless of danger rush forward and slap the lion upon hi nose as hard as she could while she cri out dont you dare to bite toto you ought to be asham of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor littl dog i didnt bite him said the lion as he rub hi nose with hi paw where dorothi had hit it no but you tri to she retort you ar noth but a big coward i know it said the lion hang hi head in shame iv alwai known it but how can i help it i dont know im sure to think of your strike a stuf man like the poor scarecrow is he stuf ask the lion in surpris as he watch her pick up the scarecrow and set him upon hi feet while she pat him into shape again of cours he stuf repli dorothi who wa still angri that why he went over so easili remark the lion it astonish me to see him whirl around so is the other on stuf also no said dorothi he made of tin and she help the woodman up again that why he nearli blunt my claw said the lion when thei scratch against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back what is that littl anim you ar so tender of he is my dog toto answer dorothi is he made of tin or stuf ask the lion neither he aaa meat dog said the girl oh he a curiou anim and seem remark small now that i look at him no on would think of bite such a littl thing except a coward like me continu the lion sadli what make you a coward ask dorothi look at the great beast in wonder for he wa as big as a small hors it a mysteri repli the lion i suppos i wa born that wai all the other anim in the forest natur expect me to be brave for the lion is everywher thought to be the king of beast i learn that if i roar veri loudli everi live thing wa frighten and got out of my wai whenev iv met a man iv been awfulli scare but i just roar at him and he ha alwai run awai as fast as he could go if the eleph and the tiger and the bear had ever tri to fight me i should have run myselfim such a coward but just as soon as thei hear me roar thei all try to get awai from me and of cours i let them go but that isnt right the king of beast shouldnt be a coward said the scarecrow i know it return the lion wipe a tear from hi ey with the tip of hi tail it is my great sorrow and make my life veri unhappi but whenev there is danger my heart begin to beat fast perhap you have heart diseas said the tin woodman it mai be said the lion if you have continu the tin woodman you ought to be glad for it prove you have a heart for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart diseas perhap said the lion thoughtfulli if i had no heart i should not be a coward have you brain ask the scarecrow i suppos so iv never look to see repli the lion i am go to the great oz to ask him to give me some remark the scarecrow for my head is stuf with straw and i am go to ask him to give me a heart said the woodman and i am go to ask him to send toto and me back to kansa ad dorothi do you think oz could give me courag ask the cowardli lion just as easili as he could give me brain said the scarecrow or give me a heart said the tin woodman or send me back to kansa said dorothi then if you dont mind ill go with you said the lion for my life is simpli unbear without a bit of courag you will be veri welcom answer dorothi for you will help to keep awai the other wild beast it seem to me thei must be more cowardli than you ar if thei allow you to scare them so easili thei realli ar said the lion but that doesnt make me ani braver and as long as i know myself to be a coward i shall be unhappi so onc more the littl compani set off upon the journei the lion walk with state stride at dorothi side toto did not approv of thi new comrad at first for he could not forget how nearli he had been crush between the lion great jaw but after a time he becam more at eas and present toto and the cowardli lion had grown to be good friend dure the rest of that dai there wa no other adventur to mar the peac of their journei onc inde the tin woodman step upon a beetl that wa crawl along the road and kill the poor littl thing thi made the tin woodman veri unhappi for he wa alwai care not to hurt ani live creatur and as he walk along he wept sever tear of sorrow and regret these tear ran slowli down hi face and over the hing of hi jaw and there thei rust when dorothi present ask him a question the tin woodman could not open hi mouth for hi jaw were tightli rust togeth he becam greatli frighten at thi and made mani motion to dorothi to reliev him but she could not understand the lion wa also puzzl to know what wa wrong but the scarecrow seiz the oilcan from dorothi basket and oil the woodman jaw so that after a few moment he could talk as well as befor thi will serv me a lesson said he to look where i step for if i should kill anoth bug or beetl i should sure cry again and cry rust my jaw so that i cannot speak thereaft he walk veri carefulli with hi ey on the road and when he saw a tini ant toil by he would step over it so as not to harm it the tin woodman knew veri well he had no heart and therefor he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anyth you peopl with heart he said have someth to guid you and need never do wrong but i have no heart and so i must be veri care when oz give me a heart of cours i neednt mind so much the journei to the great oz thei were oblig to camp out that night under a larg tree in the forest for there were no hous near the tree made a good thick cover to protect them from the dew and the tin woodman chop a great pile of wood with hi ax and dorothi built a splendid fire that warm her and made her feel less lone she and toto at the last of their bread and now she did not know what thei would do for breakfast if you wish said the lion i will go into the forest and kill a deer for you you can roast it by the fire sinc your tast ar so peculiar that you prefer cook food and then you will have a veri good breakfast dont pleas dont beg the tin woodman i should certainli weep if you kill a poor deer and then my jaw would rust again but the lion went awai into the forest and found hi own supper and no on ever knew what it wa for he didnt mention it and the scarecrow found a tree full of nut and fill dorothi basket with them so that she would not be hungri for a long time she thought thi wa veri kind and thought of the scarecrow but she laugh heartili at the awkward wai in which the poor creatur pick up the nut hi pad hand were so clumsi and the nut were so small that he drop almost as mani as he put in the basket but the scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabl him to keep awai from the fire as he fear a spark might get into hi straw and burn him up so he kept a good distanc awai from the flame and onli came near to cover dorothi with dry leav when she lai down to sleep these kept her veri snug and warm and she slept soundli until morn when it wa daylight the girl bath her face in a littl rippl brook and soon after thei all start toward the emerald citi thi wa to be an event dai for the travel thei had hardli been walk an hour when thei saw befor them a great ditch that cross the road and divid the forest as far as thei could see on either side it wa a veri wide ditch and when thei crept up to the edg and look into it thei could see it wa also veri deep and there were mani big jag rock at the bottom the side were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seem that their journei must end what shall we do ask dorothi despairingli i havent the faintest idea said the tin woodman and the lion shook hi shaggi mane and look thought but the scarecrow said we cannot fly that is certain neither can we climb down into thi great ditch therefor if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we ar i think i could jump over it said the cowardli lion after measur the distanc carefulli in hi mind then we ar all right answer the scarecrow for you can carri us all over on your back on at a time well ill try it said the lion who will go first i will declar the scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump over the gulf dorothi would be kill or the tin woodman badli dent on the rock below but if i am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me at all i am terribl afraid of fall myself said the cowardli lion but i suppos there is noth to do but try it so get on my back and we will make the attempt the scarecrow sat upon the lion back and the big beast walk to the edg of the gulf and crouch down why dont you run and jump ask the scarecrow becaus that isnt the wai we lion do these thing he repli then give a great spring he shot through the air and land safe on the other side thei were all greatli pleas to see how easili he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from hi back the lion sprang across the ditch again dorothi thought she would go next so she took toto in her arm and climb on the lion back hold tightli to hi mane with on hand the next moment it seem as if she were fly through the air and then befor she had time to think about it she wa safe on the other side the lion went back a third time and got the tin woodman and then thei all sat down for a few moment to give the beast a chanc to rest for hi great leap had made hi breath short and he pant like a big dog that ha been run too long thei found the forest veri thick on thi side and it look dark and gloomi after the lion had rest thei start along the road of yellow brick silent wonder each in hi own mind if ever thei would come to the end of the wood and reach the bright sunshin again to add to their discomfort thei soon heard strang nois in the depth of the forest and the lion whisper to them that it wa in thi part of the countri that the kalidah live what ar the kalidah ask the girl thei ar monstrou beast with bodi like bear and head like tiger repli the lion and with claw so long and sharp that thei could tear me in two as easili as i could kill toto im terribl afraid of the kalidah im not surpris that you ar return dorothi thei must be dread beast the lion wa about to repli when suddenli thei came to anoth gulf across the road but thi on wa so broad and deep that the lion knew at onc he could not leap across it so thei sat down to consid what thei should do and after seriou thought the scarecrow said here is a great tree stand close to the ditch if the tin woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easili that is a firstrat idea said the lion on would almost suspect you had brain in your head instead of straw the woodman set to work at onc and so sharp wa hi ax that the tree wa soon chop nearli through then the lion put hi strong front leg against the tree and push with all hi might and slowli the big tree tip and fell with a crash across the ditch with it top branch on the other side thei had just start to cross thi queer bridg when a sharp growl made them all look up and to their horror thei saw run toward them two great beast with bodi like bear and head like tiger thei ar the kalidah said the cowardli lion begin to trembl quick cri the scarecrow let us cross over so dorothi went first hold toto in her arm the tin woodman follow and the scarecrow came next the lion although he wa certainli afraid turn to face the kalidah and then he gave so loud and terribl a roar that dorothi scream and the scarecrow fell over backward while even the fierc beast stop short and look at him in surpris but see thei were bigger than the lion and rememb that there were two of them and onli on of him the kalidah again rush forward and the lion cross over the tree and turn to see what thei would do next without stop an instant the fierc beast also began to cross the tree and the lion said to dorothi we ar lost for thei will sure tear us to piec with their sharp claw but stand close behind me and i will fight them as long as i am aliv wait a minut call the scarecrow he had been think what wa best to be done and now he ask the woodman to chop awai the end of the tree that rest on their side of the ditch the tin woodman began to us hi ax at onc and just as the two kalidah were nearli across the tree fell with a crash into the gulf carri the ugli snarl brute with it and both were dash to piec on the sharp rock at the bottom well said the cowardli lion draw a long breath of relief i see we ar go to live a littl while longer and i am glad of it for it must be a veri uncomfort thing not to be aliv those creatur frighten me so badli that my heart is beat yet ah said the tin woodman sadli i wish i had a heart to beat thi adventur made the travel more anxiou than ever to get out of the forest and thei walk so fast that dorothi becam tire and had to ride on the lion back to their great joi the tree becam thinner the farther thei advanc and in the afternoon thei suddenli came upon a broad river flow swiftli just befor them on the other side of the water thei could see the road of yellow brick run through a beauti countri with green meadow dot with bright flower and all the road border with tree hang full of delici fruit thei were greatli pleas to see thi delight countri befor them how shall we cross the river ask dorothi that is easili done repli the scarecrow the tin woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side so the woodman took hi ax and began to chop down small tree to make a raft and while he wa busi at thi the scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit thi pleas dorothi who had eaten noth but nut all dai and she made a hearti meal of the ripe fruit but it take time to make a raft even when on is as industri and untir as the tin woodman and when night came the work wa not done so thei found a cozi place under the tree where thei slept well until the morn and dorothi dream of the emerald citi and of the good wizard oz who would soon send her back to her own home again the deadli poppi field our littl parti of travel awaken the next morn refresh and full of hope and dorothi breakfast like a princess off peach and plum from the tree besid the river behind them wa the dark forest thei had pass safe through although thei had suffer mani discourag but befor them wa a love sunni countri that seem to beckon them on to the emerald citi to be sure the broad river now cut them off from thi beauti land but the raft wa nearli done and after the tin woodman had cut a few more log and fasten them togeth with wooden pin thei were readi to start dorothi sat down in the middl of the raft and held toto in her arm when the cowardli lion step upon the raft it tip badli for he wa big and heavi but the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood upon the other end to steadi it and thei had long pole in their hand to push the raft through the water thei got along quit well at first but when thei reach the middl of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther awai from the road of yellow brick and the water grew so deep that the long pole would not touch the bottom thi is bad said the tin woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carri into the countri of the wick witch of the west and she will enchant us and make us her slave and then i should get no brain said the scarecrow and i should get no courag said the cowardli lion and i should get no heart said the tin woodman and i should never get back to kansa said dorothi we must certainli get to the emerald citi if we can the scarecrow continu and he push so hard on hi long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river then befor he could pull it out againor let goth raft wa swept awai and the poor scarecrow wa left cling to the pole in the middl of the river goodby he call after them and thei were veri sorri to leav him inde the tin woodman began to cry but fortun rememb that he might rust and so dri hi tear on dorothi apron of cours thi wa a bad thing for the scarecrow i am now wors off than when i first met dorothi he thought then i wa stuck on a pole in a cornfield where i could makebeliev scare the crow at ani rate but sure there is no us for a scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middl of a river i am afraid i shall never have ani brain after all down the stream the raft float and the poor scarecrow wa left far behind then the lion said someth must be done to save us i think i can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will onli hold fast to the tip of my tail so he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of hi tail then the lion began to swim with all hi might toward the shore it wa hard work although he wa so big but by and by thei were drawn out of the current and then dorothi took the tin woodman long pole and help push the raft to the land thei were all tire out when thei reach the shore at last and step off upon the pretti green grass and thei also knew that the stream had carri them a long wai past the road of yellow brick that led to the emerald citi what shall we do now ask the tin woodman as the lion lai down on the grass to let the sun dry him we must get back to the road in some wai said dorothi the best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remark the lion so when thei were rest dorothi pick up her basket and thei start along the grassi bank to the road from which the river had carri them it wa a love countri with plenti of flower and fruit tree and sunshin to cheer them and had thei not felt so sorri for the poor scarecrow thei could have been veri happi thei walk along as fast as thei could dorothi onli stop onc to pick a beauti flower and after a time the tin woodman cri out look then thei all look at the river and saw the scarecrow perch upon hi pole in the middl of the water look veri lone and sad what can we do to save him ask dorothi the lion and the woodman both shook their head for thei did not know so thei sat down upon the bank and gaze wistfulli at the scarecrow until a stork flew by who upon see them stop to rest at the water edg who ar you and where ar you go ask the stork i am dorothi answer the girl and these ar my friend the tin woodman and the cowardli lion and we ar go to the emerald citi thi isnt the road said the stork as she twist her long neck and look sharpli at the queer parti i know it return dorothi but we have lost the scarecrow and ar wonder how we shall get him again where is he ask the stork over there in the river answer the littl girl if he wasnt so big and heavi i would get him for you remark the stork he isnt heavi a bit said dorothi eagerli for he is stuf with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much well ill try said the stork but if i find he is too heavi to carri i shall have to drop him in the river again so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the scarecrow wa perch upon hi pole then the stork with her great claw grab the scarecrow by the arm and carri him up into the air and back to the bank where dorothi and the lion and the tin woodman and toto were sit when the scarecrow found himself among hi friend again he wa so happi that he hug them all even the lion and toto and as thei walk along he sang tolderideoh at everi step he felt so gai i wa afraid i should have to stai in the river forev he said but the kind stork save me and if i ever get ani brain i shall find the stork again and do her some kind in return that all right said the stork who wa fly along besid them i alwai like to help anyon in troubl but i must go now for my babi ar wait in the nest for me i hope you will find the emerald citi and that oz will help you thank you repli dorothi and then the kind stork flew into the air and wa soon out of sight thei walk along listen to the sing of the brightli color bird and look at the love flower which now becam so thick that the ground wa carpet with them there were big yellow and white and blue and purpl blossom besid great cluster of scarlet poppi which were so brilliant in color thei almost dazzl dorothi ey arent thei beauti the girl ask as she breath in the spici scent of the bright flower i suppos so answer the scarecrow when i have brain i shall probabl like them better if i onli had a heart i should love them ad the tin woodman i alwai did like flower said the lion thei seem so helpless and frail but there ar none in the forest so bright as these thei now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppi and fewer and fewer of the other flower and soon thei found themselv in the midst of a great meadow of poppi now it is well known that when there ar mani of these flower togeth their odor is so power that anyon who breath it fall asleep and if the sleeper is not carri awai from the scent of the flower he sleep on and on forev but dorothi did not know thi nor could she get awai from the bright red flower that were everywher about so present her ey grew heavi and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep but the tin woodman would not let her do thi we must hurri and get back to the road of yellow brick befor dark he said and the scarecrow agre with him so thei kept walk until dorothi could stand no longer her ey close in spite of herself and she forgot where she wa and fell among the poppi fast asleep what shall we do ask the tin woodman if we leav her here she will die said the lion the smell of the flower is kill us all i myself can scarc keep my ey open and the dog is asleep alreadi it wa true toto had fallen down besid hi littl mistress but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not be made of flesh were not troubl by the scent of the flower run fast said the scarecrow to the lion and get out of thi deadli flower bed as soon as you can we will bring the littl girl with us but if you should fall asleep you ar too big to

he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask and if he is the love ladi i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bid and if he is the great head he will be at my merci for i will roll thi head all about the room until he promis to give us what we desir so be of good cheer my friend for all will yet be well the next

forthwith there wa heard a great buzz in the air and a swarm of black bee came fly toward her go to the stranger and sting them to death command the witch and the bee turn and flew rapidli until thei came to where dorothi and her friend were walk but the woodman had seen them come and the scarecrow had decid what to do take out my straw and scatter it over the littl girl and the dog and the lion he said to the woodman and the bee cannot sting them thi the woodman did and as dorothi lai close besid the lion and held toto in her arm the straw cover them entir the bee came and found no on but the woodman to sting so thei flew at him and broke off all their sting against the tin without hurt the woodman at all and as bee cannot live when their sting ar broken that wa the end of the black bee and thei lai scatter thick about the woodman like littl heap of fine coal then dorothi and the lion got up and the girl help the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he wa as good as ever so thei start upon their journei onc more the wick witch wa so angri when she saw her black bee in littl heap like fine coal that she stamp her foot and tore her hair and gnash her teeth and then she call a dozen of her slave who were the winki and gave them sharp spear tell them to go to the stranger and destroi them the winki were not a brave peopl but thei had to do as thei were told so thei march awai until thei came near to dorothi then the lion gave a great roar and sprang toward them and the poor winki were so frighten that thei ran back as fast as thei could when thei return to the castl the wick witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she sat down to think what she should do next she could not understand how all her plan to destroi these stranger had fail but she wa a power witch as well as a wick on and she soon made up her mind how to act there wa in her cupboard a golden cap with a circl of diamond and rubi run round it thi golden cap had a charm whoever own it could call three time upon the wing monkei who would obei ani order thei were given but no person could command these strang creatur more than three time twice alreadi the wick witch had us the charm of the cap onc wa when she had made the winki her slave and set herself to rule over their countri the wing monkei had help her do thi the second time wa when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west the wing monkei had also help her in do thi onli onc more could she us thi golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other power were exhaust but now that her fierc wolv and her wild crow and her sting bee were gone and her slave had been scare awai by the cowardli lion she saw there wa onli on wai left to destroi dorothi and her friend so the wick witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and place it upon her head then she stood upon her left foot and said slowli epp pepp kakk next she stood upon her right foot and said hillo hollo hello after thi she stood upon both feet and cri in a loud voic zizzi zuzzi zik now the charm began to work the sky wa darken and a low rumbl sound wa heard in the air there wa a rush of mani wing a great chatter and laugh and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the wick witch surround by a crowd of monkei each with a pair of immens and power wing on hi shoulder on much bigger than the other seem to be their leader he flew close to the witch and said you have call us for the third and last time what do you command go to the stranger who ar within my land and destroi them all except the lion said the wick witch bring that beast to me for i have a mind to har him like a hors and make him work your command shall be obei said the leader then with a great deal of chatter and nois the wing monkei flew awai to the place where dorothi and her friend were walk some of the monkei seiz the tin woodman and carri him through the air until thei were over a countri thickli cover with sharp rock here thei drop the poor woodman who fell a great distanc to the rock where he lai so batter and dent that he could neither move nor groan other of the monkei caught the scarecrow and with their long finger pull all of the straw out of hi cloth and head thei made hi hat and boot and cloth into a small bundl and threw it into the top branch of a tall tree the remain monkei threw piec of stout rope around the lion and wound mani coil about hi bodi and head and leg until he wa unabl to bite or scratch or struggl in ani wai then thei lift him up and flew awai with him to the witch castl where he wa place in a small yard with a high iron fenc around it so that he could not escap but dorothi thei did not harm at all she stood with toto in her arm watch the sad fate of her comrad and think it would soon be her turn the leader of the wing monkei flew up to her hi long hairi arm stretch out and hi ugli face grin terribl but he saw the mark of the good witch kiss upon her forehead and stop short motion the other not to touch her we dare not harm thi littl girl he said to them for she is protect by the power of good and that is greater than the power of evil all we can do is to carri her to the castl of the wick witch and leav her there so carefulli and gentli thei lift dorothi in their arm and carri her swiftli through the air until thei came to the castl where thei set her down upon the front doorstep then the leader said to the witch we have obei you as far as we were abl the tin woodman and the scarecrow ar destroi and the lion is ti up in your yard the littl girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carri in her arm your power over our band is now end and you will never see us again then all the wing monkei with much laugh and chatter and nois flew into the air and were soon out of sight the wick witch wa both surpris and worri when she saw the mark on dorothi forehead for she knew well that neither the wing monkei nor she herself dare hurt the girl in ani wai she look down at dorothi feet and see the silver shoe began to trembl with fear for she knew what a power charm belong to them at first the witch wa tempt to run awai from dorothi but she happen to look into the child ey and saw how simpl the soul behind them wa and that the littl girl did not know of the wonder power the silver shoe gave her so the wick witch laugh to herself and thought i can still make her my slave for she doe not know how to us her power then she said to dorothi harshli and sever come with me and see that you mind everyth i tell you for if you do not i will make an end of you as i did of the tin woodman and the scarecrow dorothi follow her through mani of the beauti room in her castl until thei came to the kitchen where the witch bade her clean the pot and kettl and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood dorothi went to work meekli with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she wa glad the wick witch had decid not to kill her with dorothi hard at work the witch thought she would go into the courtyard and har the cowardli lion like a hors it would amus her she wa sure to make him draw her chariot whenev she wish to go to drive but as she open the gate the lion gave a loud roar and bound at her so fierc that the witch wa afraid and ran out and shut the gate again if i cannot har you said the witch to the lion speak through the bar of the gate i can starv you you shall have noth to eat until you do as i wish so after that she took no food to the imprison lion but everi dai she came to the gate at noon and ask ar you readi to be har like a hors and the lion would answer no if you come in thi yard i will bite you the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wish wa that everi night while the woman wa asleep dorothi carri him food from the cupboard after he had eaten he would lie down on hi bed of straw and dorothi would lie besid him and put her head on hi soft shaggi mane while thei talk of their troubl and tri to plan some wai to escap but thei could find no wai to get out of the castl for it wa constantli guard by the yellow winki who were the slave of the wick witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them the girl had to work hard dure the dai and often the witch threaten to beat her with the same old umbrella she alwai carri in her hand but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothi becaus of the mark upon her forehead the child did not know thi and wa full of fear for herself and toto onc the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave littl dog flew at her and bit her leg in return the witch did not bleed where she wa bitten for she wa so wick that the blood in her had dri up mani year befor dorothi life becam veri sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansa and aunt em again sometim she would cry bitterli for hour with toto sit at her feet and look into her face whine dismal to show how sorri he wa for hi littl mistress toto did not realli care whether he wa in kansa or the land of oz so long as dorothi wa with him but he knew the littl girl wa unhappi and that made him unhappi too now the wick witch had a great long to have for her own the silver shoe which the girl alwai wore her bee and her crow and her wolv were ly in heap and dry up and she had us up all the power of the golden cap but if she could onli get hold of the silver shoe thei would give her more power than all the other thing she had lost she watch dorothi carefulli to see if she ever took off her shoe think she might steal them but the child wa so proud of her pretti shoe that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath the witch wa too much afraid of the dark to dare go in dorothi room at night to take the shoe and her dread of water wa greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when dorothi wa bath inde the old witch never touch water nor ever let water touch her in ani wai but the wick creatur wa veri cun and she final thought of a trick that would give her what she want she place a bar of iron in the middl of the kitchen floor and then by her magic art made the iron invis to human ey so that when dorothi walk across the floor she stumbl over the bar not be abl to see it and fell at full length she wa not much hurt but in her fall on of the silver shoe came off and befor she could reach it the witch had snatch it awai and put it on her own skinni foot the wick woman wa greatli pleas with the success of her trick for as long as she had on of the shoe she own half the power of their charm and dorothi could not us it against her even had she known how to do so the littl girl see she had lost on of her pretti shoe grew angri and said to the witch give me back my shoe i will not retort the witch for it is now my shoe and not your you ar a wick creatur cri dorothi you have no right to take my shoe from me i shall keep it just the same said the witch laugh at her and somedai i shall get the other on from you too thi made dorothi so veri angri that she pick up the bucket of water that stood near and dash it over the witch wet her from head to foot instantli the wick woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as dorothi look at her in wonder the witch began to shrink and fall awai see what you have done she scream in a minut i shall melt awai im veri sorri inde said dorothi who wa truli frighten to see the witch actual melt awai like brown sugar befor her veri ey didnt you know water would be the end of me ask the witch in a wail despair voic of cours not answer dorothi how should i well in a few minut i shall be all melt and you will have the castl to yourself i have been wick in my dai but i never thought a littl girl like you would ever be abl to melt me and end my wick deed look outher i go with these word the witch fell down in a brown melt shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean board of the kitchen floor see that she had realli melt awai to noth dorothi drew anoth bucket of water and threw it over the mess she then swept it all out the door after pick out the silver shoe which wa all that wa left of the old woman she clean and dri it with a cloth and put it on her foot again then be at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wick witch of the west had come to an end and that thei were no longer prison in a strang land the rescu the cowardli lion wa much pleas to hear that the wick witch had been melt by a bucket of water and dorothi at onc unlock the gate of hi prison and set him free thei went in togeth to the castl where dorothi first act wa to call all the winki togeth and tell them that thei were no longer slave there wa great rejoic among the yellow winki for thei had been made to work hard dure mani year for the wick witch who had alwai treat them with great cruelti thei kept thi dai as a holidai then and ever after and spent the time in feast and danc if our friend the scarecrow and the tin woodman were onli with us said the lion i should be quit happi dont you suppos we could rescu them ask the girl anxious we can try answer the lion so thei call the yellow winki and ask them if thei would help to rescu their friend and the winki said that thei would be delight to do all in their power for dorothi who had set them free from bondag so she chose a number of the winki who look as if thei knew the most and thei all start awai thei travel that dai and part of the next until thei came to the rocki plain where the tin woodman lai all batter and bent hi ax wa near him but the blade wa rust and the handl broken off short the winki lift him tenderli in their arm and carri him back to the yellow castl again dorothi shed a few tear by the wai at the sad plight of her old friend and the lion look sober and sorri when thei reach the castl dorothi said to the winki ar ani of your peopl tinsmith oh ye some of us ar veri good tinsmith thei told her then bring them to me she said and when the tinsmith came bring with them all their tool in basket she inquir can you straighten out those dent in the tin woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him togeth where he is broken the tinsmith look the woodman over carefulli and then answer that thei thought thei could mend him so he would be as good as ever so thei set to work in on of the big yellow room of the castl and work for three dai and four night hammer and twist and bend and solder and polish and pound at the leg and bodi and head of the tin woodman until at last he wa straighten out into hi old form and hi joint work as well as ever to be sure there were sever patch on him but the tinsmith did a good job and as the woodman wa not a vain man he did not mind the patch at all when at last he walk into dorothi room and thank her for rescu him he wa so pleas that he wept tear of joi and dorothi had to wipe everi tear carefulli from hi face with her apron so hi joint would not be rust at the same time her own tear fell thick and fast at the joi of meet her old friend again and these tear did not need to be wipe awai as for the lion he wipe hi ey so often with the tip of hi tail that it becam quit wet and he wa oblig to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till

the winki to help her and thei walk all that dai and part of the next until thei came to the tall tree in the branch of which the wing monkei had toss the scarecrow cloth it wa a veri tall tree and the trunk wa so smooth that no on could climb it but the woodman said at onc ill chop it down and then we can get the scarecrow cloth now while the tinsmith had been at work mend the woodman himself anoth of the winki who wa a goldsmith had made an axehandl of solid gold and fit it to the woodman ax instead of the old broken handl other polish the blade until all the rust wa remov and it glisten like burnish silver as soon as he had spoken the tin woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the scarecrow cloth fell out of the branch and roll off on the ground dorothi pick them up and had the winki carri them back to the castl where thei were stuf with nice clean straw and behold here wa the scarecrow as good as ever thank them over and over again for save him now that thei were reunit dorothi and her friend spent a few happi dai at the yellow castl where thei found everyth thei need to make them comfort but on dai the girl thought of aunt em

mass of tower and steepl behind the green wall and high up abov everyth the spire and dome of the palac of oz oz wa not such a bad wizard after all said the tin woodman as he felt hi heart rattl around in hi breast he knew how to give me brain and veri good brain too said the scarecrow if oz had taken a dose of the same courag he gave me ad the lion he would have been a brave man dorothi said noth oz had not kept the promis he made her but he had done hi best so she forgav him as he said he wa a good man even if he wa a bad wizard the first dai journei wa through the green field and bright flower that stretch about the emerald citi on everi side thei slept that night on the grass with noth but the star over them and thei rest veri well inde in the morn thei travel on until thei came to a thick wood there wa no wai of go around it for it seem to extend to the right and left as far as thei could see and besid thei did not dare chang the direct of their journei for fear of get lost so thei look for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest the scarecrow who wa in the lead final discov a big tree with such widespread branch that there wa room for the parti to pass underneath so he walk forward to the tree but just as he came under the first branch thei bent down and twine around him and the next minut he wa rais from the ground and flung headlong among hi

promptli chop off the branch and set the littl dog free the other tree of the forest did noth to keep them back so thei made up their mind that onli the first row of tree could bend down their branch and that probabl these were the policemen of the forest and given thi wonder power in order to keep stranger out of it the four travel walk with eas through the tree until thei came to the farther edg of the wood then to their surpris thei found befor them a high wall which seem to be made of white china it wa smooth like the surfac of a dish and higher than their head what shall we do now ask dorothi i will make a ladder said the tin woodman for we certainli must climb over the wall the dainti china countri while the woodman wa make a ladder from wood which he found in the forest dorothi lai down and slept for she wa tire by the long walk the lion also curl himself up to sleep and toto lai besid him the scarecrow watch the woodman while he work and said to him i cannot think why thi wall is here nor what it is made of rest your brain and do not worri about the wall repli the woodman when we have climb over it we shall know what is on the other side after a time the ladder wa finish it look clumsi but the tin woodman wa sure it wa strong and would answer their purpos the scarecrow wake dorothi and the lion and toto and told them that the ladder wa readi the scarecrow climb up the ladder first but he wa so awkward that dorothi had to follow close behind and keep him from fall off when he got hi head over the top of the wall the scarecrow said oh my go on exclaim dorothi so the scarecrow climb farther up and sat down on the top of the wall and dorothi put her head over and cri oh my just as the scarecrow had done then toto came up and immedi began to bark but dorothi made him be still the lion climb the ladder next and the tin woodman came last but both of them cri oh my as soon as thei look over the wall when thei were all sit in a row on the top of the wall thei look down and saw a strang sight befor them wa a great stretch of countri have a floor as smooth and shine and white as the bottom of a big platter scatter around were mani hous made entir of china and paint in the brightest color these hous were quit small the biggest of them reach onli as high as dorothi waist there were also pretti littl barn with china fenc around them and mani cow and sheep

all these peopl were all made of china even to their cloth and were so small that the tallest of them wa no higher than dorothi knee no on did so much as look at the travel at first except on littl purpl china dog with an extralarg head which came to the wall and bark at them in a tini voic afterward run awai again how shall we get down ask dorothi thei found the ladder so heavi thei could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the other jump down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet of cours thei took pain not to light on hi head and get the pin in their feet when all were safe down thei pick up the scarecrow whose bodi wa quit flatten out and pat hi straw into shape again we must cross thi strang place in order to get to the other side said dorothi

head wa join to the pudgi bodi by a neck as slender as a wasp waist thi gave the lion a hint of the best wai to attack the creatur and as he knew it wa easier to fight it asleep than awak he gave a great spring and land directli upon the monster back then with on blow of hi heavi paw all arm with sharp claw he knock the spider head from it bodi jump down he watch it until the long leg stop wiggl when he knew it wa quit dead the lion went back to the open where the beast of the forest were wait for him and said proudli you need fear your enemi no longer then the beast bow down to the lion as

thei came out from it gloom saw befor them a steep hill cover from top to bottom with great piec of rock that will be a hard climb said the scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless so he led the wai and the other follow thei had nearli reach the first rock when thei heard a rough voic cry out keep back who ar you ask the scarecrow then a head show itself over the rock and the same voic said thi hill belong to us and we dont allow anyon to cross it but we must cross it said the scarecrow were go to the countri of the quadl but you shall not repli the voic and there step from behind the rock the strangest man the travel had ever seen he wa quit short and stout and had a big head which wa flat at the top and support by a thick neck full of wrinkl but he had no arm at all and see thi the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creatur could prevent them from climb the hill so he said im sorri not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walk boldli forward as quick as lightn the man head shot forward and hi neck stretch out until the top of the head where it wa flat struck the scarecrow in the middl and sent him tumbl over and over down the hill almost as quickli as it came the head went back to the bodi and the man laugh harshli as he said it isnt as easi as you think a choru of boister laughter came from the other rock and dorothi saw hundr of the armless hammerhead upon the hillsid on behind everi rock the lion becam quit angri at the laughter caus by the scarecrow mishap and give a loud roar that echo like thunder he dash up the hill again a head shot swiftli out and the great lion went roll down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball dorothi ran down and help the scarecrow to hi feet and the lion came up to her feel rather bruis and sore and said it is useless to fight peopl with shoot head no on can withstand them what can we do then she ask call the wing monkei suggest the tin
