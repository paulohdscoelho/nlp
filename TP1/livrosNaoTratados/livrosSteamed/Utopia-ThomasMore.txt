commonwealth henri viii the unconqu king of england a princ adorn with all the virtu that becom a great monarch have some differ of no small consequ with charl the most seren princ of castil sent me into flander as hi ambassador for treat and compos matter between them i wa colleagu and companion to that incompar man cuthbert tonstal whom the king with such univers applaus late made master of the roll but of whom i will sai noth not becaus i fear that the testimoni of a friend will be suspect but rather becaus hi learn and virtu ar too great for me to do them justic and so well known that thei need not my commend unless i would accord to the proverb show the sun with a lantern those that were appoint by the princ to treat with us met us at bruge accord to agreement thei were all worthi men the margrav of bruge wa their head and the chief man among them but he that wa esteem the wisest and that spoke for the rest wa georg tems the provost of casselse both art and natur had concur to make him eloqu he wa veri learn in the law and as he had a great capac so by a long practic in affair he wa veri dexter at unravel them after we had sever time met without come to an agreement thei went to brussel for some dai to know the princ pleasur and sinc our busi would admit it i went to antwerp while i wa there among mani that visit me there wa on that wa more accept to me than ani other peter gile born at antwerp who is a man of great honour and of a good rank in hi town though less than he deserv for i do not know if there be anywher to be found a more learn and a better bred young man for as he is both a veri worthi and a veri know person so he is so civil to all men so particularli kind to hi friend and so full of candour and affect that there is not perhap abov on or two anywher to be found that is in all respect so perfect a friend he is extraordinarili modest there is no artific in him and yet no man ha more of a prudent simplic hi convers wa so pleasant and so innoc cheer that hi compani in a great measur lessen ani long to go back to my countri and to my wife and children which an absenc of four month had quicken veri much on dai as i wa return home from mass at st mari which is the chief church and the most frequent of ani in antwerp i saw him by accid talk with a stranger who seem past the flower of hi ag hi face wa tan he had a long beard and hi cloak wa hang carelessli about him so that by hi look and habit i conclud he wa a seaman as soon as peter saw me he came and salut me and as i wa return hi civil he took me asid and point to him with whom he had been discours he said do you see that man i wa just think to bring him to you i answer he should have been veri welcom on your account and on hi own too repli he if you knew the man for there is none aliv that can give so copiou an account of unknown nation and countri as he can do which i know you veri much desir then said i i did not guess amiss for at first sight i took him for a seaman but you ar much mistaken said he for he ha not sail as a seaman but as a travel or rather a philosoph thi raphael who from hi famili carri the name of hythlodai is not ignor of the latin tongu but is emin learn in the greek have appli himself more particularli to that than to the former becaus he had given himself much to philosophi in which he knew that the roman have left us noth that is valuabl except what is to be found in seneca and cicero he is a portugues by birth and wa so desir of see the world that he divid hi estat among hi brother ran the same hazard as americu vesputiu and bore a share in three of hi four voyag that ar now publish onli he did not return with him in hi last but obtain leav of him almost by forc that he might be on of those twentyfour who were left at the farthest place at which thei touch in their last voyag to new castil the leav him thu did not a littl gratifi on that wa more fond of travel than of return home to be buri in hi own countri for he us often to sai that the wai to heaven wa the same from all place and he that had no grave had the heaven still over him yet thi disposit of mind had cost him dear if god had not been veri graciou to him for after he with five castalian had travel over mani countri at last by strang good fortun he got to ceylon and from thenc to calicut where he veri happili found some portugues ship and beyond all men expect return to hi nativ countri when peter had said thi to me i thank him for hi kind in intend to give me the acquaint of a man whose convers he knew would be so accept and upon that raphael and i embrac each other after those civil were past which ar usual with stranger upon their first meet we all went to my hous and enter into the garden sat down on a green bank and entertain on anoth in discours he told us that when vesputiu had sail awai he and hi companion that stai behind in new castil by degre insinu themselv into the affect of the peopl of the countri meet often with them and treat them gentli and at last thei not onli live among them without danger but convers familiarli with them and got so far into the heart of a princ whose name and countri i have forgot that he both furnish them plentifulli with all thing necessari and also with the conveni of travel both boat when thei went by water and waggon when thei travel over land he sent with them a veri faith guid who wa to introduc and recommend them to such other princ as thei had a mind to see and after mani dai journei thei came to town and citi and to commonwealth that were both happili govern and well peopl under the equat and as far on both side of it as the sun move there lai vast desert that were parch with the perpetu heat of the sun the soil wa wither all thing look dismal and all place were either quit uninhabit or abound with wild beast and serpent and some few men that were neither less wild nor less cruel than the beast themselv but as thei went farther a new scene open all thing grew milder the air less burn the soil more verdant and even the beast were less wild and at last there were nation town and citi that had not onli mutual commerc among themselv and with their neighbour but trade both by sea and land to veri remot countri there thei found the conveni of see mani countri on all hand for no ship went ani voyag into which he and hi companion were not veri welcom the first vessel that thei saw were flatbottom their sail were made of reed and wicker woven close togeth onli some were of leather but afterward thei found ship made with round keel and canva sail and in all respect like our ship and the seamen understood both astronomi and navig he got wonderfulli into their favour by show them the us of the needl of which till then thei were utterli ignor thei sail befor with great caution and onli in summer time but now thei count all season alik trust wholli to the loadston in which thei ar perhap more secur than safe so that there is reason to fear that thi discoveri which wa thought would prove so much to their advantag mai by their imprud becom an occas of much mischief to them but it were too long to dwell on all that he told us he had observ in everi place it would be too great a digress from our present purpos whatev is necessari to be told concern those wise and prudent institut which he observ among civilis nation mai perhap be relat by us on a more proper occas we ask him mani question concern all these thing to which he answer veri willingli we made no inquiri after monster than which noth is more common for everywher on mai hear of raven dog and wolv and cruel meneat but it is not so easi to find state that ar well and wise govern as he told us of mani thing that were amiss in those newdiscov countri so he reckon up not a few thing from which pattern might be taken for correct the error of these nation among whom we live of which an account mai be given as i have alreadi promis at some other time for at present i intend onli to relat those particular that he told us of the manner and law of the utopian but i will begin with the occas that led us to speak of that commonwealth after raphael had discours with great judgment on the mani error that were both among us and these nation had treat of the wise institut both here and there and had spoken as distinctli of the custom and govern of everi nation through which he had past as if he had spent hi whole life in it peter be struck with admir said i wonder raphael how it come that you enter into no king servic for i am sure there ar none to whom you would not be veri accept for your learn and knowledg both of men and thing is such that you would not onli entertain them veri pleasantli but be of great us to them by the exampl you could set befor them and the advic you could give them and by thi mean you would both serv your own interest and be of great us to all your friend as for my friend answer he i need not be much concern have alreadi done for them all that wa incumb on me for when i wa not onli in good health but fresh and young i distribut that among my kindr and friend which other peopl do not part with till thei ar old and sick when thei then unwillingli give that which thei can enjoi no longer themselv i think my friend ought to rest content with thi and not to expect that for their sake i should enslav myself to ani king whatsoev soft and fair said peter i do not mean that you should be a slave to ani king but onli that you should assist them and be us to them the chang of the word said he doe not alter the matter but term it as you will repli peter i do not see ani other wai in which you can be so us both in privat to your friend and to the public and by which you can make your own condit happier happier answer raphael is that to be compass in a wai so abhorr to my geniu now i live as i will to which i believ few courtier can pretend and there ar so mani that court the favour of great men that there will be no great loss if thei ar not troubl either with me or with other of my temper upon thi said i i perceiv raphael that you neither desir wealth nor great and inde i valu and admir such a man much more than i do ani of the great men in the world yet i think you would do what would well becom so gener and philosoph a soul as your is if you would appli your time and thought to public affair even though you mai happen to find it a littl uneasi to yourself and thi you can never do with so much advantag as by be taken into the council of some great princ and put him on nobl and worthi action which i know you would do if you were in such a post for the spring both of good and evil flow from the princ over a whole nation as from a last fountain so much learn as you have even without practic in affair or so great a practic as you have had without ani other learn would render you a veri fit counsellor to ani king whatsoev you ar doubli mistaken said he mr more both in your opinion of me and in the judgment you make of thing for as i have not that capac that you fanci i have so if i had it the public would not be on jot the better when i had sacrif my quiet to it for most princ appli themselv more to affair of war than to the us art of peac and in these i neither have ani knowledg nor do i much desir it thei ar gener more set on acquir new kingdom right or wrong than on govern well those thei possess and among the minist of princ there ar none that ar not so wise as to need no assist or at least that do not think themselv so wise that thei imagin thei need none and if thei court ani it is onli those for whom the princ ha much person favour whom by their fawn and flatteri thei endeavour to fix to their own interest and inde natur ha so made us that we all love to be flatter and to pleas ourselv with our own notion the old crow love hi young and the ap her cub now if in such a court made up of person who envi all other and onli admir themselv a person should but propos anyth that he had either read in histori or observ in hi travel the rest would think that the reput of their wisdom would sink and that their interest would be much depress if thei could not run it down and if all other thing fail then thei would fly to thi that such or such thing pleas our ancestor and it were well for us if we could but match them thei would set up their rest on such an answer as a suffici confut of all that could be said as if it were a great misfortun that ani should be found wiser than hi ancestor but though thei willingli let go all the good thing that were among those of former ag yet if better thing ar propos thei cover themselv obstin with thi excus of rever to past time i have met with these proud moros and absurd judgment of thing in mani place particularli onc in england were you ever there said i ye i wa answer he and stai some month there not long after the rebellion in the west wa suppress with a great slaughter of the poor peopl that were engag in it i wa then much oblig to that reverend prelat john morton archbishop of canterburi cardin and chancellor of england a man said he peter for mr more know well what he wa that wa not less vener for hi wisdom and virtu than for the high charact he bore he wa of a middl statur not broken with ag hi look begot rever rather than fear hi convers wa easi but seriou and grave he sometim took pleasur to try the forc of those that came as suitor to him upon busi by speak sharpli though decent to them and by that he discov their spirit and presenc of mind with which he wa much delight when it did not grow up to impud as bear a great resembl to hi own temper and he look on such person as the fittest men for affair he spoke both gracefulli and weightili he wa emin skill in the law had a vast understand and a prodigi memori and those excel talent with which natur had furnish him were improv by studi and experi when i wa in england the king depend much on hi counsel and the govern seem to be chiefli support by him for from hi youth he had been all along practis in affair and have pass through mani travers of fortun he had with great cost acquir a vast stock of wisdom which is not soon lost when it is purchas so dear on dai when i wa dine with him there happen to be at tabl on of the english lawyer who took occas to run out in a high commend of the sever execut of justic upon thiev who as he said were then hang so fast that there were sometim twenti on on gibbet and upon that he said he could not wonder enough how it came to pass that sinc so few escap there were yet so mani thiev left who were still rob in all place upon thi i who took the bold to speak freeli befor the cardin said there wa no reason to wonder at the matter sinc thi wai of punish thiev wa neither just in itself nor good for the public for as the sever wa too great so the remedi wa not effectu simpl theft not be so great a crime that it ought to cost a man hi life no punish how sever soever be abl to restrain those from rob who can find out no other wai of livelihood in thi said i not onli you in england but a great part of the world imit some ill master that ar readier to chastis their scholar than to teach them there ar dread punish enact against thiev but it were much better to make such good provis by which everi man might be put in a method how to live and so be preserv from the fatal necess of steal and of dy for it there ha been care enough taken for that said he there ar mani handicraft and there is husbandri by which thei mai make a shift to live unless thei have a greater mind to follow ill cours that will not serv your turn said i for mani lose their limb in civil or foreign war as late in the cornish rebellion and some time ago in your war with franc who be thu mutil in the servic of their king and countri can no more follow their old trade and ar too old to learn new on but sinc war ar onli accident thing and have interv let us consid those thing that fall out everi dai there is a great number of noblemen among you that ar themselv as idl as drone that subsist on other men labour on the labour of their tenant whom to rais their revenu thei pare to the quick thi inde is the onli instanc of their frugal for in all other thing thei ar prodig even to the beggar of themselv but besid thi thei carri about with them a great number of idl fellow who never learn ani art by which thei mai gain their live and these as soon as either their lord di or thei themselv fall sick ar turn out of door for your lord ar readier to feed idl peopl than to take care of the sick and often the heir is not abl to keep togeth so great a famili as hi predecessor did now when the stomach of those that ar thu turn out of door grow keen thei rob no less keenli and what els can thei do for when by wander about thei have worn out both their health and their cloth and ar tatter and look ghastli men of qualiti will not entertain them and poor men dare not do it know that on who ha been bred up in idl and pleasur and who wa us to walk about with hi sword and buckler despis all the neighbourhood with an insol scorn as far below him is not fit for the spade and mattock nor will he serv a poor man for so small a hire and in so low a diet as he can afford to give him to thi he answer thi sort of men ought to be particularli cherish for in them consist the forc of the armi for which we have occas sinc their birth inspir them with a nobler sens of honour than is to be found among tradesmen or ploughmen you mai as well sai repli i that you must cherish thiev on the account of war for you will never want the on as long as you have the other and as robber prove sometim gallant soldier so soldier often prove brave robber so near an allianc there is between those two sort of life but thi bad custom so common among you of keep mani servant is not peculiar to thi nation in franc there is yet a more pestifer sort of peopl for the whole countri is full of soldier still kept up in time of peac if such a state of a nation can be call a peac and these ar kept in pai upon the same account that you plead for those idl retain about noblemen thi be a maxim of those pretend statesmen that it is necessari for the public safeti to have a good bodi of veteran soldier ever in readi thei think raw men ar not to be depend on and thei sometim seek occas for make war that thei mai train up their soldier in the art of cut throat or as sallust observ for keep their hand in us that thei mai not grow dull by too long an intermiss but franc ha learn to it cost how danger it is to feed such beast the fate of the roman carthaginian and syrian and mani other nation and citi which were both overturn and quit ruin by those stand armi should make other wiser and the folli of thi maxim of the french appear plainli even from thi that their train soldier often find your raw men prove too hard for them of which i will not sai much lest you mai think i flatter the english everi dai experi show that the mechan in the town or the clown in the countri ar not afraid of fight with those idl gentlemen if thei ar not disabl by some misfortun in their bodi or dispirit by extrem want so that you need not fear that those well shape and strong men for it is onli such that noblemen love to keep about them till thei spoil them who now grow feebl with eas and ar soften with their effemin manner of life would be less fit for action if thei were well bred and well emploi and it seem veri unreason that for the prospect of a war which you need never have but when you pleas you should maintain so mani idl men as will alwai disturb you in time of peac which is ever to be more consid than war but i do not think that thi necess of steal aris onli from henc there is anoth caus of it more peculiar to england what is that said the cardin the increas of pastur said i by which your sheep which ar natur mild and easili kept in order mai be said now to devour men and unpeopl not onli villag but town for wherev it is found that the sheep of ani soil yield a softer and richer wool than ordinari there the nobil and gentri and even those holi men the abbot not content with the old rent which their farm yield nor think it enough that thei live at their eas do no good to the public resolv to do it hurt instead of good thei stop the cours of agricultur destroi hous and town reserv onli the church and enclos ground that thei mai lodg their sheep in them as if forest and park had swallow up too littl of the land those worthi countrymen turn the best inhabit place into solitud for when an insati wretch who is a plagu to hi countri resolv to enclos mani thousand acr of ground the owner as well as tenant ar turn out of their possess by trick or by main forc or be weari out by ill usag thei ar forc to sell them by which mean those miser peopl both men and women marri and unmarri old and young with their poor but numer famili sinc countri busi requir mani hand ar all forc to chang their seat not know whither to go and thei must sell almost for noth their household stuff which could not bring them much monei even though thei might stai for a buyer when that littl monei is at an end for it will be soon spent what is left for them to do but either to steal and so to be hang god know how justli or to go about and beg and if thei do thi thei ar put in prison as idl vagabond while thei would willingli work but can find none that will hire them for there is no more occas for countri labour to which thei have been bred when there is no arabl ground left on shepherd can look after a flock which will stock an extent of ground that would requir mani hand if it were to be plough and reap thi likewis in mani place rais the price of corn the price of wool is also so risen that the poor peopl who were wont to make cloth ar no more abl to bui it and thi likewis make mani of them idl for sinc the increas of pastur god ha punish the avaric of the owner by a rot among the sheep which ha destroi vast number of themto us it might have seem more just had it fell on the owner themselv but suppos the sheep should increas ever so much their price is not like to fall sinc though thei cannot be call a monopoli becaus thei ar not engross by on person yet thei ar in so few hand and these ar so rich that as thei ar not press to sell them sooner than thei have a mind to it so thei never do it till thei have rais the price as high as possibl and on the same account it is that the other kind of cattl ar so dear becaus mani villag be pull down and all countri labour be much neglect there ar none who make it their busi to breed them the rich do not breed cattl as thei do sheep but bui them lean and at low price and after thei have fatten them on their ground sell them again at high rate and i do not think that all the inconveni thi will produc ar yet observ for as thei sell the cattl dear so if thei ar consum faster than the breed countri from which thei ar brought can afford them then the stock must decreas and thi must need end in great scarciti and by these mean thi your island which seem as to thi particular the happiest in the world will suffer much by the curs avaric of a few person besid thi the rise of corn make all peopl lessen their famili as much as thei can and what can those who ar dismiss by them do but either beg or rob and to thi last a man of a great mind is much sooner drawn than to the former luxuri likewis break in apac upon you to set forward your poverti and miseri there is an excess vaniti in apparel and great cost in diet and that not onli in noblemen famili but even among tradesmen among the farmer themselv and among all rank of person you have also mani infam hous and besid those that ar known the tavern and alehous ar no better add to these dice card tabl footbal tenni and quoit in which monei run fast awai and those that ar initi into them must in the conclus betak themselv to rob for a suppli banish these plagu and give order that those who have dispeopl so much soil mai either rebuild the villag thei have pull down or let out their ground to such as will do it restrain those engross of the rich that ar as bad almost as monopoli leav fewer occas to idl let agricultur be set up again and the manufactur of the wool be regul that so there mai be work found for those compani of idl peopl whom want forc to be thiev or who now be idl vagabond or useless servant will certainli grow thiev at last if you do not find a remedi to these evil it is a vain thing to boast of your sever in punish theft which though it mai have the appear of justic yet in itself is neither just nor conveni for if you suffer your peopl to be illeduc and their manner to be corrupt from their infanc and then punish them for those crime to which their first educ dispos them what els is to be conclud from thi but that you first make thiev and then punish them while i wa talk thu the counsellor who wa present had prepar an answer and had resolv to resum all i had said accord to the formal of a debat in which thing ar gener repeat more faithfulli than thei ar answer as if the chief trial to be made were of men memori you have talk prettili for a stranger said he have heard of mani thing among us which you have not been abl to consid well but i will make the whole matter plain to you and will first repeat in order all that you have said then i will show how much your ignor of our affair ha misl you and will in the last place answer all your argument and that i mai begin where i promis there were four thing hold your peac said the cardin thi will take up too much time therefor we will at present eas you of the troubl of answer and reserv it to our next meet which shall be tomorrow if raphael affair and your can admit of it but raphael said he to me i would gladli know upon what reason it is that you think theft ought not to be punish by death would you give wai to it or do you propos ani other punish that will be more us to the public for sinc death doe not restrain theft if men thought their live would be safe what fear or forc could restrain ill men on the contrari thei would look on the mitig of the punish as an invit to commit more crime i answer it seem to me a veri unjust thing to take awai a man life for a littl monei for noth in the world can be of equal valu with a man life and if it be said that it is not for the monei that on suffer but for hi break the law i must sai extrem justic is an extrem injuri for we ought not to approv of those terribl law that make the smallest offenc capit nor of that opinion of the stoic that make all crime equal as if there were no differ to be made between the kill a man and the take hi purs between which if we examin thing imparti there is no like nor proport god ha command us not to kill and shall we kill so easili for a littl monei but if on shall sai that by that law we ar onli forbid to kill ani except when the law of the land allow of it upon the same ground law mai be made in some case to allow of adulteri and perjuri for god have taken from us the right of dispos either of our own or of other peopl live if it is pretend that the mutual consent of men in make law can authoris manslaught in case in which god ha given us no exampl that it free peopl from the oblig of the divin law and so make murder a law action what is thi but to give a prefer to human law befor the divin and if thi is onc admit by the same rule men mai in all other thing put what restrict thei pleas upon the law of god if by the mosaic law though it wa rough and sever as be a yoke laid on an obstin and servil nation men were onli fine and not put to death for theft we cannot imagin that in thi new law of merci in which god treat us with the tender of a father he ha given us a greater licenc to cruelti than he did to the jew upon these reason it is that i think put thiev to death is not law and it is plain and obviou that it is absurd and of ill consequ to the commonwealth that a thief and a murder should be equal punish for if a robber see that hi danger is the same if he is convict of theft as if he were guilti of murder thi will natur incit him to kill the person whom otherwis he would onli have rob sinc if the punish is the same there is more secur and less danger of discoveri when he that can best make it is put out of the wai so that terrifi thiev too much provok them to cruelti but as to the question what more conveni wai of punish can be found i think it much easier to find out that than to invent anyth that is wors why should we doubt but the wai that wa so long in us among the old roman who understood so well the art of govern wa veri proper for their punish thei condemn such as thei found guilti of great crime to work their whole live in quarri or to dig in mine with chain about them but the method that i like best wa that which i observ in my travel in persia among the polylerit who ar a consider and wellgovern peopl thei pai a yearli tribut to the king of persia but in all other respect thei ar a free nation and govern by their own law thei lie far from the sea and ar environ with hill and be content with the product of their own countri which is veri fruit thei have littl commerc with ani other nation and as thei accord to the geniu of their countri have no inclin to enlarg their border so their mountain and the pension thei pai to the persian secur them from all invas thu thei have no war among them thei live rather conveni than with splendour and mai be rather call a happi nation than either emin or famou for i do not think that thei ar known so much as by name to ani but their next neighbour those that ar found guilti of theft among them ar bound to make restitut to the owner and not as it is in other place to the princ for thei reckon that the princ ha no more right to the stolen good than the thief but if that which wa stolen is no more in be then the good of the thiev ar estim and restitut be made out of them the remaind is given to their wive and children and thei themselv ar condemn to serv in the public work but ar neither imprison nor chain unless there happen to be some extraordinari circumst in their crime thei go about loos and free work for the public if thei ar idl or backward to work thei ar whip but if thei work hard thei ar well us and treat without ani mark of reproach onli the list of them ar call alwai at night and then thei ar shut up thei suffer no other uneasi but thi of constant labour for as thei work for the public so thei ar well entertain out of the public stock which is done differ in differ place in some place whatev is bestow on them is rais by a charit contribut and though thi wai mai seem uncertain yet so merci ar the inclin of that peopl that thei ar plentifulli suppli by it but in other place public revenu ar set asid for them or there is a constant tax or pollmonei rais for their mainten in some place thei ar set to no public work but everi privat man that ha occas to hire workmen goe to the marketplac and hire them of the public a littl lower than he would do a freeman if thei go lazili about their task he mai quicken them with the whip by thi mean there is alwai some piec of work or other to be done by them and besid their livelihood thei earn somewhat still to the public thei all wear a peculiar habit of on certain colour and their hair is crop a littl abov their ear and a piec of on of their ear is cut off their friend ar allow to give them either meat drink or cloth so thei ar of their proper colour but it is death both to the giver and taker if thei give them monei nor is it less penal for ani freeman to take monei from them upon ani account whatsoev and it is also death for ani of these slave so thei ar call to handl arm those of everi divis of the countri ar distinguish by a peculiar mark which it is capit for them to lai asid to go out of their bound or to talk with a slave of anoth jurisdict and the veri attempt of an escap is no less penal than an escap itself it is death for ani other slave to be accessori to it and if a freeman engag in it he is condemn to slaveri those that discov it ar rewardedif freemen in monei and if slave with liberti togeth with a pardon for be accessori to it that so thei might find their account rather in repent of their engag in such a design than in persist in it these ar their law and rule in relat to robberi and it is obviou that thei ar as advantag as thei ar mild and gentl sinc vice is not onli destroi and men preserv but thei ar treat in such a manner as to make them see the necess of be honest and of emploi the rest of their live in repair the injuri thei had formerli done to societi nor is there ani hazard of their fall back to their old custom and so littl do travel apprehend mischief from them that thei gener make us of them for guid from on jurisdict to anoth for there is noth left them by which thei can rob or be the better for it sinc as thei ar disarm so the veri have of monei is a suffici convict and as thei ar certainli punish if discov so thei cannot hope to escap for their habit be in all the part of it differ from what is commonli worn thei cannot fly awai unless thei would go nake and even then their crop ear would betrai them the onli danger to be fear from them is their conspir against the govern but those of on divis and neighbourhood can do noth to ani purpos unless a gener conspiraci were laid amongst all the slave of the sever jurisdict which cannot be done sinc thei cannot meet or talk togeth nor will ani ventur on a design where the conceal would be so danger and the discoveri so profit none ar quit hopeless of recov their freedom sinc by their obedi and patienc and by give good ground to believ that thei will chang their manner of life for the futur thei mai expect at last to obtain their liberti and some ar everi year restor to it upon the good charact that is given of them when i had relat all thi i ad that i did not see why such a method might not be follow with more advantag than could ever be expect from that sever justic which the counsellor magnifi so much to thi he answer that it could never take place in england without endang the whole nation as he said thi he shook hi head made some grimac and held hi peac while all the compani seem of hi opinion except the cardin who said that it wa not easi to form a judgment of it success sinc it wa a method that never yet had been tri but if said he when sentenc of death were pass upon a thief the princ would repriev him for a while and make the experi upon him deni him the privileg of a sanctuari and then if it had a good effect upon him it might take place and if it did not succe the worst would be to execut the sentenc on the condemn person at last and i do not see ad he why it would be either unjust inconveni or at all danger to admit of such a delai in my opinion the vagabond ought to be treat in the same manner against whom though we have made mani law yet we have not been abl to gain our end when the cardin had done thei all commend the motion though thei had despis it when it came from me but more particularli commend what relat to the vagabond becaus it wa hi own observ i do not know whether it be worth while to tell what follow for it wa veri ridicul but i shall ventur at it for as it is not foreign to thi matter so some good us mai be made of it there wa a jester stand by that counterfeit the fool so natur that he seem to be realli on the jest which he offer were so cold and dull that we laugh more at him than at them yet sometim he said as it were by chanc thing that were not unpleas so as to justifi the old proverb that he who throw the dice often will sometim have a lucki hit when on of the compani had said that i had taken care of the thiev and the cardin had taken care of the vagabond so that there remain noth but that some public provis might be made for the poor whom sick or old ag had disabl from labour leav that to me said the fool and i shall take care of them for there is no sort of peopl whose sight i abhor more have been so often vex with them and with their sad complaint but as dolefulli soever as thei have told their tale thei could never prevail so far as to draw on penni from me for either i had no mind to give them anyth or when i had a mind to do it i had noth to give them and thei now know me so well that thei will not lose their labour but let me pass without give me ani troubl becaus thei hope for nothingno more in faith than if i were a priest but i would have a law made for send all these beggar to monasteri the men to the benedictin to be made laybroth and the women to be nun the cardin smile and approv of it in jest but the rest like it in earnest there wa a divin present who though he wa a grave moros man yet he wa so pleas with thi reflect that wa made on the priest and the monk that he began to plai with the fool and said to him thi will not deliv you from all beggar except you take care of us friar that is done alreadi answer the fool for the cardin ha provid for you by what he propos for restrain vagabond and set them to work for i know no vagabond like you thi wa well entertain by the whole compani who look at the cardin perceiv that he wa not illpleas at it onli the friar himself wa vex as mai be easili imagin and fell into such a passion that he could not forbear rail at the fool and call him knave slander backbit and son of perdit and then cite some dread threaten out of the scriptur against him now the jester thought he wa in hi element and laid about him freeli good friar said he be not angri for it is written in patienc possess your soul the friar answer for i shall give you hi own word i am not angri you hangman at least i do not sin in it for the psalmist sai be ye angri and sin not upon thi the cardin admonish him gentli and wish him to govern hi passion no my lord said he i speak not but from a good zeal which i ought to have for holi men have had a good zeal as it is said the zeal of thy hous hath eaten me up and we sing in our church that those who mock elisha as he went up to the hous of god felt the effect of hi zeal which that mocker that rogu that scoundrel will perhap feel you do thi perhap with a good intent said the cardin but in my opinion it were wiser in you and perhap better for you not to engag in so ridicul a contest with a fool no my lord answer he that were not wise done for solomon the wisest of men said answer a fool accord to hi folli which i now do and show him the ditch into which he will fall if he is not awar of it for if the mani mocker of elisha who wa but on bald man felt the effect of hi zeal what will becom of the mocker of so mani friar among whom there ar so mani bald men we have likewis a bull by which all that jeer us ar excommun when the cardin saw that there wa no end of thi matter he made a sign to the fool to withdraw turn the discours anoth wai and soon after rose from the tabl and dismiss us went to hear caus thu mr more i have run out into a tediou stori of the length of which i had been asham if as you earnestli beg it of me i had not observ you to hearken to it as if you had no mind to lose ani part of it i might have contract it but i resolv to give it you at larg that you might observ how those that despis what i had propos no sooner perceiv that the cardin did not dislik it but present approv of it fawn so on him and flatter him to such a degre that thei in good earnest applaud those thing that he onli like in jest and from henc you mai gather how littl courtier would valu either me or my counsel to thi i answer you have done me a great kind in thi relat for as everyth ha been relat by you both wise and pleasantli so you have made me imagin that i wa in my own countri and grown young again by recal that good cardin to my thought in whose famili i wa bred from my childhood and though you ar upon other account veri dear to me yet you ar the dearer becaus you honour hi memori so much but after all thi i cannot chang my opinion for i still think that if you could overcom that avers which you have to the court of princ you might by the advic which it is in your power to give do a great deal of good to mankind and thi is the chief design that everi good man ought to propos to himself in live for your friend plato think that nation will be happi when either philosoph becom king or king becom philosoph it is no wonder if we ar so far from that happi while philosoph will not think it their duti to assist king with their counsel thei ar not so basemind said he but that thei would willingli do it mani of them have alreadi done it by their book if those that ar in power would but hearken to their good advic but plato judg right that except king themselv becam philosoph thei who from their childhood ar corrupt with fals notion would never fall in entir with the counsel of philosoph and thi he himself found to be true in the person of dionysiu do not you think that if i were about ani king propos good law to him and endeavour to root out all the curs seed of evil that i found in him i should either be turn out of hi court or at least be laugh at for my pain for instanc what could i signifi if i were about the king of franc and were call into hi cabinet council where sever wise men in hi hear were propos mani expedi as by what art and practic milan mai be kept and napl that ha so often slip out of their hand recov how the venetian and after them the rest of itali mai be subdu and then how flander brabant and all burgundi and some other kingdom which he ha swallow alreadi in hi design mai be ad to hi empir on propos a leagu with the venetian to be kept as long as he find hi account in it and that he ought to commun counsel with them and give them some share of the spoil till hi success make him need or fear them less and then it will be easili taken out of their hand anoth propos the hire the german and the secur the switzer by pension anoth propos the gain the emperor by monei which is omnipot with him anoth propos a peac with the king of arragon and in order to cement it the yield up the king of navarr pretens anoth think that the princ of castil is to be wrought on by the hope of an allianc and that some of hi courtier ar to be gain to the french faction by pension the hardest point of all is what to do with england a treati of peac is to be set on foot and if their allianc is not to be depend on yet it is to be made as firm as possibl and thei ar to be call friend but suspect as enemi therefor the scot ar to be kept in readi to be let loos upon england on everi occas and some banish nobleman is to be support underhand for by the leagu it cannot be done avowedli who ha a pretens to the crown by which mean that suspect princ mai be kept in aw now when thing ar in so great a ferment and so mani gallant men ar join counsel how to carri on the war if so mean a man as i should stand up and wish them to chang all their counselsto let itali alon and stai at home sinc the kingdom of franc wa inde greater than could be well govern by on man that therefor he ought not to think of ad other to it and if after thi i should propos to them the resolut of the achorian a peopl that lie on the southeast of utopia who long ago engag in war in order to add to the dominion of their princ anoth kingdom to which he had some pretens by an ancient allianc thi thei conquer but found that the troubl of keep it wa equal to that by which it wa gain that the conquer peopl were alwai either in rebellion or expos to foreign invas while thei were oblig to be incessantli at war either for or against them and consequ could never disband their armi that in the meantim thei were oppress with tax their monei went out of the kingdom their blood wa spilt for the glori of their king without procur the least advantag to the peopl who receiv not the smallest benefit from it even in time of peac and that their manner be corrupt by a long war robberi and murder everywher abound and their law fell into contempt while their king distract with the care of two kingdom wa the less abl to appli hi mind to the interest of either when thei saw thi and that there would be no end to these evil thei by joint counsel made an humbl address to their king desir him to choos which of the two kingdom he had the greatest mind to keep sinc he could not hold both for thei were too great a peopl to be govern by a divid king sinc no man would willingli have a groom that should be in common between him and anoth upon which the good princ wa forc to quit hi new kingdom to on of hi friend who wa not long after dethron and to be content with hi old on to thi i would add that after all those warlik attempt the vast confus and the consumpt both of treasur and of peopl that must follow them perhap upon some misfortun thei might be forc to throw up all at last therefor it seem much more elig that the king should improv hi ancient kingdom all he could and make it flourish as much as possibl that he should love hi peopl and be belov of them that he should live among them govern them gentli and let other kingdom alon sinc that which had fallen to hi share wa big enough if not too big for himprai how do you think would such a speech as thi be heard i confess said i i think not veri well but what said he if i should sort with anoth kind of minist whose chief contriv and consult were by what art the princ treasur might be increas where on propos rais the valu of speci when the king debt ar larg and lower it when hi revenu were to come in that so he might both pai much with a littl and in a littl receiv a great deal anoth propos a pretenc of a war that monei might be rais in order to carri it on and that a peac be conclud as soon as that wa done and thi with such appear of religion as might work on the peopl and make them imput it to the pieti of their princ and to hi tender for the live of hi subject a third offer some old musti law that have been antiqu by a long disus and which as thei had been forgotten by all the subject so thei had also been broken by them and propos the levi the penalti of these law that as it would bring in a vast treasur so there might be a veri good pretenc for it sinc it would look like the execut a law and the do of justic a fourth propos the prohibit of mani thing under sever penalti especi such as were against the interest of the peopl and then the dispens with these prohibit upon great composit to those who might find their advantag in break them thi would serv two end both of them accept to mani for as those whose avaric led them to transgress would be sever fine so the sell licenc dear would look as if a princ were tender of hi peopl and would not easili or at low rate dispens with anyth that might be against the public good anoth propos that the judg must be made sure that thei mai declar alwai in favour of the prerog that thei must be often sent for to court that the king mai hear them argu those point in which he is concern sinc how unjust soever ani of hi pretens mai be yet still some on or other of them either out of contradict to other or the pride of singular or to make their court would find out some pretenc or other to give the king a fair colour to carri the point for if the judg but differ in opinion the clearest thing in the world is made by that mean disput and truth be onc brought in question the king mai then take advantag to expound the law for hi own profit while the judg that stand out will be brought over either through fear or modesti and thei be thu gain all of them mai be sent to the bench to give sentenc boldli as the king would have it for fair pretenc will never be want when sentenc is to be given in the princ favour it will either be said that equiti li of hi side or some word in the law will be found sound that wai or some forc sens will be put on them and when all other thing fail the king undoubt prerog will be pretend as that which is abov all law and to which a religi judg ought to have a special regard thu all consent to that maxim of crassu that a princ cannot have treasur enough sinc he must maintain hi armi out of it that a king even though he would can do noth unjustli that all properti is in him not except the veri person of hi subject and that no man ha ani other properti but that which the king out of hi good think fit to leav him and thei think it is the princ interest that there be as littl of thi left as mai be as if it were hi advantag that hi peopl should have neither rich nor liberti sinc these thing make them less easi and will to submit to a cruel and unjust govern wherea necess and poverti blunt them make them patient beat them down and break that height of spirit that might otherwis dispos them to rebel now what if after all these proposit were made i should rise up and assert that such counsel were both unbecom a king and mischiev to him and that not onli hi honour but hi safeti consist more in hi peopl wealth than in hi own if i should show that thei choos a king for their own sake and not for hi that by hi care and endeavour thei mai be both easi and safe and that therefor a princ ought to take more care of hi peopl happi than of hi own as a shepherd is to take more care of hi flock than of himself it is also certain that thei ar much mistaken that think the poverti of a nation is a mean of the public safeti who quarrel more than beggar who doe more earnestli long for a chang than he that is uneasi in hi present circumst and who run to creat confus with so desper a bold as those who have noth to lose hope to gain by them if a king should fall under such contempt or envi that he could not keep hi subject in their duti but by oppress and ill usag and by render them poor and miser it were certainli better for him to quit hi kingdom than to retain it by such method as make him while he keep the name of author lose the majesti due to it nor is it so becom the digniti of a king to reign over beggar as over rich and happi subject and therefor fabriciu a man of a nobl and exalt temper said he would rather govern rich men than be rich himself sinc for on man to abound in wealth and pleasur when all about him ar mourn and groan is to be a gaoler and not a king he is an unskil physician that cannot cure on diseas without cast hi patient into anoth so he that can find no other wai for correct the error of hi peopl but by take from them the conveni of life show that he know not what it is to govern a free nation he himself ought rather to shake off hi sloth or to lai down hi pride for the contempt or hatr that hi peopl have for him take it rise from the vice in himself let him live upon what belong to him without wrong other and accommod hi expens to hi revenu let him punish crime and by hi wise conduct let him endeavour to prevent them rather than be sever when he ha suffer them to be too common let him not rashli reviv law that ar abrog by disus especi if thei have been long forgotten and never want and let him never take ani penalti for the breach of them to which a judg would not give wai in a privat man but would look on him as a crafti and unjust person for pretend to it to these thing i would add that law among the macariansa peopl that live not far from utopiabi which their king on the dai on which he began to reign is ti by an oath confirm by solemn sacrific never to have at onc abov a thousand pound of gold in hi treasur or so much silver as is equal to that in valu thi law thei tell us wa made by an excel king who had more regard to the rich of hi countri than to hi own wealth and therefor provid against the heap up of so much treasur as might impoverish the peopl he thought that moder sum might be suffici for ani accid if either the king had occas for it against the rebel or the kingdom against the invas of an enemi but that it wa not enough to encourag a princ to invad other men rightsa circumst that wa the chief caus of hi make that law he also thought that it wa a good provis for that free circul of monei so necessari for the cours of commerc and exchang and when a king must distribut all those extraordinari access that increas treasur beyond the due pitch it make him less dispos to oppress hi subject such a king as thi will be the terror of ill men and will be belov by all the good if i sai i should talk of these or suchlik thing to men that had taken their bia anoth wai how deaf would thei be to all i could sai no doubt veri deaf answer i and no wonder for on is never to offer proposit or advic that we ar certain will not be entertain discours so much out of the road could not avail anyth nor have ani effect on men whose mind were prepossess with differ sentiment thi philosoph wai of specul is not unpleas among friend in a free convers but there is no room for it in the court of princ where great affair ar carri on by author that is what i wa sai repli he that there is no room for philosophi in the court of princ ye there is said i but not for thi specul philosophi that make everyth to be alik fit at all time but there is anoth philosophi that is more pliabl that know it proper scene accommod itself to it and teach a man with proprieti and decenc to act that part which ha fallen to hi share if when on of plautu comedi is upon the stage and a compani of servant ar act their part you should come out in the garb of a philosoph and repeat out of octavia a discours of seneca to nero would it not be better for you to sai noth than by mix thing of such differ natur to make an impertin tragicomedi for you spoil and corrupt the plai that is in hand when you mix with it thing of an opposit natur even though thei ar much better therefor go through with the plai that is act the best you can and do not confound it becaus anoth that is pleasant come into your thought it is even so in a commonwealth and in the council of princ if ill opinion cannot be quit root out and you cannot cure some receiv vice accord to your wish you must not therefor abandon the commonwealth for the same reason as you should not forsak the ship in a storm becaus you cannot command the wind you ar not oblig to assault peopl with discours that ar out of their road when you see that their receiv notion must prevent your make an impress upon them you ought rather to cast about and to manag thing with all the dexter in your power so that if you ar not abl to make them go well thei mai be as littl ill as possibl for except all men were good everyth cannot be right and that is a bless that i do not at present hope to see accord to your argument answer he all that i could be abl to do would be to preserv myself from be mad while i endeavour to cure the mad of other for if i speak with i must repeat what i have said to you and as for ly whether a philosoph can do it or not i cannot tell i am sure i cannot do it but though these discours mai be uneasi and ungrat to them i do not see why thei should seem foolish or extravag inde if i should either propos such thing as plato ha contriv in hi commonwealth or as the utopian practis in their though thei might seem better as certainli thei ar yet thei ar so differ from our establish which is found on properti there be no such thing among them that i could not expect that it would have ani effect on them but such discours as mine which onli call past evil to mind and give warn of what mai follow leav noth in them that is so absurd that thei mai not be us at ani time for thei can onli be unpleas to those who ar resolv to run headlong the contrari wai and if we must let alon everyth as absurd or extravagantwhich by reason of the wick live of mani mai seem uncouthw must even among christian give over press the greatest part of those thing that christ hath taught us though he ha command us not to conceal them but to proclaim on the housetop that which he taught in secret the greatest part of hi precept ar more opposit to the live of the men of thi ag than ani part of my discours ha been but the preacher seem to have learn that craft to which you advis me for thei observ that the world would not willingli suit their live to the rule that christ ha given have fit hi doctrin as if it had been a leaden rule to their live that so some wai or other thei might agre with on anoth but i see no other effect of thi complianc except it be that men becom more secur in their wicked by it and thi is all the success that i can have in a court for i must alwai differ from the rest and then i shall signifi noth or if i agre with them i shall then onli help forward their mad i do not comprehend what you mean by your cast about or by the bend and handl thing so dexter that if thei go not well thei mai go as littl ill as mai be for in court thei will not bear with a man hold hi peac or conniv at what other do a man must barefacedli approv of the worst counsel and consent to the blackest design so that he would pass for a spy or possibl for a traitor that did but coldli approv of such wick practic and therefor when a man is engag in such a societi he will be so far from be abl to mend matter by hi cast about as you call it that he will find no occas of do ani goodth ill compani will sooner corrupt him than be the better for him or if notwithstand all their ill compani he still remain steadi and innoc yet their folli and knaveri will be imput to him and by mix counsel with them he must bear hi share of all the blame that belong wholli to other it wa no ill simil by which plato set forth the unreason of a philosoph meddl with govern if a man sai he were to see a great compani run out everi dai into the rain and take delight in be wetif he knew that it would be to no purpos for him to go and persuad them to return to their hous in order to avoid the storm and that all that could be expect by hi go to speak to them would be that he himself should be as wet as thei it would be best for him to keep within door and sinc he had not influenc enough to correct other peopl folli to take care to preserv himself though to speak plainli my real sentiment i must freeli own that as long as there is ani properti and while monei is the standard of all other thing i cannot think that a nation can be govern either justli or happili not justli becaus the best thing will fall to the share of the worst men nor happili becaus all thing will be divid among a few and even these ar not in all respect happi the rest be left to be absolut miser therefor when i reflect on the wise and good constitut of the utopian among whom all thing ar so well govern and with so few law where virtu hath it due reward and yet there is such an equal that everi man live in plentywhen i compar with them so mani other nation that ar still make new law and yet can never bring their constitut to a right regul where notwithstand everi on ha hi properti yet all the law that thei can invent have not the power either to obtain or preserv it or even to enabl men certainli to distinguish what is their own from what is anoth of which the mani lawsuit that everi dai break out and ar etern depend give too plain a demonstrationwhen i sai i balanc all these thing in my thought i grow more favour to plato and do not wonder that he resolv not to make ani law for such as would not submit to a commun of all thing for so wise a man could not but forese that the set all upon a level wa the onli wai to make a nation happi which cannot be obtain so long as there is properti for when everi man draw to himself all that he can compass by on titl or anoth it must need follow that how plenti soever a nation mai be yet a few divid the wealth of it among themselv the rest must fall into indig so that there will be two sort of peopl among them who deserv that their fortun should be interchangedth former useless but wick and raven and the latter who by their constant industri serv the public more than themselv sincer and modest menfrom whenc i am persuad that till properti is taken awai there can be no equit or just distribut of thing nor can the world be happili govern for as long as that is maintain the greatest and the far best part of mankind will be still oppress with a load of care and anxieti i confess without take it quit awai those pressur that lie on a great part of mankind mai be made lighter but thei can never be quit remov for if law were made to determin at how great an extent in soil and at how much monei everi man must stopto limit the princ that he might not grow too great and to restrain the peopl that thei might not becom too insolentand that none might factious aspir to public employ which ought neither to be sold nor made burdensom by a great expens sinc otherwis those that serv in them would be tempt to reimburs themselv by cheat and violenc and it would becom necessari to find out rich men for undergo those employ which ought rather to be trust to the wise these law i sai might have such effect as good diet and care might have on a sick man whose recoveri is desper thei might allai and mitig the diseas but it could never be quit heal nor the bodi polit be brought again to a good habit as long as properti remain and it will fall out as in a complic of diseas that by appli a remedi to on sore you will provok anoth and that which remov the on ill symptom produc other while the strengthen on part of the bodi weaken the rest on the contrari answer i it seem to me that men cannot live conveni where all thing ar common how can there be ani plenti where everi man will excus himself from labour for as the hope of gain doth not excit him so the confid that he ha in other men industri mai make him sloth if peopl come to be pinch with want and yet cannot dispos of anyth as their own what can follow upon thi but perpetu sedit and bloodsh especi when the rever and author due to magistr fall to the ground for i cannot imagin how that can be kept up among those that ar in all thing equal to on anoth i do not wonder said he that it appear so to you sinc you have no notion or at least no right on of such a constitut but if you had been in utopia with me and had seen their law and rule as i did for the space of five year in which i live among them and dure which time i wa so delight with them that inde i should never have left them if it had not been to make the discoveri of that new world to the european you would then confess that you had never seen a peopl so well constitut as thei you will not easili persuad me said peter that ani nation in that new world is better govern than those among us for as our understand ar not wors than their so our govern if i mistak not be more ancient a long practic ha help us to find out mani conveni of life and some happi chanc have discov other thing to us which no man understand could ever have invent as for the antiqu either of their govern or of our said he you cannot pass a true judgment of it unless you had read their histori for if thei ar to be believ thei had town among them befor these part were so much as inhabit and as for those discoveri that have been either hit on by chanc or made by ingeni men these might have happen there as well as here i do not deni but we ar more ingeni than thei ar but thei exce us much in industri and applic thei knew littl concern us befor our arriv among them thei call us all by a gener name of the nation that lie beyond the equinocti line for their chronicl mention a shipwreck that wa made on their coast twelv hundr year ago and that some roman and egyptian that were in the ship get safe ashor spent the rest of their dai amongst them and such wa their ingenu that from thi singl opportun thei drew the advantag of learn from those unlookedfor guest and acquir all the us art that were then among the roman and which were known to these shipwreck men and by the hint that thei gave them thei themselv found out even some of those art which thei could not fulli explain so happili did thei improv that accid of have some of our peopl cast upon their shore but if such an accid ha at ani time brought ani from thenc into europ we have been so far from improv it that we do not so much as rememb it as in aftertim perhap it will be forgot by our peopl that i wa ever there for though thei from on such accid made themselv master of all the good invent that were among us yet i believ it would be long befor we should learn or put in practic ani of the good institut that ar among them and thi is the true caus of their be better govern and live happier than we though we come not short of them in point of understand or outward advantag upon thi i said to him i earnestli beg you would describ that island veri particularli to us be not too short but set out in order all thing relat to their soil their river their town their peopl their manner constitut law and in a word all that you imagin we desir to know and you mai well imagin that we desir to know everyth concern them of which we ar hitherto ignor i will do it veri willingli said he for i have digest the whole matter carefulli but it will take up some time let us go then said i first and dine and then we shall have leisur enough he consent we went in and dine and after dinner came back and sat down in the same place i order my servant to take care that none might come and interrupt us and both peter and i desir raphael to be as good as hi word when he saw that we were veri intent upon it he paus a littl to recollect himself and began in thi manner the island of utopia is in the middl two hundr mile broad and hold almost at the same breadth over a great part of it but it grow narrow toward both end it figur is not unlik a crescent between it horn the sea come in eleven mile broad and spread itself into a great bai which is environ with land to the compass of about five hundr mile and is well secur from wind in thi bai there is no great current the whole coast is as it were on continu harbour which give all that live in the island great conveni for mutual commerc but the entri into the bai occas by rock on the on hand and shallow on the other is veri danger in the middl of it there is on singl rock which appear abov water and mai therefor easili be avoid and on the top of it there is a tower in which a garrison is kept the other rock lie under water and ar veri danger the channel is known onli to the nativ so that if ani stranger should enter into the bai without on of their pilot he would run great danger of shipwreck for even thei themselv could not pass it safe if some mark that ar on the coast did not direct their wai and if these should be but a littl shift ani fleet that might come against them how great soever it were would be certainli lost on the other side of the island there ar likewis mani harbour and the coast is so fortifi both by natur and art that a small number of men can hinder the descent of a great armi but thei report and there remain good mark of it to make it credibl that thi wa no island at first but a part of the contin utopu that conquer it whose name it still carri for abraxa wa it first name brought the rude and uncivilis inhabit into such a good govern and to that measur of polit that thei now far excel all the rest of mankind have soon subdu them he design to separ them from the contin and to bring the sea quit round them to accomplish thi he order a deep channel to be dug fifteen mile long and that the nativ might not think he treat them like slave he not onli forc the inhabit but also hi own soldier to labour in carri it on as he set a vast number of men to work he beyond all men expect brought it to a speedi conclus and hi neighbour who at first laugh at the folli of the undertak no sooner saw it brought to perfect than thei were struck with admir and terror there ar fiftyfour citi in the island all larg and well built the manner custom and law of which ar the same and thei ar all contriv as near in the same manner as the ground on which thei stand will allow the nearest lie at least twentyfour mile distanc from on anoth and the most remot ar not so far distant but that a man can go on foot in on dai from it to that which li next it everi citi send three of their wisest senat onc a year to amaurot to consult about their common concern for that is the chief town of the island be situat near the centr of it so that it is the most conveni place for their assembl the jurisdict of everi citi extend at least twenti mile and where the town lie wider thei have much more ground no town desir to enlarg it bound for the peopl consid themselv rather as tenant than landlord thei have built over all the countri farmhous for husbandmen which ar well contriv and furnish with all thing necessari for countri labour inhabit ar sent by turn from the citi to dwell in them no countri famili ha fewer than forti men and women in it besid two slave there is a master and a mistress set over everi famili and over thirti famili there is a magistr everi year twenti of thi famili come back to the town after thei have stai two year in the countri and in their room there ar other twenti sent from the town that thei mai learn countri work from those that have been alreadi on year in the countri as thei must teach those that come to them the next from the town by thi mean such as dwell in those countri farm ar never ignor of agricultur and so commit no error which might otherwis be fatal and bring them under a scarciti of corn but though there is everi year such a shift of the husbandmen to prevent ani man be forc against hi will to follow that hard cours of life too long yet mani among them take such pleasur in it that thei desir leav to continu in it mani year these husbandmen till the ground breed cattl hew wood and convei it to the town either by land or water as is most conveni thei breed an infinit multitud of chicken in a veri curiou manner for the hen do not sit and hatch them but a vast number of egg ar laid in a gentl and equal heat in order to be hatch and thei ar no sooner out of the shell and abl to stir about but thei seem to consid those that feed them as their mother and follow them as other chicken do the hen that hatch them thei breed veri few hors but those thei have ar full of mettl and ar kept onli for exercis their youth in the art of sit and ride them for thei do not put them to ani work either of plough or carriag in which thei emploi oxen for though their hors ar stronger yet thei find oxen can hold out longer and as thei ar not subject to so mani diseas so thei ar kept upon a less charg and with less troubl and even when thei ar so worn out that thei ar no more fit for labour thei ar good meat at last thei sow no corn but that which is to be their bread for thei drink either wine cider or perri and often water sometim boil with honei or liquoric with which thei abound and though thei know exactli how much corn will serv everi town and all that tract of countri which belong to it yet thei sow much more and breed more cattl than ar necessari for their consumpt and thei give that overplu of which thei make no us to their neighbour when thei want anyth in the countri which it doe not produc thei fetch that from the town without carri anyth in exchang for it and the magistr of the town take care to see it given them for thei meet gener in the town onc a month upon a festiv dai when the time of harvest come the magistr in the countri send to those in the town and let them know how mani hand thei will need for reap the harvest and the number thei call for be sent to them thei commonli despatch it all in on dai of their town particularli of amaurot he that know on of their town know them allthei ar so like on anoth except where the situat make some differ i shall therefor describ on of them and none is so proper as amaurot for as none is more emin all the rest yield in preced to thi becaus it is the seat of their suprem council so there wa none of them better known to me i have live five year all togeth in it it li upon the side of a hill or rather a rise ground it figur is almost squar for from the on side of it which shoot up almost to the top of the hill it run down in a descent for two mile to the river anid but it is a littl broader the other wai that run along by the bank of that river the anid rise about eighti mile abov amaurot in a small spring at first but other brook fall into it of which two ar more consider than the rest as it run by amaurot it is grown half a mile broad but it still grow larger and larger till after sixti mile cours below it it is lost in the ocean between the town and the sea and for some mile abov the town it ebb and flow everi six hour with a strong current the tide come up about thirti mile so full that there is noth but salt water in the river the fresh water be driven back with it forc and abov that for some mile the water is brackish but a littl higher as it run by the town it is quit fresh and when the tide ebb it continu fresh all along to the sea there is a bridg cast over the river not of timber but of fair stone consist of mani state arch it li at that part of the town which is farthest from the sea so that the ship without ani hindranc lie all along the side of the town there is likewis anoth river that run by it which though it is not great yet it run pleasantli for it rise out of the same hill on which the town stand and so run down through it and fall into the anid the inhabit have fortifi the fountainhead of thi river which spring a littl without the town that so if thei should happen to be besieg the enemi might not be abl to stop or divert the cours of the water nor poison it from thenc it is carri in earthen pipe to the lower street and for those place of the town to which the water of that small river cannot be convei thei have great cistern for receiv the rainwat which suppli the want of the other the town is compass with a high and thick wall in which there ar mani tower and fort there is also a broad and deep dry ditch set thick with thorn cast round three side of the town and the river is instead of a ditch on the fourth side the street ar veri conveni for all carriag and ar well shelter from the wind their build ar good and ar so uniform that a whole side of a street look like on hous the street ar twenti feet broad there lie garden behind all their hous these ar larg but enclos with build that on all hand face the street so that everi hous ha both a door to the street and a back door to the garden their door have all two leav which as thei ar easili open so thei shut of their own accord and there be no properti among them everi man mai freeli enter into ani hous whatsoev at everi ten year end thei shift their hous by lot thei cultiv their garden with great care so that thei have both vine fruit herb and flower in them and all is so well order and so fine kept that i never saw garden anywher that were both so fruit and so beauti as their and thi humour of order their garden so well is not onli kept up by the pleasur thei find in it but also by an emul between the inhabit of the sever street who vie with each other and there is inde noth belong to the whole town that is both more us and more pleasant so that he who found the town seem to have taken care of noth more than of their garden for thei sai the whole scheme of the town wa design at first by utopu but he left all that belong to the ornament and improv of it to be ad by those that should come after him that be too much for on man to bring to perfect their record that contain the histori of their town and state ar preserv with an exact care and run backward seventeen hundr and sixti year from these it appear that their hous were at first low and mean like cottag made of ani sort of timber and were built with mud wall and thatch with straw but now their hous ar three storei high the front of them ar face either with stone plaster or brick and between the face of their wall thei throw in their rubbish their roof ar flat and on them thei lai a sort of plaster which cost veri littl and yet is so temper that it is not apt to take fire and yet resist the weather more than lead thei have great quantiti of glass among them with which thei glaze their window thei us also in their window a thin linen cloth that is so oil or gum that it both keep out the wind and give free admiss to the light of their magistr thirti famili choos everi year a magistr who wa ancient call the syphogr but is now call the philarch and over everi ten syphogr with the famili subject to them there is anoth magistr who wa ancient call the tranibor but of late the archphilarch all the syphogr who ar in number two hundr choos the princ out of a list of four who ar name by the peopl of the four divis of the citi but thei take an oath befor thei proce to an elect that thei will choos him whom thei think most fit for the offic thei give him their voic secretli so that it is not known for whom everi on give hi suffrag the princ is for life unless he is remov upon suspicion of some design to enslav the peopl the tranibor ar new chosen everi year but yet thei ar for the most part continu all their other magistr ar onli annual the tranibor meet everi third dai and often if necessari and consult with the princ either concern the affair of the state in gener or such privat differ as mai aris sometim among the peopl though that fall out but seldom there ar alwai two syphogr call into the council chamber and these ar chang everi dai it is a fundament rule of their govern that no conclus can be made in anyth that relat to the public till it ha been first debat three sever dai in their council it is death for ani to meet and consult concern the state unless it be either in their ordinari council or in the assembl of the whole bodi of the peopl these thing have been so provid among them that the princ and the tranibor mai not conspir togeth to chang the govern and enslav the peopl and therefor when anyth of great import is set on foot it is sent to the syphogr who after thei have commun it to the famili that belong to their divis and have consid it among themselv make report to the senat and upon great occas the matter is refer to the council of the whole island on rule observ in their council is never to debat a thing on the same dai in which it is first propos for that is alwai refer to the next meet that so men mai not rashli and in the heat of discours engag themselv too soon which might bia them so much that instead of consult the good of the public thei might rather studi to support their first opinion and by a pervers and preposter sort of shame hazard their countri rather than endang their own reput or ventur the be suspect to have want foresight in the expedi that thei at first propos and therefor to prevent thi thei take care that thei mai rather be deliber than sudden in their motion of their trade and manner of life agricultur is that which is so univers understood among them that no person either man or woman is ignor of it thei ar instruct in it from their childhood partli by what thei learn at school and partli by practic thei be led out often into the field about the town where thei not onli see other at work but ar likewis exercis in it themselv besid agricultur which is so common to them all everi man ha some peculiar trade to which he appli himself such as the manufactur of wool or flax masonri smith work or carpent work for there is no sort of trade that is in great esteem among them throughout the island thei wear the same sort of cloth without ani other distinct except what is necessari to distinguish the two sex and the marri and unmarri the fashion never alter and as it is neither disagre nor uneasi so it is suit to the climat and calcul both for their summer and winter everi famili make their own cloth but all among them women as well as men learn on or other of the trade formerli mention women for the most part deal in wool and flax which suit best with their weak leav the ruder trade to the men the same trade gener pass down from father to son inclin often follow descent but if ani man geniu li anoth wai he is by adopt translat into a famili that deal in the trade to which he is inclin and when that is to be done care is taken not onli by hi father but by the magistr that he mai be put to a discreet and good man and if after a person ha learn on trade he desir to acquir anoth that is also allow and is manag in the same manner as the former when he ha learn both he follow that which he like best unless the public ha more occas for the other the chief and almost the onli busi of the syphogr is to take care that no man mai live idl but that everi on mai follow hi trade dilig yet thei do not wear themselv out with perpetu toil from morn to night as if thei were beast of burden which as it is inde a heavi slaveri so it is everywher the common cours of life amongst all mechan except the utopian but thei divid the dai and night into twentyfour hour appoint six of these for work three of which ar befor dinner and three after thei then sup and at eight oclock count from noon go to bed and sleep eight hour the rest of their time besid that taken up in work eat and sleep is left to everi man discret yet thei ar not to abus that interv to luxuri and idl but must emploi it in some proper exercis accord to their variou inclin which is for the most part read it is ordinari to have public lectur everi morn befor daybreak at which none ar oblig to appear but those who ar mark out for literatur yet a great mani both men and women of all rank go to hear lectur of on sort or other accord to their inclin but if other that ar not made for contempl choos rather to emploi themselv at that time in their trade as mani of them do thei ar not hinder but ar rather commend as men that take care to serv their countri after supper thei spend an hour in some divers in summer in their garden and in winter in the hall where thei eat where thei entertain each other either with music or discours thei do not so much as know dice or ani such foolish and mischiev game thei have howev two sort of game not unlik our chess the on is between sever number in which on number as it were consum anoth the other resembl a battl between the virtu and the vice in which the enmiti in the vice among themselv and their agreement against virtu is not unpleasantli repres togeth with the special opposit between the particular virtu and vice as also the method by which vice either openli assault or secretli undermin virtu and virtu on the other hand resist it but the time appoint for labour is to be narrowli examin otherwis you mai imagin that sinc there ar onli six hour appoint for work thei mai fall under a scarciti of necessari provis but it is so far from be true that thi time is not suffici for suppli them with plenti of all thing either necessari or conveni that it is rather too much and thi you will easili apprehend if you consid how great a part of all other nation is quit idl first women gener do littl who ar the half of mankind and if some few women ar dilig their husband ar idl then consid the great compani of idl priest and of those that ar call religi men add to these all rich men chiefli those that have estat in land who ar call noblemen and gentlemen togeth with their famili made up of idl person that ar kept more for show than us add to these all those strong and lusti beggar that go about pretend some diseas in excus for their beg and upon the whole account you will find that the number of those by whose labour mankind is suppli is much less than you perhap imagin then consid how few of those that work ar emploi in labour that ar of real servic for we who measur all thing by monei give rise to mani trade that ar both vain and superflu and serv onli to support riot and luxuri for if those who work were emploi onli in such thing as the conveni of life requir there would be such an abund of them that the price of them would so sink that tradesmen could not be maintain by their gain if all those who labour about useless thing were set to more profit employ and if all thei that languish out their live in sloth and idl everi on of whom consum as much as ani two of the men that ar at work were forc to labour you mai easili imagin that a small proport of time would serv for do all that is either necessari profit or pleasant to mankind especi while pleasur is kept within it due bound thi appear veri plainli in utopia for there in a great citi and in all the territori that li round it you can scarc find five hundr either men or women by their ag and strength capabl of labour that ar not engag in it even the syphogr though excus by the law yet do not excus themselv but work that by their exampl thei mai excit the industri of the rest of the peopl the like exempt is allow to those who be recommend to the peopl by the priest ar by the secret suffrag of the syphogr privileg from labour that thei mai appli themselv wholli to studi and if ani of these fall short of those hope that thei seem at first to give thei ar oblig to return to work and sometim a mechan that so emploi hi leisur hour as to make a consider advanc in learn is eas from be a tradesman and rank among their learn men out of these thei choos their ambassador their priest their tranibor and the princ himself ancient call their barzen but is call of late their ademu and thu from the great number among them that ar neither suffer to be idl nor to be emploi in ani fruitless labour you mai easili make the estim how much mai be done in those few hour in which thei ar oblig to labour but besid all that ha been alreadi said it is to be consid that the need art among them ar manag with less labour than anywher els the build or the repair of hous among us emploi mani hand becaus often a thriftless heir suffer a hous that hi father built to fall into decai so that hi successor must at a great cost repair that which he might have kept up with a small charg it frequent happen that the same hous which on person built at a vast expens is neglect by anoth who think he ha a more delic sens of the beauti of architectur and he suffer it to fall to ruin build anoth at no less charg but among the utopian all thing ar so regul that men veri seldom build upon a new piec of ground and ar not onli veri quick in repair their hous but show their foresight in prevent their decai so that their build ar preserv veri long with but veri littl labour and thu the builder to whom that care belong ar often without employ except the hew of timber and the squar of stone that the materi mai be in readi for rais a build veri suddenli when there is ani occas for it as to their cloth observ how littl work is spent in them while thei ar at labour thei ar cloth with leather and skin cut carelessli about them which will last seven year and when thei appear in public thei put on an upper garment which hide the other and these ar all of on colour and that is the natur colour of the wool as thei need less woollen cloth than is us anywher els so that which thei make us of is much less costli thei us linen cloth more but that is prepar with less labour and thei valu cloth onli by the white of the linen or the clean of the wool without much regard to the fine of the thread while in other place four or five upper garment of woollen cloth of differ colour and as mani vest of silk will scarc serv on man and while those that ar nicer think ten too few everi man there is content with on which veri often serv him two year nor is there anyth that can tempt a man to desir more for if he had them he would neither be the warmer nor would he make on jot the better appear for it and thu sinc thei ar all emploi in some us labour and sinc thei content themselv with fewer thing it fall out that there is a great abund of all thing among them so that it frequent happen that for want of other work vast number ar sent out to mend the highwai but when no public undertak is to be perform the hour of work ar lessen the magistr never engag the peopl in unnecessari labour sinc the chief end of the constitut is to regul labour by the necess of the public and to allow the peopl as much time as is necessari for the improv of their mind in which thei think the happi of life consist of their traffic but it is now time to explain to you the mutual intercours of thi peopl their commerc and the rule by which all thing ar distribut among them as their citi ar compos of famili so their famili ar made up of those that ar nearli relat to on anoth their women when thei grow up ar marri out but all the male both children and grandchildren live still in the same hous in great obedi to their common parent unless ag ha weaken hi understand and in that case he that is next to him in ag come in hi room but lest ani citi should becom either too great or by ani accid be dispeopl provis is made that none of their citi mai contain abov six thousand famili besid those of the countri around it no famili mai have less than ten and more than sixteen person in it but there can be no determin number for the children under ag thi rule is easili observ by remov some of the children of a more fruit coupl to ani other famili that doe not abound so much in them by the same rule thei suppli citi that do not increas so fast from other that breed faster and if there is ani increas over the whole island then thei draw out a number of their citizen out of the sever town and send them over to the neighbour contin where if thei find that the inhabit have more soil than thei can well cultiv thei fix a coloni take the inhabit into their societi if thei ar will to live with them and where thei do that of their own accord thei quickli enter into their method of life and conform to their rule and thi prove a happi to both nation for accord to their constitut such care is taken of the soil that it becom fruit enough for both though it might be otherwis too narrow and barren for ani on of them but if the nativ refus to conform themselv to their law thei drive them out of those bound which thei mark out for themselv and us forc if thei resist for thei account it a veri just caus of war for a nation to hinder other from possess a part of that soil of which thei make no us but which is suffer to lie idl and uncultiv sinc everi man ha by the law of natur a right to such a wast portion of the earth as is necessari for hi subsist if an accid ha so lessen the number of the inhabit of ani of their town that it cannot be made up from the other town of the island without diminish them too much which is said to have fallen out but twice sinc thei were first a peopl when great number were carri off by the plagu the loss is then suppli by recal as mani as ar want from their coloni for thei will abandon these rather than suffer the town in the island to sink too low but to return to their manner of live in societi the oldest man of everi famili as ha been alreadi said is it governor wive serv their husband and children their parent and alwai the younger serv the elder everi citi is divid into four equal part and in the middl of each there is a marketplac what is brought thither and manufactur by the sever famili is carri from thenc to hous appoint for that purpos in which all thing of a sort ar laid by themselv and thither everi father goe and take whatsoev he or hi famili stand in need of without either pai for it or leav anyth in exchang there is no reason for give a denial to ani person sinc there is such plenti of everyth among them and there is no danger of a man ask for more than he need thei have no induc to do thi sinc thei ar sure thei shall alwai be suppli it is the fear of want that make ani of the whole race of anim either greedi or raven but besid fear there is in man a pride that make him fanci it a particular glori to excel other in pomp and excess but by the law of the utopian there is no room for thi near these market there ar other for all sort of provis where there ar not onli herb fruit and bread but also fish fowl and cattl there ar also without their town place appoint near some run water for kill their beast and for wash awai their filth which is done by their slave for thei suffer none of their citizen to kill their cattl becaus thei think that piti and goodnatur which ar among the best of those affect that ar born with us ar much impair by the butcher of anim nor do thei suffer anyth that is foul or unclean to be brought within their town lest the air should be infect by illsmel which might prejudic their health in everi street there ar great hall that lie at an equal distanc from each other distinguish by particular name the syphogr dwell in those that ar set over thirti famili fifteen ly on on side of it and as mani on the other in these hall thei all meet and have their repast the steward of everi on of them come to the marketplac at an appoint hour and accord to the number of those that belong to the hall thei carri home provis but thei take more care of their sick than of ani other these ar lodg and provid for in public hospit thei have belong to everi town four hospit that ar built without their wall and ar so larg that thei mai pass for littl town by thi mean if thei had ever such a number of sick person thei could lodg them conveni and at such a distanc that such of them as ar sick of infecti diseas mai be kept so far from the rest that there can be no danger of contagion the hospit ar furnish and store with all thing that ar conveni for the eas and recoveri of the sick and those that ar put in them ar look after with such tender and watch care and ar so constantli attend by their skil physician that as none is sent to them against their will so there is scarc on in a whole town that if he should fall ill would not choos rather to go thither than lie sick at home after the steward of the hospit ha taken for the sick whatsoev the physician prescrib then the best thing that ar left in the market ar distribut equal among the hall in proport to their number onli in the first place thei serv the princ the chief priest the tranibor the ambassador and stranger if there ar ani which inde fall out but seldom and for whom there ar hous well furnish particularli appoint for their recept when thei come among them at the hour of dinner and supper the whole syphogranti be call togeth by sound of trumpet thei meet and eat togeth except onli such as ar in the hospit or lie sick at home yet after the hall ar serv no man is hinder to carri provis home from the marketplac for thei know that none doe that but for some good reason for though ani that will mai eat at home yet none doe it willingli sinc it is both ridicul and foolish for ani to give themselv the troubl to make readi an ill dinner at home when there is a much more plenti on made readi for him so near hand all the uneasi and sordid servic about these hall ar perform by their slave but the dress and cook their meat and the order their tabl belong onli to the women all those of everi famili take it by turn thei sit at three or more tabl accord to their number the men sit toward the wall and the women sit on the other side that if ani of them should be taken suddenli ill which is no uncommon case amongst women with child she mai without disturb the rest rise and go to the nurs room who ar there with the suck children where there is alwai clean water at hand and cradl in which thei mai lai the young children if there is occas for it and a fire that thei mai shift and dress them befor it everi child is nurs by it own mother if death or sick doe not interven and in that case the syphogr wive find out a nurs quickli which is no hard matter for ani on that can do it offer herself cheerfulli for as thei ar much inclin to that piec of merci so the child whom thei nurs consid the nurs as it mother all the children under five year old sit among the nurs the rest of the younger sort of both sex till thei ar fit for marriag either serv those that sit at tabl or if thei ar not strong enough for that stand by them in great silenc and eat what is given them nor have thei ani other formal of dine in the middl of the first tabl which stand across the upper end of the hall sit the syphogr and hi wife for that is the chief and most conspicu place next to him sit two of the most ancient for there go alwai four to a mess if there is a templ within the syphogranti the priest and hi wife sit with the syphogr abov all the rest next them there is a mixtur of old and young who ar so place that as the young ar set near other so thei ar mix with the more ancient which thei sai wa appoint on thi account that the graviti of the old peopl and the rever that is due to them might restrain the younger from all indec word and gestur dish ar not serv up to the whole tabl at first but the best ar first set befor the old whose seat ar distinguish from the young and after them all the rest ar serv alik the old men distribut to the younger ani curiou meat that happen to be set befor them if there is not such an abund of them that the whole compani mai be serv alik thu old men ar honour with a particular respect yet all the rest fare as well as thei both dinner and supper ar begun with some lectur of moral that is read to them but it is so short that it is not tediou nor uneasi to them to hear it from henc the old men take occas to entertain those about them with some us and pleasant enlarg but thei do not engross the whole discours so to themselv dure their meal that the younger mai not put in for a share on the contrari thei engag them to talk that so thei mai in that free wai of convers find out the forc of everi on spirit and observ hi temper thei despatch their dinner quickli but sit long at supper becaus thei go to work after the on and ar to sleep after the other dure which thei think the stomach carri on the concoct more vigor thei never sup without music and there is alwai fruit serv up after meat while thei ar at tabl some burn perfum and sprinkl about fragrant ointment and sweet watersin short thei want noth that mai cheer up their spirit thei give themselv a larg allow that wai and indulg themselv in all such pleasur as ar attend with no inconveni thu do those that ar in the town live togeth but in the countri where thei live at a great distanc everi on eat at home and no famili want ani necessari sort of provis for it is from them that provis ar sent unto those that live in the town of the travel of the utopian if ani man ha a mind to visit hi friend that live in some other town or desir to travel and see the rest of the countri he obtain leav veri easili from the syphogr and tranibor when there is no particular occas for him at home such as travel carri with them a passport from the princ which both certifi the licenc that is grant for travel and limit the time of their return thei ar furnish with a waggon and a slave who drive the oxen and look after them but unless there ar women in the compani the waggon is sent back at the end of the journei as a needless encumbr while thei ar on the road thei carri no provis with them yet thei want for noth but ar everywher treat as if thei were at home if thei stai in ani place longer than a night everi on follow hi proper occup and is veri well us by those of hi own trade but if ani man goe out of the citi to which he belong without leav and is found rambl without a passport he is sever treat he is punish as a fugit and sent home disgracefulli and if he fall again into the like fault is condemn to slaveri if ani man ha a mind to travel onli over the precinct of hi own citi he mai freeli do it with hi father permiss and hi wife consent but when he come into ani of the countri hous if he expect to be entertain by them he must labour with them and conform to their rule and if he doe thi he mai freeli go over the whole precinct be then as us to the citi to which he belong as if he were still within it thu you see that there ar no idl person among them nor pretenc of excus ani from labour there ar no tavern no alehous nor stew among them nor ani other occas of corrupt each other of get into corner or form themselv into parti all men live in full view so that all ar oblig both to perform their ordinari task and to emploi themselv well in their spare hour and it is certain that a peopl thu order must live in great abund of all thing and these be equal distribut among them no man can want or be oblig to beg in their great council at amaurot to which there ar three sent from everi town onc a year thei examin what town abound in provis and what ar under ani scarciti that so the on mai be furnish from the other and thi is done freeli without ani sort of exchang for accord to their plenti or scarciti thei suppli or ar suppli from on anoth so that inde the whole island is as it were on famili when thei have thu taken care of their whole countri and laid up store for two year which thei do to prevent the ill consequ of an unfavour season thei order an export of the overplu both of corn honei wool flax wood wax tallow leather and cattl which thei send out commonli in great quantiti to other nation thei order a seventh part of all these good to be freeli given to the poor of the countri to which thei send them and sell the rest at moder rate and by thi exchang thei not onli bring back those few thing that thei need at home for inde thei scarc need anyth but iron but likewis a great deal of gold and silver and by their drive thi trade so long it is not to be imagin how vast a treasur thei have got among them so that now thei do not much care whether thei sell off their merchandis for monei in hand or upon trust a great part of their treasur is now in bond but in all their contract no privat man stand bound but the write run in the name of the town and the town that ow them monei rais it from those privat hand that ow it to them lai it up in their public chamber or enjoi the profit of it till the utopian call for it and thei choos rather to let the greatest part of it lie in their hand who make advantag by it than to call for it themselv but if thei see that ani of their other neighbour stand more in need of it then thei call it in and lend it to them whenev thei ar engag in war which is the onli occas in which their treasur can be usefulli emploi thei make us of it themselv in great extrem or sudden accid thei emploi it in hire foreign troop whom thei more willingli expos to danger than their own peopl thei give them great pai know well that thi will work even on their enemi that it will engag them either to betrai their own side or at least to desert it and that it is the best mean of rais mutual jealousi among them for thi end thei have an incred treasur but thei do not keep it as a treasur but in such a manner as i am almost afraid to tell lest you think it so extravag as to be hardli credibl thi i have the more reason to apprehend becaus if i had not seen it myself i could not have been easili persuad to have believ it upon ani man report it is certain that all thing appear incred to us in proport as thei differ from known custom but on who can judg aright will not wonder to find that sinc their constitut differ so much from our their valu of gold and silver should be measur by a veri differ standard for sinc thei have no us for monei among themselv but keep it as a provis against event which seldom happen and between which there ar gener long interven interv thei valu it no farther than it deservesthat is in proport to it us so that it is plain thei must prefer iron either to gold or silver for men can no more live without iron than without fire or water but natur ha mark out no us for the other metal so essenti as not easili to be dispens with the folli of men ha enhanc the valu of gold and silver becaus of their scarciti wherea on the contrari it is their opinion that natur as an indulg parent ha freeli given us all the best thing in great abund such as water and earth but ha laid up and hid from us the thing that ar vain and useless if these metal were laid up in ani tower in the kingdom it would rais a jealousi of the princ and senat and give birth to that foolish mistrust into which the peopl ar apt to falla jealousi of their intend to sacrific the interest of the public to their own privat advantag if thei should work it into vessel or ani sort of plate thei fear that the peopl might grow too fond of it and so be unwil to let the plate be run down if a war made it necessari to emploi it in pai their soldier to prevent all these inconveni thei have fallen upon an expedi which as it agre with their other polici so is it veri differ from our and will scarc gain belief among us who valu gold so much and lai it up so carefulli thei eat and drink out of vessel of earth or glass which make an agreeabl appear though form of brittl materi while thei make their chamberpot and close stool of gold and silver and that not onli in their public hall but in their privat hous of the same metal thei likewis make chain and fetter for their slave to some of which as a badg of infami thei hang an ear of gold and make other wear a chain or a coronet of the same metal and thu thei take care by all possibl mean to render gold and silver of no esteem and from henc it is that while other nation part with their gold and silver as unwillingli as if on tore out their bowel those of utopia would look on their give in all thei possess of those metal when there were ani us for them but as the part with a trifl or as we would esteem the loss of a penni thei find pearl on their coast and diamond and carbuncl on their rock thei do not look after them but if thei find them by chanc thei polish them and with them thei adorn their children who ar delight with them and glori in them dure their childhood but when thei grow to year and see that none but children us such baubl thei of their own accord without be bid by their parent lai them asid and would be as much asham to us them afterward as children among us when thei come to year ar of their puppet and other toi i never saw a clearer instanc of the opposit impress that differ custom make on peopl than i observ in the ambassador of the anemolian who came to amaurot when i wa there as thei came to treat of affair of great consequ the deputi from sever town met togeth to wait for their come the ambassador of the nation that lie near utopia know their custom and that fine cloth ar in no esteem among them that silk is despis and gold is a badg of infami us to come veri modestli cloth but the anemolian ly more remot and have had littl commerc with them understand that thei were coars cloth and all in the same manner took it for grant that thei had none of those fine thing among them of which thei made no us and thei be a vainglori rather than a wise peopl resolv to set themselv out with so much pomp that thei should look like god and strike the ey of the poor utopian with their splendour thu three ambassador made their entri with a hundr attend all clad in garment of differ colour and the greater part in silk the ambassador themselv who were of the nobil of their countri were in clothofgold and adorn with massi chain ear and ring of gold their cap were cover with bracelet set full of pearl and other gemsin a word thei were set out with all those thing that among the utopian were either the badg of slaveri the mark of infami or the playth of children it wa not unpleas to see on the on side how thei look big when thei compar their rich habit with the plain cloth of the utopian who were come out in great number to see them make their entri and on the other to observ how much thei were mistaken in the impress which thei hope thi pomp would have made on them it appear so ridicul a show to all that had never stir out of their countri and had not seen the custom of other nation that though thei paid some rever to those that were the most meanli clad as if thei had been the ambassador yet when thei saw the ambassador themselv so full of gold and chain thei look upon them as slave and forbor to treat them with rever you might have seen the children who were grown big enough to despis their playth and who had thrown awai their jewel call to their mother push them gentli and cry out see that great fool that wear pearl and gem as if he were yet a child while their mother veri innoc repli hold your peac thi i believ is on of the ambassador fool other censur the fashion of their chain and observ that thei were of no us for thei were too slight to bind their slave who could easili break them and besid hung so loos about them that thei thought it easi to throw their awai and so get from them but after the ambassador had stai a dai among them and saw so vast a quantiti of gold in their hous which wa as much despis by them as it wa esteem in other nation and beheld more gold and silver in the chain and fetter of on slave than all their ornament amount to their plume fell and thei were asham of all that glori for which thei had form valu themselv and accordingli laid it asidea resolut that thei immedi took when on their engag in some free discours with the utopian thei discov their sens of such thing and their other custom the utopian wonder how ani man should be so much taken with the glare doubt lustr of a jewel or a stone that can look up to a star or to the sun himself or how ani should valu himself becaus hi cloth is made of a finer thread for how fine soever that thread mai be it wa onc no better than the fleec of a sheep and that sheep wa a sheep still for all it wear it thei wonder much to hear that gold which in itself is so useless a thing should be everywher so much esteem that even man for whom it wa made and by whom it ha it valu should yet be thought of less valu than thi metal that a man of lead who ha no more sens than a log of wood and is as bad as he is foolish should have mani wise and good men to serv him onli becaus he ha a great heap of that metal and that if it should happen that by some accid or trick of law which sometim produc as great chang as chanc itself all thi wealth should pass from the master to the meanest varlet of hi whole famili he himself would veri soon becom on of hi servant as if he were a thing that belong to hi wealth and so were bound to follow it fortun but thei much more admir and detest the folli of those who when thei see a rich man though thei neither ow him anyth nor ar in ani sort depend on hi bounti yet mere becaus he is rich give him littl less than divin honour even though thei know him to be so covet and basemind that notwithstand all hi wealth he will not part with on farth of it to them as long as he live these and such like notion have that peopl imbib partli from their educ be bred in a countri whose custom and law ar opposit to all such foolish maxim and partli from their learn and studiesfor though there ar but few in ani town that ar so wholli excus from labour as to give themselv entir up to their studi these be onli such person as discov from their childhood an extraordinari capac and disposit for letter yet their children and a great part of the nation both men and women ar taught to spend those hour in which thei ar not oblig to work in read and thi thei do through the whole progress of life thei have all their learn in their own tongu which is both a copiou and pleasant languag and in which a man can fulli express hi mind it run over a great tract of mani countri but it is not equal pure in all place thei had never so much as heard of the name of ani of those philosoph that ar so famou in these part of the world befor we went among them and yet thei had made the same discoveri as the greek both in music logic arithmet and geometri but as thei ar almost in everyth equal to the ancient philosoph so thei far exce our modern logician for thei have never yet fallen upon the barbar niceti that our youth ar forc to learn in those trifl logic school that ar among us thei ar so far from mind chimera and fantast imag made in the mind that none of them could comprehend what we meant when we talk to them of a man in the abstract as common to all men in particular so that though we spoke of him as a thing that we could point at with our finger yet none of them could perceiv him and yet distinct from everi on as if he were some monstrou colossu or giant yet for all thi ignor of these empti notion thei knew astronomi and were perfectli acquaint with the motion of the heavenli bodi and have mani instrument well contriv and divid by which thei veri accur comput the cours and posit of the sun moon and star but for the cheat of divin by the star by their opposit or conjunct it ha not so much as enter into their thought thei have a particular sagac found upon much observ in judg of the weather by which thei know when thei mai look for rain wind or other alter in the air but as to the philosophi of these thing the caus of the salt of the sea of it eb and flow and of the origin and natur both of the heaven and the earth thei disput of them partli as our ancient philosoph have done and partli upon some new hypothesi in which as thei differ from them so thei do not in all thing agre among themselv as to moral philosophi thei have the same disput among them as we have here thei examin what ar properli good both for the bodi and the mind and whether ani outward thing can be call truli good or if that term belong onli to the endow of the soul thei inquir likewis into the natur of virtu and pleasur but their chief disput is concern the happi of a man and wherein it consistswheth in some on thing or in a great mani thei seem inde more inclin to that opinion that place if not the whole yet the chief part of a man happi in pleasur and what mai seem more strang thei make us of argument even from religion notwithstand it sever and rough for the support of that opinion so indulg to pleasur for thei never disput concern happi without fetch some argument from the principl of religion as well as from natur reason sinc without the former thei reckon that all our inquiri after happi must be but conjectur and defect these ar their religi principlesthat the soul of man is immort and that god of hi good ha design that it should be happi and that he ha therefor appoint reward for good and virtuou action and punish for vice to be distribut after thi life though these principl of religion ar convei down among them by tradit thei think that even reason itself determin a man to believ and acknowledg them and freeli confess that if these were taken awai no man would be so insens as not to seek after pleasur by all possibl mean law or unlaw us onli thi cautionthat a lesser pleasur might not stand in the wai of a greater and that no pleasur ought to be pursu that should draw a great deal of pain after it for thei think it the maddest thing in the world to pursu virtu that is a sour and difficult thing and not onli to renounc the pleasur of life but willingli to undergo much pain and troubl if a man ha no prospect of a reward and what reward can there be for on that ha pass hi whole life not onli without pleasur but in pain if there is noth to be expect after death yet thei do not place happi in all sort of pleasur but onli in those that in themselv ar good and honest there is a parti among them who place happi in bare virtu other think that our natur ar conduct by virtu to happi as that which is the chief good of man thei defin virtu thusthat it is a live accord to natur and think that we ar made by god for that end thei believ that a man then follow the dictat of natur when he pursu or avoid thing accord to the direct of reason thei sai that the first dictat of reason is the kindl in us a love and rever for the divin majesti to whom we ow both all that we have and all that we can ever hope for in the next place reason direct us to keep our mind as free from passion and as cheer as we can and that we should consid ourselv as bound by the ti of goodnatur and human to us our utmost endeavour to help forward the happi of all other person for there never wa ani man such a moros and sever pursuer of virtu such an enemi to pleasur that though he set hard rule for men to undergo much pain mani watch and other rigor yet did not at the same time advis them to do all thei could in order to reliev and eas the miser and who did not repres gentl and goodnatur as amiabl disposit and from thenc thei infer that if a man ought to advanc the welfar and comfort of the rest of mankind there be no virtu more proper and peculiar to our natur than to eas the miseri of other to free from troubl and anxieti in furnish them with the comfort of life in which pleasur consist natur much more vigor lead them to do all thi for himself a life of pleasur is either a real evil and in that case we ought not to assist other in their pursuit of it but on the contrari to keep them from it all we can as from that which is most hurt and deadli or if it is a good thing so that we not onli mai but ought to help other to it why then ought not a man to begin with himself sinc no man can be more bound to look after the good of anoth than after hi own for natur cannot direct us to be good and kind to other and yet at the same time to be unmerci and cruel to ourselv thu as thei defin virtu to be live accord to natur so thei imagin that natur prompt all peopl on to seek after pleasur as the end of all thei do thei also observ that in order to our support the pleasur of life natur inclin us to enter into societi for there is no man so much rais abov the rest of mankind as to be the onli favourit of natur who on the contrari seem to have place on a level all those that belong to the same speci upon thi thei infer that no man ought to seek hi own conveni so eagerli as to prejudic other and therefor thei think that not onli all agreement between privat person ought to be observ but likewis that all those law ought to be kept which either a good princ ha publish in due form or to which a peopl that is neither oppress with tyranni nor circumv by fraud ha consent for distribut those conveni of life which afford us all our pleasur thei think it is an evid of true wisdom for a man to pursu hi own advantag as far as the law allow it thei account it pieti to prefer the public good to on privat concern but thei think it unjust for a man to seek for pleasur by snatch anoth man pleasur from him and on the contrari thei think it a sign of a gentl and good soul for a man to dispens with hi own advantag for the good of other and that by thi mean a good man find as much pleasur on wai as he part with anoth for as he mai expect the like from other when he mai come to need it so if that should fail him yet the sens of a good action and the reflect that he make on the love and gratitud of those whom he ha so oblig give the mind more pleasur than the bodi could have found in that from which it had restrain itself thei ar also persuad that god will make up the loss of those small pleasur with a vast and endless joi of which religion easili convinc a good soul thu upon an inquiri into the whole matter thei reckon that all our action and even all our virtu termin in pleasur as in our chief end and greatest happi and thei call everi motion or state either of bodi or mind in which natur teach us to delight a pleasur thu thei cautious limit pleasur onli to those appetit to which natur lead us for thei sai that natur lead us onli to those delight to which reason as well as sens carri us and by which we neither injur ani other person nor lose the possess of greater pleasur and of such as draw no troubl after them but thei look upon those delight which men by a foolish though common mistak call pleasur as if thei could chang as easili the natur of thing as the us of word as thing that greatli obstruct their real happi instead of advanc it becaus thei so entir possess the mind of those that ar onc captiv by them with a fals notion of pleasur that there is no room left for pleasur of a truer or purer kind there ar mani thing that in themselv have noth that is truli delight on the contrari thei have a good deal of bitter in them and yet from our pervers appetit after forbidden object ar not onli rank among the pleasur but ar made even the greatest design of life among those who pursu these sophist pleasur thei reckon such as i mention befor who think themselv realli the better for have fine cloth in which thei think thei ar doubli mistaken both in the opinion thei have of their cloth and in that thei have of themselv for if you consid the us of cloth why should a fine thread be thought better than a coars on and yet these men as if thei had some real advantag beyond other and did not ow them wholli to their mistak look big seem to fanci themselv to be more valuabl and imagin that a respect is due to them for the sake of a rich garment to which thei would not have pretend if thei had been more meanli cloth and even resent it as an affront if that respect is not paid them it is also a great folli to be taken with outward mark of respect which signifi noth for what true or real pleasur can on man find in anoth stand bare or make leg to him will the bend anoth man knee give eas to your and will the head be bare cure the mad of your and yet it is wonder to see how thi fals notion of pleasur bewitch mani who delight themselv with the fanci of their nobil and ar pleas with thi conceitthat thei ar descend from ancestor who have been held for some success rich and who have had great possess for thi is all that make nobil at present yet thei do not think themselv a whit the less nobl though their immedi parent have left none of thi wealth to them or though thei themselv have squander it awai the utopian have no better opinion of those who ar much taken with gem and preciou stone and who account it a degre of happi next to a divin on if thei can purchas on that is veri extraordinari especi if it be of that sort of stone that is then in greatest request for the same sort is not at all time univers of the same valu nor will men bui it unless it be dismount and taken out of the gold the jewel is then made to give good secur and requir solemnli to swear that the stone is true that by such an exact caution a fals on might not be bought instead of a true though if you were to examin it your ey could find no differ between the counterfeit and that which is true so that thei ar all on to you as much as if you were blind or can it be thought that thei who heap up a useless mass of wealth not for ani us that it is to bring them but mere to pleas themselv with the contempl of it enjoi ani true pleasur in it the delight thei find is onli a fals shadow of joi those ar no better whose error is somewhat differ from the former and who hide it out of their fear of lose it for what other name can fit the hide it in the earth or rather the restor it to it again it be thu cut off from be us either to it owner or to the rest of mankind and yet the owner have hid it carefulli is glad becaus he think he is now sure of it if it should be stole the owner though he might live perhap ten year after the theft of which he knew noth would find no differ between hi have or lose it for both wai it wa equal useless to him among those foolish pursuer of pleasur thei reckon all that delight in hunt in fowl or game of whose mad thei have onli heard for thei have no such thing among them but thei have ask us what sort of pleasur is it that men can find in throw the dice for if there were ani pleasur in it thei think the do it so often should give on a surfeit of it and what pleasur can on find in hear the bark and howl of dog which seem rather odiou than pleasant sound nor can thei comprehend the pleasur of see dog run after a hare more than of see on dog run after anoth for if the see them run is that which give the pleasur you have the same entertain to the ey on both these occas sinc that is the same in both case but if the pleasur li in see the hare kill and torn by the dog thi ought rather to stir piti that a weak harmless and fear hare should be devour by strong fierc and cruel dog therefor all thi busi of hunt is among the utopian turn over to their butcher and those as ha been alreadi said ar all slave and thei look on hunt as on of the basest part of a butcher work for thei account it both more profit and more decent to kill those beast that ar more necessari and us to mankind wherea the kill and tear of so small and miser an anim can onli attract the huntsman with a fals show of pleasur from which he can reap but small advantag thei look on the desir of the bloodsh even of beast as a mark of a mind that is alreadi corrupt with cruelti or that at least by too frequent return of so brutal a pleasur must degener into it thu though the rabbl of mankind look upon these and on innumer other thing of the same natur as pleasur the utopian on the contrari observ that there is noth in them truli pleasant conclud that thei ar not to be reckon among pleasur for though these thing mai creat some tickl in the sens which seem to be a true notion of pleasur yet thei imagin that thi doe not aris from the thing itself but from a deprav custom which mai so vitiat a man tast that bitter thing mai pass for sweet as women with child think pitch or tallow tast sweeter than honei but as a man sens when corrupt either by a diseas or some ill habit doe not chang the natur of other thing so neither can it chang the natur of pleasur thei reckon up sever sort of pleasur which thei call true on some belong to the bodi and other to the mind the pleasur of the mind lie in knowledg and in that delight which the contempl of truth carri with it to which thei add the joy reflect on a well spent life and the assur hope of a futur happi thei divid the pleasur of the bodi into two sortsth on is that which give our sens some real delight and is perform either by recruit natur and suppli those part which feed the intern heat of life by eat and drink or when natur is eas of ani surcharg that oppress it when we ar reliev from sudden pain or that which aris from satisfi the appetit which natur ha wise given to lead us to the propag of the speci there is anoth kind of pleasur that aris neither from our receiv what the bodi requir nor it be reliev when overcharg and yet by a secret unseen virtu affect the sens rais the passion and strike the mind with gener impressionsthi is the pleasur that aris from music anoth kind of bodili pleasur is that which result from an undisturb and vigor constitut of bodi when life and activ spirit seem to actuat everi part thi live health when entir free from all mixtur of pain of itself give an inward pleasur independ of all extern object of delight and though thi pleasur doe not so powerfulli affect us nor act so strongli on the sens as some of the other yet it mai be esteem as the greatest of all pleasur and almost all the utopian reckon it the foundat and basi of all the other joi of life sinc thi alon make the state of life easi and desir and when thi is want a man is realli capabl of no other pleasur thei look upon freedom from pain if it doe not rise from perfect health to be a state of stupid rather than of pleasur thi subject ha been veri narrowli canvass among them and it ha been debat whether a firm and entir health could be call a pleasur or not some have thought that there wa no pleasur but what wa excit by some sensibl motion in the bodi but thi opinion ha been long ago exclud from among them so that now thei almost univers agre that health is the greatest of all bodili pleasur and that as there is a pain in sick which is as opposit in it natur to pleasur as sick itself is to health so thei hold that health is accompani with pleasur and if ani should sai that sick is not realli pain but that it onli carri pain along with it thei look upon that as a fetch of subtleti that doe not much alter the matter it is all on in their opinion whether it be said that health is in itself a pleasur or that it beget a pleasur as fire give heat so it be grant that all those whose health is entir have a true pleasur in the enjoy of it and thei reason thuswhat is the pleasur of eat but that a man health which had been weaken doe with the assist of food drive awai hunger and so recruit itself recov it former vigour and be thu refresh it find a pleasur in that conflict and if the conflict is pleasur the victori must yet breed a greater pleasur except we fanci that it becom stupid as soon as it ha obtain that which it pursu and so neither know nor rejoic in it own welfar if it is said that health cannot be felt thei absolut deni it for what man is in health that doe not perceiv it when he is awak is there ani man that is so dull and stupid as not to acknowledg that he feel a delight in health and what is delight but anoth name for pleasur but of all pleasur thei esteem those to be most valuabl that lie in the mind the chief of which aris out of true virtu and the wit of a good conscienc thei account health the chief pleasur that belong to the bodi for thei think that the pleasur of eat and drink and all the other delight of sens ar onli so far desir as thei give or maintain health but thei ar not pleasant in themselv otherwis than as thei resist those impress that our natur infirm ar still make upon us for as a wise man desir rather to avoid diseas than to take physic and to be freed from pain rather than to find eas by remedi so it is more desir not to need thi sort of pleasur than to be oblig to indulg it if ani man imagin that there is a real happi in these enjoy he must then confess that he would be the happiest of all men if he were to lead hi life in perpetu hunger thirst and itch and by consequ in perpetu eat drink and scratch himself which ani on mai easili see would be not onli a base but a miser state of a life these ar inde the lowest of pleasur and the least pure for we can never relish them but when thei ar mix with the contrari pain the pain of hunger must give us the pleasur of eat and here the pain outbal the pleasur and as the pain is more vehement so it last much longer for as it begin befor the pleasur so it doe not ceas but with the pleasur that extinguish it and both expir togeth thei think therefor none of those pleasur ar to be valu ani further than as thei ar necessari yet thei rejoic in them and with due gratitud acknowledg the tender of the great author of natur who ha plant in us appetit by which those thing that ar necessari for our preserv ar likewis made pleasant to us for how miser a thing would life be if those daili diseas of hunger and thirst were to be carri off by such bitter drug as we must us for those diseas that return seldom upon us and thu these pleasant as well as proper gift of natur maintain the strength and the sprightli of our bodi thei also entertain themselv with the other delight let in at their ey their ear and their nostril as the pleasant relish and season of life which natur seem to have mark out peculiarli for man sinc no other sort of anim contempl the figur and beauti of the univers nor is delight with smell ani further than as thei distinguish meat by them nor do thei apprehend the concord or discord of sound yet in all pleasur whatsoev thei take care that a lesser joi doe not hinder a greater and that pleasur mai never breed pain which thei think alwai follow dishonest pleasur but thei think it mad for a man to wear out the beauti of hi face or the forc of hi natur strength to corrupt the sprightli of hi bodi by sloth and lazi or to wast it by fast that it is mad to weaken the strength of hi constitut and reject the other delight of life unless by renounc hi own satisfact he can either serv the public or promot the happi of other for which he expect a greater recompens from god so that thei look on such a cours of life as the mark of a mind that is both cruel to itself and ungrat to the author of natur as if we would not be beholden to him for hi favour and therefor reject all hi bless as on who should afflict himself for the empti shadow of virtu or for no better end than to render himself capabl of bear those misfortun which possibl will never happen thi is their notion of virtu and of pleasur thei think that no man reason can carri him to a truer idea of them unless some discoveri from heaven should inspir him with sublim notion i have not now the leisur to examin whether thei think right or wrong in thi matter nor do i judg it necessari for i have onli undertaken to give you an account of their constitut but not to defend all their principl i am sure that whatev mai be said of their notion there is not in the whole world either a better peopl or a happier govern their bodi ar vigor and live and though thei ar but of a middl statur and have neither the fruitfullest soil nor the purest air in the world yet thei fortifi themselv so well by their temper cours of life against the unhealthi of their air and by their industri thei so cultiv their soil that there is nowher to be seen a greater increas both of corn and cattl nor ar there anywher healthier men and freer from diseas for on mai there see reduc to practic not onli all the art that the husbandman emploi in manur and improv an ill soil but whole wood pluck up by the root and in other place new on plant where there were none befor their princip motiv for thi is the conveni of carriag that their timber mai be either near their town or grow on the bank of the sea or of some river so as to be float to them for it is a harder work to carri wood at ani distanc over land than corn the peopl ar industri apt to learn as well as cheer and pleasant and none can endur more labour when it is necessari but except in that case thei love their eas thei ar unweari pursuer of knowledg for when we had given them some hint of the learn and disciplin of the greek concern whom we onli instruct them for we know that there wa noth among the roman except their historian and their poet that thei would valu much it wa strang to see how eagerli thei were set on learn that languag we began to read a littl of it to them rather in complianc with their importun than out of ani hope of their reap from it ani great advantag but after a veri short trial we found thei made such progress that we saw our labour wa like to be more success than we could have expect thei learn to write their charact and to pronounc their languag so exactli had so quick an apprehens thei rememb it so faithfulli and becam so readi and correct in the us of it that it would have look like a miracl if the greater part of those whom we taught had not been men both of extraordinari capac and of a fit ag for instruct thei were for the greatest part chosen from among their learn men by their chief council though some studi it of their own accord in three year time thei becam master of the whole languag so that thei read the best of the greek author veri exactli i am inde apt to think that thei learn that languag the more easili from it have some relat to their own i believ that thei were a coloni of the greek for though their languag come nearer the persian yet thei retain mani name both for their town and magistr that ar of greek deriv i happen to carri a great mani book with me instead of merchandis when i sail my fourth voyag for i wa so far from think of soon come back that i rather thought never to have return at all and i gave them all my book among which were mani of plato and some of aristotl work i had also theophrastu on plant which to my great regret wa imperfect for have laid it carelessli by while we were at sea a monkei had seiz upon it and in mani place torn out the leav thei have no book of grammar but lascar for i did not carri theodoru with me nor have thei ani dictionari but hesichiu and dioscerid thei esteem plutarch highli and were much taken with lucian wit and with hi pleasant wai of write as for the poet thei have aristophan homer euripid and sophocl of alduss edit and for historian thucydid herodotu and herodian on of my companion thriciu apinatu happen to carri with him some of hippocratess work and galen microtechn which thei hold in great estim for though there is no nation in the world that need physic so littl as thei do yet there is not ani that honour it so much thei reckon the knowledg of it on of the pleasantest and most profit part of philosophi by which as thei search into the secret of natur so thei not onli find thi studi highli agreeabl but think that such inquiri ar veri accept to the author of natur and imagin that as he like the inventor of curiou engin amongst mankind ha expos thi great machin of the univers to the view of the onli creatur capabl of contempl it so an exact and curiou observ who admir hi workmanship is much more accept to him than on of the herd who like a beast incap of reason look on thi gloriou scene with the ey of a dull and unconcern spectat the mind of the utopian when fenc with a love for learn ar veri ingeni in discov all such art as ar necessari to carri it to perfect two thing thei ow to us the manufactur of paper and the art of print yet thei ar not so entir indebt to us for these discoveri but that a great part of the invent wa their own we show them some book print by aldu we explain to them the wai of make paper and the mysteri of print but as we had never practis these art we describ them in a crude and superfici manner thei seiz the hint we gave them and though at first thei could not arriv at perfect yet by make mani essai thei at last found out and correct all their error and conquer everi difficulti befor thi thei onli wrote on parchment on reed or on the bark of tree but now thei have establish the manufactur of paper and set up print press so that if thei had but a good number of greek author thei would be quickli suppli with mani copi of them at present though thei have no more than those i have mention yet by sever impress thei have multipli them into mani thousand if ani man wa to go among them that had some extraordinari talent or that by much travel had observ the custom of mani nation which made us to be so well receiv he would receiv a hearti welcom for thei ar veri desir to know the state of the whole world veri few go among them on the account of traffic for what can a man carri to them but iron or gold or silver which merchant desir rather to export than import to a strang countri and as for their export thei think it better to manag that themselv than to leav it to foreign for by thi mean as thei understand the state of the neighbour countri better so thei keep up the art of navig which cannot be maintain but by much practic of their slave and of their marriag thei do not make slave of prison of war except those that ar taken in battl nor of the son of their slave nor of those of other nation the slave among them ar onli such as ar condemn to that state of life for the commiss of some crime or which is more common such as their merchant find condemn to die in those part to which thei trade whom thei sometim redeem at low rate and in other place have them for noth thei ar kept at perpetu labour and ar alwai chain but with thi differ that their own nativ ar treat much wors than other thei ar consid as more proflig than the rest and sinc thei could not be restrain by the advantag of so excel an educ ar judg worthi of harder usag anoth sort of slave ar the poor of the neighbour countri who offer of their own accord to come and serv them thei treat these better and us them in all other respect as well as their own countrymen except their impos more labour upon them which is no hard task to those that have been accustom to it and if ani of these have a mind to go back to their own countri which inde fall out but seldom as thei do not forc them to stai so thei do not send them awai emptyhand i have alreadi told you with what care thei look after their sick so that noth is left undon that can contribut either to their case or health and for those who ar taken with fix and incur diseas thei us all possibl wai to cherish them and to make their live as comfort as possibl thei visit them often and take great pain to make their time pass off easili but when ani is taken with a tortur and linger pain so that there is no hope either of recoveri or eas the priest and magistr come and exhort them that sinc thei ar now unabl to go on with the busi of life ar becom a burden to themselv and to all about them and thei have realli outliv themselv thei should no longer nourish such a root distemp but choos rather to die sinc thei cannot live but in much miseri be assur that if thei thu deliv themselv from tortur or ar will that other should do it thei shall be happi after death sinc by their act thu thei lose none of the pleasur but onli the troubl of life thei think thei behav not onli reason but in a manner consist with religion and pieti becaus thei follow the advic given them by their priest who ar the expound of the will of god such as ar wrought on by these persuas either starv themselv of their own accord or take opium and by that mean die without pain but no man is forc on thi wai of end hi life and if thei cannot be persuad to it thi doe not induc them to fail in their attend and care of them but as thei believ that a voluntari death when it is chosen upon such an author is veri honour so if ani man take awai hi own life without the approb of the priest and the senat thei give him none of the honour of a decent funer but throw hi bodi into a ditch their women ar not marri befor eighteen nor their men befor twoand twenti and if ani of them run into forbidden embrac befor marriag thei ar sever punish and the privileg of marriag is deni them unless thei can obtain a special warrant from the princ such disord cast a great reproach upon the master and mistress of the famili in which thei happen for it is suppos that thei have fail in their duti the reason of punish thi so sever is becaus thei think that if thei were not strictli restrain from all vagrant appetit veri few would engag in a state in which thei ventur the quiet of their whole live by be confin to on person and ar oblig to endur all the inconveni with which it is accompani in choos their wive thei us a method that would appear to us veri absurd and ridicul but it is constantli observ among them and is account perfectli consist with wisdom befor marriag some grave matron present the bride nake whether she is a virgin or a widow to the bridegroom and after that some grave man present the bridegroom nake to the bride we inde both laugh at thi and condemn it as veri indec but thei on the other hand wonder at the folli of the men of all other nation who if thei ar but to bui a hors of a small valu ar so cautiou that thei will see everi part of him and take off both hi saddl and all hi other tackl that there mai be no secret ulcer hid under ani of them and that yet in the choic of a wife on which depend the happi or unhappi of the rest of hi life a man should ventur upon trust and onli see about a handsbreadth of the face all the rest of the bodi be cover under which mai lie hid what mai be contagi as well as loathsom all men ar not so wise as to choos a woman onli for her good qualiti and even wise men consid the bodi as that which add not a littl to the mind and it is certain there mai be some such deform cover with cloth as mai total alien a man from hi wife when it is too late to part with her if such a thing is discov after marriag a man ha no remedi but patienc thei therefor think it is reason that there should be good provis made against such mischiev fraud there wa so much the more reason for them to make a regul in thi matter becaus thei ar the onli peopl of those part that neither allow of polygami nor of divorc except in the case of adulteri or insuffer pervers for in these case the senat dissolv the marriag and grant the injur person leav to marri again but the guilti ar made infam and ar never allow the privileg of a second marriag none ar suffer to put awai their wive against their will from ani great calam that mai have fallen on their person for thei look on it as the height of cruelti and treacheri to abandon either of the marri person when thei need most the tender care of their consort and that chiefli in the case of old ag which as it carri mani diseas along with it so it is a diseas of itself but it frequent fall out that when a marri coupl do not well agre thei by mutual consent separ and find out other person with whom thei hope thei mai live more happili yet thi is not done without obtain leav of the senat which never admit of a divorc but upon a strict inquiri made both by the senat and their wive into the ground upon which it is desir and even when thei ar satisfi concern the reason of it thei go on but slowli for thei imagin that too great easi in grant leav for new marriag would veri much shake the kind of marri peopl thei punish sever those that defil the marriag bed if both parti ar marri thei ar divorc and the injur person mai marri on anoth or whom thei pleas but the adulter and the adulteress ar condemn to slaveri yet if either of the injur person cannot shake off the love of the marri person thei mai live with them still in that state but thei must follow them to that labour to which the slave ar condemn and sometim the repent of the condemn togeth with the unshaken kind of the innoc and injur person ha prevail so far with the princ that he ha taken off the sentenc but those that relaps after thei ar onc pardon ar punish with death their law doe not determin the punish for other crime but that is left to the senat to temper it accord to the circumst of the fact husband have power to correct their wive and parent to chastis their children unless the fault is so great that a public punish is thought necessari for strike terror into other for the most part slaveri is the punish even of the greatest crime for as that is no less terribl to the crimin themselv than death so thei think the preserv them in a state of servitud is more for the interest of the commonwealth than kill them sinc as their labour is a greater benefit to the public than their death could be so the sight of their miseri is a more last terror to other men than that which would be given by their death if their slave rebel and will not bear their yoke and submit to the labour that is enjoin them thei ar treat as wild beast that cannot be kept in order neither by a prison nor by their chain and ar at last put to death but those who bear their punish patient and ar so much wrought on by that pressur that li so hard on them that it appear thei ar realli more troubl for the crime thei have commit than for the miseri thei suffer ar not out of hope but that at last either the princ will by hi prerog or the peopl by their intercess restor them again to their liberti or at least veri much mitig their slaveri he that tempt a marri woman to adulteri is no less sever punish than he that commit it for thei believ that a deliber design to commit a crime is equal to the fact itself sinc it not take effect doe not make the person that miscarri in hi attempt at all the less guilti thei take great pleasur in fool and as it is thought a base and unbecom thing to us them ill so thei do not think it amiss for peopl to divert themselv with their folli and in their opinion thi is a great advantag to the fool themselv for if men were so sullen and sever as not at all to pleas themselv with their ridicul behaviour and foolish sai which is all that thei can do to recommend themselv to other it could not be expect that thei would be so well provid for nor so tenderli us as thei must otherwis be if ani man should reproach anoth for hi be misshap or imperfect in ani part of hi bodi it would not at all be thought a reflect on the person so treat but it would be account scandal in him that had upbraid anoth with what he could not help it is thought a sign of a sluggish and sordid mind not to preserv carefulli on natur beauti but it is likewis infam among them to us paint thei all see that no beauti recommend a wife so much to her husband as the probiti of her life and her obedi for as some few ar caught and held onli by beauti so all ar attract by the other excel which charm all the world as thei fright men from commit crime by punish so thei invit them to the love of virtu by public honour therefor thei erect statu to the memori of such worthi men as have deserv well of their countri and set these in their marketplac both to perpetu the remembr of their action and to be an incit to their poster to follow their exampl if ani man aspir to ani offic he is sure never to compass it thei all live easili togeth for none of the magistr ar either insol or cruel to the peopl thei affect rather to be call father and by be realli so thei well deserv the name and the peopl pai them all the mark of honour the more freeli becaus none ar exact from them the princ himself ha no distinct either of garment or of a crown but is onli distinguish by a sheaf of corn carri befor him as the high priest is also known by hi be preced by a person carri a wax light thei have but few law and such is their constitut that thei need not mani thei veri much condemn other nation whose law togeth with the commentari on them swell up to so mani volum for thei think it an unreason thing to oblig men to obei a bodi of law that ar both of such a bulk and so dark as not to be read and understood by everi on of the subject thei have no lawyer among them for thei consid them as a sort of peopl whose profess it is to disguis matter and to wrest the law and therefor thei think it is much better that everi man should plead hi own caus and trust it to the judg as in other place the client trust it to a counsellor by thi mean thei both cut off mani delai and find out truth more certainli for after the parti have laid open the merit of the caus without those artific which lawyer ar apt to suggest the judg examin the whole matter and support the simplic of such wellmean person whom otherwis crafti men would be sure to run down and thu thei avoid those evil which appear veri remark among all those nation that labour under a vast load of law everi on of them is skill in their law for as it is a veri short studi so the plainest mean of which word ar capabl is alwai the sens of their law and thei argu thu all law ar promulg for thi end that everi man mai know hi duti and therefor the plainest and most obviou sens of the word is that which ought to be put upon them sinc a more refin exposit cannot be easili comprehend and would onli serv to make the law becom useless to the greater part of mankind and especi to those who need most the direct of them for it is all on not to make a law at all or to couch it in such term that without a quick apprehens and much studi a man cannot find out the true mean of it sinc the gener of mankind ar both so dull and so much emploi in their sever trade that thei have neither the leisur nor the capac requisit for such an inquiri some of their neighbour who ar master of their own liberti have long ago by the assist of the utopian shaken off the yoke of tyranni and be much taken with those virtu which thei observ among them have come to desir that thei would send magistr to govern them some chang them everi year and other everi five year at the end of their govern thei bring them back to utopia with great express of honour and esteem and carri awai other to govern in their stead in thi thei seem to have fallen upon a veri good expedi for their own happi and safeti for sinc the good or ill condit of a nation depend so much upon their magistr thei could not have made a better choic than by pitch on men whom no advantag can bia for wealth is of no us to them sinc thei must so soon go back to their own countri and thei be stranger among them ar not engag in ani of their heat or animos and it is certain that when public judicatori ar swai either by avaric or partial affect there must follow a dissolut of justic the chief sinew of societi the utopian call those nation that come and ask magistr from them neighbour but those to whom thei have been of more particular servic friend and as all other nation ar perpetu either make leagu or break them thei never enter into an allianc with ani state thei think leagu ar useless thing and believ that if the common ti of human do not knit men togeth the faith of promis will have no great effect and thei ar the more confirm in thi by what thei see among the nation round about them who ar no strict observ of leagu and treati we know how religi thei ar observ in europ more particularli where the christian doctrin is receiv among whom thei ar sacr and inviol which is partli ow to the justic and good of the princ themselv and partli to the rever thei pai to the pope who as thei ar the most religi observ of their own promis so thei exhort all other princ to perform their and when fainter method do not prevail thei compel them to it by the sever of the pastor censur and think that it would be the most indec thing possibl if men who ar particularli distinguish by the titl of the faith should not religi keep the faith of their treati but in that newfound world which is not more distant from us in situat than the peopl ar in their manner and cours of life there is no trust to leagu even though thei were made with all the pomp of the most sacr ceremoni on the contrari thei ar on thi account the sooner broken some slight pretenc be found in the word of the treati which ar purpos couch in such ambigu term that thei can never be so strictli bound but thei will alwai find some loophol to escap at and thu thei break both their leagu and their faith and thi is done with such impud that those veri men who valu themselv on have suggest these expedi to their princ would with a haughti scorn declaim against such craft or to speak plainer such fraud and deceit if thei found privat men make us of it in their bargain and would readili sai that thei deserv to be hang by thi mean it is that all sort of justic pass in the world for a lowspirit and vulgar virtu far below the digniti of royal greatnessor at least there ar set up two sort of justic the on is mean and creep on the ground and therefor becom none but the lower part of mankind and so must be kept in sever by mani restraint that it mai not break out beyond the bound that ar set to it the other is the peculiar virtu of princ which as it is more majest than that which becom the rabbl so take a freer compass and thu law and unlaw ar onli measur by pleasur and interest these practic of the princ that lie about utopia who make so littl account of their faith seem to be the reason that determin them to engag in no confederaci perhap thei would chang their mind if thei live among us but yet though treati were more religi observ thei would still dislik the custom of make them sinc the world ha taken up a fals maxim upon it as if there were no tie of natur unit on nation to anoth onli separ perhap by a mountain or a river and that all were born in a state of hostil and so might lawfulli do all that mischief to their neighbour against which there is no provis made by treati and that when treati ar made thei do not cut off the enmiti or restrain the licenc of prei upon each other if by the unskil of word them there ar not effectu proviso made against them thei on the other hand judg that no man is to be esteem our enemi that ha never injur us and that the partnership of human natur is instead of a leagu and that kind and good natur unit men more effectu and with greater strength than ani agreement whatsoev sinc therebi the engag of men heart becom stronger than the bond and oblig of word of their militari disciplin thei detest war as a veri brutal thing and which to the reproach of human natur is more practis by men than by ani sort of beast thei in opposit to the sentiment of almost all other nation think that there is noth more inglori than that glori that is gain by war and therefor though thei accustom themselv daili to militari exercis and the disciplin of war in which not onli their men but their women likewis ar train up that in case of necess thei mai not be quit useless yet thei do not rashli engag in war unless it be either to defend themselv or their friend from ani unjust aggressor or out of good natur or in compass assist an oppress nation in shake off the yoke of tyranni thei inde help their friend not onli in defens but also in offens war but thei never do that unless thei had been consult befor the breach wa made and be satisfi with the ground on which thei went thei had found that all demand of repar were reject so that a war wa unavoid thi thei think to be not onli just when on neighbour make an inroad on anoth by public order and carri awai the spoil but when the merchant of on countri ar oppress in anoth either under pretenc of some unjust law or by the pervers wrest of good on thi thei count a juster caus of war than the other becaus those injuri ar done under some colour of law thi wa the onli ground of that war in which thei engag with the nepheloget against the aleopolitan a littl befor our time for the merchant of the former have as thei thought met with great injustic among the latter which whether it wa in itself right or wrong drew on a terribl war in which mani of their neighbour were engag and their keen in carri it on be support by their strength in maintain it it not onli shook some veri flourish state and veri much afflict other but after a seri of much mischief end in the entir conquest and slaveri of the aleopolitan who though befor the war thei were in all respect much superior to the nepheloget were yet subdu but though the utopian had assist them in the war yet thei pretend to no share of the spoil but though thei so vigor assist their friend in obtain repar for the injuri thei have receiv in affair of thi natur yet if ani such fraud were commit against themselv provid no violenc wa done to their person thei would onli on their be refus satisfact forbear trade with such a peopl thi is not becaus thei consid their neighbour more than their own citizen but sinc their neighbour trade everi on upon hi own stock fraud is a more sensibl injuri to them than it is to the utopian among whom the public in such a case onli suffer as thei expect no thing in return for the merchandis thei export but that in which thei so much abound and is of littl us to them the loss doe not much affect them thei think therefor it would be too sever to reveng a loss attend with so littl inconveni either to their live or their subsist with the death of mani person but if ani of their peopl ar either kill or wound wrongfulli whether it be done by public author or onli by privat men as soon as thei hear of it thei send ambassador and demand that the guilti person mai be deliv up to them and if that is deni thei declar war but if it be compli with the offend ar condemn either to death or slaveri thei would be both troubl and asham of a bloodi victori over their enemi and think it would be as foolish a purchas as to bui the most valuabl good at too high a rate and in no victori do thei glori so much as in that which is gain by dexter and good conduct without bloodsh in such case thei appoint public triumph and erect trophi to the honour of those who have succeed for then do thei reckon that a man act suitabl to hi natur when he conquer hi enemi in such a wai as that no other creatur but a man could be capabl of and that is by the strength of hi understand bear lion boar wolv and dog and all other anim emploi their bodili forc on against anoth in which as mani of them ar superior to men both in strength and fierc so thei ar all subdu by hi reason and understand the onli design of the utopian in war is to obtain that by forc which if it had been grant them in time would have prevent the war or if that cannot be done to take so sever a reveng on those that have injur them that thei mai be terrifi from do the like for the time to come by these end thei measur all their design and manag them so that it is visibl that the appetit of fame or vainglori doe not work so much on there as a just care of their own secur as soon as thei declar war thei take care to have a great mani schedul that ar seal with their common seal affix in the most conspicu place of their enemi countri thi is carri secretli and done in mani place all at onc in these thei promis great reward to such as shall kill the princ and lesser in proport to such as shall kill ani other person who ar those on whom next to the princ himself thei cast the chief balanc of the war and thei doubl the sum to him that instead of kill the person so mark out shall take him aliv and put him in their hand thei offer not onli indemn but reward to such of the person themselv that ar so mark if thei will act against their countrymen by thi mean those that ar name in their schedul becom not onli distrust of their fellowcitizen but ar jealou of on anoth and ar much distract by fear and danger for it ha often fallen out that mani of them and even the princ himself have been betrai by those in whom thei have trust most for the reward that the utopian offer ar so immeasur great that there is no sort of crime to which men cannot be drawn by them thei consid the risk that those run who undertak such servic and offer a recompens proport to the dangernot onli a vast deal of gold but great revenu in land that lie among other nation that ar their friend where thei mai go and enjoi them veri secur and thei observ the promis thei make of their kind most religi thei veri much approv of thi wai of corrupt their enemi though it appear to other to be base and cruel but thei look on it as a wise cours to make an end of what would be otherwis a long war without so much as hazard on battl to decid it thei think it likewis an act of merci and love to mankind to prevent the great slaughter of those that must otherwis be kill in the progress of the war both on their own side and on that of their enemi by the death of a few that ar most guilti and that in so do thei ar kind even to their enemi and piti them no less than their own peopl as know that the greater part of them do not engag in the war of their own accord but ar driven into it by the passion of their princ if thi method doe not succe with them then thei sow seed of content among their enemi and anim the princ brother or some of the nobil to aspir to the crown if thei cannot disunit them by domest broil then thei engag their neighbour against them and make them set on foot some old pretens which ar never want to princ when thei have occas for them these thei plentifulli suppli with monei though but veri sparingli with ani auxiliari troop for thei ar so tender of their own peopl that thei would not willingli exchang on of them even with the princ of their enemi countri but as thei keep their gold and silver onli for such an occas so when that offer itself thei easili part with it sinc it would be no conveni to them though thei should reserv noth of it to themselv for besid the wealth that thei have among them at home thei have a vast treasur abroad mani nation round about them be deep in their debt so that thei hire soldier from all place for carri on their war but chiefli from the zapolet who live five hundr mile east of utopia thei ar a rude wild and fierc nation who delight in the wood and rock among which thei were born and bred up thei ar harden both against heat cold and labour and know noth of the delicaci of life thei do not appli themselv to agricultur nor do thei care either for their hous or their cloth cattl is all that thei look after and for the greatest part thei live either by hunt or upon rapin and ar made as it were onli for war thei watch all opportun of engag in it and veri readili embrac such as ar offer them great number of them will frequent go out and offer themselv for a veri low pai to serv ani that will emploi them thei know none of the art of life but those that lead to the take it awai thei serv those that hire them both with much courag and great fidel but will not engag to serv for ani determin time and agre upon such term that the next dai thei mai go over to the enemi of those whom thei serv if thei offer them a greater encourag and will perhap return to them the dai after that upon a higher advanc of their pai there ar few war in which thei make not a consider part of the armi of both side so it often fall out that thei who ar relat and were hire in the same countri and so have live long and familiarli togeth forget both their relat and former friendship kill on anoth upon no other consider than that of be hire to it for a littl monei by princ of differ interest and such a regard have thei for monei that thei ar easili wrought on by the differ of on penni a dai to chang side so entir doe their avaric influenc them and yet thi monei which thei valu so highli is of littl us to them for what thei purchas thu with their blood thei quickli wast on luxuri which among them is but of a poor and miser form thi nation serv the utopian against all peopl whatsoev for thei pai higher than ani other the utopian hold thi for a maxim that as thei seek out the best sort of men for their own us at home so thei make us of thi worst sort of men for the consumpt of war and therefor thei hire them with the offer of vast reward to expos themselv to all sort of hazard out of which the greater part never return to claim their promis yet thei make them good most religi to such as escap thi anim them to adventur again whenev there is occas for it for the utopian ar not at all troubl how mani of these happen to be kill and reckon it a servic done to mankind if thei could be a mean to deliv the world from such a lewd and viciou sort of peopl that seem to have run togeth as to the drain of human natur next to these thei ar serv in their war with those upon whose account thei undertak them and with the auxiliari troop of their other friend to whom thei join a few of their own peopl and send some man of emin and approv virtu to command in chief there ar two sent with him who dure hi command ar but privat men but the first is to succe him if he should happen to be either kill or taken and in case of the like misfortun to him the third come in hi place and thu thei provid against all event that such accid as mai befal their gener mai not endang their armi when thei draw out troop of their own peopl thei take such out of everi citi as freeli offer themselv for none ar forc to go against their will sinc thei think that if ani man is press that want courag he will not onli act faintli but by hi cowardic dishearten other but if an invas is made on their countri thei make us of such men if thei have good bodi though thei ar not brave and either put them aboard their ship or place them on the wall of their town that be so post thei mai find no opportun of fly awai and thu either shame the heat of action or the imposs of fly bear down their cowardic thei often make a virtu of necess and behav themselv well becaus noth els is left them but as thei forc no man to go into ani foreign war against hi will so thei do not hinder those women who ar will to go along with their husband on the contrari thei encourag and prais them and thei stand often next their husband in the front of the armi thei also place togeth those who ar relat parent and children kindr and those that ar mutual alli near on anoth that those whom natur ha inspir with the greatest zeal for assist on anoth mai be the nearest and readiest to do it and it is matter of great reproach if husband or wife surviv on anoth or if a child surviv hi parent and therefor when thei come to be engag in action thei continu to fight to the last man if their enemi stand befor them and as thei us all prudent method to avoid the endang their own men and if it is possibl let all the action and danger fall upon the troop that thei hire so if it becom necessari for themselv to engag thei then charg with as much courag as thei avoid it befor with prudenc nor is it a fierc charg at first but it increas by degre and as thei continu in action thei grow more obstin and press harder upon the enemi insomuch that thei will much sooner die than give ground for the certainti that their children will be well look after when thei ar dead free them from all that anxieti concern them which often master men of great courag and thu thei ar anim by a nobl and invinc resolut their skill in militari affair increas their courag and the wise sentiment which accord to the law of their countri ar instil into them in their educ give addit vigour to their mind for as thei do not undervalu life so as prodig to throw it awai thei ar not so indec fond of it as to preserv it by base and unbecom method in the greatest heat of action the bravest of their youth who have devot themselv to that servic singl out the gener of their enemi set on him either openli or by ambuscad pursu him everywher and when spent and weari out ar reliev by other who never give over the pursuit either attack him with close weapon when thei can get near him or with those which wound at a distanc when other get in between them so that unless he secur himself by flight thei seldom fail at last to kill or to take him prison when thei have obtain a victori thei kill as few as possibl and ar much more bent on take mani prison than on kill those that fly befor them nor do thei ever let their men so loos in the pursuit of their enemi as not to retain an entir bodi still in order so that if thei have been forc to engag the last of their battalion befor thei could gain the dai thei will rather let their enemi all escap than pursu them when their own armi is in disord rememb well what ha often fallen out to themselv that when the main bodi of their armi ha been quit defeat and broken when their enemi imagin the victori obtain have let themselv loos into an irregular pursuit a few of them that lai for a reserv wait a fit opportun have fallen on them in their chase and when straggl in disord and apprehens of no danger but count the dai their own have turn the whole action and wrest out of their hand a victori that seem certain and undoubt while the vanquish have suddenli becom victori it is hard to tell whether thei ar more dexter in lai or avoid ambush thei sometim seem to fly when it is far from their thought and when thei intend to give ground thei do it so that it is veri hard to find out their design if thei see thei ar ill post or ar like to be overpow by number thei then either march off in the night with great silenc or by some stratagem delud their enemi if thei retir in the daytim thei do it in such order that it is no less danger to fall upon them in a retreat than in a march thei fortifi their camp with a deep and larg trench and throw up the earth that is dug out of it for a wall nor do thei emploi onli their slave in thi but the whole armi work at it except those that ar then upon the guard so that when so mani hand ar at work a great line and a strong fortif is finish in so short a time that it is scarc credibl their armour is veri strong for defenc and yet is not so heavi as to make them uneasi in their march thei can even swim with it all that ar train up to war practis swim both hors and foot make great us of arrow and ar veri expert thei have no sword but fight with a poleax that is both sharp and heavi by which thei thrust or strike down an enemi thei ar veri good at find out warlik machin and disguis them so well that the enemi doe not perceiv them till he feel the us of them so that he cannot prepar such a defenc as would render them useless the chief consider had in the make them is that thei mai be easili carri and manag if thei agre to a truce thei observ it so religi that no provoc will make them break it thei never lai their enemi countri wast nor burn their corn and even in their march thei take all possibl care that neither hors nor foot mai tread it down for thei do not know but that thei mai have us for it themselv thei hurt no man whom thei find disarm unless he is a spy when a town is surrend to them thei take it into their protect and when thei carri a place by storm thei never plunder it but put those onli to the sword that oppos the render of it up and make the rest of the garrison slave but for the other inhabit thei do them no hurt and if ani of them had advis a surrend thei give them good reward out of the estat of those that thei condemn and distribut the rest among their auxiliari troop but thei themselv take no share of the spoil when a war is end thei do not oblig their friend to reimburs their expens but thei obtain them of the conquer either in monei which thei keep for the next occas or in land out of which a constant revenu is to be paid them by mani increas the revenu which thei draw out from sever countri on such occas is now risen to abov ducat a year thei send some of their own peopl to receiv these revenu who have order to live magnific and like princ by which mean thei consum much of it upon the place and either bring over the rest to utopia or lend it to that nation in which it li thi thei most commonli do unless some great occas which fall out but veri seldom should oblig them to call for it all it is out of these land that thei assign reward to such as thei encourag to adventur on desper attempt if ani princ that engag in war with them is make prepar for invad their countri thei prevent him and make hi countri the seat of the war for thei do not willingli suffer ani war to break in upon their island and if that should happen thei would onli defend themselv by their own peopl but would not call for auxiliari troop to their assist of the religion of the utopian there ar sever sort of religion not onli in differ part of the island but even in everi town some worship the sun other the moon or on of the planet some worship such men as have been emin in former time for virtu or glori not onli as ordinari deiti but as the suprem god yet the greater and wiser sort of them worship none of these but ador on etern invis infinit and incomprehens deiti as a be that is far abov all our apprehens that is spread over the whole univers not by hi bulk but by hi power and virtu him thei call the father of all and acknowledg that the begin the increas the progress the vicissitud and the end of all thing come onli from him nor do thei offer divin honour to ani but to him alon and inde though thei differ concern other thing yet all agre in thi that thei think there is on suprem be that made and govern the world whom thei call in the languag of their countri mithra thei differ in thi that on think the god whom he worship is thi suprem be and anoth think that hi idol is that god but thei all agre in on principl that whoever is thi suprem be he is also that great essenc to whose glori and majesti all honour ar ascrib by the consent of all nation by degre thei fall off from the variou superstit that ar among them and grow up to that on religion that is the best and most in request and there is no doubt to be made but that all the other had vanish long ago if some of those who advis them to lai asid their superstit had not met with some unhappi accid which be consid as inflict by heaven made them afraid that the god whose worship had like to have been abandon had interpos and reveng themselv on those who despis their author after thei had heard from us an account of the doctrin the cours of life and the miracl of christ and of the wonder constanc of so mani martyr whose blood so willingli offer up by them wa the chief occas of spread their religion over a vast number of nation it is not to be imagin how inclin thei were to receiv it i shall not determin whether thi proceed from ani secret inspir of god or whether it wa becaus it seem so favour to that commun of good which is an opinion so particular as well as so dear to them sinc thei perceiv that christ and hi follow live by that rule and that it wa still kept up in some commun among the sincerest sort of christian from whichsoev of these motiv it might be true it is that mani of them came over to our religion and were initi into it by baptism but as two of our number were dead so none of the four that surviv were in priest order we therefor could onli baptis them so that to our great regret thei could not partak of the other sacrament that can onli be administ by priest but thei ar instruct concern them and long most vehement for them thei have had great disput among themselv whether on chosen by them to be a priest would not be therebi qualifi to do all the thing that belong to that charact even though he had no author deriv from the pope and thei seem to be resolv to choos some for that employ but thei had not done it when i left them those among them that have not receiv our religion do not fright ani from it and us none ill that goe over to it so that all the while i wa there on man wa onli punish on thi occas he be newli baptis did notwithstand all that we could sai to the contrari disput publicli concern the christian religion with more zeal than discret and with so much heat that he not onli prefer our worship to their but condemn all their rite as profan and cri out against all that adher to them as impiou and sacrilegi person that were to be damn to everlast burn upon hi have frequent preach in thi manner he wa seiz and after trial he wa condemn to banish not for have disparag their religion but for hi inflam the peopl to sedit for thi is on of their most ancient law that no man ought to be punish for hi religion at the first constitut of their govern utopu have understood that befor hi come among them the old inhabit had been engag in great quarrel concern religion by which thei were so divid among themselv that he found it an easi thing to conquer them sinc instead of unit their forc against him everi differ parti in religion fought by themselv after he had subdu them he made a law that everi man might be of what religion he pleas and might endeavour to draw other to it by the forc of argument and by amic and modest wai but without bitter against those of other opinion but that he ought to us no other forc but that of persuas and wa neither to mix with it reproach nor violenc and such as did otherwis were to be condemn to banish or slaveri thi law wa made by utopu not onli for preserv the public peac which he saw suffer much by daili content and irreconcil heat but becaus he thought the interest of religion itself requir it he judg it not fit to determin anyth rashli and seem to doubt whether those differ form of religion might not all come from god who might inspir man in a differ manner and be pleas with thi varieti he therefor thought it indec and foolish for ani man to threaten and terrifi anoth to make him believ what did not appear to him to be true and suppos that onli on religion wa realli true and the rest fals he imagin that the nativ forc of truth would at last break forth and shine bright if support onli by the strength of argument and attend to with a gentl and unprejud mind while on the other hand if such debat were carri on with violenc and tumult as the most wick ar alwai the most obstin so the best and most holi religion might be choke with superstit as corn is with briar and thorn he therefor left men wholli to their liberti that thei might be free to believ as thei should see caus onli he made a solemn and sever law against such as should so far degener from the digniti of human natur as to think that our soul di with our bodi or that the world wa govern by chanc without a wise overrul provid for thei all formerli believ that there wa a state of reward and punish to the good and bad after thi life and thei now look on those that think otherwis as scarc fit to be count men sinc thei degrad so nobl a be as the soul and reckon it no better than a beast thu thei ar far from look on such men as fit for human societi or to be citizen of a wellord commonwealth sinc a man of such principl must need as oft as he dare do it despis all their law and custom for there is no doubt to be made that a man who is afraid of noth but the law and apprehend noth after death will not scrupl to break through all the law of hi countri either by fraud or forc when by thi mean he mai satisfi hi appetit thei never rais ani that hold these maxim either to honour or offic nor emploi them in ani public trust but despis them as men of base and sordid mind yet thei do not punish them becaus thei lai thi down as a maxim that a man cannot make himself believ anyth he pleas nor do thei drive ani to dissembl their thought by threaten so that men ar not tempt to lie or disguis their opinion which be a sort of fraud is abhor by the utopian thei take care inde to prevent their disput in defenc of these opinion especi befor the common peopl but thei suffer and even encourag them to disput concern them in privat with their priest and other grave men be confid that thei will be cure of those mad opinion by have reason laid befor them there ar mani among them that run far to the other extrem though it is neither thought an ill nor unreason opinion and therefor is not at all discourag thei think that the soul of beast ar immort though far inferior to the digniti of the human soul and not capabl of so great a happi thei ar almost all of them veri firmli persuad that good men will be infinit happi in anoth state so that though thei ar compassion to all that ar sick yet thei lament no man death except thei see him loath to part with life for thei look on thi as a veri ill presag as if the soul consciou to itself of guilt and quit hopeless wa afraid to leav the bodi from some secret hint of approach miseri thei think that such a man appear befor god cannot be accept to him who be call on doe not go out cheerfulli but is backward and unwil and is as it were drag to it thei ar struck with horror when thei see ani die in thi manner and carri them out in silenc and with sorrow and prai god that he would be merci to the error of the depart soul thei lai the bodi in the ground but when ani die cheerfulli and full of hope thei do not mourn for them but sing hymn when thei carri out their bodi and commend their soul veri earnestli to god their whole behaviour is then rather grave than sad thei burn the bodi and set up a pillar where the pile wa made with an inscript to the honour of the deceas when thei come from the funer thei discours of hi good life and worthi action but speak of noth often and with more pleasur than of hi seren at the hour of death thei think such respect paid to the memori of good men is both the greatest incit to engag other to follow their exampl and the most accept worship that can be offer them for thei believ that though by the imperfect of human sight thei ar invis to us yet thei ar present among us and hear those discours that pass concern themselv thei believ it inconsist with the happi of depart soul not to be at liberti to be where thei will and do not imagin them capabl of the ingratitud of not desir to see those friend with whom thei live on earth in the strictest bond of love and kind besid thei ar persuad that good men after death have these affect and all other good disposit increas rather than diminish and therefor conclud that thei ar still among the live and observ all thei sai or do from henc thei engag in all their affair with the greater confid of success as trust to their protect while thi opinion of the presenc of their ancestor is a restraint that prevent their engag in ill design thei despis and laugh at auguri and the other vain and superstiti wai of divin so much observ among other nation but have great rever for such miracl as cannot flow from ani of the power of natur and look on them as effect and indic of the presenc of the suprem be of which thei sai mani instanc have occur among them and that sometim their public prayer which upon great and danger occas thei have solemnli put up to god with assur confid of be heard have been answer in a miracul manner thei think the contempl god in hi work and the ador him for them is a veri accept piec of worship to him there ar mani among them that upon a motiv of religion neglect learn and appli themselv to no sort of studi nor do thei allow themselv ani leisur time but ar perpetu emploi believ that by the good thing that a man doe he secur to himself that happi that come after death some of these visit the sick other mend highwai cleans ditch repair bridg or dig turf gravel or stone other fell and cleav timber and bring wood corn and other necessari on cart into their town nor do these onli serv the public but thei serv even privat men more than the slave themselv do for if there is anywher a rough hard and sordid piec of work to be done from which mani ar frighten by the labour and loathsom of it if not the despair of accomplish it thei cheerfulli and of their own accord take that to their share and by that mean as thei eas other veri much so thei afflict themselv and spend their whole life in hard labour and yet thei do not valu themselv upon thi nor lessen other peopl credit to rais their own but by their stoop to such servil employ thei ar so far from be despis that thei ar so much the more esteem by the whole nation of these there ar two sort some live unmarri and chast and abstain from eat ani sort of flesh and thu wean themselv from all the pleasur of the present life which thei account hurt thei pursu even by the hardest and painfullest method possibl that blessed which thei hope for hereaft and the nearer thei approach to it thei ar the more cheer and earnest in their endeavour after it anoth sort of them is less will to put themselv to much toil and therefor prefer a marri state to a singl on and as thei do not deni themselv the pleasur of it so thei think the beget of children is a debt which thei ow to human natur and to their countri nor do thei avoid ani pleasur that doe not hinder labour and therefor eat flesh so much the more willingli as thei find that by thi mean thei ar the more abl to work the utopian look upon these as the wiser sect but thei esteem the other as the most holi thei would inde laugh at ani man who from the principl of reason would prefer an unmarri state to a marri or a life of labour to an easi life but thei rever and admir such as do it from the motiv of religion there is noth in which thei ar more cautiou than in give their opinion posit concern ani sort of religion the men that lead those sever live ar call in the languag of their countri brutheska which answer to those we call religi order their priest ar men of emin pieti and therefor thei ar but few for there ar onli thirteen in everi town on for everi templ but when thei go to war seven of these go out with their forc and seven other ar chosen to suppli their room in their absenc but these enter again upon their employ when thei return and those who serv in their absenc attend upon the high priest till vacanc fall by death for there is on set over the rest thei ar chosen by the peopl as the other magistr ar by suffrag given in secret for prevent of faction and when thei ar chosen thei ar consecr by the colleg of priest the care of all sacr thing the worship of god and an inspect into the manner of the peopl ar commit to them it is a reproach to a man to be sent for by ani of them or for them to speak to him in secret for that alwai give some suspicion all that is incumb on them is onli to exhort and admonish the peopl for the power of correct and punish ill men belong wholli to the princ and to the other magistr the severest thing that the priest doe is the exclud those that ar desper wick from join in their worship there is not ani sort of punish more dread by them than thi for as it load them with infami so it fill them with secret horror such is their rever to their religion nor will their bodi be long exempt from their share of troubl for if thei do not veri quickli satisfi the priest of the truth of their repent thei ar seiz on by the senat and punish for their impieti the educ of youth belong to the priest yet thei do not take so much care of instruct them in letter as in form their mind and manner aright thei us all possibl method to infus veri earli into the tender and flexibl mind of children such opinion as ar both good in themselv and will be us to their countri for when deep impress of these thing ar made at that ag thei follow men through the whole cours of their live and conduc much to preserv the peac of the govern which suffer by noth more than by vice that rise out of ill opinion the wive of their priest ar the most extraordinari women of the whole countri sometim the women themselv ar made priest though that fall out but seldom nor ar ani but ancient widow chosen into that order none of the magistr have greater honour paid them than is paid the priest and if thei should happen to commit ani crime thei would not be question for it their punish is left to god and to their own conscienc for thei do not think it law to lai hand on ani man how wick soever he is that ha been in a peculiar manner dedic to god nor do thei find ani great inconveni in thi both becaus thei have so few priest and becaus these ar chosen with much caution so that it must be a veri unusu thing to find on who mere out of regard to hi virtu and for hi be esteem a singularli good man wa rais up to so great a digniti degener into corrupt and vice and if such a thing should fall out for man is a changeabl creatur yet there be few priest and these have no author but what rise out of the respect that is paid them noth of great consequ to the public can proce from the indemn that the priest enjoi thei have inde veri few of them lest greater number share in the same honour might make the digniti of that order which thei esteem so highli to sink in it reput thei also think it difficult to find out mani of such an exalt pitch of good as to be equal to that digniti which demand the exercis of more than ordinari virtu nor ar the priest in greater vener among them than thei ar among their neighbour nation as you mai imagin by that which i think give occas for it when the utopian engag in battl the priest who accompani them to the war apparel in their sacr vestment kneel down dure the action in a place not far from the field and lift up their hand to heaven prai first for peac and then for victori to their own side and particularli that it mai be gain without the effus of much blood on either side and when the victori turn to their side thei run in among their own men to restrain their furi and if ani of their enemi see them or call to them thei ar preserv by that mean and such as can come so near them as to touch their garment have not onli their live but their fortun secur to them it is upon thi account that all the nation round about consid them so much and treat them with such rever that thei have been often no less abl to preserv their own peopl from the furi of their enemi than to save their enemi from their rage for it ha sometim fallen out that when their armi have been in disord and forc to fly so that their enemi were run upon the slaughter and spoil the priest by interpos have separ them from on anoth and stop the effus of more blood so that by their mediat a peac ha been conclud on veri reason term nor is there ani nation about them so fierc cruel or barbar as not to look upon their person as sacr and inviol the first and the last dai of the month and of the year is a festiv thei measur their month by the cours of the moon and their year by the cours of the sun the first dai ar call in their languag the cynemern and the last the trapemern which answer in our languag to the festiv that begin or end the season thei have magnific templ that ar not onli nobli built but extrem spaciou which is the more necessari as thei have so few of them thei ar a littl dark within which proce not from ani error in the architectur but is done with design for their priest think that too much light dissip the thought and that a more moder degre of it both recollect the mind and rais devot though there ar mani differ form of religion among them yet all these how variou soever agre in the main point which is the worship the divin essenc and therefor there is noth to be seen or heard in their templ in which the sever persuas among them mai not agre for everi sect perform those rite that ar peculiar to it in their privat hous nor is there anyth in the public worship that contradict the particular wai of those differ sect there ar no imag for god in their templ so that everi on mai repres him to hi thought accord to the wai of hi religion nor do thei call thi on god by ani other name but that of mithra which is the common name by which thei all express the divin essenc whatsoev otherwis thei think it to be nor ar there ani prayer among them but such as everi on of them mai us without prejudic to hi own opinion thei meet in their templ on the even of the festiv that conclud a season and not have yet broke their fast thei thank god for their good success dure that year or month which is then at an end and the next dai be that which begin the new season thei meet earli in their templ to prai for the happi progress of all their affair dure that period upon which thei then enter in the festiv which conclud the period befor thei go to the templ both wive and children fall on their knee befor their husband or parent and confess everyth in which thei have either er or fail in their duti and beg pardon for it thu all littl discont in famili ar remov that thei mai offer up their devot with a pure and seren mind for thei hold it a great impieti to enter upon them with disturb thought or with a conscious of their bear hatr or anger in their heart to ani person whatsoev and think that thei should becom liabl to sever punish if thei presum to offer sacrific without cleans their heart and reconcil all their differ in the templ the two sex ar separ the men go to the right hand and the women to the left and the male and femal all place themselv befor the head and master or mistress of the famili to which thei belong so that those who have the govern of them at home mai see their deport in public and thei intermingl them so that the younger and the older mai be set by on anoth for if the younger sort were all set togeth thei would perhap trifl awai that time too much in which thei ought to beget in themselv that religi dread of the suprem be which is the greatest and almost the onli incit to virtu thei offer up no live creatur in sacrific nor do thei think it suitabl to the divin be from whose bounti it is that these creatur have deriv their live to take pleasur in their death or the offer up their blood thei burn incens and other sweet odour and have a great number of wax light dure their worship not out of ani imagin that such oblat can add anyth to the divin natur which even prayer cannot do but as it is a harmless and pure wai of worship god so thei think those sweet savour and light togeth with some other ceremoni by a secret and unaccount virtu elev men soul and inflam them with greater energi and cheer dure the divin worship all the peopl appear in the templ in white garment but the priest vestment ar particolour and both the work and colour ar wonder thei ar made of no rich materi for thei ar neither embroid nor set with preciou stone but ar compos of the plume of sever bird laid togeth with so much art and so neatli that the true valu of them is far beyond the costliest materi thei sai that in the order and place those plume some dark mysteri ar repres which pass down among their priest in a secret tradit concern them and that thei ar as hieroglyph put them in mind of the bless that thei have receiv from god and of their duti both to him and to their neighbour as soon as the priest appear in those ornament thei all fall prostrat on the ground with so much rever and so deep a silenc that such as look on cannot but be struck with it as if it were the effect of the appear of a deiti after thei have been for some time in thi postur thei all stand up upon a sign given by the priest and sing hymn to the honour of god some music instrument plai all the while these ar quit of anoth form than those us among us but as mani of them ar much sweeter than our so other ar made us of by us yet in on thing thei veri much exce us all their music both vocal and instrument is adapt to imit and express the passion and is so happili suit to everi occas that whether the subject of the hymn be cheer or form to sooth or troubl the mind or to express grief or remors the music take the impress of whatev is repres affect and kindl the passion and work the sentiment deep into the heart of the hearer when thi is done both priest and peopl offer up veri solemn prayer to god in a set form of word and these ar so compos that whatsoev is pronounc by the whole assembl mai be likewis appli by everi man in particular to hi own condit in these thei acknowledg god to be the author and governor of the world and the fountain of all the good thei receiv and therefor offer up to him their thanksgiv and in particular bless him for hi good in order it so that thei ar born under the happiest govern in the world and ar of a religion which thei hope is the truest of all other but if thei ar mistaken and if there is either a better govern or a religion more accept to god thei implor hi good to let them know it vow that thei resolv to follow him whithersoev he lead them but if their govern is the best and their religion the truest then thei prai that he mai fortifi them in it and bring all the world both to the same rule of life and to the same opinion concern himself unless accord to the unsearch of hi mind he is pleas with a varieti of religion then thei prai that god mai give them an easi passag at last to himself not presum to set limit to him how earli or late it should be but if it mai be wish for without derog from hi suprem author thei desir to be quickli deliv and to be taken to himself though by the most terribl kind of death rather than to be detain long from see him by the most prosper cours of life when thi prayer is end thei all fall down again upon the ground and after a littl while thei rise up go home to dinner and spend the rest of the dai in divers or militari exercis thu have i describ to you as particularli as i could the constitut of that commonwealth which i do not onli think the best in the world but inde the onli commonwealth that truli deserv that name in all other place it is visibl that while peopl talk of a commonwealth everi man onli seek hi own wealth but there where no man ha ani properti all men zealous pursu the good of the public and inde it is no wonder to see men act so differ for in other commonwealth everi man know that unless he provid for himself how flourish soever the commonwealth mai be he must die of hunger so that he see the necess of prefer hi own concern to the public but in utopia where everi man ha a right to everyth thei all know that if care is taken to keep the public store full no privat man can want anyth for among them there is no unequ distribut so that no man is poor none in necess and though no man ha anyth yet thei ar all rich for what can make a man so rich as to lead a seren and cheer life free from anxieti neither apprehend want himself nor vex with the endless complaint of hi wife he is not afraid of the miseri of hi children nor is he contriv how to rais a portion for hi daughter but is secur in thi that both he and hi wife hi children and grandchildren to as mani gener as he can fanci will all live both plentifulli and happili sinc among them there is no less care taken of those who were onc engag in labour but grow afterward unabl to follow it than there is elsewher of these that continu still emploi i would gladli hear ani man compar the justic that is among them with that of all other nation among whom mai i perish if i see anyth that look either like justic or equiti for what justic is there in thi that a nobleman a goldsmith a banker or ani other man that either doe noth at all or at best is emploi in thing that ar of no us to the public should live in great luxuri and splendour upon what is so ill acquir and a mean man a carter a smith or a ploughman that work harder even than the beast themselv and is emploi in labour so necessari that no commonwealth could hold out a year without them can onli earn so poor a livelihood and must lead so miser a life that the condit of the beast is much better than their for as the beast do not work so constantli so thei feed almost as well and with more pleasur and have no anxieti about what is to come whilst these men ar depress by a barren and fruitless employ and torment with the apprehens of want in their old ag sinc that which thei get by their daili labour doe but maintain them at present and is consum as fast as it come in there is no overplu left to lai up for old ag is not that govern both unjust and ungrat that is so prodig of it favour to those that ar call gentlemen or goldsmith or such other who ar idl or live either by flatteri or by contriv the art of vain pleasur and on the other hand take no care of those of a meaner sort such as ploughmen collier and smith without whom it could not subsist but after the public ha reap all the advantag of their servic and thei come to be oppress with ag sick and want all their labour and the good thei have done is forgotten and all the recompens given them is that thei ar left to die in great miseri the richer sort ar often endeavour to bring the hire of labour lower not onli by their fraudul practic but by the law which thei procur to be made to that effect so that though it is a thing most unjust in itself to give such small reward to those who deserv so well of the public yet thei have given those hardship the name and colour of justic by procur law to be made for regul them therefor i must sai that as i hope for merci i can have no other notion of all the other govern that i see or know than that thei ar a conspiraci of the rich who on pretenc of manag the public onli pursu their privat end and devis all the wai and art thei can find out first that thei mai without danger preserv all that thei have so illacquir and then that thei mai engag the poor to toil and labour for them at as low rate as possibl and oppress them as much as thei pleas and if thei can but prevail to get these contriv establish by the show of public author which is consid as the repres of the whole peopl then thei ar account law yet these wick men after thei have by a most insati covet divid that among themselv with which all the rest might have been well suppli ar far from that happi that is enjoi among the utopian for the us as well as the desir of monei be extinguish much anxieti and great occas of mischief is cut off with it and who doe not see that the fraud theft robberi quarrel tumult content sedit murder treacheri and witchcraft which ar inde rather punish than restrain by the sever of law would all fall off if monei were not ani more valu by the world men fear solicitud care labour and watch would all perish in the same moment with the valu of monei even poverti itself for the relief of which monei seem most necessari would fall but in order to the apprehend thi aright take on instanc consid ani year that ha been so unfruit that mani thousand have di of hunger and yet if at the end of that year a survei wa made of the granari of all the rich men that have hoard up the corn it would be found that there wa enough among them to have prevent all that consumpt of men that perish in miseri and that if it had been distribut among them none would have felt the terribl effect of that scarciti so easi a thing would it be to suppli all the necess of life if that bless thing call monei which is pretend to be invent for procur them wa not realli the onli thing that obstruct their be procur i do not doubt but rich men ar sensibl of thi and that thei well know how much a greater happi it is to want noth necessari than to abound in mani superflu and to be rescu out of so much miseri than to abound with so much wealth and i cannot think but the sens of everi man interest ad to the author of christ command who as he wa infinit wise knew what wa best and wa not less good in discov it to us would have drawn all the world over to the law of the utopian if pride that plagu of human natur that sourc of so much miseri did not hinder it for thi vice doe not measur happi so much by it own conveni as by the miseri of other and would not be satisfi with be thought a goddess if none were left that were miser over whom she might insult pride think it own happi shine the brighter by compar it with the misfortun of other person that by displai it own wealth thei mai feel their poverti the more sensibl thi is that infern serpent that creep into the breast of mortal and possess them too much to be easili drawn out and therefor i am glad that the utopian have fallen upon thi form of govern in which i wish that all the world could be so wise as to imit them for thei have inde laid down such a scheme and foundat of polici that as men live happili under it so it is like to be of great continu for thei have root out of the mind of their peopl all the seed both of ambit and faction there is no danger of ani commot at home which alon ha been the ruin of mani state that seem otherwis to be well secur but as long as thei live in peac at home and ar govern by such good law the envi of all their neighbour princ who have often though in vain attempt their ruin will never be abl to put their state into ani commot or disord when raphael had thu made an end of speak though mani thing occur to me both concern the manner and law of that peopl that seem veri absurd as well in their wai of make war as in their notion of religion and divin matterstogeth with sever other particular but chiefli what seem the foundat of all the rest their live in common without the us of monei by which all nobil magnific splendour and majesti which accord to the common opinion ar the true ornament of a nation would be quit taken awayyet sinc i perceiv that raphael wa weari and wa not sure whether he could easili bear contradict rememb that he had taken notic of some who seem to think thei were bound in honour to support the credit of their own wisdom by find out someth to censur in all other men invent besid their own i onli commend their constitut and the account he had given of it in gener and so take him by the hand carri him to supper and told him i would find out some other time for examin thi subject more particularli and for discours more copious upon it and inde i shall be glad to embrac an opportun of do it in the meanwhil though it must be confess that he is both a veri learn man and a person who ha obtain a great knowledg of the world i cannot perfectli agre to everyth he ha relat howev there ar mani thing in the commonwealth of utopia that i rather wish than hope to see follow in our govern
