thought alic warmer in fact becaus there ll be no on here to scold me awai from the fire oh what fun it ll be when thei see me through the glass in here and can t get at me then she began look about and notic that what could be seen from the old room wa quit common and uninterest but that all the rest wa as differ as possibl for instanc the pictur on the wall next the fire seem to be all aliv and the veri clock on the chimneypiec you know you can onli see the back of it in the lookingglass had got the face of a littl old man and grin at her thei don t keep thi room so tidi as the other alic thought to herself as she notic sever of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinder but in anoth moment with a littl oh of surpris she wa down on her hand and knee watch them the chessmen were walk about two and two here ar the red king and the red queen alic said in a whisper for fear of frighten them and there ar the white king and the white queen sit on the edg of the shoveland here ar two castl walk arm in armi don t think thei can hear me she went on as she put her head closer down and i m nearli sure thei can t see me i feel somehow as if i were invis here someth began squeak on the tabl behind alic and made her turn her head just in time to see on of the white pawn roll over and begin kick she watch it with great curios to see what would happen next it is the voic of my child the white queen cri out as she rush past the king so violent that she knock him over among the cinder my preciou lili my imperi kitten and she began scrambl wildli up the side of the fender imperi fiddlestick said the king rub hi nose which had been hurt by the fall he had a right to be a littl annoi with the queen for he wa cover with ash from head to foot alic wa veri anxiou to be of us and as the poor littl lili wa nearli scream herself into a fit she hastili pick up the queen and set her on the tabl by the side of her noisi littl daughter the queen gasp and sat down the rapid journei through the air had quit taken awai her breath and for a minut or two she could do noth but hug the littl lili in silenc as soon as she had recov her breath a littl she call out to the white king who wa sit sulkili among the ash mind the volcano what volcano said the king look up anxious into the fire as if he thought that wa the most like place to find on blewmeup pant the queen who wa still a littl out of breath mind you come upth regular waydon t get blown up alic watch the white king as he slowli struggl up from bar to bar till at last she said why you ll be hour and hour get to the tabl at that rate i d far better help you hadn t i but the king took no notic of the question it wa quit clear that he could neither hear her nor see her so alic pick him up veri gentli and lift him across more slowli than she had lift the queen that she mightn t take hi breath awai but befor she put him on the tabl she thought she might as well dust him a littl he wa so cover with ash she said afterward that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the king made when he found himself held in the air by an invis hand and be dust he wa far too much astonish to cry out but hi ey and hi mouth went on get larger and larger and rounder and rounder till her hand shook so with laugh that she nearli let him drop upon the floor oh pleas don t make such face my dear she cri out quit forget that the king couldn t hear her you make me laugh so that i can hardli hold you and don t keep your mouth so wide open all the ash will get into itther now i think you re tidi enough she ad as she smooth hi hair and set him upon the tabl near the queen the king immedi fell flat on hi back and lai perfectli still and alic wa a littl alarm at what she had done and went round the room to see if she could find ani water to throw over him howev she could find noth but a bottl of ink and when she got back with it she found he had recov and he and the queen were talk togeth in a frighten whisperso low that alic could hardli hear what thei said the king wa sai i assur you my dear i turn cold to the veri end of my whisker to which the queen repli you haven t got ani whisker the horror of that moment the king went on i shall never never forget you will though the queen said if you don t make a memorandum of it alic look on with great interest as the king took an enorm memorandumbook out of hi pocket and began write a sudden thought struck her and she took hold of the end of the pencil which came some wai over hi shoulder and began write for him the poor king look puzzl and unhappi and struggl with the pencil for some time without sai anyth but alic wa too strong for him and at last he pant out my dear i realli must get a thinner pencil i can t manag thi on a bit it write all manner of thing that i don t intend what manner of thing said the queen look over the book in which alic had put the white knight is slide down the poker he balanc veri badli that s not a memorandum of your feel there wa a book ly near alic on the tabl and while she sat watch the white king for she wa still a littl anxiou about him and had the ink all readi to throw over him in case he faint again she turn over the leav to find some part that she could read for it s all in some languag i don t know she said to herself it wa like thi ykcowrebbaj sevot yhtil eht dnagillirb sawt ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg did sevogorob eht erew ysmim lla ebargtuo shtar emom eht dna she puzzl over thi for some time but at last a bright thought struck her why it s a lookingglass book of cours and if i hold it up to a glass the word will all go the right wai again thi wa the poem that alic read jabberwocki twa brillig and the slithi tove did gyre and gimbl in the wabe all mimsi were the borogov and the mome rath outgrab bewar the jabberwock my son the jaw that bite the claw that catch bewar the jubjub bird and shun the frumiou bandersnatch he took hi vorpal sword in hand long time the manxom foe he sought so rest he by the tumtum tree and stood awhil in thought and as in uffish thought he stood the jabberwock with ey of flame came whiffl through the tulgei wood and burbl as it came on two

callooh callai he chortl in hi joi twa brillig and the slithi tove did gyre and gimbl in the wabe all mimsi were the borogov and the mome rath outgrab it seem veri pretti she said when she had finish it but it s rather hard to understand you see she didn t like to confess even to herself that she couldn t make it out at all somehow it seem to fill my head with ideasonli i don t exactli know what thei ar howev somebodi kill someth that s clear at ani rate but oh thought alic suddenli jump up if i don t make hast i shall have to go back through the lookingglass befor i ve seen what the rest of the hous is like let s have a look at the garden first she wa out of the room in a moment and ran down stairsor at least it wasn t exactli run but a new invent of her for get down stair quickli and easili as alic said to herself she just kept the tip of her finger on the handrail and float gentli down without even touch the stair with her feet then she float on through the hall and would have gone straight out at the door in the same wai if she hadn t caught hold of the doorpost she wa get a littl giddi with so much float in the air and wa rather glad to find herself walk again in the natur wai chapter ii the garden of live flower i should see the garden far better said alic to herself if i could get to the top of that hill and here s a path that lead straight to itat least no it doesn t do that after go a few yard along the path and turn sever sharp corner but i suppos it will at last but how curious it twist it s more like a corkscrew than a path well thi turn goe to the hill i supposeno it doesn t thi goe straight back to the hous well then i ll try it the other wai and so she did wander up and down and try turn after turn but alwai come back to the hous do what she would inde onc when she turn a corner rather more quickli than usual she ran against it befor she could stop herself it s no us talk about it alic said look up at the hous and pretend it wa argu with her i m not go in again yet i know i should have to get through the lookingglass againback into the old roomand there d be an end of all my adventur so resolut turn her back upon the hous she set out onc more down the path determin to keep straight on till she got to the hill for a few minut all went on well and she wa just sai i realli shall do it thi time when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself as she describ it afterward and the next moment she found herself actual walk in at the door oh it s too bad she cri i never saw such a hous for get in the wai never howev there wa the hill full in sight so there wa noth to be done but start again thi time she came upon a larg flowerb with a border of daisi and a willowtre grow in the middl o tigerlili said alic address herself to on that wa wave gracefulli about in the wind i wish you could talk we can talk said the tigerlili when there s anybodi worth talk to alic wa so astonish that she could not speak for a minut it quit seem to take her breath awai at length as the tigerlili onli went on wave about she spoke again in a timid voicealmost in a whisper and can all the flower talk as well as you can said the tigerlili and a great deal louder it isn t manner for us to begin you know said the rose and i realli wa wonder when you d speak said i to myself her face ha got some sens in it though it s not a clever on still you re the right colour and that goe a long wai i don t care about the colour the tigerlili remark if onli her petal curl up a littl more she d be all right alic didn t like be criticis so she began ask question aren t you sometim frighten at be plant out here with nobodi to take care of you there s the tree in the middl said the rose what els is it good for but what could it do if ani danger came alic ask it sai boughwough cri a daisi that s why it branch ar call bough didn t you know that cri anoth daisi and here thei all began shout togeth till the air seem quit full of littl shrill voic silenc everi on of you cri the tigerlili wave itself passion from side to side and trembl with excit thei know i can t get at them it pant bend it quiver head toward alic or thei wouldn t dare to do it never mind alic said in a sooth tone and stoop down to the daisi who were just begin again she whisper if you don t hold your tongu i ll pick you there wa silenc in a moment and sever of the pink daisi turn white that s right said the tigerlili the daisi ar worst of all when on speak thei all begin togeth and it s enough to make on wither to hear the wai thei go on how is it you can all talk so nice alic said hope to get it into a better temper by a compliment i ve been in mani garden befor but none of the flower could talk put your hand down and feel the ground said the tigerlili then you ll know why alic did so it s veri hard she said but i don t see what that ha to do with it in most garden the tigerlili said thei make the bed too softso that the flower ar alwai asleep thi sound a veri good reason and alic wa quit pleas to know it i never thought of that befor she said it s my opinion that you never think at all the rose said in a rather sever tone i never saw anybodi that look stupid a violet said so suddenli that alic quit jump for it hadn t spoken befor hold your tongu cri the tigerlili as if you ever saw anybodi you keep your head under the leav and snore awai there till you know no more what s go on in the world than if you were a bud ar there ani more peopl in the garden besid me alic said not choos to notic the rose s last remark there s on other flower in the garden that can move about like you said the rose i wonder how you do it you re alwai wonder said the tigerlili but she s more bushi than you ar is she like me alic ask eagerli for the thought cross her mind there s anoth littl girl in the garden somewher well she ha the same awkward shape as you the rose said but she s redderand her petal ar shorter i think her petal ar done up close almost like a dahlia the tigerlili interrupt not tumbl about anyhow like your but that s not your fault the rose ad kindli you re begin to fade you knowand then on can t help on s petal get a littl untidi alic didn t like thi idea at all so to chang the subject she ask doe she ever come out here i daresai you ll see her soon said the rose she s on of the thorni kind where doe she wear the thorn alic ask with some curios why all round her head of cours the rose repli i wa wonder you hadn t got some too i thought it wa the regular rule she s come cri the larkspur i hear her footstep thump thump thump along the gravelwalk alic look round eagerli and found that it wa the red queen she s grown a good deal wa her first remark she had inde when alic first found her in the ash she had been onli three inch highand here she wa half a head taller than alic herself it s the fresh air that doe it said the rose wonderfulli fine air it is out here i think i ll go and meet her said alic for though the flower were interest enough she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real queen you can t possibl do that said the rose i should advis you to walk the other wai thi sound nonsens to alic so she said noth but set off at onc toward the red queen to her surpris she lost sight of her in a moment and found herself walk in at the frontdoor again a littl provok she drew back and after look everywher for the queen whom she spi out at last a long wai off she thought she would try the plan thi time of walk in the opposit direct it succeed beautifulli she had not been walk a minut befor she found herself face to face with the red queen and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aim at where do you come from said the red queen and where ar you go look up speak nice and don t twiddl your finger all the time alic attend to all these direct and explain as well as she could that she had lost her wai i don t know what you mean by your wai said the queen all the wai about here belong to mebut why did you come out here at all she ad in a kinder tone curtsei while you re think what to sai it save time alic wonder a littl at thi but she wa too much in aw of the queen to disbeliev it i ll try it when i go home she thought to herself the next time i m a littl late for dinner it s time for you to answer now the queen said look at her watch open your mouth a littl wider when you speak and alwai sai your majesti i onli want to see what the garden wa like your majesti that s right said the queen pat her on the head which alic didn t like at all though when you sai garden i ve seen garden compar with which thi would be a wilder alic didn t dare to argu the point but went on and i thought i d try and find my wai to the top of that hill when you sai hill the queen interrupt i could show you hill in comparison with which you d call that a vallei no i shouldn t said alic surpris into contradict her at last a hill can t be a vallei you know that would be nonsens the red queen shook her head you mai call it nonsens if you like she said but i ve heard nonsens compar with which that would be as sensibl as a dictionari alic curtsei again as she wa afraid from the queen s tone that she wa a littl offend and thei walk on in silenc till thei got to the top of the littl hill for some minut alic stood without speak look out in all direct over the countryand a most curiou countri it wa there were a number of tini littl brook run straight across it from side to side and the ground between wa divid up into squar by a number of littl green hedg that reach from brook to brook i declar it s mark out just like a larg chessboard alic said at last there ought to be some men move about somewhereand so there ar she ad in a tone of delight and her heart began to beat quick with excit as she went on it s a great huge game of chess that s be playedal over the worldif thi is the world at all you know oh what fun it is how i wish i wa on of them i wouldn t mind be a pawn if onli i might jointhough of cours i should like to be a queen best she glanc rather shyli at the real queen as she said thi but her companion onli smile pleasantli and said that s easili manag you can be the white queen s pawn if you like as lili s too young to plai and you re in the second squar to begin with when you get to the eighth squar you ll be a queen just at thi moment somehow or other thei began to run alic never could quit make out in think it over afterward how it wa that thei began all she rememb is that thei were run hand in hand and the queen went so fast that it wa all she could do to keep up with her and still the queen kept cry faster faster but alic felt she could not go faster though she had not breath left to sai so the most curiou part of the thing wa that the tree and the other thing round them never chang their place at all howev fast thei went thei never seem to pass anyth i wonder if all the thing move along with us thought poor puzzl alic and the queen seem to guess her thought for she cri faster don t try to talk not that alic had ani idea of do that she felt as if she would never be abl to talk again she wa get so much out of breath and still the queen cri faster faster and drag her along ar we nearli there alic manag to pant out at last nearli there the queen repeat why we pass it ten minut ago faster and thei ran on for a time in silenc with the wind whistl in alic s ear and almost blow her hair off her head she fanci now now cri the queen faster faster and thei went so fast that at last thei seem to skim through the air hardli touch the ground with their feet till suddenli just as alic wa get quit exhaust thei stop and she found herself sit on the ground breathless and giddi the queen prop her up against a tree and said kindli you mai rest a littl now alic look round her in great surpris why i do believ we ve been under thi tree the whole time everyth s just as it wa of cours it is said the queen what would you have it well in our countri said alic still pant a littl you d gener get to somewher elseif you ran veri fast for a long time as we ve been do a slow sort of countri said the queen now here you see it take all the run you can do to keep in the same place if you want to get somewher els you must run at least twice as fast as that i d rather not try pleas said alic i m quit content to stai hereonli i am so hot and thirsti i know what you d like the queen said goodnaturedli take a littl box out of her pocket have a biscuit alic thought it would not be civil to sai no though it wasn t at all what she want so she took it and at it as well as she could and it wa veri dry and she thought she had never been so nearli choke in all her life while you re refresh yourself said the queen i ll just take the measur and she took a ribbon out of her pocket mark in inch and began measur the ground and stick littl peg in here and there at the end of two yard she said put in a peg to mark the distanc i shall give you your directionshav anoth biscuit no thank you said alic on s quit enough thirst quench i hope said the queen alic did not know what to sai to thi but luckili the queen did not wait for an answer but went on at the end of three yard i shall repeat themfor fear of your forget them at the end of four i shall sai goodby and at the end of five i shall go she had got all the peg put in by thi time and alic look on with great interest as she return to the tree and then began slowli walk down the row at the twoyard peg she face round and said a pawn goe two squar in it first move you know so you ll go veri quickli through the third squarebi railwai i should thinkand you ll find yourself in the fourth squar in no time well that squar belong to tweedledum and tweedledeeth fifth is mostli waterth sixth belong to humpti dumptybut you make no remark ii didn t know i had to make onejust then alic falter out you should have said it s extrem kind of you to tell me all thi howev we ll suppos it saidth seventh squar is all foresthowev on of the knight will show you the wayand in the eighth squar we shall be queen togeth and it s all feast and fun alic got up and curtsei and sat down again at the next peg the queen turn again and thi time she said speak in french when you can t think of the english for a thingturn out your toe as you walkand rememb who you ar she did not wait for alic to curtsei thi time but walk on quickli to the next peg where she turn for a moment to sai goodby and then hurri on to the last how it happen alic never knew but exactli as she came to the last peg she wa gone whether she vanish into the air or whether she ran quickli into the wood and she can run veri fast thought alic there wa no wai of guess but she wa gone and alic began to rememb that she wa a pawn and that it would soon be time for her to move chapter iii lookingglass insect of cours the first thing to do wa to make a grand survei of the countri she

go back from here as luggag alic couldn t see who wa sit beyond the beetl but a hoars voic spoke next chang engin it said and wa oblig to leav off it sound like a hors alic thought to herself and an extrem small voic close to her ear said you might make a joke on thatsometh about hors and hoars you know then a veri gentl voic in the distanc said she must be label lass with care you know and after that other voic went on what a number of peopl there ar in the carriag thought alic sai she must go by post as she s got a head on her she must be sent as a messag by the telegraph she must draw the

sigh that she wouldn t have heard it at all if it hadn t come quit close to her ear the consequ of thi wa that it tickl her ear veri much and quit took off her thought from the unhappi of the poor littl creatur i know you ar a friend the littl voic went on a dear friend and an old friend and you won t hurt me though i am an insect what kind of insect alic inquir a littl anxious what she realli want to know wa whether it could sting or not but she thought thi wouldn t be quit a civil question to ask what then you don t the littl voic began when it wa drown by a shrill scream from the engin and everybodi jump up in alarm alic among the rest the hors who had put hi head out of the window quietli drew it in and said it s onli a brook we have to jump over everybodi seem satisfi with thi though alic felt a littl nervou at the idea of train jump at all howev it ll take us into the fourth squar that s some comfort she said to herself in anoth moment she felt the carriag rise straight up into the air and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand which happen to be the goat s beard but the beard seem to melt awai as she touch it and she found herself sit quietli under a treewhil the gnat for that wa the insect she had been talk to wa balanc itself on a twig just over her head and fan her with it wing it certainli wa a veri larg gnat about the size of a chicken alic thought still she couldn t feel nervou with it after thei had been talk togeth so long then you don t like all insect the gnat went on as quietli as if noth had happen i like them when thei can talk alic said none of them ever talk where i come from what sort of insect do you rejoic in where you come from the gnat inquir i don t rejoic in insect at all alic explain becaus i m rather afraid of

live on frumenti and minc pie the gnat repli and it make it nest in a christma box and then there s the butterfli alic went on after she had taken a good look at the insect with it head on fire and had thought to herself i wonder if that s the reason insect ar so fond of fly into candlesbecaus thei want to turn into snapdragonfli crawl at your feet said the gnat alic drew her feet back in some alarm you mai observ a breadandbutterfli it wing ar thin slice of breadandbutt it bodi is a crust and it head is a lump of sugar and what doe it live on weak tea with cream in it a new difficulti came into alic s head suppos it couldn t find ani she suggest then it would die of cours but that must happen veri often alic remark thoughtfulli it alwai happen said the gnat after thi alic wa silent for

your lesson that s a joke i wish you had made it why do you wish i had made it alic ask it s a veri bad on but the gnat onli sigh deepli while two larg tear came roll down it cheek you shouldn t make joke alic said if it make you so unhappi then came anoth of those melancholi littl sigh and thi time the poor gnat realli seem to have sigh itself awai for when alic look up there wa noth whatev to be seen on the twig and as she wa get quit chilli with sit still so long she got up and walk on she veri soon came to an open field with a wood on the other side of it it look much darker than the last wood and alic felt a littl timid about go into it howev on second thought she made up her mind to go on for i certainli won t go back she thought to herself and thi wa the onli wai to the eighth squar thi must be the wood she said thoughtfulli to herself where thing have no name i wonder what ll becom of my name when i go in i shouldn t like to lose it at allbecaus thei d have to give me anoth and it would be almost certain to be an ugli on but then the fun would be try to find the creatur that had got my old name that s just like the advertis you know when peopl lose dog answer to the name of

veri cool and shadi well at ani rate it s a great comfort she said as she step under the tree after be so hot to get into theinto what she went on rather surpris at not be abl to think of the word i mean to get under theunder theunder thi you know put her hand on the trunk of the tree what doe it call itself i wonder i do believ it s got no namewhi to be sure it hasn t she stood silent for a minut think then she suddenli began again then it realli ha happen after all and now who am i i will rememb if i can i m determin to do it but be determin didn t help much and all she could sai after a great deal of puzzl wa l i know it begin with l just then a fawn came wander by it look at alic with it larg gentl ey but didn t seem at all frighten here then here then alic said as she held out

littl i ll tell you if you ll move a littl further on the fawn said i can t rememb here so thei walk on togeth though the wood alic with her arm clasp lovingli round the soft neck of the fawn till thei came out into anoth open field and here the fawn gave a sudden bound into the air and shook itself free from alic s arm i m a fawn it cri out in a voic of delight and dear me you re a human child a sudden look of alarm came into it beauti brown ey and in anoth moment it had dart awai at full speed alic stood look after it almost readi to cry with vexat at have lost her dear littl fellowtravel so suddenli howev i know my name now she said that s some comfort alicealicei won t forget it again and now which of these fingerpost ought i to follow i wonder it wa not a veri difficult question to answer as there wa onli on road through the wood and the two fingerpost both point along it i ll settl it alic said to herself when the road divid and thei point differ wai but thi did not seem like to happen she went on and on a long wai but wherev the road divid there were sure to be two fingerpost point the same wai on mark to tweedledum s hous and the other to the hous of tweedlede i do believ said alic at last that thei live in the same hous i wonder i never thought of that beforebut i can t stai there long i ll just call and sai how d you do and ask them the wai out of the wood if i could onli get to the eighth squar befor it get dark so she wander on talk to herself as she went till on turn a sharp corner she came upon two fat littl men so suddenli that she could not help start back but in anoth moment she recov herself feel sure that thei must be chapter iv tweedledum and tweedlede thei were stand under a tree each with an arm round the other s neck and alic knew which wa which in a moment becaus on of them had dum embroid on hi collar and the other dee i suppos thei ve each got tweedl round at the back of the collar she said to herself thei stood so still that she quit forgot thei were aliv and she wa just look round to see if the word tweedl wa written at the back of each collar when she wa startl by a voic come from the on mark dum if you think we re waxwork he said you ought to pai you know waxwork weren t made to be look at for noth nohow contrariwis ad the on mark dee if you think we re aliv you ought to speak i m sure i m veri sorri wa all alic could sai for the word of the old song kept ring through her head like the tick of a clock and she could hardli help sai them out loud tweedledum and tweedlede agre to have a battl for tweedledum said tweedlede had spoil hi nice new rattl just then flew down a monstrou crow as black as a tarbarrel which frighten both the hero so thei quit forgot their quarrel i know what you re think about said tweedledum but it isn t so nohow contrariwis continu tweedlede if it wa so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isn t it ain t that s logic i wa think alic said veri polit which is the best wai out of thi wood it s get so dark would you tell me pleas but the littl men onli look at each other and grin thei look so exactli like a coupl of great schoolboi that alic couldn t help point her finger at tweedledum and sai first boi nohow tweedledum cri out briskli and shut hi mouth up again with a snap next boi said alic pass on to tweedlede though she felt quit certain he would onli shout out contrariwis and so he did you ve been wrong cri tweedledum the first thing in a visit is to sai how d ye do and shake hand and here the two brother gave each other a hug and then thei held out the two hand that were free to shake hand with her alic did not like shake hand with either of them first for fear of hurt the other on s feel so as the best wai out of the difficulti she took hold of both hand at onc the next moment thei were danc round in a ring thi seem quit natur she rememb afterward and she wa not even surpris to hear music plai it seem to come from the tree under which thei were danc and it wa done as well as she could make it out by the branch rub on across the other like fiddl and fiddlestick but it certainli wa funni alic said afterward when she wa tell her sister the histori of all thi to find myself sing here we go round the mulberri bush i don t know when i began it but somehow i felt as if i d been sing it a long long time the other two dancer were fat and veri soon out of breath four time round is enough for on danc tweedledum pant out and thei left off danc as suddenli as thei had begun the music stop at the same moment then thei let go of alic s hand and stood look at her for a minut there wa a rather awkward paus as alic didn t know how to begin a convers with peopl she had just been danc with it would never do to sai how d ye do now she said to herself we seem to have got beyond that somehow i hope you re not much tire she said at last nohow and thank you veri much for ask said tweedledum so much oblig ad tweedlede you like poetri yee pretti wellsom poetri alic said doubtfulli would you tell me which road lead out of the wood what shall i repeat to her said tweedlede look round at tweedledum with great solemn ey and not notic alic s question the walru and the carpent is the longest tweedledum repli give hi brother an affection hug tweedlede began instantli the sun wa shine here alic ventur to interrupt him if it s veri long she said as polit as she could would you pleas tell me first which road tweedlede smile gentli and began again the sun wa shine on the sea shine with all hi might he did hi veri best to make the billow smooth and bright and thi wa odd becaus it wa the middl of the night the moon wa shine sulkili becaus she thought the sun had got no busi to be there after the dai wa done it s veri rude of him she said to come and spoil the fun the sea wa wet as wet could be the sand were dry as dry you could not see a cloud becaus no cloud wa in the sky no bird were fly over head there were no bird to fly the walru and the carpent were walk close at hand thei wept like anyth to see such quantiti of sand if thi were onli clear awai thei said it would be grand if seven maid with seven mop swept it for half a year do you suppos the walru said that thei could get it clear i doubt it said the carpent and shed a bitter tear o oyster come and walk with us the walru did beseech a pleasant walk a pleasant talk along the brini beach we cannot do with more than four to give a hand to each the eldest oyster look at him but never a word he said the eldest oyster wink hi ey and shook hi heavi head mean to sai he did not choos to leav the oysterb but four young oyster hurri up all eager for the treat their coat were brush their face wash their shoe were clean and neat and thi wa odd becaus you know thei hadn t ani feet four other oyster follow them and yet anoth four and thick and fast thei came at last and more and more and more all hop through the frothi wave and scrambl to the shore the walru and the carpent walk on a mile or so and then thei rest on a rock conveni low and all the littl oyster stood and wait in a row the time ha come the walru said to talk of mani thing of shoesand shipsand sealingwax of cabbagesand king and why the sea is boil hot and whether pig have wing but wait a bit the oyster cri befor we have our chat for some of us ar out of breath and all of us ar fat no hurri said the carpent thei thank him much for that a loaf of bread the walru said is what we chiefli need pepper and vinegar besid ar veri good inde now if you re readi oyster dear we can begin to feed but not on us the oyster cri turn a littl blue after such kind that would be a dismal thing to do the night is fine the walru said do you admir the view it wa so kind of you to come and you ar veri nice the carpent said noth but cut us anoth slice i wish you were not quit so deaf i ve had to ask you twice it seem a shame the walru said to plai them such a trick after we ve brought them out so far and made them trot so quick the carpent said noth but the butter s spread too thick i weep for you the walru said i deepli sympath with sob and tear he sort out those of the largest size hold hi pocket handkerchief befor hi stream ey o oyster said the carpent you ve had a pleasant run shall we be trot home again but answer came there none and that wa scarc odd becaus thei d eaten everi on i like the walru best said alic becaus you see he wa a littl sorri for the poor oyster he at more than the carpent though said tweedlede you see he held hi handkerchief in front so that the carpent couldn t count how mani he took contrariwis that wa mean alic said indignantli then i like the carpent bestif he didn t eat so mani as the walru but he at as mani as he could get said tweedledum thi wa a puzzler after a paus alic began well thei were both veri unpleas charact here she check herself in some alarm at hear someth that sound to her like the puf of a larg steamengin in the wood near

littl so there wa no more convers for a minut or two while the boat glide gentli on sometim among bed of weed which made the oar stick fast in the water wors then ever and sometim under tree but alwai with the same tall riverbank frown over their head oh pleas there ar some scent rush alic cri in a sudden transport of delight there realli areand such beauti you needn t sai pleas to me about em the sheep said without look up from her knit i didn t put em there and i m not go to take em awai no but i meantpleas mai we wait and pick some alic plead if you don t mind stop the boat for a minut how

were carefulli roll up and the littl arm were plung in elbowdeep to get the rush a good long wai down befor break them offand for a while alic forgot all about the sheep and the knit as she bent over the side of the boat with just the end of her tangl hair dip into the waterwhil with bright eager ey she caught at on bunch after anoth of the darl scent rush i onli hope the boat won t tippl over she said to herself oh what a love on onli i couldn t quit reach it and it certainli did seem a littl provok almost as if it happen on purpos she thought that though she manag to pick plenti of beauti rush as the boat glide by there wa alwai a more love on that she couldn t reach the prettiest ar alwai further she said at last with a sigh at the obstinaci of the rush in grow so far off as with flush cheek and drip hair and hand she scrambl back into her place and began to arrang her newfound treasur what matter it to her just then that the rush had begun to fade and to lose all their scent and beauti from the veri moment that she pick them even real scent rush you know last onli a veri littl whileand these be dreamrush melt awai almost like snow as thei lai in heap at her feetbut alic hardli notic thi there were so mani other curiou thing to think about thei hadn t gone much farther befor the blade of on of the oar got fast in the water and wouldn t come out again so alic explain it afterward and the consequ wa that the handl of it caught her under the chin and in spite of a seri of littl shriek of oh oh oh from poor alic it swept her straight off the seat and down among the heap of rush howev she wasn t hurt and wa soon up again the sheep went on with her knit all the while just as if noth had happen that wa a nice crab you caught she remark as alic got back into her place veri much reliev to find herself still in the boat wa it i didn t see it said alic peep cautious over the side of the boat into the dark water i wish it hadn t let goi should so like to see a littl crab to take home with me but the sheep onli laugh scornfulli and went on with her knit ar there mani crab here said alic crab and all sort of thing said the sheep plenti of choic onli make up your mind now what do you want to bui to bui alic echo in a tone that wa half astonish and half frightenedfor the oar and the boat and the river had vanish all in a moment and she wa back again in the

you know the sheep took the monei and put it awai in a box then she said i never put thing into peopl s handsthat would never doyou must get it for yourself and so sai she went off to the other end of the shop and set the egg upright on a shelf i wonder why it wouldn t do thought alic as she grope her wai among the tabl and chair for the shop wa veri dark toward the end the egg seem to get further awai the more i walk toward it let me see is thi a chair why it s got branch i declar how veri odd to find tree grow here and actual here s a littl brook well thi is the veri queerest shop i ever saw

given the lion twice as much as me she s kept none for herself anyhow said the lion do you like plumcak monster but befor alic could answer him the drum began where the nois came from she couldn t make out the air seem full of it and it rang through and through her head till she felt quit deafen she start to her feet and sprang across the littl brook in her terror and had just time to see the lion and the unicorn rise to their feet with angri look at be interrupt in their feast befor she drop to her knee and put her hand over her ear vainli try to shut out the dread uproar if that doesn t

the other he knock him off hi hors and if he miss he tumbl off himselfand anoth rule seem to be that thei hold their club with their arm as if thei were punch and judywhat a nois thei make when thei tumbl just like a whole set of fireiron fall into the fender and how quiet the hors ar thei let them get on and off them just as if thei were tabl anoth rule of battl that alic had not notic seem to be that thei alwai fell on their head and the battl end with their both fall off in thi wai side by side when thei got up again thei shook hand and then the red knight mount and gallop off it wa a
