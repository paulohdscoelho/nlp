settl first at hull he got a good estat by merchandis and leav off hi trade live afterward at york from whenc he had marri my mother whose relat were name robinson a veri good famili in that countri and from whom i wa call robinson kreutznaer but by the usual corrupt of word in england we ar now call nai we call ourselv and write our name cruso and so my companion alwai call me i had two elder brother on of which wa lieutenantcolonel to an english regiment of foot in flander formerli command by the famou colonel lockhart and wa kill at the battl near dunkirk against the spaniard what becam of my second brother i never knew ani more than my father or mother did know what wa becom of me be the third son of the famili and not bred to ani trade my head began to be fill veri earli with rambl thought my father who wa veri ancient had given me a compet share of learn as far as hous educ and a countri freeschool gener go and design me for the law but i would be satisfi with noth but go to sea and my inclin to thi led me so strongli against the will nai the command of my father and against all the entreati and persuas of my mother and other friend that there seem to be someth fatal in that propens of natur tend directli to the life of miseri which wa to befal me my father a wise and grave man gave me seriou and excel counsel against what he foresaw wa my design he call me on morn into hi chamber where he wa confin by the gout and expostul veri warmli with me upon thi subject he ask me what reason more than a mere wander inclin i had for leav my father hous and my nativ countri where i might be well introduc and had a prospect of rais my fortun by applic and industri with a life of eas and pleasur he told me it wa for men of desper fortun on on hand or of aspir superior fortun on the other who went abroad upon adventur to rise by enterpris and make themselv famou in undertak of a natur out of the common road that these thing were all either too far abov me or too far below me that mine wa the middl state or what might be call the upper station of low life which he had found by long experi wa the best state in the world the most suit to human happi not expos to the miseri and hardship the labour and suffer of the mechan part of mankind and not embarrass with the pride luxuri ambit and envi of the upper part of mankind he told me i might judg of the happi of thi state by thi on thing viz that thi wa the state of life which all other peopl envi that king have frequent lament the miser consequ of be born to great thing and wish thei had been place in the middl of the two extrem between the mean and the great that the wise man gave hi testimoni to thi as the just standard of true felic when he prai to have neither poverti nor rich he bid me observ it and i should alwai find that the calam of life were share among the upper and lower part of mankind but that the middl station had the fewest disast and wa not expos to so mani vicissitud as the higher or lower part of mankind nai thei were not subject to so mani distemp and uneasi either of bodi or mind as those were who by viciou live luxuri and extravag on on hand or by hard labour want of necessari and mean or insuffici diet on the other hand bring distemp upon themselv by the natur consequ of their wai of live that the middl station of life wa calcul for all kind of virtu and all kind of enjoy that peac and plenti were the handmaid of a middl fortun that temper moder quiet health societi all agreeabl divers and all desir pleasur were the bless attend the middl station of life that thi wai men went silent and smoothli through the world and comfort out of it not embarrass with the labour of the hand or of the head not sold to the life of slaveri for daili bread or harass with perplex circumst which rob the soul of peac and the bodi of rest not enrag with the passion of envi or secret burn lust of ambit for great thing but in easi circumst slide gentli through the world and sensibl tast the sweet of live without the bitter feel that thei ar happi and learn by everi dai experi to know it more sensibl after thi he press me earnestli and in the most affection manner not to plai the young man not to precipit myself into miseri which natur and the station of life i wa born in seem to have provid against that i wa under no necess of seek my bread that he would do well for me and endeavour to enter me fairli into the station of life which he had been just recommend to me and that if i wa not veri easi and happi in the world it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it and that he should have noth to answer for have thu discharg hi duti in warn me against measur which he knew would be to my hurt in a word that as he would do veri kind thing for me if i would stai and settl at home as he direct so he would not have so much hand in my misfortun as to give me ani encourag to go awai and to close all he told me i had my elder brother for an exampl to whom he had us the same earnest persuas to keep him from go into the low countri war but could not prevail hi young desir prompt him to run into the armi where he wa kill and though he said he would not ceas to prai for me yet he would ventur to sai to me that if i did take thi foolish step god would not bless me and i would have leisur hereaft to reflect upon have neglect hi counsel when there might be none to assist in my recoveri i observ in thi last part of hi discours which wa truli prophet though i suppos my father did not know it to be so himself i sai i observ the tear run down hi face veri plentifulli and especi when he spoke of my brother who wa kill and that when he spoke of my have leisur to repent and none to assist me he wa so move that he broke off the discours and told me hi heart wa so full he could sai no more to me i wa sincer affect with thi discours as inde who could be otherwis and i resolv not to think of go abroad ani more but to settl at home accord to my father desir but ala a few dai wore it all off and in short to prevent ani of my father farther importun in a few week after i resolv to run quit awai from him howev i did not act so hastili neither as my first heat of resolut prompt but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a littl pleasant than ordinari and told her that my thought were so entir bent upon see the world that i should never settl to ani thing with resolut enough to go through with it and my father had better give me hi consent than forc me to go without it that i wa now eighteen year old which wa too late to go apprentic to a trade or clerk to an attornei that i wa sure if i did i should never serv out my time and i should certainli run awai from my master befor my time wa out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go on voyag abroad if i came home again and did not like it i would go no more and i would promis by a doubl dilig to recov that time i had lost thi put my mother into a great passion she told me she knew it would be to no purpos to speak to my father upon ani such subject that he knew too well what wa my interest to give hi consent to ani such thing so much for my hurt and that she wonder how i could think of ani such thing after such a discours as i had had with my father and such kind and tender express as she knew my father had us to me and that in short if i would ruin myself there wa no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruct and i should never have it to sai that my mother wa will when my father wa not though my mother refus to move it to my father yet as i have heard afterward she report all the discours to him and that my father after shew a great concern at it said to her with a sigh that boi might be happi if he would stai at home but if he goe abroad he will be the most miser wretch that wa ever born i can give no consent to it it wa not till almost a year after thi that i broke loos though in the meantim i continu obstin deaf to all propos of settl to busi and frequent expostul with my father and mother about their be so posit determin against what thei knew my inclin prompt me to but be on dai at hull where i went casual and without ani purpos of make an elop that time but i sai be there and on of my companion be go by sea to london in hi father ship and prompt me to go with them with the common allur of seafar men viz that it should cost me noth for my passag i consult neither father or mother ani more not so much as sent them word of it but leav them to hear of it as thei might without ask god bless or my father without ani consider of circumst or consequ and in an ill hour god know on the first of septemb i went on board a ship bound for london never ani young adventur misfortun i believ began sooner or continu longer than mine the ship wa no sooner gotten out of the humber but the wind began to blow and the wave to rise in a most fright manner and as i had never been at sea befor i wa most inexpress sick in bodi and terrifi in mind i began now serious to reflect upon what i had done and how justli i wa overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wick leav my father hous and abandon my duti all the good counsel of my parent my father tear and my mother entreati came now fresh into my mind and my conscienc which wa not yet come to the pitch of hard to which it ha been sinc reproach me with the contempt of advic and the breach of my duti to god and my father all thi while the storm increas and the sea which i had never been upon befor went veri high though noth like what i have seen mani time sinc no nor like what i saw a few dai after but it wa enough to affect me then who wa but a young sailor and had never known ani thing of the matter i expect everi wave would have swallow us up and that everi time the ship fell down as i thought in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more and in thi agoni of mind i made mani vow and resolut that if it would pleas god here to spare my life thi on voyag if ever i got onc my foot upon dry land again i would go directli home to my father and never set it into a ship again while i live that i would take hi advic and never run myself into such miseri as these ani more now i saw plainli the good of hi observ about the middl station of life how easi how comfort he had live all hi dai and never had been expos to tempest at sea or troubl on shore and i resolv that i would like a true repent prodig go home to my father these wise and sober thought continu all the while the storm continu and inde some time after but the next dai the wind wa abat and the sea calmer and i began to be a littl inur to it howev i wa veri grave for all that dai be also a littl seasick still but toward night the weather clear up the wind wa quit over and a charm fine even follow the sun went down perfectli clear and rose so the next morn and have littl or no wind and a smooth sea the sun shine upon it the sight wa as i thought the most delight that ever i saw i had slept well in the night and wa now no more seasick but veri cheer look with wonder upon the sea that wa so rough and terribl the dai befor and could be so calm and so pleasant in so littl time after and now lest my good resolut should continu my companion who had inde entic me awai come to me well bob sai he clap me upon the shoulder how do you do after it i warrant you were fright want you last night when it blew but a cap of winda cap do you call it said i it wa a terribl storma storm you fool you repli he do you call that a storm why it wa noth at all give us but a good ship and searoom and we think noth of such a squall of wind as that but your but a freshwat sailor bob come let us make a bowl of punch and well forget all that do you see what charm weather it is now to make short thi sad part of my stori we went the old wai of all sailor the punch wa made and i wa made drunk with it and in that on night wicked i drown all my repent all my reflect upon my past conduct and all my resolut for my futur in a word as the sea wa return to it smooth of surfac and settl calm by the abat of that storm so the hurri of my thought be over my fear and apprehens of be swallow up by the sea be forgotten and the current of my former desir return i entir forgot the vow and promis that i made in my distress i found inde some interv of reflect and the seriou thought did as it were endeavour to return again sometim but i shook them off and rous myself from them as it were from a distemp and appli myself to drink and compani soon master the return of those fit for so i call them and i had in five or six dai got as complet a victori over conscienc as ani young fellow that resolv not to be troubl with it could desir but i wa to have anoth trial for it still and provid as in such case gener it doe resolv to leav me entir without excus for if i would not take thi for a deliver the next wa to be such a on as the worst and most harden wretch among us would confess both the danger and the merci the sixth dai of our be at sea we came into yarmouth road the wind have been contrari and the weather calm we had made but littl wai sinc the storm here we were oblig to come to anchor and here we lai the wind continu contrari viz at southwest for seven or eight dai dure which time a great mani ship from newcastl came into the same road as the common harbour where the ship might wait for a wind for the river we had not howev rid here so long but should have tide it up the river but that the wind blew too fresh and after we had lain four or five dai blew veri hard howev the road be reckon as good as a harbour the anchorag good and our ground tackl veri strong our men were unconcern and not in the least apprehens of danger but spent the time in rest and mirth after the manner of the sea but the eighth dai in the morn the wind increas and we had all hand at work to strike our topmast and make everi thing snug and close that the ship might ride as easi as possibl by noon the sea went veri high inde and our ship rid forecastl in ship sever sea and we thought onc or twice our anchor had come home upon which our master order out the sheet anchor so that we rode with two anchor ahead and the cabl veer out to the better end by thi time it blew a terribl storm inde and now i began to see terror and amaz in the face even of the seamen themselv the master though vigil in the busi of preserv the ship yet as he went in and out of hi cabin by me i could hear him softli to himself sai sever time lord be merci to us we shall be all lost we shall be all undon and the like dure these first hurri i wa stupid ly still in my cabin which wa in the steerag and cannot describ my temper i could ill reassum the first penit which i had so appar trampl upon and harden myself against i thought the bitter of death had been past and that thi would be noth like the first but when the master himself came by me as i said just now and said we should be all lost i wa dreadfulli fright i got up out of my cabin and look out but such a dismal sight i never saw the sea went mountain high and broke upon us everi three or four minut when i could look about i could see noth but distress round us two ship that rid near us we found had cut their mast by the board be deep loaden and our men cri out that a ship which rid about a mile ahead of us wa founder two more ship be driven from their anchor were run out of the road to sea at all adventur and that with not a mast stand the light ship fare the best as not so much labour in the sea but two or three of them drove and came close by us run awai with onli their spritsail out befor the wind toward even the mate and boatswain beg the master of our ship to let them cut awai the foremast which he wa veri unwil to do but the boatswain protest to him that if he did not the ship would founder he consent and when thei had cut awai the foremast the mainmast stood so loos and shook the ship so much thei were oblig to cut her awai also and make a clear deck ani on mai judg what a condit i must be in at all thi who wa but a young sailor and who had been in such a fright befor at but a littl but if i can express at thi distanc the thought i had about me at that time i wa in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convict and the have return from them to the resolut i had wickedli taken at first than i wa at death itself and these ad to the terror of the storm put me in such a condit that i can by no word describ it but the worst wa not come yet the storm continu with such furi that the seamen themselv acknowledg thei had never known a wors we had a good ship but she wa deep loaden and wallow in the sea that the seamen everi now and then cri out she would founder it wa my advantag in on respect that i did not know what thei meant by founder till i inquir howev the storm wa so violent that i saw what is not often seen the master the boatswain and some other more sensibl than the rest at their prayer and expect everi moment when the ship would go to the bottom in the middl of the night and under all the rest of our distress on of the men that had been down on purpos to see cri out we had sprang a leak anoth said there wa four foot water in the hold then all hand were call to the pump at that veri word my heart as i thought di within me and i fell backward upon the side of my bed where i sat into the cabin howev the men rous me and told me that i that wa abl to do noth befor wa as well abl to pump as anoth at which i stir up and went to the pump and work veri heartili while thi wa do the master see some light collier who not abl to ride out the storm were oblig to slip and run awai to sea and would come near us order to fire a gun as a signal of distress i who knew noth what that meant wa so surpris that i thought the ship had broke or some dread thing happen in a word i wa so surpris that i fell down in a swoon as thi wa a time when everi bodi had hi own life to think of nobodi mind me or what wa becom of me but anoth man stept up to the pump and thrust me asid with hi foot let me lie think i had been dead and it wa a great while befor i came to myself we work on but the water increas in the hold it wa appar that the ship would founder and though the storm began to abat a littl yet as it wa not possibl she could swim till we might run into a port so the master continu fire gun for help and a light ship who had rid it out just ahead of us ventur a boat out to help us it wa with the utmost hazard the boat came near us but it wa imposs for as to get on board or for the boat to lie near the ship side till at last the men row veri heartili and ventur their live to save our our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoi to it and then veer it out a great length which thei after great labour and hazard took hold of and we haul them close under our stern and got all into their boat it wa to no purpos for them or us after we were in the boat to think of reach to their own ship so all agre to let her drive and onli to pull her in toward shore as much as we could and our master promis them that if the boat wa stave upon shore he would make it good to their master so partli row and partli drive our boat went awai to the northward slope toward the shore almost as far as winterton we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship but we saw her sink and then i understood for the first time what wa meant by a ship founder in the sea i must acknowledg i had hardli ey to look up when the seamen told me she wa sink for from that moment thei rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in my heart wa as it were dead within me partli with fright partli with horror of mind and the thought of what wa yet befor me while we were in thi condit the men yet labour at the oar to bring the boat near the shore we could see when our boat mount the wave we were abl to see the shore a great mani peopl run along the shore to assist us when we should come near but we made but slow wai toward the shore nor were we abl to reach the shore till be past the lighthous at winterton the shore fall off to the westward toward cromer and so the land broke off a littl the violenc of the wind here we got in and though not without much difficulti got all safe on shore and walk afterward on foot to yarmouth where as unfortun men we were us with great human as well by the magistr of the town who assign us good quarter as by particular merchant and owner of ship and had monei given us suffici to carri us either to london or back to hull as we thought fit had i now had the sens to have gone back to hull and have gone home i had been happi and my father an emblem of our bless saviour parabl had even kill the fat calf for me for hear the ship i went awai in wa cast awai in yarmouth road it wa a great while befor he had ani assur that i wa not drown but my ill fate push me on now with an obstinaci that noth could resist and though i had sever time loud call from my reason and my more compos judgment to go home yet i had no power to do it i know not what to call thi nor will i urg that it is a secret overrul decre that hurri us on to be the instrument of our own destruct even though it be befor us and that we push upon it with our ey open certainli noth but some such decre unavoid miseri attend and which it wa imposs for me to escap could have push me forward against the calm reason and persuas of my most retir thought and against two such visibl instruct as i had met with in my first attempt my comrad who had help to harden me befor and who wa the master son wa now less forward than i the first time he spoke to me after we were at yarmouth which wa not till two or three dai for we were separ in the town to sever quarter i sai the first time he saw me it appear hi tone wa alter and look veri melancholi and shake hi head ask me how i did and tell hi father who i wa and how i had come thi voyag onli for a trial in order to go farther abroad hi father turn to me with a veri grave and concern tone young man sai he you ought never to go to sea ani more you ought to take thi for a plain and visibl token that you ar not to be a seafar manwhi sir said i will you go to sea no more that is anoth case said he it is my call and therefor my duti but as you made thi voyag for a trial you see what a tast heaven ha given you of what you ar to expect if you persist perhap thi is all befallen us on your account like jonah in the ship of tarshish prai continu he what ar you and on what account did you go to sea upon that i told him some of my stori at the end of which he burst out with a strang kind of passion what had i done sai he that such an unhappi wretch should come into my ship i would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pound thi inde wa as i said an excurs of hi spirit which were yet agit by the sens of hi loss and wa farther than he could have author to go howev he afterward talk veri grave to me exhort me to go back to my father and not tempt provid to my ruin told me i might see a visibl hand of heaven against me and young man said he depend upon it if you do not go back wherev you go you will meet with noth but disast and disappoint till your father word ar fulfil upon you we part soon after for i made him littl answer and i saw him no more which wai he went i know not as for me have some monei in my pocket i travel to london by land and there as well as on the road had mani struggl with myself what cours of life i should take and whether i should go home or go to sea as to go home shame oppos the best motion that offer to my thought and it immedi occur to me how i should be laugh at among the neighbour and should be asham to see not my father and mother onli but even everi bodi els from whenc i have sinc often observ how incongru and irrat the common temper of mankind is especi of youth to that reason which ought to guid them in such case viz that thei ar not asham to sin and yet ar asham to repent nor asham of the action for which thei ought justli to be esteem fool but ar asham of the return which onli can make them be esteem wise men in thi state of life howev i remain some time uncertain what measur to take and what cours of life to lead an irresist reluct continu to go home and as i stai a while the remembr of the distress i had been in wore off and as that abat the littl motion i had in my desir to a return wore off with it till at last i quit laid asid the thought of it and look out for a voyag that evil influenc which carri me first awai from my father hous that hurri me into the wild and indigest notion of rais my fortun and that impress those conceit so forcibl upon me as to make me deaf to all good advic and to the entreati and even the command of my father i sai the same influenc whatev it wa present the most unfortun of all enterpris to my view and i went on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa or as our sailor vulgarli call it a voyag to guinea it wa my great misfortun that in all these adventur i did not ship myself as a sailor wherebi though i might inde have work a littl harder than ordinari yet at the same time i had learnt the duti and offic of a foremastman and in time might have qualifi myself for a mate or lieuten if not for a master but as it wa alwai my fate to choos for the wors so i did here for have monei in my pocket and good cloth upon my back i would alwai go on board in the habit of a gentleman and so i neither had ani busi in the ship or learnt to do ani it wa my lot first of all to fall into pretti good compani in london which doe not alwai happen to such loos and unguid young fellow as i then wa the devil gener not omit to lai some snare for them veri earli but it wa not so with me i first fell acquaint with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of guinea and who have had veri good success there wa resolv to go again and who take a fanci to my convers which wa not at all disagre at that time hear me sai i had a mind to see the world told me if i would go the voyag with him i should be at no expens i should be hi messmat and hi companion and if i could carri ani thing with me i should have all the advantag of it that the trade would admit and perhap i might meet with some encourag i embrac the offer and enter into a strict friendship with thi captain who wa an honest and plaindeal man i went the voyag with him and carri a small adventur with me which by the disinterest honesti of my friend the captain i increas veri consider for i carri about l in such toi and trifl as the captain direct me to bui thi l i had muster togeth by the assist of some of my relat whom i correspond with and who i believ got my father or at least my mother to contribut so much as that to my first adventur thi wa the onli voyag which i mai sai wa success in all my adventur and which i ow to the integr and honesti of my friend the captain under whom also i got a compet knowledg of the mathemat and the rule of navig learnt how to keep an account of the ship cours take an observ and in short to understand some thing that were need to be understood by a sailor for as he took delight to instruct me i took delight to learn and in a word thi voyag made me both a sailor and a merchant for i brought home five pound nine ounc of golddust for my adventur which yield me in london at my return almost l and thi fill me with those aspir thought which have so complet my ruin yet even in thi voyag i had my misfortun too particularli that i wa continu sick be thrown into a violent calentur by the excess heat of the climat our princip trade be upon the coast from the latitud of degre north even to the line itself i wa now set up for a guinea trader and my friend to my great misfortun dy soon after hi arriv i resolv to go the same voyag again and i embark in the same vessel with on who wa hi mate in the former voyag and had now got the command of the ship thi wa the unhappiest voyag that ever man made for though i did not carri quit l of my newgain wealth so that i had l left and which i lodg with my friend widow who wa veri just to me yet i fell into terribl misfortun in thi voyag and the first wa thi viz our ship make her cours toward the canari island or rather between those island and the african shore wa surpris in the grei of the morn by a turkish rover of salle who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make we crowd also as much canvass as our yard would spread or our mast carri to have got clear but find the pirat gain upon us and would certainli come up with us in a few hour we prepar to fight our ship have twelv gun and the rogu eighteen about three in the afternoon he came up with us and bring to by mistak just athwart our quarter instead of athwart our stern as he intend we brought eight of our gun to bear on that side and pour in a broadsid upon him which made him sheer off again after return our fire and pour in also hi smallshot from near men which he had on board howev we had not a man touch all our men keep close he prepar to attack us again and we to defend ourselv but lai us on board the next time upon our other quarter he enter sixti men upon our deck who immedi fell to cut and hack the deck and rig we pli them with smallshot halfpik powdercheat and such like and clear our deck of them twice howev to cut short thi melancholi part of our stori our ship be disabl and three of our men kill and eight wound we were oblig to yield and were carri all prison into salle a port belong to the moor the usag i had there wa not so dread as at first i apprehend nor wa i carri up the countri to the emperor court as the rest of our men were but wa kept by the captain of the rover as hi proper prize and made hi slave be young and nimbl and fit for hi busi at thi surpris chang of my circumst from a merchant to a miser slave i wa perfectli overwhelm and now i look back upon my father prophet discours to me that i should be miser and have none to reliev me which i thought wa now so effectu brought to pass that i could not be wors that now the hand of heaven had overtaken me and i wa undon without redempt but ala thi wa but a tast of the miseri i wa to go through as will appear in the sequel of thi stori as my new patron or master had taken me home to hi hous so i wa in hope that he would take me with him when he went to sea again believ that it would sometim or other be hi fate to be taken by a spanish or portug man of war and that then i should be set at liberti but thi hope of mine wa soon taken awai for when he went to sea he left me on shore to look after hi littl garden and do the common drudgeri of slave about hi hous and when he came home again from hi cruis he order me to be in the cabin to look after the ship here i medit noth but my escap and what method i might take to effect it but found no wai that had the least probabl in it noth present to make the supposit of it ration for i had nobodi to commun it to that would embark with me no fellow slave no englishman irishman or scotsman there but myself so that for two year though i often pleas myself with the imagin yet i never had the least encourag prospect of put it in practic after about two year an odd circumst present itself which put the old thought of make some attempt for my liberti again in my head my patron ly at home longer than usual without fit out hi ship which as i heard wa for want of monei he us constantli onc or twice a week sometim often if the weather wa fair to take the ship pinnac and go out into the road afish and as he alwai took me and a young maresco with him to row the boat we made him veri merri and i prove veri dexter in catch fish insomuch that sometim he would send me with a moor on of hi kinsmen and the youth the maresco as thei call him to catch a dish of fish for him it happen on time that go afish in a stark calm morn a fog rose so thick that though we were not half a leagu from the shore we lost sight of it and row we knew not whither or which wai we labour all dai and all the next night and when the morn came we found we had pull off to sea instead of pull in for the shore and that we were at least two leagu from the shore howev we got well in again though with a great deal of labour and some danger for the wind began to blow pretti fresh in the morn but particularli we were all veri hungri but our patron warn by thi disast resolv to take more care of himself for the futur and have ly by him the longboat of our english ship he had taken he resolv he would not go afish ani more without a compass and some provis so he order the carpent of hi ship who also wa an english slave to build a littl stateroom or cabin in the middl of the longboat like that of a barg with a place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the mainsheet and room befor for a hand or two to stand and work the sail she sail with that we call a shoulder of mutton sail and the boom gibe over the top of the cabin which lai veri snug and low and had in it room for him to lie with a slave or two and a tabl to eat on with some small locker to put in some bottl of such liquor as he thought fit to drink particularli hi bread rice and coffe we went frequent out with thi boat afish and as i wa most dexter to catch fish for him he never went without me it happen that he had appoint to go out in thi boat either for pleasur or for fish with two or three moor of some distinct in that place and for whom he had provid extraordinarili and had therefor sent on board the boat overnight a larger store of provis than ordinari and had order me to get readi three fuze with powder and shot which were on board hi ship for that thei design some sport of fowl as well as fish i got all thing readi as he had direct and wait the next morn with the boat wash clean her ancient and pendant out and everi thing to accommod hi guest when by and by my patron came on board alon and told me hi guest had put off go upon some busi that fell out and order me with the man and boi as usual to go out with the boat and catch them some fish for that hi friend were to sup at hi hous and command that as soon as i got some fish i should bring it home to hi hous all which i prepar to do thi moment my former notion of deliver dart into my thought for now i found i wa like to have a littl ship at my command and my master be gone i prepar to furnish myself not for fish busi but for a voyag though i knew not neither did i so much as consid whither i should steer for ani where to get out of that place wa my wai my first contriv wa to make a pretenc to speak to thi moor to get someth for our subsist on board for i told him we must not presum to eat of our patron bread he said that wa true so he brought a larg basket of rusk or bisket of their kind and three jar with fresh water into the boat i knew where my patron case of bottl stood which it wa evid by the make were taken out of some english prize and i convei them into the boat while the moor wa on shore as if thei had been there befor for our master i convei also a great lump of beeswax into the boat which weigh abov half a hundr weight with a parcel of twine or thread a hatchet a saw and a hammer all which were of great us to us afterward especi the wax to make candl anoth trick i tri upon him which he innoc came into also hi name wa ismael whom thei call muli or molei so i call to him molei said i our patron gun ar on board the boat can you not get a littl powder and shot it mai be we mai kill some alcami a fowl like our curlew for ourselv for i know he keep the gunner store in the shipy sai he ill bring some and accordingli he brought a great leather pouch which held about a pound and a half of powder or rather more and anoth with shot that had five or six pound with some bullet and put all into the boat at the same time i had found some powder of my master in the great cabin with which i fill on of the larg bottl in the case which wa almost empti pour what wa in it into anoth and thu furnish with everi thing need we sail out of the port to fish the castl which is at the entranc of the port knew who we were and took no notic of us and we were not abov a mile out of the port befor we hale in our sail and set us down to fish the wind blew from the nne which wa contrari to my desir for had it blown southerli i had been sure to have made the coast of spain and at last reach to the bai of cadiz but my resolut were blow which wai it would i would be gone from that horrid place where i wa and leav the rest to fate after we had fish some time and catch noth for when i had fish on my hook i would not pull them up that he might not see them i said to the moor thi will not do our master will not be thu serv we must stand farther off he think no harm agre and be in the head of the boat set the sail and as i had the helm i ran the boat out near a leagu farther and then brought her to as if i would fish when give the boi the helm i step forward to where the moor wa and make as if i stoop for someth behind him i took him by surpris with my arm under hi twist and toss him clear overboard into the sea he rose immedi for he swam like a cork and call to me beg to be taken in told me he would go all over the world with me he swam so strong after the boat that he would have reach me veri quickli there be but littl wind upon which i step into the cabin and fetch on of the fowlingpiec i present it at him and told him i had done him no hurt and if he would be quiet i would do him none but said i you swim well enough to reach to the shore and the sea is calm make the best of your wai to shore and i will do you no harm but if you come near the boat ill shoot you through the head for i am resolv to have my liberti so he turn himself about and swam for the shore and i make no doubt but he reach it with eas for he wa an excel swimmer i could have been content to have taken thi moor with me and have drown the boi but there wa no ventur to trust him when he wa gone i turn to the boi whom thei call xuri and said to him xuri if you will be faith to me ill make you a great man but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me that is swear by mahomet and hi father beard i must throw you into the sea too the boi smile in my face and spoke so innoc that i could not mistrust him and swore to be faith to me and go all over the world with me while i wa in view of the moor that wa swim i stood out directli to sea with the boat rather stretch to windward that thei might think me gone toward the strait mouth as inde ani on that had been in their wit must have been suppos to do for who would have suppos we were sail on to the southward to the truli barbarian coast where whole nation of negro were sure to surround us with the cano and destroi us where we could never onc go on shore but we should be devour by savag beast or more merciless savag of human kind but as soon as it grew dusk in the even i chang my cours and steer directli south and by east bend my cours a littl toward the east that i might keep in with the shore and have a fair fresh gale of wind and a smooth quiet sea i made such sail that i believ by the next dai at three oclock in the afternoon when i first made the land i could not be less than mile south of salle quit beyond the emperor of morocco dominion or inde of ani other king thereabout for we saw no peopl yet such wa the fright i had taken at the moor and the dread apprehens i had of fall into their hand that i would not stop or go on shore or come to an anchor the wind continu fair till i had sail in that manner five dai and then the wind shift to the southward i conclud also that if ani of our vessel were in chase of me thei also would now give over so i ventur to make to the coast and come to an anchor in the mouth of a littl river i knew not what or where neither what latitud what countri what nation or what river i neither saw or desir to see ani peopl the princip thing i want wa fresh water we came into thi creek in the even resolv to swim on shore as soon as it wa dark and discov the countri but as soon as it wa quit dark we heard such dread nois of the bark roar and howl of wild creatur of we knew not what kind that the poor boi wa readi to die with fear and beg of me not to go on shore till dai well xuri said i then i wont but it mai be we mai see men by dai who will be as bad to us as those lionsthen we give them the shoot gun sai xuri laugh make them run wei such english xuri spoke by convers among us slave howev i wa glad to see the boi so cheer and i gave him a dram out of our patron case of bottl to cheer him up after all xuri advic wa good and i took it we drop our littl anchor and lai still all night i sai still for we slept none for in two or three hour we saw vast great creatur we knew not what to call them of mani sort come down to the seashor and run into the water wallow and wash themselv for the pleasur of cool themselv and thei made such hideou howl and yell that i never inde heard the like xuri wa dreadfulli fright and inde so wa i too but we were both more fright when we heard on of these mighti creatur come swim toward our boat we could not see him but we might hear him by hi blow to be a monstrou huge and furiou beast xuri said it wa a lion and it might be so for aught i know but poor xuri cri to me to weigh the anchor and row awai no sai i xuri we can slip our cabl with the buoi to it and go off to sea thei cannot follow us far i had no sooner said so but i perceiv the creatur whatev it wa within two oar length which someth surpris me howev i immedi step to the cabindoor and take up my gun fire at him upon which he immedi turn about and swam toward the shore again but it is imposs to describ the horribl nois and hideou cri and howl that were rais as well upon the edg of the shore as higher within the countri upon the nois or report of the gun a thing i have some reason to believ those creatur had never heard befor thi convinc me that there wa no go on shore for us in the night upon that coast and how to ventur on shore in the dai wa anoth question too for to have fallen into the hand of ani of the savag had been as bad as to have fallen into the hand of lion and tiger at least we were equal apprehens of the danger of it be that as it would we were oblig to go on shore somewher or other for water for we had not a pint left in the boat when or where to get it wa the point xuri said if i would let him go on shore with on of the jar he would find if there wa ani water and bring some to me i ask him why he would go why i should not go and he stai in the boat the boi answer with so much affect that made me love him ever after sai he if wild man come thei eat me you go weywel xuri said i we will both go and if the wild man come we will kill them thei shall eat neither of us so i gave xuri a piec of rusk bread to eat and a dram out of our patron case of bottl which i mention befor and we hale the boat in as near the shore as we thought wa proper and wade on shore carri noth but our arm and two jar for water i did not care to go out of sight of the boat fear the come of cano with savag down the river but the boi see a low place about a mile up the countri rambl to it and by and by i saw him come run toward me i thought he wa pursu by some savag or fright with some wild beast and i run forward toward him to help him but when i came nearer to him i saw someth hang over hi shoulder which wa a creatur that he had shot like a hare but differ in colour and longer leg howev we were veri glad of it and it wa veri good meat but the great joi that poor xuri came with wa to tell me that he had found good water and seen no wild man but we found afterward that we need not take such pain for water for a littl higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when the tide wa out which flow but a littl wai up so we fill our jar and feast on the hare we had kill and prepar to go on our wai have seen no footstep of ani human creatur in that part of the countri as i had been on voyag to thi coast befor i knew veri well that the island of the canari and the cape de verd island also lai not far off from the coast but as i had no instrument to take an observ to know what latitud we were in and not exactli know or at least rememb what latitud thei were in and knew not where to look for them or when to stand off to sea toward them otherwis i might now easili have found some of these island but my hope wa that if i stood along thi coast till i came to that part where the english trade i should find some of their vessel upon their usual design of trade that would reliev and take us in by the best of my calcul that place where i now wa must be that countri which ly between the emperor of morocco dominion and the negro li wast and uninhabit except by wild beast the negro have abandon it and gone farther south for fear of the moor and the moor not think it worth inhabit by reason of it barren and inde both forsak it becaus of the prodigi number of tiger lion leopard and other furiou creatur which harbour there so that the moor us it for their hunt onli where thei go like an armi two or three thousand men at a time and inde for near an hundr mile togeth upon thi coast we saw noth but a wast uninhabit countri by dai and heard noth but howl and roar of wild beast by night onc or twice in the daytim i thought i saw the pico of teneriff be the high top of the mountain teneriff in the canari and had a great mind to ventur out in hope of reach thither but have tri twice i wa forc in again by contrari wind the sea also go too high for my littl vessel so i resolv to pursu my first design and keep along the shore sever time i wa oblig to land for fresh water after we had left thi place and onc in particular be earli in the morn we came to an anchor under a littl point of land which wa pretti high and the tide begin to flow we lai still to go farther in xuri whose ey were more about him than it seem mine were call softli to me and tell me that we had best go farther off the shore for sai he look yonder li a dread monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep i look where he point and saw a dread monster inde for it wa a terribl great lion that lai on the side of the shore under the shade of a piec of the hill that hung as it were a littl over him xuri sai i you shall go on shore and kill him xuri look fright and said me kill he eat me at on mouth on mouth he meant howev i said no more to the boi but had him lie still and i took our biggest gun which wa almost musketbor and load it with a good charg of powder and with two slug and laid it down then i load anoth gun with two bullet and the third for we had three piec i load with five smaller bullet i took the best aim i could with the first piec to have shot him into the head but he lai so with hi leg rais a littl abov hi nose that the slug hit hi leg about the knee and broke the bone he start up growl at first but find hi leg broke fell down again and then got up upon three leg and gave the most hideou roar that ever i heard i wa a littl surpris that i had not hit him on the head howev i look up the second piec immedi and though he began to move off fire again and shot him into the head and had the pleasur to see him drop and make but littl nois but he struggl for life then xuri took heart and would have me let him go on shore well go said i so the boi jump into the water and take a littl gun in on hand swam to shore with the other hand and come close to the creatur put the muzzl of the piec to hi ear and shot him into the head again which dispatch him quit thi wa game inde to us but thi wa no food and i wa veri sorri to lose three charg of powder and shot upon a creatur that wa good for noth to us howev xuri said he would have some of him so he come on board and ask me to give him the hatchet for what xuri said i me cut off hi head said he howev xuri could not cut off hi head but he cut off a foot and brought it with him and it wa a monstrou great on i bethought myself howev that perhap the skin of him might on wai or other be of some valu to us and i resolv to take off hi skin if i could so xuri and i went to work with him but xuri wa much the better workman at it for i knew veri ill how to do it inde it took us up both the whole dai but at last we got off the hide of him and spread it on the top of our cabin the sun effectu dri it in two dai time and it afterward serv me to lie upon after thi stop we made on to the southward continu for ten or twelv dai live veri spare on our provis which began to abat veri much and go no often into the shore than we were oblig to for fresh water my design in thi wa to make the river gambia or seneg that is to sai ani where about the cape de verd where i wa in hope to meet with some european ship and if i did not i knew not what cours i had to take but to seek for the island or perish there among the negro i knew that all the ship from europ which sail either to the coast of guinea or brasil or to the east indi made thi cape or those island and in a word i put the whole of my fortun upon thi singl point either that i must meet with some ship or must perish when i had pass thi resolut about ten dai longer as i have said i began to see that the land wa inhabit and in two or three place as we sail by we saw peopl stand upon the shore to look at us we could also perceiv that thei were quit black and stark nake i wa onc inclin to have gone on shore to them but xuri wa my better counsellor and said to me no go no go howev i haul in nearer the shore that i might talk to them and i found thei run along the shore by me a good wai i observ thei had no weapon in their hand except on who had a long slender stick which xuri said wa a lanc and that thei would throw them a great wai with good aim so i kept at a distanc but talk with them by sign as well as i could and particularli made sign for someth to eat thei beckon to me to stop my boat and thei would fetch me some meat upon thi i lower the top of my sail and lai by and two of them ran up into the countri and in less than half an hour came back and brought with them two piec of dry flesh and some corn such as is the produc of their countri but we neither knew what the on nor the other wa howev we were will to accept it but how to come at it wa our next disput for i wa not for ventur on shore to them and thei were as much afraid of us but thei took a safe wai for us all for thei brought it to the shore and laid it down and went and stood a great wai off till we fetch it on board and then came close to us again we made sign of thank to them for we had noth to make them amend but an opportun offer that veri instant to oblig them wonderfulli for while we were ly by the shore came two mighti creatur on pursu the other as we took it with great furi from the mountain toward the sea whether it wa the male pursu the femal or whether thei were in sport or in rage we could not tell ani more than we could tell whether it wa usual or strang but i believ it wa the latter becaus in the first place those raven creatur seldom appear but in the night and in the second place we found the peopl terribl fright especi the women the man that had the lanc or dart did not fly from them but the rest did howev as the two creatur ran directli into the water thei did not seem to offer to fall upon ani of the negro but plung themselv into the sea and swam about as if thei had come for their divers at last on of them began to come nearer our boat than at first i expect but i lai readi for him for i had load my gun with all possibl expedit and had xuri load both the other as soon as he came fairli within my reach i fire and shot him directli into the head immedi he sunk down into the water but rose instantli and plung up and down as if he wa struggl for life and so inde he wa he immedi made to the shore but between the wound which wa hi mortal hurt and the strangl of the water he di just befor he reach the shore it is imposs to express the astonish of these poor creatur at the nois and the fire of my gun some of them were even readi to die for fear and fell down as dead with the veri terror but when thei saw the creatur dead and sunk in the water and that i made sign to them to come to the shore thei took heart and came to the shore and began to search for the creatur i found him by hi blood stain the water and by the help of a rope which i slung round him and gave the negro to hale thei drag him on shore and found that it wa a most curiou leopard spot and fine to an admir degre and the negro held up their hand with admir to think what it wa i had kill him with the other creatur fright with the flash of fire and the nois of the gun swam on shore and ran up directli to the mountain from whenc thei came nor could i at that distanc know what it wa i found quickli the negro were for eat the flesh of thi creatur so i wa will to have them take it as a favour from me which when i made sign to them that thei might take him thei were veri thank for immedi thei fell to work with him and though thei had no knife yet with a sharpen piec of wood thei took off hi skin as readili and much more readili than we could have done with a knife thei offer me some of the flesh which i declin make as if i would give it them but made sign for the skin which thei gave me veri freeli and brought me a great deal more of their provis which though i did not understand yet i accept then i made sign to them for some water and held out on of my jar to them turn it bottom upward to shew that it wa empti and that i want to have it fill thei call immedi to some of their friend and there came two women and brought a great vessel made of earth and burnt as i suppos in the sun thi thei set down for me as befor and i sent xuri on shore with my jar and fill them all three the women were as stark nake as the men i wa now furnish with root and corn such as it wa and water and leav my friendli negro i made forward for about eleven dai more without offer to go near the shore till i saw the land run out a great length into the sea at about the distanc of four or five leagu befor me and the sea be veri calm i kept a larg of to make thi point at length doubl the point at about two leagu from the land i saw plainli land on the other side to seaward then i conclud as it wa most certain inde that thi wa the cape de verd and those the island call from thenc cape de verd island howev thei were at a great distanc and i could not well tell what i had best to do for if i should be taken with a fresh of wind i might neither reach on nor the other in thi dilemma as i wa veri pensiv i step into the cabin and sat me down xuri have the helm when on a sudden the boi cri out master master a ship with a sail and the foolish boi wa fright out of hi wit think it must need be some of hi master ship sent to pursu us when i knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach i jump out of the cabin and immedi saw not onli the ship but what she wa viz that it wa a portugues ship and as i thought wa bound to the coast of guinea for negro but when i observ the cours she steer i wa soon convinc thei were bound some other wai and did not design to come ani nearer to the shore upon which i stretch out to sea as much as i could resolv to speak with them if possibl with all the sail i could muster i found i should not be abl to come in their wai but that thei would be gone by befor i could make ani signal to them but after i had crowd to the utmost and began to despair thei it seem saw me by the help of their perspectiveglass and that it wa some european boat which as thei suppos must belong to some ship that wa lost so thei shorten sail to let me come up i wa encourag with thi and as i had my patron ancient on board i made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress and fire a gun both which thei saw for thei told me thei saw the smoke though thei did not hear the gun upon these signal thei veri kindli brought to and lai by for me and in about three hour time i came up with them thei ask me what i wa in portugues and in spanish and in french but i understood none of them but at last a scot sailor who wa on board call to me and i answer him and told him i wa an englishman that i had made my escap out of slaveri from the moor at salle then thei had me come on board and veri kindli took me in and all my good it wa an inexpress joi to me that ani on would believ that i wa thu deliv as i esteem it from such a miser and almost hopeless condit as i wa in and immedi offer all i had to the captain of the ship as a return for my deliver but he gener told me he would take noth from me but that all i had should be deliv safe to me when i came to the brasil for sai he i have save your life on no other term than i would be glad to be save myself and it mai on time or other be my lot to be taken up in the same condit besid said he when i carri you to the brasil so great a wai from your own countri if i should take from you what you have you will be starv

the ship us and ask me what i would have for it i told him he had been so gener to me in everyth that i could not offer to make ani price of the boat but left it entir to him upon which he told me he would give me a note of hi hand to pai me eighti piec of eight for it at brasil and when it came there if ani on offer to give more he would make it up he offer me also sixti piec of eight more for my boi xuri which i wa loath to lake not that i wa not will to let the captain have him but i wa veri loath to sell the poor boi liberti who had assist me so faithfulli in procur my own howev when i let him know my reason he own it to be just and offer me thi medium that he would give the boi an oblig to set him free in ten year if he turn christian upon thi and xuri sai he wa will to go to him i let the captain have him we had a veri good voyag to the brasil and arriv in the bai de todo lo santo or all saint bai in about twentytwo dai after and now i wa onc more deliv from the most miser of all

not been long here but be recommend to the hous of a good honest man like himself who had an ingeino as thei call it that is a plantat and a sugarhous i live with him some time and acquaint myself by that mean with the manner of their plant and make of sugar and see how well the planter live and how thei grew rich suddenli i resolv if i could get licens to settl there i would turn planter among

mean by some of the english merchant there to send over not the order onli but a full account of my stori to a merchant at london who repres it effectu to her whereupon she not onli deliv the monei but out of her own pocket sent the portug captain a veri handsom present for hi human and chariti to me the merchant in london vest thi hundr pound in english good such as the captain had writ for sent them directli to him at lisbon and he brought them all safe to me to the brasil among which without my direct for i wa too young in my busi to think of them he had taken care to have all sort of tool iron work and utensil necessari for my plantat and which were of great us to me when thi cargo arriv i thought my fortun made for i wa surpris with joi of it and my good steward the captain had laid out the five pound which my friend had sent him for a present for himself to purchas and bring me over a servant under bond for six year servic and would not accept of ani consider except a littl tobacco which i would have him accept be of my own produc neither wa thi all but my good be all english manufactur such as cloth stuff baiz and thing particularli valuabl and desir in the countri i found mean to sell them to a veri great advantag so that i mai sai i had more than four time the valu of my first cargo and wa now infinit beyond my poor neighbour i mean in the advanc of my plantat for the first thing i did i bought me a negro slave and an european servant also i mean anoth besid that which the captain brought me from lisbon but as abus prosper is oftentim made the veri mean of

which my father so earnestli recommend a quiet retir life and of which he had so sensibl describ the middl station of life to be full but other thing attend me and i wa still to be the wil agent of all my own miseri and particularli to increas my fault and doubl the reflect upon myself which in my futur sorrow i should have leisur to make all these miscarriag were procur by my appar obstin adher to my foolish inclin of wander abroad and pursu that inclin in contradict to the clearest view of do myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospect and those measur of life which natur and provid concur to present me with and to make my duti as i had done thu in my break awai from my parent so i could not be content now but i must go and leav the happi view i had of be a rich and thrive man in my new plantat onli to pursu a rash and immoder desir of rise faster than the natur of the thing admit and thu i cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human miseri that ever man fell into or perhap could be consist with life and a state of health in the world to come then by just degre to the particular of thi part of my stori you mai suppos that have now live almost four year in the brasil and begin to thrive and prosper veri well upon my plantat i had not onli learnt the languag but had contract acquaint and friendship among my fellowplant as well as among the merchant at st salvador which wa our port and that in my discours among them i had frequent given them an account of my two voyag to the coast of guinea the manner of trade with the negro there and how easi it wa to purchas upon the coast for trifl such as bead toi knive scissar hatchet bit of glass and the like not onli golddust guinea grain eleph teeth c but negro for the servic of the brasil in great number thei listen alwai veri attent to my discours on these head but especi to that part which relat to the bui negro which wa a trade at that time not onli not far enter into but as far as it wa had been carri on by the assiento for permiss of the king of spain and portug and engross in the public so that few negro were brought and those excess dear it happen be in compani with some merchant and planter of my acquaint and talk of those thing veri earnestli three of them came to me the next morn and told me thei had been muse veri much upon what i had discours with them of the last night and thei came to make a secret propos to me and after enjoin me secreci thei told me that thei had a mind to fit out a ship to to guinea that thei had all plantat as well as i and were straiten for noth so much as servant that as it wa a trade could not be carri on becaus thei could not publicli sell the negro when thei came home so thei desir to make but on voyag to bring the negro on shore privat and divid them among their own plantat and in a word the question wa whether i would go their supercargo in the ship to manag the trade part upon the coast of guinea and thei offer me that i should have my equal share of the negro without provid ani part of the stock thi wa a fair propos it must be confess had it been made to ani on that had not had a settlement and plantat of hi own to look after which wa in a fair wai of come to be veri consider and with a good stock upon it but for me that wa thu enter and establish and had noth to do but go on as i had begun for three or four year more and to have sent for the other hundr pound from england and who in that time and with that littl addit could scarc have fail of be worth three or four thousand pound sterl and that increas too for me to think of such a voyag wa the most preposter thing that ever man in such circumst could be guilti of but i that wa born to be my own destroy could no more resist the offer than i could restrain my first rambl design when my father good counsel wa lost upon me in a word i told them i would go with all my heart if thei would undertak to look alter my plantat in my absenc and would dispos of it to such as i should direct if i miscarri thi thei all engag to do and enter into write or coven to do so and i made a formal will dispos of my plantat and effect in case of my death make the captain of the ship that had save my life as befor my univers heir but oblig him to dispos of my effect as i had direct in my will on half of the produc be to himself and the other to be ship to england in short i took all possibl caution to preserv my effect and keep up my plantat had i us half as much prudenc to have look into my own interest and have made a judgment of what i ought to have done and not to have done i had certainli never gone awai from so prosper an undertak leav all the probabl view of a thrive circumst and gone upon a voyag to sea attend with all it common hazard to sai noth of the reason i had to expect particular misfortun to myself but i wa hurri on and obei blindli the dictat of my fanci rather than my reason and accordingli the ship be fit out and the cargo furnish and all thing done as by agreement by my partner in the voyag i went on board in an evil hour the st of septemb be the same dai eight year that i went from my father and mother at hull in order to act the rebel to their author and the fool to my own interest our ship wa about on hundr and twenti ton burden carri six gun and fourteen men besid the master hi boi and myself we had on board no larg cargo of good except of such toi as were fit for our trade with the negro such as bead bit of glass shell and odd trifl especi littl lookingglass knive scissar hatchet and the like the same dai i went on board we set sail stand awai to the northward upon our own coast with design to stretch over for the african coast when thei came about or degre of northern latitud which it seem wa the manner of their cours in those dai we had veri good weather onli excess hot all the wai upon our own coast till we made the height of cape st augustino from whenc keep farther off at sea we lost sight of land and steer as if we were bound for the isl fernand de noronha hold our cours ne by n and leav those isl on the east in thi cours we pass the line in about twelv dai time and were by our last observ in degre min northern latitud when a violent tornado or hurrican took us quit out of our knowledg it began from the southeast came about to the northwest and then settl into the northeast from whenc it blew in such a terribl manner that for twelv dai togeth we could do noth but drive and scud awai befor it let it carri us whither ever fate and the furi of the wind direct and dure these twelv dai i need not sai that i expect everi dai to be swallow up nor inde did ani in the ship expect to save their live in thi distress we had besid the terror of the storm on of our men die of the calentur and on man and the boi wash overboard about the twelfth dai the weather abat a littl the master made an observ as well as he could and found that he wa in about degre north latitud but that he wa degre of longitud differ west from cape st augustino so that he found he wa gotten upon the coast of guinea or the north part of brasil beyond the river amazon toward that of the river oronoqu commonli call the great river and began to consult with me what cours he should take for the ship wa leaki and veri much disabl and he wa go directli back to the coast of brasil i wa posit against that and look over the chart of the sea coast of america with him we conclud there wa no inhabit countri for us to have recours to till we came within the circl of the caribbe island and therefor resolv to stand awai for barbado which by keep off at sea to avoid the indraft of the bai or gulf of mexico we might easili perform as we hope in about fifteen dai sail wherea we could not possibl make our voyag to the coast of africa without some assist both to our ship and to ourselv with thi design we chang our cours and steer awai nw by w in order to reach some of our english island where i hope for relief but our voyag wa otherwis determin for be in the latitud of deg min a second storm came upon us which carri us awai with the same impetuos westward and drove us so out of the veri wai of all human commerc that had all our live been save as to the sea we were rather in danger of be devour by savag than ever return to our own countri in thi distress the wind still blow veri hard on of our men earli in the morn cri out land and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hope of see whereabout in the world we were but the ship struck upon a sand and in a moment her motion be so stop the sea broke over her in such a manner that we expect we should all have perish immedi and we were immedi driven into our close quarter to shelter us from the veri foam and sprai of the sea it is not easi for ani on who ha not been in the like condit to describ or conceiv the constern of men in such circumst we knew noth where we were or upon what land it wa we were driven whether an island or the main whether inhabit or not inhabit and as the rage of the wind wa still great though rather less than at first we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold mani minut without break in piec unless the wind by a kind of miracl should turn immedi about in a word we sat look on upon anoth and expect death everi moment and everi man act accordingli as prepar for anoth world for there wa littl or noth more for us to do in thi that which wa our present comfort and all the comfort we had wa that contrari to our expect the ship did not break yet and that the master said the wind began to abat now though we thought that the wind did a littl abat yet the ship have thu struck upon the sand and stick too fast for us to expect her get off we were in a dread condit inde and had noth to do but to think of save our live as well as we could we had a boat at our stern just befor the storm but she wa first stave by dash against the ship rudder and in the next place she broke awai and either sunk or wa driven off to sea so there wa no hope from her we had anoth boat on board but how to get her off into the sea wa a doubt thing howev there wa no room to debat for we fanci the ship would break in piec everi minut and some told us she wa actual broken alreadi in thi distress the mate of our vessel lai hold of the boat and with the help of the rest of the men thei got her slung over the ship side and get all into her let go and commit ourselv be eleven in number to god merci and the wild sea for though the storm wa abat consider yet the sea went dread high upon the shore and might well be call den wild zee as the dutch call the sea in a storm and now our case wa veri dismal inde for we all saw plainli that the sea went so high that the boat could not live and that we should be inevit drown as to make sail we had none nor if we had could we have done ani thing with it so we work at the oar toward the land though with heavi heart like men go to execut for we all knew that when the boat came nearer the shore she would be dash into a thousand piec by the breach of the sea howev we commit our soul to god in the most earnest manner and the wind drive us toward the shore we hasten our destruct with our own hand pull as well as we could toward land what the shore wa whether rock or sand whether steep or shoal we knew not the onli hope that could ration give us the least shadow of expect wa if we might happen into some bai or gulf or the mouth of some river where by great chanc we might have run our boat in or got under the lee of the land and perhap made smooth water but there wa noth of thi appear but as we made nearer and nearer the shore the land look more fright than the sea after we had row or rather driven about a leagu and a half as we reckon it a rage wave mountainlik came roll astern of us and plainli had us expect the coupdegrac in a word it took us with such a furi that it overset the boat at onc and separ us as well from the boat as from on anoth gave us not time hardli to sai o god for we were all swallow up in a moment noth can describ the confus of thought which i felt when i sunk into the water for though i swam veri well yet i could not deliv myself from the wave so as to draw breath till that wave have driven me or rather carri me a vast wai on toward the shore and have spent itself went back and left me upon the land almost dry but half dead with the water i took in i had so much presenc of mind as well as breath left that see myself nearer the main land than i expect i got upon my feet and endeavour to make on toward the land as fast as i could befor anoth wave should return and take me up again but i soon found it wa imposs to avoid it for i saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill and as furiou as an enemi which i had no mean or strength to contend with my busi wa to hold my breath and rais myself upon the water if i could and so by swim to preserv my breath and pilot myself toward the shore if possibl my greatest concern now be that the sea as it would carri me a great wai toward the shore when it came on might not carri me back again with it when it gave back toward the sea the wave that came upon me again buri me at onc twenti or thirti foot deep in it own bodi and i could feel myself carri with a mighti forc and swift toward the shore a veri great wai but i held my breath and assist myself to swim still forward with all my might i wa readi to burst with hold my breath when as i felt myself rise up so to my immedi relief i found my head and hand shoot out abov the surfac of the water and though it wa not two second of time that i could keep myself so yet it reliev me greatli gave me breath and new courag i wa cover again with water a good while but not so long but i held it out and find the water had spent itself and began to return i struck forward against the return of the wave and felt ground again with my feet i stood still a few moment to recov breath and till the water went from me and then took to my heel and ran with what strength i had farther toward the shore but neither would thi deliv me from the furi of the sea which came pour in after me again and twice more i wa lift up by the wave and carri forward as befor the shore be veri flat the last time of these two had well near been fatal to me for the sea have hurri me along as befor land me or rather dash me against a piec of a rock and that with such forc as it left me senseless and inde helpless as to my own deliver for the blow take my side and breast beat the breath as it were quit out of my bodi and had it return again immedi i must have been strangl in the water but i recov a littl befor the return of the wave and see i should be cover again with the water i resolv to hold fast by a piec of the rock and so to hold my breath if possibl till the wave went back now as the wave were not so high as at first be near land i held my hold till the wave abat and then fetch anoth run which brought me so near the shore that the next wave though it went over me yet did not so swallow me up as to carri me awai and the next run i took i got to the main land where to my great comfort i clamber up the clift of the shore and sat me down upon the grass free from danger and quit out of the reach of the water i wa now land and safe on shore and began to look up and thank god that my life wa save in a case wherein there wa some minut befor scarc ani room to hope i believ it is imposs to express to the life what the ecstasi and transport of the soul ar when it is so save as i mai sai out of the veri grave and i do not wonder now at that custom viz that when a malefactor who ha the halter about hi neck is ti up and just go to be turn off and ha a repriev brought to him i sai i do not wonder that thei bring a surgeon with it to let him blood that veri moment thei tell him of it that the surpris mai not drive the anim spirit from the heart and overwhelm him for sudden joi like grief confound at first i walk about on the shore lift up my hand and my whole be as i mai sai wrapt up in the contempl of my deliver make a thousand gestur and motion which i cannot describ reflect upon all my comrad that were drown and that there should not be on soul save but myself for as for them i never saw them afterward or ani sign of them except three of their hat on cap and two shoe that were not fellow i cast my ey to the strand vessel when the breach and troth of the sea be so big i could hardli see it it lai so far off and consid lord how wa it possibl i could get on shore after i had solac my mind with the comfort part of my condit i began to look round me to see what kind of place i wa in and what wa next to be done and i soon found my comfort abat and that in a word i had a dread deliver for i wa wet had no cloth to shift me nor ani thing either to eat or drink to comfort me neither did i see ani prospect befor me but that of perish with hunger or be devour by wild beast and that which wa particularli afflict to me wa that i had no weapon either to hunt and kill ani creatur for my susten or to defend myself against ani other creatur that might desir to kill me for their in a word i had noth about me but a knife a tobacco pipe and a littl tobacco in a box thi wa all my provis and thi threw me into terribl agoni of mind that for a while i ran about like a madman night come upon me i began with a heavi heart to consid what would be my lot if there were ani raven beast in that countri see at night thei alwai come abroad for their prei all the remedi that offer to my thought at that time wa to get up into a thick bushi tree like a fir but thorni which grew near me and where i resolv to sit all night and consid the next dai what death i should die for as yet i saw no prospect of life i walk about a furlong from the shore to see if i could find ani fresh water to drink which i did to my great joi and have drank and put a littl tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger i went to the tree and get up into it endeavour to place myself so as that if i should sleep i might not fall and have cut me a short stick like a truncheon for my defenc i took up my lodg and have been excess fatigu i fell fast asleep and slept as comfort as i believ few could have done in my condit and found myself the most refresh with it that i think i ever wa on such an occas when i wake it wa broad dai the weather clear and the storm abat so that the sea did not rage and swell as befor but that which surpris me most wa that the ship wa lift off in the night from the sand where she lai by the swell of the tide and wa driven up almost as far as the rock which i first mention where i had been so bruis by the dash me against it thi be within about a mile from the shore where i wa and the ship seem to stand upright still i wish myself on board that at least i might save some necessari thing for my us when i came down from my apart in the tree i look about me again and the first thing i found wa the boat which lai as the wind and the sea had toss her up upon the land about two mile on my right hand i walk as far as i could upon the shore to have got to her but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which wa about half a mile broad so i came back for the present be more intent upon get at the ship where i hope to find someth for my present subsist a littl after noon i found the sea veri calm and the tide eb so far out that i could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship and here i found a fresh renew of my grief for i saw evid that if we had kept on board we had been all safe that is to sai we had all got safe on shore and i had not been so miser as to be left entir destitut of all comfort and compani as i now wa thi forc tear from my ey again but as there wa littl relief in that i resolv if possibl to get to the ship so i pull off my cloth for the weather wa hot to extrem and took the water but when i came to the ship my difficulti wa still greater to know how to get on board for as she lai aground and high out of the water there wa noth within my reach to lai hold of i swam round her twice and the second time i spi a small piec of a rope which i wonder i did not see at first hang down by the forechain so low as that with great difficulti i got hold of it and by the help of that rope got up into the forecastl of the ship here i found that the ship wa bulg and had a great deal of water in her hold but that she lai so on the side of a bank of hard sand or rather earth and her stern lai lift up upon the bank and her head low almost to the water by thi mean all her quarter wa free and all that wa in that part wa dry for you mai be sure my first work wa to search and to see what wa spoil and what wa free and first i found that all the ship provis were dry and untouch by the water and be veri well dispos to eat i went to the breadroom and fill my pocket with bisket and at it as i went about other thing for i had no time to lose i also found some rum in the great cabin of which i took a larg drain and which i had inde need enough of to spirit me for what wa befor me now i want noth but a boat to furnish myself with mani thing which i foresaw would be veri necessari to me it wa in vain to sit still and wish for what wa not to be had and thi extrem rous my applic we had sever spare yard and two or three larg spar of wood and a spare topmast or two in the ship i resolv to fall to work with these and flung as mani of them overboard as i could manag of their weight ty everi on with a rope that thei might not drive awai when thi wa done i went down the ship side and pull them to me i ti four of them fast togeth at both end as well as i could in the form of a raft and lai two or three short piec of plank upon them crosswai i found i could walk upon it veri well but that it wa not abl to bear ani great weight the piec be too light so i went to work and with the carpent saw i cut a spare topmast into three length and ad them to my raft with a great deal of labour and pain but hope of furnish myself with necessari encourag me to go beyond what i should have been abl to have done upon anoth occas my raft wa now strong enough to bear ani reason weight my next care wa what to load it with and how to preserv what i laid upon it from the surf of the sea but i wa not long consid thi i first laid all the plank or board upon it that i could get and have consid well what i most want i first got three of the seamen chest which i had broken open and empti and lower them down upon my raft the first of these i fill with provis viz bread rice three dutch chees five piec of dri goat flesh which we live much upon and a littl remaind of european corn which had been laid by for some fowl which we brought to sea with us but the fowl were kill there had been some barlei and wheat togeth but to my great disappoint i found afterward that the rat had eaten or spoil it all as for liquor i found sever case of bottl belong to our skipper in which were some cordial water and in all abov five or six gallon of rack these i stow by themselv there be no need to put them into the chest nor no room for them while i wa do thi i found the tide began to flow though veri calm and i had the mortif to see my coat shirt and waistcoat which i had left on shore upon the sand swim awai as for my breech which were onli linen and openkne i swam on board in them and my stock howev thi put me upon rummag for cloth of which i found enough but took no more than i want for present us for i had other thing which my ey wa more upon as first tool to work with on shore and it wa after long search that i found out the carpent chest which wa inde a veri us prize to me and much more valuabl than a shipload of gold would have been at that time i got it down to my raft even whole as it wa without lose time to look into it for i knew in gener what it contain my next care wa for some ammunit and arm there were two veri good fowlingpiec in the great cabin and two pistol these i secur first with some powder horn and a small bag of shot and two old rusti sword i knew there were three barrel of powder in the ship but knew not where our gunner had stow them but with much search i found them two of them dry and good the third had taken water those two i got to my raft with the arm and now i thought myself pretti well freight and began to think how i should get to shore with them have neither sail oar or rudder and the least cap of wind would have overset all my navig i had three encourag a smooth calm sea the tide rise and set in to the shore what littl wind there wa blew me toward the land and thu have found two or three broken oar belong to the boat and besid the tool which were in the chest i found two saw an ax and a hammer and with thi cargo i put to sea for a mile or thereabout my raft went veri well onli that i found it drive a littl distant from the place where i had land befor by which i perceiv that there wa some indraft of the water and consequ i hope to find some creek or river there which i might make us of as a port to get to land with my cargo as i imagin so it wa there appear befor me a littl open of the land and i found a strong current of the tide set into it so i guid my raft as well as i could to keep in the middl of the stream but here i had like to have suffer a second shipwreck which if i had i think verili would have broke my heart for know noth of the coast my raft run aground at on end of it upon a shoal and not be aground at the other end it want but a littl that all my cargo had slip off toward that end that wa afloat and so fallen into the water i did my utmost by set my back against the chest to keep them in their place but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength neither durst i stir from the postur i wa in but hold up the chest with all my might stood in that manner near half an hour in which time the rise of the water brought me a littl more upon a level and a littl after the water still rise my raft float again and i thrust her off with the oar i had into the channel and then drive up higher i at length found myself in the mouth of a littl river with land on both side and a strong current or tide run up i look on both side for a proper place to get to shore for i wa not will to be driven too high up the river hope in time to see some ship at sea and therefor resolv to place myself as near the coast as i could at length i spi a littl cove on the right shore of the creek to which with great pain and difficulti i guid my raft and at last got so near as that reach ground with my oar i could thrust her directli in but here i had like to have dip all my cargo in the sea again for that shore ly pretti steep that is to sai slope there wa no place to land but where on end of the float if it run on shore would lie so high and the other sink lower as befor that it would endang my cargo again all that i could do wa to wait till the tide wa at the highest keep the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the shore near a flat piec of ground which i expect the water would flow over and so it did as soon as i found water enough for my raft drew about a foot of water i thrust her on upon that flat piec of ground and there fasten or moor her by stick my two broken oar into the ground on on on side near on end and on on the other side near the other end and thu i lai till the water eb awai and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore my next work wa to view the countri and seek a proper place for my habit and where to stow my good to secur them from whatev might happen where i wa i yet knew not whether on the contin or on an island whether inhabit or not inhabit whether in danger of wild beast or not there wa a hill not abov a mile from me which rose up veri steep and high and which seem to overtop some other hill which lai as in a ridg from it northward i took out on of the fowlingpiec and on of the pistol and an horn of powder and thu arm i travel for discoveri up to the top of that hill where after i had with great labour and difficulti got to the top i saw my fate to my great afflict viz that i wa in an island environ everi wai with the sea no land to be seen except some rock which lai a great wai off and two small island less than thi which lai about three leagu to the west i found also that the island i wa in wa barren and as i saw good reason to believ uninhabit except by wild beast of whom howev i saw none yet i saw abund of fowl but knew not their kind neither when i kill them could i tell what wa fit for food and what not at my come back i shot at a great bird which i saw sit upon a tree on the side of a great woodi believ it wa the first gun that had been fire there sinc the creation of the world i had no sooner fire but from all part of the wood there aros an innumer number of fowl of mani sort make a confus scream and cry everi on accord to hi usual note but not on of them of ani kind that i knew as for the creatur i kill i took it to be a kind of a hawk it colour and beak resembl it but had no talon or claw more than common it flesh wa carrion and fit for noth content with thi discoveri i came back to my raft and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore which took me up the rest of that dai and what to do with myself at night i knew not nor inde where to rest for i wa afraid to lie down on the ground not know but some wild beast might devour me though as i afterward found there wa realli no need for those fear howev as well as i could i barricado myself round with the chest and board that i had brought on shore and made a kind of a hut for that night lodg as for food i yet saw not which wai to suppli myself except that i had seen two or three creatur like hare run out of the wood where i shot the fowl i now began to consid that i might yet get a great mani thing out of the ship which would be us to me and particularli some of the rig and sail and such other thing as might come to land and i resolv to make anoth voyag on board the vessel if possibl and as i knew that the first storm that blew must necessarili break her all in piec i resolv to set all other thing apart till i got everi thing out of the ship that i could get then i call a council that is to sai in my thought whether i should take back the raft but thi appear impractic so i resolv to go as befor when the tide wa down and i did so onli that i strip befor i went from my hut have noth on but a check shirt and a pair of linen trowser and a pair of pump on my feet i got on board the ship as befor and prepar a second raft and have had experi of the first i neither made thi so unwieldi nor load it so hard but yet i brought awai sever thing veri us to me as first in the carpent store i found two or three bag full of nail and spike a great screwjack a dozen or two of hatchet and abov all that most us thing call a grindston all these i secur togeth with sever thing belong to the gunner particularli two or three iron crow and two barrel of musketbullet seven musket and anoth fowlingpiec with some small quantiti of powder more a larg bag full of small shot and a great roll of sheet lead but thi last wa so heavi i could not hoist it up to get it over the ship side besid these thing i took all the men cloth that i could find and a spare foretopsail hammock and some bed and with thi i load my second raft and brought them all safe on shore to my veri great comfort i wa under some apprehens dure my absenc from the land that at least my provis might be devour on shore but when i came back i found no sign of ani visitor onli there sat a creatur like a wild cat upon on of the chest which when i came toward it ran awai a littl distanc and then stood still she sat veri compos and unconcern and look full in my face as if she had a mind to be acquaint with me i present my gun at her but as she did not understand it she wa perfectli unconcern at it nor did she offer to stir awai upon which i toss her a bit of biscuit though by the wai i wa not veri free of it for my store wa not great howev i spare her a bit i sai and she went to it smell of it and at it and look as pleas for more but i thank her and could spare no more so she march off have got my second cargo on shore though i wa fain to open the barrel of powder and bring them by parcel for thei were too heavi be larg cask i went to work to make me a littl tent with the sail and some pole which i cut for that purpos and into thi tent i brought everi thing that i knew would spoil either with rain or sun and i pile all the empti chest and cask up in a circl round the tent to fortifi it from ani sudden attempt either from man or beast when i had done thi i block up the door of the tent with some board within and an empti chest set up an end without and spread on of the bed upon the ground lai my two pistol just at my head and my gun at length by me i went to bed for the first time and slept veri quietli all night for i wa veri weari and heavi as the night befor i had slept littl and had labour veri hard all dai as well to fetch all those thing from the ship as to get them on shore i had the biggest magazin of all kind now that ever were laid up i believ for on man but i wa not satisfi still for while the ship sat upright in that postur i thought i ought to get everi thing out of her that i could so everi dai at low water i went on board and brought awai someth or other but particularli the third time i went i brought awai as much of the rig as i could as also all the small rope and ropetwin i could get with a piec of spare canvass which wa to mend the sail upon occas and the barrel of wet gunpowd in a word i brought awai all the sail first and last onli that i wa fain to cut them in piec and bring as much at a time as i could for thei were no more us to be sail but as mere canvass onli but that which comfort me more still wa that at last of all after i had made five or six such voyag as these and thought i had noth more to expect from the ship that wa worth my meddl with i sai after all thi i found a great hogshead of bread and three larg runlet of rum or spirit and a box of sugar and a barrel of fine flower thi wa surpris to me becaus i had given over expect ani more provis except what wa spoil by the water i soon empti the hogshead of that bread and wrap it up parcel by parcel in piec of the sail which i cut out and in a word i got all thi safe on shore also the next dai i made anoth voyag and now have plunder the ship of what wa portabl and fit to hand out i began with the cabl and cut the great cabl into piec such as i could move i got two cabl and a hawser on shore with all the ironwork i could get and have cut down the spritsailyard and the mizenyard and everi thing i could to make a larg raft i load it with all those heavi good and came awai but my good luck began now to leav me for thi raft wa so unwieldi and so overladen that after i had enter the littl cove where i had land the rest of my good not be abl to guid it so handili as i did the other it overset and threw me and all my cargo into the water as for myself it wa no great harm for i wa near the shore but as to my cargo it wa great part of it lost especi the iron which i expect would have been of great us to me howev when the tide wa out i got most of the piec of cabl ashor and some of the iron though with infinit labour for i wa fain to dip for it into the water a work which fatigu me veri much after thi i went everi dai on board and brought awai what i could get i had been now thirteen dai on shore and had been eleven time on board the ship in which time i had brought awai all that on pair of hand could well be suppos capabl to bring though i believ verili had the calm weather held i should have brought awai the whole ship piec by piec but prepar the twelfth time to go on board i found the wind began to rise howev at low water i went on board and though i thought i had rummag the cabin so effectu as that noth more could be found yet i discov a locker with drawer in it in on of which i found two or three razor and on pair of larg scissar with some ten or a dozen of good knive and fork in anoth i found about thirtysix pound valu in monei some european coin some brasil some piec of eight some gold some silver i smile to myself at the sight of thi monei o drug said i aloud what art thou good for thou art not worth to me no not the take off of the ground on of those knive is worth all thi heap i have no manner of us for thee even remain where thou art and go to the bottom as a creatur whose life is not worth save howev upon second thought i took it awai and wrap all thi in a piec of canvass i began to think of make anoth raft but while i wa prepar thi i found the sky overcast and the wind began to rise and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore it present occur to me that it wa in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore and that it wa my busi to be gone befor the tide of flood began otherwis i might not be abl to reach the shore at all accordingli i let myself down into the water and swam cross the channel which lai between the ship and the sand and even that with difficulti enough partli with the weight of thing i had about me and partli the rough of the water for the wind rose veri hastili and befor it wa quit high water it blew a storm but i wa gotten home to my littl tent where i lai with all my wealth about me veri secur it blew veri hard all that night and in the morn when i look out behold no more ship wa to be seen i wa a littl surpris but recov myself with thi satisfactori reflect viz that i had lost no time nor abat no dilig to get everi thing out of her that could be us to me and that inde there wa littl left in her that i wa abl to bring awai if i had had more time i now gave over ani more thought of the ship or of ani thing out of her except what might drive on shore from her wreck as inde diver piec of her afterward did but those thing were of small us to me my thought were now wholli emploi about secur myself against either savag if ani should appear or wild beast if ani were in the island and i had mani thought of the method how to do thi and what kind of dwell to make whether i should make me a cave in the earth or a tent upon the earth and in short i resolv upon both the manner and descript of which it mai not be improp to give an account of i soon found the place i wa in wa not for my settlement particularli becaus it wa upon a low moorish ground near the sea and i believ would not be wholesom and more particularli becaus there wa no fresh water near it so i resolv to find a more healthi and more conveni spot of ground i consult sever thing in my situat which i found would be proper for me st health and fresh water i just now mention dly shelter from the heat of the sun dly secur from raven creatur whether man or beast thly a view to the sea that if god sent ani ship in sight i might not lose ani advantag for my deliver of which i wa not will to banish all my expect yet in search of a place proper for thi i found a littl plain on the side of a rise hill whose front toward thi littl plain wa steep as a housesid so that noth could come down upon me from the top on the side of thi rock there wa a hollow place worn a littl wai in like the entranc or door of a cave but there wa not realli ani cave or wai into the rock at all on the flat of the green just befor thi hollow place i resolv to pitch my tent thi plain wa not abov an hundr yard broad and about twice as long and lai like a green befor my door and at the end of it descend irregularli everi wai down into the low ground by the seasid it wa on the nnw side of the hill so that i wa shelter from the heat everi dai till it came to a w and by s sun or thereabout which in those countri is near the set befor i set up my tent i drew a halfcircl befor the hollow place which took in about ten yard in it semidiamet from the rock and twenti yard in it diamet from it begin and end in thi half circl i pitch two row of strong stake drive them into the ground till thei stood veri firm like pile the biggest end be out of the ground about five foot and a half and sharpen on the top the two row did not stand abov six inch from on anoth then i took the piec of cabl which i had cut in the ship and laid them in row on upon anoth within the circl between these two row of stake up to the top place other stake in the insid lean against them about two foot and a half high like a spur to a post and thi fenc wa so strong that neither man or beast could get into it or over it thi cost me a great deal of time and labour especi to cut the pile in the wood bring them to the place and drive them into the earth the entranc into thi place i made to be not by a door but by a short ladder to go over the top which ladder when i wa in i lift over after me and so i wa complet fenc in and fortifi as i thought from all the world and consequ slept secur in the night which otherwis i could not have done though as it appear afterward there wa no need of all thi caution from the enemi that i apprehend danger from into thi fenc or fortress with infinit labour i carri all my rich all my provis ammunit and store of which you have the account abov and i made me a larg tent which to preserv me from the rain that in on part of the year ar veri violent there i made doubl viz on smaller tent within and on larger tent abov it and cover the uppermost with a larg tarpaulin which i had save among the sail and now i lai no more for awhil in the bed which i had brought on shore but in a hammock which wa inde a veri good on and belong to the mate of the ship into thi tent i brought all my provis and everi thing that would spoil by the wet and have thu enclos all my good i made up the entranc which till now i had left open and so pass and repass as i said by a short ladder when i had done thi i began to work my wai into the rock and bring all the earth and stone that i dug down out through my tent i laid them up within my fenc in the natur of a terrac that so it rais the ground within about a foot and a half and thu i made me a cave just behind my tent which serv me like a cellar to my hous it cost me much labour and mani dai befor all these thing were brought to perfect and therefor i must go back to some other thing which took up some of my thought at the same time it happen after i had laid my scheme for the set up my tent and make the cave that a storm of rain fall from a thick dark cloud a sudden flash of lightn happen and after that a great clap of thunder as is natur the effect of it i wa not so much surpris with the lightn as i wa with a thought which dart into my mind as swift as the lightn itself o my powder my veri heart sunk within me when i thought that at on blast all my powder might be destroi on which not my defenc onli but the provid me food as i thought entir depend i wa noth near so anxiou about my own danger though had the powder took fire i had never known who had hurt me such impress did thi make upon me that after the storm wa over i laid asid all my work my build and fortifi and appli myself to make bag and box to separ the powder and to keep it a littl and a littl in a parcel in hope that whatev might come it might not all take fire at onc and to keep it so apart that it should not be possibl to make on part fire anoth i finish thi work in about a fortnight and i think my powder which in all wa about two hundr and forti pound weight wa divid in not less than a hundr parcel as to the barrel that had been wet i did not apprehend ani danger from that so i place it in my new cave which in my fanci i call my kitchen and the rest i hid up and down in hole among the rock so that no wet might come to it mark veri carefulli where i laid it in the interv of time while thi wa do i went out onc at least everi dai with my gun as well to divert myself as to see if i could kill ani thing fit for food and as near as i could to acquaint myself with what the island produc the first time i went out i present discov that there were goat in the island which wa a great satisfact to me but then it wa attend with thi misfortun to me viz that thei were so shy so subtl and so swift of foot that it wa the most difficult thing in the world to come at them but i wa not discourag at thi not doubt but i might now and then shoot on as it soon happen for after i had found their haunt a littl i laid wait in thi manner for them i observ if thei saw me in the valli though thei were upon the rock thei would run awai as in a terribl fright but if thei were feed in the valli and i wa upon the rock thei took no notic of me from whenc i conclud that by the posit of their optic their sight wa so direct downward that thei did not readili see object that were abov them so afterward i took thi method i alwai climb the rock first to get abov them and then had frequent a fair mark the first shot i made among these creatur kill a shegoat which had a littl kid by her which she gave suck to which griev me heartili but when the old on fell the kid stood stock still by her till i came and took her up and not onli so but when i carri the old on with me upon my shoulder the kid follow me quit to my enclosur upon which i laid down the dam and took the kid in my arm and carri it over my pale in hope to have bred it up tame but it would not eat so i wa forc to kill it and eat it myself these two suppli me with flesh a great while for i at sparingli and save my provis my bread especi as much as possibl i could have now fix my habit i found it absolut necessari to provid a place to make a fire in and fuel to burn and what i did for that as also how i enlarg my cave and what conveni i made i shall give a full account of in it place but i must first give some littl account of myself and of my thought about live which it mai well be suppos were not a few i had a dismal prospect of my condit for as i wa not cast awai upon that island without be driven as is said by a violent storm quit out of the cours of our intend voyag and a great wai viz some hundr of leagu out of the ordinari cours of the trade of mankind i had great reason to consid it as a determin of heaven that in thi desol place and in thi desol manner i should end my life the tear would run plentifulli down my face when i made these reflect and sometim i would expostul with myself why provid should thu complet ruin hi creatur and render them so absolut miser so without help abandon so entir depress that it could hardli be ration to be thank for such a life but someth alwai return swift upon me to check these thought and to reprov me and particularli on dai walk with my gun in my hand by the seasid i wa veri pensiv upon the subject of my present condit when reason as it were expostul with the tother wai thu well you ar in a desol condit ti true but prai rememb where ar the rest of you did not you come eleven of you into the boat where ar the ten why were thei not save and you lost why were you singl out is it better to be here or there and then i point to the sea all evil ar to be consid with the good that is in them and with what wors attend them then it occur to me again how well i wa furnish for my subsist and what would have been my eas if it had not happen which wa an hundr thousand to on that the ship float from the place where she first struck and wa driven so near the shore that i had time to get all these thing out of her what would have been my case if i had been to have live in the condit in which i at first came on shore without necessari of life or necessari to suppli and procur them particularli said i loud though to myself what should i have done without a gun without ammunit without ani tool to make ani thing or to work with without cloth bed a tent or ani manner of cover and that now i had all these to a suffici quantiti and wa in a fair wai to provid myself in such a manner as to live without my gun when my ammunit wa spent so that i had a toler view of subsist without ani want as long as i live for i consid from the begin how i should provid for the accid that might happen and for the time that wa to come even not onli after my ammunit should be spent but even after my health or strength should decai i confess i had not entertain ani notion of my ammunit be destroi at on blast i mean my powder be blown up by lightn and thi made the thought of it so surpris to me when it lightn and thunder as i observ just now and now be about to enter into a melancholi relat of a scene of silent life such perhap as wa never heard of in the world befor i shall take it from it begin and continu it in it order it wa by my account the th of septemb when in the manner as abov said i first set foot upon thi horrid island when the sun be to us in it autumn equinox wa almost just over my head for i reckon myself by observ to be in the latitud of degre minut north of the line after i had been there about ten or twelv dai it came into my thought that i should lose my reckon of time for want of book and pen and ink and should even forget the sabbath dai from the work dai but to prevent thi i cut it with my knife upon a larg post in capit letter and make it into a great cross i set it up on the shore where i first land viz i came on shore here on the th of septemb upon the side of thi squar post i cut everi dai a notch with my knife and everi seventh notch wa as long again as the rest and everi first dai of the month as long again as that long on and thu i kept my calendar or weekli monthli and yearli reckon of time in the next place we ar to observ that among the mani thing which i brought out of the ship in the sever voyag which as abov mention i made to it i got sever thing of less valu but not all less us to me which i omit set down befor as in particular pen ink and paper sever parcel in the captain mate gunner and carpent keep three or four compass some mathemat instrument dial perspect chart and book of navig all which i huddl togeth whether i might want them or no also i found three veri good bibl which came to me in my cargo from england and which i had pack up among my thing some portugues book also and among them two or three popish prayerbook and sever other book all which i carefulli secur and i must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and two cat of whose emin histori i mai have occas to sai someth in it place for i carri both the cat with me and as for the dog he jump out of the ship of himself and swam on shore to me the dai after i went on shore with my first cargo and wa a trusti servant to me mani year i want noth that he could fetch me nor ani compani that he could make up to me i onli want to have him talk to me but that he could not do as i observ befor i found pen ink and paper and i husband them to the utmost and i shall shew that while my ink last i kept thing veri exact but after that wa gone i could not for i could not make ani ink by ani mean that i could devis and thi put me in mind that i want mani thing notwithstand all that i had amass togeth and of these thi of ink wa on as also spade pickax and shovel to dig or remov the earth needl pin and thread as for linen i soon learnt to want that without much difficulti thi want of tool made everi work i did go on heavili and it wa near a whole year befor i had entir finish my littl pale or surround habit the pile or stake which were as heavi as i could well lift were a long time in cut and prepar in the wood and more by far in bring home so that i spent sometim two dai in cut and bring home on of those post and a third dai in drive it into the ground for which purpos i got a heavi piec of wood at first but at last bethought myself of on of the iron crow which howev though i found it yet it made drive those post or pile veri labori and tediou work but what need i have been concern at the tedious of ani thing i had to do see i had time enough to do it in nor had i ani other employ if that had been over at least that i could forese except the rang the island to seek for food which i did more or less everi dai i now began to consid serious my condit and the circumst i wa reduc to and i drew up the state of my affair in write not so much to leav them to ani that were to come after me for i wa like to have but few heir as to deliv my thought from daili pore upon them and afflict my mind and as my reason began now to master my despond i began to comfort myself as well as i could and to set the good against the evil that i might have someth to distinguish my case from wors and i state it veri imparti like debtor and creditor the comfort i enjoi against the miseri i suffer thu evil good i am cast upon a horribl but i am aliv and desol island void not drown as all my of all hope of recoveri ship compani wa i am singl out and but i am singl out separ as it were too from all the ship from all the world to be crew to be spare from miser death and he that miracul save me from death can deliv me from thi condit i am divid from but i am not starv mankind a solitair on and perish on a barren banish from human societi place afford no susten i have not cloth to but i am in a hot climat cover me where if i had cloth i could hardli wear them i am without ani defenc but i am cast on an or mean to resist island where i see no ani violenc of man or wild beast to hurt me beast as i saw on the coast of africa and what if i had been shipwreck there i have no soul to speak but god wonderfulli to or reliev me sent the ship in near enough to the shore that i have gotten out so mani necessari thing as will either suppli my want or enabl me to suppli myself even as long as i live upon the whole here wa an undoubt testimoni that there wa scarc ani condit in the world so miser but there wa someth neg or someth posit to be thank for in it and let thi stand as a direct from the experi of the most miser of all condit in thi world that we mai alwai find in it someth to comfort ourselv from and to set in the descript of good and evil on the credit side of the account have now brought my mind a littl to relish my condit and given over look out to sea to see if i could spy a ship i sai give over these thing i began to appli myself to accommod my wai of live and to make thing as easi to me as i could i have alreadi describ my habit which wa a tent under the side of a rock surround with a strong pale of post and cabl but i might now rather call it a wall for i rais a kind of wall up against it of turf about two foot thick on the outsid and after some time i think it wa a year and half i rais rafter from it lean to the rock and thatch or cover it with bough of tree and such thing as i could get to keep out the rain which i found at some time of the year veri violent i have alreadi observ how i brought all my good into thi pale and into the cave which i had made behind me but i must observ too that at first thi wa a confus heap of good which as thei lai in no order so thei took up all my place i had no room to turn myself so i set myself to enlarg my cave and work farther into the earth for it wa a loos sandi rock which yield easili to the labour i bestow on it and so when i found i wa pretti safe as to beast of prei i work sidewai to the right hand into the rock and then turn to the right again work quit out and made me a door to come out on the outsid of my pale or fortif thi gave me not onli egress and regress as it were a backwai to my tent and to my storehous but gave me room to stow my good and now i began to appli myself to make such necessari thing as i found i most want particularli a chair and a tabl for without these i wa not abl to enjoi the few comfort i had in the world i could not write or eat or do sever thing with so much pleasur without a tabl so i went to work and here i must need observ that as reason is the substanc and origin of the mathemat so by state and squar everi thing by reason and by make the most ration judgment of thing everi man mai be in time master of everi mechan art i had never handl a tool in my life and yet in time by labour applic and contriv i found at last that i want noth but i could have made it especi if i had had tool howev i made abund of thing even without tool and some with no more tool than an adz and a hatchet which perhap were never made that wai befor and that with infinit labour for exampl if i want a board i had no other wai but to cut down a tree set it on an edg befor me and hew it flat on either side with my ax till i had brought it to be as thin as a plank and then dub it smooth with my adz it is true by thi method i could make but on board out of a whole tree but thi i had no remedi for but patienc ani more than i had for the prodigi deal of time and labour which it took me up to make a plank or board but my time or labour wa littl worth and so it wa as well emploi on wai as anoth howev i made me a tabl and a chair as i observ abov in the first place and thi i did out of the short piec of board that i brought on my raft from the ship but when i had wrought out some board as abov i made larg shelv of the breadth of a foot and a half on over anoth all along on side of my cave to lai all my tool nail and ironwork and in a word to separ everi thing at larg in their place that i might come easili at them i knock piec into the wall of the rock to hang my gun and all thing that would hang up so that had my cave been to be seen it look like a gener magazin of all necessari thing and i had everi thing so readi at my hand that it wa a great pleasur to me to see all my good in such order and especi to find my stock of all necessari so great and now it wa that i began to keep a journal of everi dai employ for inde at first i wa in too much a hurri and not onli hurri as to labour but in too much discomposur of mind and my journal would have been full of mani dull thing for exampl i must have said thu sept the th after i got to shore and had escap drown instead of be thank to god for my deliver have first vomit with the great quantiti of salt water which wa gotten into my stomach and recov myself a littl i ran about the shore wring my hand and beat my head and face exclaim at my miseri and cry out i wa undon undon till tire and faint i wa forc to lie down on the ground to repos but durst not sleep for fear of be devour some dai after thi and after i had been on board the ship and got all that i could out of her yet i could not forbear get up to the top of a littl mountain and look out to sea in hope of see a ship then fanci at a vast distanc i spi a sail pleas myself with the hope of it and then after look steadili till i wa almost blind lose it quit and sit down and weep like a child and thu increas my miseri by my folli but have gotten over these thing in some measur and have settl my householdstuff and habit made me a tabl and a chair and all as handsom about me as i could i began to keep my journal of which i shall here give you the copi though in it will be told all those particular over again as long as it last for have no more ink i wa forc to leav it off the journal septemb i poor miser robinson cruso be shipwreck dure a dread storm in the of came on shore on thi dismal unfortun island which i call the island of despair all the rest of the ship compani be drown and myself almost dead all the rest of that dai i spent in afflict myself at the dismal circumst i wa brought to viz i had neither food hous cloth weapon or place to fly to and in despair of ani relief saw noth but death befor me either that i should be devour by wild beast murder by savag or starv to death for want of food at the approach of night i slept in a tree for fear of wild creatur but slept soundli though it rain all night octob in the morn i saw to my great surpris the ship had float with the high tide and wa driven on shore again much nearer the island which as it wa some comfort on on hand for see her sit upright and not broken to piec i hope if the wind abat i might get on board and get some food and necessari out of her for my relief so on the other hand it renew my grief at the loss of my comrad who i imagin if we had all staid on board might have save the ship or at least that thei would not have been all drown as thei were and that had the men been save we might perhap have built us a boat out of the ruin of the ship to have carri us to some other part of the world i spent great part of thi dai in perplex myself on these thing but at length see the ship almost dry i went upon the sand as near as i could and then swam on board thi dai also it continu rain though with no wind at all from the st of octob to the th all these dai entir spent in mani sever voyag to get all i could out of the ship which i brought on shore everi tide of flood upon raft much rain also in these dai though with some interv of fair weather but it seem thi wa the raini season oct i overset my raft and all the good i had got up upon it but be in shoal water and the thing be chiefli heavi i recov mani of them when the tide wa out oct it rain all night and all dai with some gust of wind dure which time the ship broke in piec the wind blow a littl harder than befor and wa no more to be seen except the wreck of her and that onli at low water i spent thi dai in cover and secur the good which i had save that rain might not spoil them oct i walk about the shore almost all dai to find out a place to fix my habit greatli concern to secur myself from ani attack in the night either from wild beast or men toward night i fix upon a proper place under a rock and mark out a semicircl for my encamp which i resolv to strengthen with a work wall or fortif made of doubl pile line within with cabl and without with turf from the th to the th i work veri hard in carri all my good to my new habit though some part of the time it rain exceed hard the st in the morn i went out into the island with my gun to see for some food and discov the countri when i kill a she goat and her kid follow me home which i afterward kill also becaus it would not feed novemb i set up my tent under a rock and lai there for the first night make it as larg as i could with stake driven in to swing my hammock upon nov i set up all my chest and board and the piec of timber which made my raft and with them form a fenc round me a littl within the place i had mark out for my fortif nov i went out with my gun and kill two fowl like duck which were veri good food in the afternoon went to work to make me a tabl nov thi morn i began to order my time of work of go out with my gun time of sleep and time of divers viz everi morn i walk out with my gun for two or three hour if it did not rain then emploi myself to work till about eleven oclock then at what i had to live on and from twelv to two i lai down to sleep the weather be excess hot and then in the even to work again the work part of thi dai and of the next were wholli emploi in make my tabl for i wa yet but a veri sorri workman though time and necess make me a complet natur mechan soon after as i believ it would do ani on els nov thi dai went abroad with my gun and my dog and kill a wild cat her skin pretti soft but her flesh good for noth everi creatur i kill i took off the skin and preserv them come back by the seashor i saw mani sort of seafowl which i did not understand but wa surpris and almost fright with two or three seal which while i wa gaze at not well know what thei were got into the sea and escap me for that time nov after my morn walk i went to work with my tabl again and finish it though not to my like nor wa it long befor i learnt to mend it nov now it began to be settl fair weather the th th th th and part of the th for the th wa sundai i took wholli up to make me a chair and with much ado brought it to a toler shape but never to pleas me and even in the make i pull it in piec sever time note i soon neglect my keep sundai for omit my mark for them on my post i forgot which wa which nov thi dai it rain which refresh me exceedingli and cool the earth but it wa accompani with terribl thunder and lightn which fright me dreadfulli for fear of my powder as soon as it wa over i resolv to separ my stock of powder into as mani littl parcel as possibl that it might not be in danger nov these three dai i spent in make littl squar chest or box which might hold a pound or two pound at most of powder and so put the powder in i stow it in place as secur and remot from on anoth as possibl on on of these three dai i kill a larg bird that wa good to eat but i knew not what to call it nov thi dai i began to dig behind my tent into the rock to make room for my farther conveni note three thing i want exceedingli for thi work viz a pickax a shovel and a wheelbarrow or basket so i desist from my work and began to consid how to suppli that want and make me some tool as for a pickax i made us of the iron crow which were proper enough though heavi but the next thing wa a shovel or spade thi wa so absolut necessari that inde i could do noth effectu without it but what kind of on to make i knew not nov the next dai in search the wood i found a tree of that wood or like it which in the brasil thei call the iron tree for it exceed hard of thi with great labour and almost spoil my ax i cut a piec and brought it home too with difficulti enough for it wa exceed heavi the excess hard of the wood and have no other wai made me a long while upon thi machin for i work it effectu by littl and littl into the form of a shovel or spade the handl exactli shape like our in england onli that the broad part have no iron shod upon it at bottom it would not last me so long howev it serv well enough for the us which i had occas to put it to but never wa a shovel i believ made after that fashion or so long a make i wa still defici for i want a basket or a wheelbarrow a basket i could not make by ani mean have no such thing as twig that would bend to make wickerwar at least none yet found out and as to a wheelbarrow i fanci i could make all but the wheel but that i had no notion of neither did i know how to go about it besid i had no possibl wai to make the iron gudgeon for the spindl or axi of the wheel to run in so i gave it over and so for carri awai the earth which i dug out of the cave i made me a thing like a hod which the labour carri mortar in when thei serv the bricklay thi wa not so difficult to me as the make the shovel and yet thi and the shovel and the attempt which i made in vain to make a wheelbarrow took me up no less than four dai i mean alwai except my morn walk with my gun which i seldom fail and veri seldom fail also bring home someth to eat nov my other work have now stood still becaus of my make these tool when thei were finish i went on and work everi dai as my strength and time allow i spent eighteen dai entir in widen and deepen my cave that it might hold my good commodi note dure all thi time i work to make thi room or cave spaciou enough to accommod me as a warehous or magazin a kitchen a diningroom and a cellar as for my lodg i kept to the tent except that sometim in the wet season of the year it rain so hard that i could not keep myself dry which caus me afterward to cover all my place within my pale with long pole in the form of rafter lean against the rock and load them with flag and larg leav of tree like a thatch dec i began now to think my cave or vault finish when on a sudden it seem i had made it too larg a great quantiti of earth fell down from the top and on side so much that in short it fright me and not without reason too for if i had been under it i had never want a gravedigg upon thi disast i had a great deal of work to do over again for i had the loos earth to carri out and which wa of more import i had the ceil to prop up so that i might be sure no more would come down dec thi dai i went to work with it accordingli and got two shore or post pitch upright to the top with two piec of board across over each post thi i finish the next dai and set more post up with board in about a week more i had the roof secur and the post stand in row serv me for partit to part off my hous dec from thi dai to the twentieth i place shelv and knock up nail on the post to hang everi thing up that could be hung up and now i began to be in some order within door dec now i carri everi thing into the cave and began to furnish my hous and set up some piec of board like a dresser to order my victual upon but board began to be veri scarc with me also i made me anoth tabl dec much rain all night and all dai no stir out dec rain all dai dec no rain and the earth much cooler than befor and pleasant dec kill a young goat and lame anoth so that i caught it and led it home in a string when i had it home i bound and splinter up it leg which wa broke nb i took such care of it that it live and the leg grew well and as strong as ever but by nurs it so long it grew tame and fed upon the littl green at my door and would not go awai thi wa the first time that i entertain a thought of breed up some tame creatur that i might have food when my powder and shot wa all spent dec great heat and no breez so that there wa no stir abroad except in the even for food thi time i spent in put all my thing in order within door januari veri hot still but i went abroad earli and late with my gun and lai still in the middl of the dai thi even go farther into the valli which lai toward the centr of the island i found there wa plenti of goat though exceed shy and hard to come at howev i resolv to try if i could not bring my dog to hunt them down jan accordingli the next dai i went out with my dog and set him upon the goat but i wa mistaken for thei all face about upon the dog and he knew hi danger too well for he would not come near them jan i began my fenc or wall which be still jealou of my be attack by somebodi i resolv to make veri thick and strong nb thi wall be describ befor i purpos omit what wa said in the journal it is suffici to observ that i wa no less time than from the d of januari to the th of april work finish and perfect thi wall though it wa no more than about twentyfour yard in length be a halfcircl from on place in the rock to anoth place about eight yard from it the door of the cave be in the centr behind it all thi time i work veri hard the rain hinder me mani dai nai sometim week togeth but i thought i should never be perfectli secur until thi wall wa finish and it is scarc credibl what inexpress labour everi thing wa done with especi the bring pile out of the wood and drive them into the ground for i made them much bigger than i need to have done when thi wall wa finish and the outsid doubl fenc with a turf wall rais up close to it i persuad myself that if ani peopl were to come on shore there thei would not perceiv ani thing like a habit and it wa veri well i did so as mai be observ hereaft upon a veri remark occas dure thi time i made my round in the wood for game everi dai when the rain admit me and made frequent discoveri in these walk of someth or other to my advantag particularli i found a kind of wild pigeon who built not as wood pigeon in a tree but rather as hous pigeon in the hole of the rock and take some young on i endeavour to breed them up tame and did so but when thei grew older thei flew awai which perhap wa at first for want of feed them for i had noth to give them howev i frequent found their nest and got their young on which were veri good meat and now in the manag my household affair i found myself want in mani thing which i thought at first it wa imposs for me to make as inde as to some of them it wa for instanc i could never make a cask to be hoop i had a small runlet or two as i observ befor but i could never arriv to the capac of make on by them though i spent mani week about it i could neither put in the head or joint the stave so true to on anoth as to make them hold water so i gave that also over in the next place i wa at a great loss for candl so that as soon as ever it wa dark which wa gener by seven oclock i wa oblig to go to bed i rememb the lump of beeswax with which i made candl in my african adventur but i had none of that now the onli remedi i had wa that when i had kill a goat i save the tallow and with a littl dish made of clai which i bake in the sun to which i ad a wick of some oakum i made me a lamp and thi gave me light though not a clear steadi light like a candl in the middl of all my labour it happen that rummag my thing i found a littl bag which as i hint befor had been fill with corn for the feed of poultri not for thi voyag but befor as i suppos when the ship came from lisbon what littl remaind of corn had been in the bag wa all devour with the rat and i saw noth in the bag but husk and dust and be will to have the bag for some other us i think it wa to put powder in when i divid it for fear of the lightn or some such us i shook the husk of corn out of it on on side of my fortif under the rock it wa a littl befor the great rain just now mention that i threw thi stuff awai take no notic of ani thing and not so much as rememb that i had thrown ani thing there when about a month after or thereabout i saw some few stalk of someth green shoot out of the ground which i fanci might be some plant i had not seen but i wa surpris and perfectli astonish when after a littl longer time i saw about ten or twelv ear come out which were perfect green barlei of the same kind as our european nai as our english barlei it is imposs to express the astonish and confus of my thought on thi occas i had hitherto act upon no religi foundat at all inde i had veri few notion of religion in my head or had entertain ani sens of ani thing that had befallen me otherwis than as a chanc or as we lightli sai what pleas god without so much as inquir into the end of provid in these thing or hi order in govern event in the world but after i saw barlei grow there in a climat which i knew wa not proper for corn and especi that i knew not how it came there it startl me strang and i began to suggest that god had miracul caus thi grain to grow without ani help of seed sown and that it wa so direct pure for my susten on that wild miser place thi touch my heart a littl and brought tear out of my ey and i began to bless myself that such a prodigi of natur should happen upon my account and thi wa the more strang to me becaus i saw near it still all along by the side of the rock some other straggl stalk which prove to be stalk of rice and which i knew becaus i had seen it grow in africa when i wa ashor there i not onli thought these the pure product of provid for my support but not doubt but that there wa more in the place i went all over that part of the island where i had been befor peep in everi corner and under everi rock to see for more of it but i could not find ani at last it occur to my thought that i had shook a bag of chicken meat out in that place and then the wonder began to ceas and i must confess my religi thank to god provid began to abat too upon discov that all thi wa noth but what wa common though i ought to have been as thank for so strang and unforeseen a provid as if it had been miracul for it wa realli the work of provid as to me that should order or appoint ten or twelv grain of corn to remain unspoil when the rat had destroi all the rest as if it had been drop from heaven as also that i should throw it out in that particular place where it be in the shade of a high rock it sprang up immedi wherea if i had thrown it ani were els at that time it had been burnt up and destroi i carefulli save the ear of corn you mai be sure in their season which wa about the end of june and lai up everi corn i resolv to sow them all again hope in time to have some quantiti suffici to suppli me with bread but it wa not till the fourth year that i could allow myself the least grain of thi corn to eat and even then but sparingli as i shall sai afterward in it order for i lost all that i sow the first season by not observ the proper time for i sow it just befor the dry season so that it never came up at all at least not as it would have done of which in it place besid thi barlei there were as abov twenti or thirti stalk of rice which i preserv with the same care and whose us wa of the same kind or to the same purpos viz to make me bread or rather food for i found wai to cook it up without bake though i did that also after some time but to return to my journal i work excess hard these three or four month to get my wall done and the th of april i close it up contriv to go into it not by a door but over the wall by a ladder that there might be no sign in the outsid of my habit april i finish the ladder so i went up with the ladder to the top and then pull it up after me and let it down on the insid thi wa a complet enclosur to me for within i had room enough and noth could come at me from without unless it could first mount my wall the veri next dai after thi wall wa finish i had almost had all my labour overthrown at onc and myself kill the case wa thu as i wa busi in the insid of it behind my tent just in the entranc into my cave i wa terribl fright with a most dread surpris thing inde for on a sudden i found the earth come crumbl down from the roof of my cave and from the edg of the hill over my head and two of the post i had set up in the cave crack in a fright manner i wa heartili scare but thought noth of what wa realli the caus onli think that the top of my cave wa fall in as some of it had done befor and for fear i should be buri in it i ran forward to my ladder and not think myself safe there neither i got over my wall for fear of the piec of the hill which i expect might roll down upon me i wa no sooner stept down upon the firm ground but i plainli saw it wa a terribl earthquak for the ground i stood on shook three time at about eight minut distanc with three such shock as would have overturn the strongest build that could be suppos to have stood on the earth and a great piec of the top of a rock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with such a terribl nois as i never heard in all my life i perceiv also the veri sea wa put into violent motion by it and i believ the shock were stronger under the water than on the island i wa so amaz with the thing itself have never felt the like or discours with ani on that had that i wa like on dead or stupifi and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick like on that wa toss at sea but the nois of the fall of the rock awak me as it were and rous me from the stupifi condit i wa in fill me with horror and i thought of noth then but the hill fall upon my tent and all my household good and buri all at onc and thi sunk my veri soul within me a second time after the third shock wa over and i felt no more for some time i began to take courag and yet i had not heart enough to get over my wall again for fear of be buri aliv but sat still upon the ground greatli cast down and disconsol not know what to do all thi while i had not the least seriou religi thought noth but the common lord have merci upon me and when it wa over that went awai too while i sat thu i found the air overcast and grow cloudi as if it would rain soon after that the wind rose by littl and littl so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dread hurrican the sea wa all on a sudden cover over with foam and froth the shore wa cover with the breach of the water the tree were torn up by the root and a terribl storm it wa and thi held about three hour and then began to abat and in two hour more it wa stark calm and began to rain veri hard all thi while i sat upon the ground veri much terrifi and deject when on a sudden it came into my thought that these wind and rain be the consequ of the earthquak the earthquak itself wa spent and over and i might ventur into my cave again with thi thought my spirit began to reviv and the rain also help to persuad me i went in and sat down in my tent but the rain wa so violent that my tent wa readi to be beaten down with it and i wa forc to go into my cave though veri much afraid and uneasi for fear it should fall on my head thi violent rain forc me to a new work viz to cut a hole through my new fortif like a sink to let water go out which would els have drown my cave after i had been in my cave some time and found still no more shock of the earthquak follow i began to be more compos and now to support my spirit which inde want it veri much i went to my littl store and took a small sup of rum which howev i did then and alwai veri sparingli know i could have no more when that wa gone it continu rain all that night and great part of the next dai so that i could not stir abroad but my mind be more compos i began to think of what i had best do conclud that if the island wa subject to these earthquak there would be no live for me in a cave but i must consid of build me some littl hut in an open place which i might surround with a wall as i had done here and so make myself secur from wild beast or men but conclud if i staid where i wa i should certainli on time or other be buri aliv with these thought i resolv to remov my tent from the place where it stood which wa just under the hang precipic of the hill and which if it should be shaken again would certainli fall upon my tent and i spent the two next dai be the th and th of april in contriv where and how to remov my habit the fear of be swallow up aliv made me that i never slept in quiet and yet the apprehens of ly abroad without ani fenc wa almost equal to it but still when i look about and saw how everi thing wa put in order how pleasantli conceal i wa and how safe from danger it made me veri loth to remov in the meantim it occur to me that it would requir a vast deal of time for me to do thi and that i must be content to run the ventur where i wa till i had form a camp for myself and had secur it so as to remov to it so with thi resolut i compos myself for a time and resolv that i would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with pile and cabl c in a circl as befor and set my tent up in it when it wa finish but that i would ventur to stai where i wa till it wa finish and fit to remov to thi wa the st april the next morn i began to consid of mean to put thi resolv in execut but i wa at a great loss about my tool i had three larg ax and abund of hatchet for we carri the hatchet for traffic with the indian but with much chop and cut knotti hard wood thei were all full of notch and dull and though i had a grindston i could not turn it and grind my tool too thi cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestow upon a grand point of polit or a judg upon the life and death of a man at length i contriv a wheel with a string to turn it with my foot that i might have both my hand at liberti note i had never seen ani such thing in england or at least not to take notic how it wa done though sinc i have observ it is veri common there besid that my grindston wa veri larg and heavi thi machin cost me a full week work to bring it to perfect april these two whole dai i took up in grind my tool my machin for turn my grindston perform veri well april have perceiv my bread had been low a great while now i took a survei of it and reduc myself to on biscuitcak a dai which made my heart veri heavi mai in the morn look toward the seasid the tide be low i saw someth lie on the shore bigger than ordinari and it look like a cask when i came to it i found a small barrel and two or three piec of the wreck of the ship which were driven on shore by the late hurrican and look toward the wreck itself i thought it seem to lie higher out of the water than it us to do i examin the barrel which wa driven on shore and soon found it wa a barrel of gunpowd but it had taken water and the powder wa cake as hard as a stone howev i roll it farther on shore for the present and went on upon the sand as near as i could to the wreck of the ship to look for more when i came down to the ship i found it strang remov the forecastl which lai befor buri in sand wa heav up at least six foot and the stern which wa broke to piec and part from the rest by the forc of the sea soon after i had left rummag her wa toss as it were up and cast on on side and the sand wa thrown so high on that side next her stern that wherea there wa a great place of water befor so that i could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swim i could now walk quit up to her when the tide wa out i wa surpris with thi at first but soon conclud it must be done by the earthquak and as by thi violenc the ship wa more broken open than formerli so mani thing came daili on shore which the sea had loosen and which the wind and water roll by degre to the land thi wholli divert my thought from the design of remov my habit and i busi myself mightili that dai especi in search whether i could make ani wai into the ship but i found noth wa to be expect of that kind for that all the insid of the ship wa choke up with sand howev as i had learnt not to despair of ani thing i resolv to pull everi thing to piec that i could of the ship conclud that everi thing i could get from her would be of some us or other to me mai i began with my saw and cut a piec of a beam through which i thought held some of the upper part or quarterdeck togeth and when i had cut it through i clear awai the sand as well as i could from the side which lai highest but the tide come in i wa oblig to give over for that time wai i went afish but caught not on fish that i durst eat of till i wa weari of my sport when just go to leav off i caught a young dolphin i had made me a long line of some rope yarn but i had no hook yet i frequent caught fish enough as much as i care to eat all which i dri in the sun and at them dry mai work on the wreck cut anoth beam asund and brought three great fir plank off from the deck which i ti togeth and made swim on shore when the tide of flood came on mai work on the wreck got sever iron bolt out of her and other piec of ironwork work veri hard and came home veri much tire and had thought of give it over mai went to the wreck again but with an intent not to work but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down the beam be cut that

which i alwai appoint dure thi part of my employ to be when the tide wa up that i might be readi when it wa eb out and by thi time i had gotten timber and plank and ironwork enough to have built a good boat if i had known how and also i got at sever time and in sever piec near on hundr weight of the sheetlead june go down to the seasid i found a larg tortois or turtl thi wa the first i had seen which it seem wa onli my misfortun not ani defect of the place or scarciti for had i happen to be on the other side of the island i might have had hundr of them everi dai as i found afterward but perhap had paid dear enough for them june i spent in cook the turtl i found in her threescor egg and her flesh wa to me at that time the most savori and pleasant that ever i tast in my life have had no flesh but of goat and fowl sinc i land in thi horrid place june rain all dai and i stai within i thought at thi time the rain felt cold and i wa someth chilli which i knew wa not usual in that

agu again so violent that i lai ab all dai and neither at or drank i wa readi to perish for thirst but so weak i had not strength to stand up or to get myself ani water to drink prai to god again but wa lighthead and when i wa not i wa so ignor that i knew not what to sai onli i lai and cri lord look upon me lord piti me lord have merci upon me i suppos i did noth els for two or three hour till the fit wear off i fell asleep and did not wake till far in the night when i wake i found myself much refresh but weak and exceed thirsti howev as i had no water in my whole habit i wa forc to lie till morn and went to sleep again in thi second sleep i had thi terribl dream i thought that i wa sit on the ground on the outsid of my wall where i sat when the storm blew after the earthquak and that i saw a man descend from a great black cloud in a bright flame of fire and light upon the ground he wa all over as bright as a flame so that i could but just bear to look toward him hi counten wa most inexpress dread imposs for word to describ when he step upon the ground with hi feet i thought the earth trembl just as it had done befor in the earthquak and all the air look to my apprehens as if it had been fill with flash of fire he wa no sooner land upon the earth but he move forward toward me with a long spear or weapon in hi hand to kill me and when he came to a rise ground at some distanc he spoke to me or i heard a voic so terribl that it is imposs to express the terror of it all that i can sai i understood wa thi see all these thing have not brought thee to repent now thou shall die at which word i thought he lift up the spear that wa in hi hand to kill me no on that shall ever read thi account will expect that i should be abl to describ the horror of my soul at thi terribl vision i mean that even while it wa a dream i even dream of those horror nor is it ani more possibl to describ the impress that remain upon my mind when i awak and found it wa but a dream i had ala no divin knowledg what i had receiv by the good instruct of my father wa then worn out by an uninterrupt seri for eight year of seafar wicked and a constant convers with noth but such as were like myself wick and profan to the last degre i do not rememb that i had in all that time on thought that so much as tend either to look upward toward god or inward toward a reflect upon my own wai but a certain stupid of soul without desir of good or conscienc of evil had entir overwhelm me and i wa all that the most harden unthink wick creatur among our common sailor can be suppos to be not have the least sens either of the fear of god in danger or of thank to god in deliver in the relat what is alreadi past of my stori thi will be the more easili believ when i shall add that through all the varieti of miseri that had to thi dai befallen me i never had so much as on thought of it be the hand of god or that it wa a just punish for my sin my rebelli behaviour against my father or my present sin which were great or so much as a punish for the gener cours of my wick life when i wa on the desper expedit on the desert shore of africa i never had so much as on thought of what would becom of me or on wish to god to direct me whither i should go or to keep me from the danger which appar surround me as well from voraci creatur as cruel savag but i wa mere thoughtless of a god or a provid act like a mere brute from the principl of natur and by the dictat of common sens onli and inde hardli that when i wa deliv and taken up at sea by the portug captain well us and dealt justli and honour with as well as charit i had not the least thank on my thought when again i wa shipwreck ruin and in danger of drown on thi island i wa as far from remors or look on it as a judgment i onli said to myself often that i wa an unfortun dog and born to be alwai miser it is true when i got on shore first here and found all my ship crew drown and myself spare i wa surpris with a kind of ecstasi and some transport of soul which had the grace of god assist might have come up to true thank but it end where it begun in a mere common flight of joi or as i mai sai be glad i wa aliv without the least reflect upon the distinguish good of the hand which had preserv me and had singl me out to be preserv when all the rest were destroi or an inquiri why provid had been thu merci to me even just the same common sort of joi which seamen gener have after thei have got safe on shore from a shipwreck which thei drown all in the next bowl of punch and forget almost as soon as it is over and all the rest of my life wa like it even when i wa afterward on due consider made sensibl of my condit how i wa cast on thi dread place out of the reach of human kind out of all hope of relief or prospect of redempt as soon as i saw but a prospect of live and that i should not starv and perish for hunger all the sens of my afflict wore off and i began to be veri easi appli myself to the work proper for my preserv and suppli and wa far enough from be afflict at my condit as a judgment from heaven or as the hand of god against me these were thought which veri seldom enter into my head the grow up of the corn as is hint in my journal had at first some littl influenc upon me and began to affect me with serious as long as i thought it had someth miracul in it but as soon as ever that part of thought wa remov all the impress which wa rais from it wore off also as i have note alreadi even the earthquak though noth could be more terribl in it natur or more immedi direct to the invis power which alon direct such thing yet no sooner wa the first fright over but the impress it had made went off also i had no more sens of god or hi judgment much less of the present afflict of my circumst be from hi hand than if i had been in the most prosper condit of life but now when i began to be sick and a leisur view of the miseri of death came to place itself befor me when my spirit began to sink under the burden of a strong distemp and natur wa exhaust with the violenc of the fever conscienc that had slept so long began to awak and i began to reproach myself with my past life in which i had so evid by uncommon wicked provok the justic of god to lai me under uncommon stroke and to deal with me in so vindict a manner these reflect oppress me from the second or third dai of my distemp and in the violenc as well of the fever as of the dread reproach of my conscienc extort some word from me like prai to god though i cannot sai thei were either a prayer attend with desir or with hope it wa rather the voic of mere fright and distress my thought were confus the convict great upon my mind and the horror of dy in such a miser condit rais vapour into my head with the mere apprehens and in these hurri of my soul i knew not what my tongu might express but it wa rather exclam such as lord what a miser creatur am i if i should be sick i shall certainli die for want of help and what will becom of me then the tear burst out of my ey and i could sai no more for a good while in thi interv the good advic of my father came to my mind and present hi predict which i mention in the begin of thi stori viz that if i did take thi foolish step god would not bless me and i would have leisur hereaft to reflect upon have neglect hi counsel when there might be none to assist in my recoveri now said i aloud my dear father word ar come to pass god justic ha overtaken me and i have none to help or hear me i reject the voic of provid which had mercifulli put me in a postur or station of life wherein i might have been happi and easi but i would neither see it myself nor learn to know the bless of it from my parent i left them to mourn over my folli and now i am left to mourn under the consequ of it i refus their help and assist who would have lift me into the world and would have made everi thing easi to me and now i have difficulti to struggl with too great for even natur itself to support and no assist no help no comfort no advic then i cri out lord be my help for i am in great distress thi wa the first prayer if i might call it so that i had made for mani year but i return to my journal june have been somewhat refresh with the sleep i had had and the fit be entir off i got up and though the fright and terror of my dream wa veri great yet i consid that the fit of the agu would return again the next dai and now wa my time to get someth to refresh and support myself when i should be ill and the first thing i did i fill a larg squar casebottl with water and set it upon my tabl in reach of my bed and to take off the chill or aguish disposit of the water i put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it and mix them togeth then i got me a piec of the goat flesh and broil it on the coal but could eat veri littl i walk about but wa veri weak and withal veri sad and heavyheart under a sens of my miser condit dread the return of my distemp the next dai at night i made my supper of three of the turtl egg which i roast in the ash and at as we call it in the shell and thi wa the first bit of meat i had ever ask god bless to even as i could rememb in my whole life after i had eaten i tri to walk but found myself so weak that i could hardli carri the gun for i never went out without that so i went but a littl wai and sat down upon the ground look out upon the sea which wa just befor me and veri calm and smooth as i sat here some such thought as these occur to me what is the earth and sea of which i have seen so much whenc is it produc and what am i and all the other creatur wild and tame human and brutal whenc ar we sure we ar all made by some secret power who form the earth and sea the air and sky and who is that then it follow most natur it is god that ha made it all well but then it came on strang if god ha made all these thing he guid and govern them all and all thing that concern them for the be that could make all thing must certainli have power to guid and direct them if so noth can happen in the great circuit of hi work either without hi knowledg or appoint and if noth happen without hi knowledg he know that i am here and am in a dread condit and if noth happen without hi appoint he ha appoint all thi to befal me noth occur to my thought to contradict ani of these conclus and therefor it rest upon me with the greater forc that it must need be that god had appoint all thi to befal me that i wa brought to thi miser circumst by hi direct he have the sole power not of me onli but of everi thing that happen in the world immedi it follow why ha god done thi to me what have i done to be thu us my conscienc present check me in that inquiri as if i had blasphem and methought it spoke to me like a voic wretch dost thou ask what thou hast done look back upon a dread mispent life and ask thyself what thou hast not done ask why is it that thou wert not long ago destroi why wert thou not drown in yarmouth road kill in the fight when the ship wa taken by the salle man of war devour by the wild beast on the coast of africa or drown here when all the crew perish but thyself dost thou ask what have i done i wa struck with these reflect as on astonish and had not a word to sai no not to answer to myself but rose up pensiv and sad walk back to my retreat and went up over my wall as if i had been go to bed but my thought were sadli disturb and i had no inclin to sleep so i sat down in my chair and light my lamp for it began to be dark now as the apprehens of the return of my distemp terrifi me veri much it occur to my thought that the brasilian take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distemp and i had a piec of a roll of tobacco in on of the chest which wa quit cure and some also that wa green and not quit cure i went direct by heaven no doubt for in thi chest i found a cure both for soul and bodi i open the chest and found what i look for viz the tobacco and as the few book i had save lai there too i took out on of the bibl which i mention befor and which to thi time i had not found leisur or so much as inclin to look into i sai i took it out and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the tabl what us to make of the tobacco i knew not as to my distemp or whether it wa good for it or no but i tri sever experi with it as if i wa resolv it should hit on wai or other i first took a piec of a leaf and chew it in my mouth which inde at first almost stupifi my brain the tobacco be green and strong and that i had not been much us to it then i took some and steep it an hour or two in some rum and resolv to take a dose of it when i lai down and lastli i burnt some upon a pan of coal and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as i could bear it as well for the heat as the virtu of it and i held almost to suffoc in the interv of thi oper i took up the bibl and began to read but my head wa too much disturb with the tobacco to bear read at least at that time onli have open the book casual the first word that occur to me were these call on me in the dai of troubl and i will deliv and thou shalt glorifi me the word were veri apt to my case and made some impress upon my thought at the time of read them though not so much as thei did afterward for as for be deliv the word had no sound as i mai sai to me the thing wa so remot so imposs in my apprehens of thing that i began to sai as the children of israel did when thei were promis flesh to eat can god spread a tabl in the wilder so i began to sai can god himself deliv me from thi place and as it wa not for mani year that ani hope appear thi prevail veri often upon my thought but howev the word made a veri great impress upon me and i muse upon them veri often it grew now late and the tobacco had as i said doze my head so much that i inclin to sleep so that i left my lamp burn in the cave lest i should want ani thing in the night and went to bed but befor i lai down i did what i never had done in all my life i kneel down and prai to god to fulfil the promis to me that if i call upon him in the dai of troubl he would deliv me after my broken and imperfect prayer wa over i drank the rum in which i had steep the tobacco which wa so strong and rank of the tobacco that inde i could scarc get it down immedi upon thi i went to bed and i found present it flew up into my head violent but i fell into a sound sleep and wake no more till by the sun it must necessarili be near three oclock in the afternoon the next dai nai to thi hour i am partli of the opinion that i slept all the next dai and night and till almost three the dai after for otherwis i knew not how i should lose a dai out of my reckon in the dai of the week as it appear some year after i had done for if i had lost it by cross and recross the line i should have lost more than a dai but in my account it wa lost and i never knew which wai be that howev on wai or other when i awak i found myself exceedingli refresh and my spirit live and cheer when i got up i wa stronger than i wa the dai befor and my stomach better for i wa hungri and in short i had no fit the next dai but continu much alter for the better thi wa the th the th wa my well dai of cours and i went abroad with my gun but did not care to travel too far i kill a seafowl or two someth like a brand goos and brought them home but wa not veri forward to eat them so i at some more of the turtl egg which were veri good thi even i renew the medicin which i had suppos did me good the dai befor viz the tobacco steep in rum onli i did not take so much as befor nor did i chew ani of the leaf or hold my head over the smoke howev i wa not so well the next dai which wa the st of juli as i hope i should have been for i had a littl spice of the cold fit but it wa not much juli i renew the medicin all the three wai and doze myself with it at first and doubl the quantiti which i drank juli i miss the fit for good and all though i did not recov my full strength for some week after while i wa thu gather strength my thought ran exceedingli upon thi scriptur i will deliv thee and the imposs of my deliver lai much upon my mind in bar of my ever expect it but as i wa discourag myself with such thought it occur to my mind that i pore so much upon my deliver from the main afflict that i disregard the deliver i had receiv and i wa as it were made to ask myself such question as these viz have i not been deliv and wonderfulli too from sick from the most distress condit that could be and that wa so fright to me and what notic had i taken of it had i done my part god had deliv me but i had not glorifi him that is to sai i had not own and been thank for that as a deliver and how could i expect greater deliver thi touch my heart veri much and immedi i kneel down and gave god thank aloud for my recoveri from my sick juli in the morn i took the bibl and begin at the new testament i began serious to read it and impos upon myself to read a while everi morn and everi night not ty myself to the number of chapter but as long as my thought should engag me it wa not long after i set serious to thi work but i found my heart more deepli and sincer affect with the wicked of my past life the impress of my dream reviv and the word all these thing have not brought thee to repent ran serious in my thought i wa earnestli beg of god to give me repent when it happen providenti the veri dai that read the scriptur i came to these word he is exalt a princ and a saviour to give repent and to give remiss i threw down the book and with my heart as well as my hand lift up to heaven in a kind of ecstasi of joi i cri out aloud jesu thou son of david jesu thou exalt princ and saviour give me repent thi wa the first time that i could sai in the true sens of the word that i prai in all my life for now i prai with a sens of my condit and with a true scriptur view of hope found on the encourag of the word of god and from thi time i mai sai i began to have hope that god would hear me now i began to constru the word mention abov call on me and i will deliv thee in a differ sens from what i had ever done befor for then i had no notion of ani thing be call deliver but my be deliv from the captiv i wa in for though i wa inde at larg in the place yet the island wa certainli a prison to me and that in the worst sens in the world but now i learnt to take it in anoth sens now i look back upon my past life with such horror and my sin appear so dread that my soul sought noth of god but deliver from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort as for my solitari life it wa noth i did not so much as prai to be deliv from it or think of it it wa all of no consider in comparison of thi and i ad thi part here to hint to whoever shall read it that whenev thei come to a true sens of thing thei will find deliver from sin a much greater bless than deliver from afflict but leav thi part i return to my journal my condit began now to be though not less miser as to my wai of live yet much easier to my mind and my thought be direct by a constant read the scriptur and prai to god to thing of a higher natur i had a great deal of comfort within which till now i knew noth of also as my health and strength return i bestir myself to furnish myself with everi thing that i want and make my wai of live as regular as i could from the th of juli to the th i wa chiefli emploi in walk about with my gun in my hand a littl and a littl at a time as a man that wa gather up hi strength after a fit of sick for it is hardli to be imagin how low i wa and to what weak i wa reduc the applic which i made us of wa perfectli new and perhap what had never cure an agu befor neither can i recommend it to ani on to practis by thi experi and though it did carri off the fit yet it rather contribut to weaken me for i had frequent convuls in my nerv and limb for some time i learnt from it also thi in particular that be abroad in the raini season wa the most pernici thing to my health that could be especi in those rain which came attend with storm and hurrican of wind for as the rain which came in a dry season wa alwai most accompani with such storm so i found thi rain wa much more danger than the rain which fell in septemb and octob i had been now in thi unhappi island abov ten month all possibl of deliver from thi condit seem to be entir taken from me and i firmli believ that no human shape had ever set foot upon that place have now secur my habit as i thought fulli to my mind i had a great desir to make a more perfect discoveri of the island and to see what other product i might find which yet i knew noth of it wa the th of juli that i began to take a more particular survei of the island itself i went up the creek first where as i hint i brought my raft on shore i found after i came about two mile up that the tide did not flow ani higher and that it wa no more than a littl brook of run water and veri fresh and good but thi be the dry season there wa hardli ani water in some part of it at least not enough to run into ani stream so as it could be perceiv on the bank of thi brook i found mani pleasant savanna or meadow plain smooth and cover with grass and on the rise part of them next to the higher ground where the water as it might be suppos never overflow i found a great deal of tobacco green and grow to a great and veri strong stalk there were diver other plant which i had no notion of or understand about and might perhap have virtu of their own which i could not find out i search for the cassav root which the indian in all that climat make their bread of but i could find none i saw larg plant of alo but did not then understand them i saw sever sugarcan but wild and for want of cultiv imperfect i content myself with these discoveri for thi time and came back muse with myself what cours i might take to know the virtu and good of ani of the fruit or plant which i should discov but could bring it to no conclus for in short i had made so littl observ while i wa in the brasil that i knew littl of the plant of the field at least veri littl that might serv me to ani purpos now in my distress the next dai the th i went up the same wai again and after go someth farther than i had done the dai befor i found the brook and the savanna began to ceas and the countri becam more woodi than befor in thi part i found differ fruit and particularli i found melon upon the ground in great abund and grape upon the tree the vine had spread inde over the tree and the cluster of grape were just now in their prime veri ripe and rich thi wa a surpris discoveri and i wa exceed glad of them but i wa warn by my experi to eat sparingli of them rememb that when i wa ashor in barbari the eat of grape kill sever of our englishmen who were slave there by throw them into flux and fever but i found an excel us for these grape and that wa to cure or dry them in the sun and keep them as dri grape or raisin ar kept which i thought would be as inde thei were as wholesom and as agreeabl to eat when no grape might be had i spent all that even there and went not back to my habit which by the wai wa the first night as i might sai i had lain from home in the night i took my first contriv and got up into a tree where i slept well and the next morn proceed upon my discoveri travel near four mile as i might judg by the length of the vallei keep still due north with a ridg of hill on the south and north side of me at the end of thi march i came to an open where the countri seem to descend to the west and a littl spring of fresh water which issu out of the side of the hill by me ran the other wai that is due east and the countri appear so fresh so green so flourish everi thing be in a constant verdur or flourish of spring that it look like a plant garden i descend a littl on the side of that delici vallei survei it with a secret kind of pleasur though mix with other afflict thought to think that thi wa all my own that i wa king and lord of all thi countri indefeas and had a right of possess and if i could convei it i might have it in inherit as complet as ani lord of a manor in england i saw here abund of cocoatre orang and lemon and citrontre but all wild and few bear ani fruit at least not then howev the green lime that i gather were not onli pleasant to eat but veri wholesom and i mix their juic afterward with water which made it veri wholesom and veri cool and refresh i found now i had busi enough to gather and carri home and resolv to lai up a store as well of grape as lime and lemon to furnish myself for the wet season which i knew wa approach in order to do thi i gather a great heap of grape in on place and a lesser heap in anoth place and a great parcel of lime and lemon in anoth place and take a few of each with me i travel homeward and resolv to come again and bring a bag or sack or what i could make to carri the rest home accordingli have spent three dai in thi journei i came home so i must now call my tent and my cave but befor i got thither the grape were spoil the rich of the fruit and the weight of the juic have broken them and bruis them thei were good for littl or noth as to the lime thei were good but i could bring but a few the next dai be the th i went back have made me two small bag to bring home my harvest but i wa surpris when come to my heap of grape which were so rich and fine when i gather them i found them all spread abroad trod to piec and drag about some here some there and abund eaten and devour by thi i conclud there were some wild creatur thereabout which had done thi but what thei were i knew not howev as i found there wa no lai them up on heap and no carri them awai in a sack but that on wai thei would be destroi and the other wai thei would be crush with their own weight i took anoth cours for i gather a larg quantiti of the grape and hung them upon the out branch of the tree that thei might cure and dry in the sun and as for the lime and lemon i carri as mani back as i could well stand under when i came home from thi journei i contempl with great pleasur on the fruit of that vallei and the pleasant of the situat the secur from storm on that side of the water and the wood and conclud that i had pitch upon a place to fix my abod which wa by far the worst part of the countri upon the whole i began to consid of remov my habit and to look out for a place equal safe as where i now wa situat if possibl in that pleasant fruit part of the island thi thought ran long in my head and i wa exceed fond of it for some time the pleasant of the place tempt me but when i came to a nearer view of it and to consid that i wa now by the seasid where it wa at least possibl that someth might happen to my advantag and that the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring some other unhappi wretch to the same place and though it wa scarc probabl that ani such thing should ever happen yet to enclos myself among the hill and wood in the centr of the island wa to anticip my bondag and to render such an affair not onli improb but imposs and that therefor i ought not by ani mean to remov howev i wa so enamour with thi place that i spent much of my time there for the whole remain part of the month of juli and though upon second thought i resolv as abov not to remov yet i built me a littl kind of a bower and surround it at a distanc with a strong fenc be a doubl hedg as high as i could reach well stake and fill between with brushwood and here i lai veri secur sometim two or three night togeth alwai go over it with a ladder as befor so that i fanci now i had my countri hous and my seacoast hous and thi work took me up the begin of august i had but newli finish my fenc and began to enjoi my labour but the rain came on and made me stick close to my first habit for though i had made me a tent like the other with a piec of a sail and spread it veri well yet i had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storm nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rain were extraordinari about the begin of august as i said i had finish my bower and began to enjoi myself the d of august i found the grape i had hung up were perfectli dri and inde were excel good raisin of the sun so i began to take them down from the tree and it wa veri happi that i did so for the rain which follow would have spoil them and i had lost the best part of my winter food for i had abov two hundr larg bunch of them no sooner had i taken them all down and carri most of them home to my cave but it began to rain and from thenc which wa the th of august it rain more or less everi dai till the middl of octob and sometim so violent that i could not stir out of my cave for sever dai in thi season i wa much surpris with the increas of my famili i had been concern for the loss of on of my cat who ran awai from me or as i thought had been dead and i heard no more tale or tide of her till to my astonish she came home about the end of august with three kitten thi wa the more strang to me becaus though i had kill a wild cat as i call it with my gun yet i thought it wa a quit differ kind from our european cat yet the young cat were the same kind of hous breed like the old on and both my cat be femal i thought it veri strang but from these three cat i afterward came to be so pester with cat that i wa forc to kill them like vermin or wild beast and to drive them from my hous as much as possibl from the th of august to the th incess rain so that i could not stir and wa now veri care not to be much wet in thi confin i began to be straiten for food but ventur out twice i on dai kill a goat and the last dai which wa the th found a veri larg tortois which wa a treat to me and my food wa regul thu i at a bunch of raisin for my breakfast a piec of the goat flesh or of the turtl for my dinner broil for to my great misfortun i had no vessel to boil or stew ani thing and two or three of the turtl egg for supper dure thi confin in my cover by the rain i work daili two or three hour at enlarg my cave and by degre work it on toward on side till i came to the outsid of the hill and made a door or wai out which came beyond my fenc or wall and so i came in and out thi wai but i wa not perfectli easi at ly so open for as i had manag myself befor i wa in a perfect enclosur wherea now i thought i lai expos and yet i could not perceiv that there wa ani live thing to fear the biggest creatur that i had seen upon the island be a goat septemb the th i wa now come to the unhappi anniversari of my land i cast up the notch on my post and found i had been on shore three hundr and sixtyf dai i kept thi dai as a solemn fast set it apart to a religi exercis prostrat myself to the ground with the most seriou humili confess myself to god acknowledg hi righteou judgment upon me and prai to him to have merci on me through jesu christ and have not tast the least refresh for twelv hour even till the go down of the sun i then at a biscuitcak and a bunch of grape and went to bed finish the dai as i began it i had all thi time observ no sabbathdai for as at first i had no sens of religion upon my mind i had after some time omit to distinguish the week by make a longer notch than ordinari for the sabbathdai and so did not realli know what ani of the dai were but now have cast up the dai as befor i found i had been there a year so i divid it into week and set apart everi seventh dai for a sabbath though i found at the end of my account i had lost a dai or two of my reckon a littl after thi my ink began to fail me and so i content myself to us it more sparingli and to write down onli the most remark event of my life without continu a daili memorandum of other thing the raini season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me and i learnt to divid them so as to provid for them accordingli but i bought all my experi befor i had it and thi i am go to relat wa on of the most discourag experi that i made at all i have mention that i had save the few ear of barlei and rice which i had so surprisingli found spring up as i thought of themselv and believ there were about thirti stalk of rice and about twenti of barlei and now i thought it a proper time to sow it after the rain the sun be in it southern posit go from me accordingli i dug up a piec of ground as well as i could with my wooden spade and divid it into two part i sow my grain but as i wa sow it casual occur to my thought that i would not sow it all at first becaus i did not know when wa the proper time for it so i sow about two third of the seed leav about a hand of each it wa a great comfort to me afterward that i did so for not on grain of that i sow thi time came to ani thing for the dry month follow the earth have had no rain after the seed wa sown it had no moistur to assist it growth and never came up at all till the wet season had come again and then it grew as if it had been newli sown find my first seed did not grow which i easili imagin wa by the drought i sought for a moister piec of ground to make anoth trial in and i dug up a piec of ground near my new bower and sow the rest of my seed in februari a littl befor the vernal equinox and thi have the raini month of march and april to water it sprung up veri pleasantli and yield a veri good crop but have part of the seed left onli and not dare to sow all that i had yet i had but a small quantiti at last my whole crop not amount to abov half a peck of each kind but by thi experi i wa made master of my busi and knew exactli when the proper season wa to sow and that i might expect two seedtim and two harvest everi year while thi corn wa grow i made a littl discoveri which wa of us to me afterward as soon as the rain were over and the weather began to settl which wa about the month of novemb i made a visit up the countri to my bower where though i had not been some month yet i found all thing just as i left them the circl or doubl hedg that i had made wa not onli firm and entir but the stake which i had cut off of some tree that grew thereabout were all shot out and grown with long branch as much as a willow tree usual shoot the first year after lop it head i could not tell what tree to call it that these stake were cut from i wa surpris and yet veri well pleas to see the young tree grow and i prune them and led them up to grow as much alik as i could and it is scarc credibl how beauti a figur thei grew into in three year so that though the hedg made a circl of about twentyf yard in diamet yet the tree for such i might now call them soon cover it and it wa a complet shade suffici to lodg under all the dry season thi made me resolv to cut some more stake and make me an hedg like thi in a semicircl round my wall i mean that of my first dwell which i did and place the tree or stake in a doubl row at abov eight yard distanc from my first fenc thei grew present and were at first a fine cover to my habit and afterward serv for a defenc also as i shall observ in it order i found now that the season of the year might gener be divid not into summer and winter as in europ but into the raini season and the dry season which were gener thu half februari raini the sun be then on or near march the equinox half april half april mai dry the sun be then to the north june of the line juli half august septemb rain the sun be then come back half octob half octob novemb dry the sun be then to the south decemb of the line januari half februari the raini season sometim held longer or shorter as the wind happen to blow but thi wa the gener observ i made after i had found by experi the ill consequ of be abroad in the rain i took care to furnish myself with provis beforehand that i might not be oblig to go out and i sat within door as much as possibl dure the wet month in thi time i found much employ and veri suitabl also to the time for i found great occas of mani thing which i had no wai to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant applic particularli i tri mani wai to make myself a basket but all the twig i could get for the purpos prove so brittl that thei would do noth it prove of excel advantag to me now that when i wa a boi i us to take great delight in stand at a basketmak in the town where my father live to see them make their wickerwar and be as boi usual ar veri offici to help and a great observ of the manner how thei work those thing and sometim lent an hand i had by thi mean so full knowledg of the method of it that i want noth but the materi when it came into my mind that the twig of that tree from whenc i cut my stake that grew might possibl be as tough as the sallow and willow and osier in england and i resolv to try accordingli the next dai i went to my countryhous as i call it and cut some of the smaller twig i found them to my purpos as much as i could desir whereupon i came the next time prepar with an hatchet to cut down a quantiti which i soon found for there wa a great plenti of them these i set up to dry within my circl or hedg and when thei were fit for us i carri them to my cave and here dure the next season i emploi myself in make as well as i could a great mani basket both to carri earth or to carri or lai up ani thing as i had occas and though i did not finish them veri handsom yet i made them suffici servic for my purpos and thu afterward i took care never to be without them and as my wickerwar decai i made more especi i made strong deep basket to place my corn in instead of sack when i should come to have ani quantiti of it have master thi difficulti and emploi a world of time about it i bestir myself to see if possibl how to suppli two want i had no vessel to hold ani thing that wa liquid except two rundlet which were almost full of rum and some glass bottl some of the common size and other which were casebottl squar for the hold of water spirit c i had not so much as a pot to boil ani thing in except a great kettl which i save out of the ship and which wa too big for such us as i desir it for viz to make broth and stew a bit of meat by itself the second thing i would fain have had wa a tobaccopip but it wa imposs for me to make on howev i found a contriv for that too at last i emploi myself in plant my second row of stake of pile and in thi wickerwork all the summer or dry season when anoth busi took me up more time than it could be imagin i could spare i mention befor that i had a great mind to see the whole island and that i had travel up the brook and so on to where i built my bower and where i had an open quit to the sea on the other side of the island i now resolv to travel quit across to the sea shore on that side so take my gun and hatchet and my dog and a larger quantiti of powder and shot than usual with two biscuitcak and a great bunch of raisin in my pouch for my store i began my journei when i had pass the vale where my bower stood as abov i came within view of the sea to the west and it be a veri clear dai i fairli descri land whether an island or contin i could not tell but it lai veri high extend from the west to the wsw at a veri great distanc by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenti leagu off i could not tell what part of the world thi might be otherwis than that i knew it must be part of america and as i conclud by all my observ must be near the spanish dominion and perhap wa all inhabit by savag where if i should have land i had been in a wors condit than i wa now and therefor i acquiesc in the disposit of provid which i began now to own and to believ order everi thing for the best i sai i quiet my mind with thi and left afflict myself with fruitless wish of be there besid after some paus upon thi affair i consid that if thi land wa the spanish coast i should certainli on time or other see some vessel pass or repass on wai or other but if not then it wa the savag coast between the spanish countri and brasil which were inde the worst of savag for thei ar cannib or meneat and fail not to murder and devour all the human bodi that fall into their hand with these consider i walk veri leisur forward i found that side of the island where i now wa much pleasant than mine the open or savanna field sweet adorn with flower and grass and full of veri fine wood i saw abund of parrot and fain would i have caught on if possibl to have kept it to be tame and taught it to speak to me i did after some painstak catch a young parrot for i knock it down with a stick and have recov it i brought it home but it wa some year befor i could make him speak howev at last i taught him to call me by my name veri familiarli but the accid that follow though it be a trifl will be veri divert in it place i wa exceedingli divert with thi journei i found in the low ground hare as i thought them to be and fox but thei differ greatli from all the other kind i had met with nor could i satisfi myself to eat them though i kill sever but i had no need to be ventur for i had no want of food and of that which wa veri good too especi these three sort viz goat pigeon and turtl or tortois which ad to my grape leadenhallmarket could not have furnish a better tabl than i in proport to the compani and though my case wa deplor enough yet i had great caus for thank that i wa not driven to ani extrem for food but rather plenti even to dainti i never travel in thi journei abov two mile outright in a dai or thereabout but i look so mani turn and return to see what discoveri i could make that i came weari enough to the place where i resolv to sit down for all night and then either repos myself in a tree or surround myself with a row of stake set upright in the ground either from on tree to anoth or so as no wild creatur could come at me without wake me as soon as i came to the seashor i wa surpris to see that i had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island for here inde the shore wa cover with innumer turtl wherea on the other side i had found but three in a year and an half here wa also an infinit number of fowl of mani kind some of which i had not seen befor and mani of them veri good meat but such as i knew not the name of except those call penguin i could have shot as mani as i pleas but wa veri spare of my powder and shot and therefor had more mind to kill a shegoat if i could which i could better feed on and though there were mani goat here more than on the other side of the island yet it wa with much more difficulti that i could come near them the countri be flat and even and thei saw me much sooner than when i wa on the hill i confess thi side of the countri wa much pleasant than mine but yet i had not the least inclin to remov for as i wa fix in my habit it becam natur to me and i seem all the while i wa here to be as it were upon a journei and from home howev i travel along the shore of the sea toward the east i suppos about twelv mile and then set up a great pole upon the shore for a mark i conclud i would go home again and the next journei i took should be on the other side of the island east from my dwell and so round till i came to my post again of which in it place i took anoth wai to come back than that i went think i could easili keep all the island so much in my view that i could not miss find my first dwell by view the countri but i found myself mistaken for be come about two or three mile i found myself descend into a veri larg vallei but so surround with hill and those hill cover with wood that i could not see which wa my wai by ani direct but that of the sun nor even then unless i knew veri well the posit of the sun at that time of the dai it happen to my farther misfortun that the weather prove hazi for three or four dai while i wa in thi vallei and not be abl to see the sun i wander about veri uncomfort and at last wa oblig to find out the seasid look for my post and come back the same wai i went and then by easi journi i turn homeward the weather be exceed hot and my gun ammunit hatchet and other thing veri heavi in thi journei my dog surpris a young kid and seiz upon it and i run in to take hold of it caught it and save it aliv from the dog i had a great mind to bring it home if i could for i had often been muse whether it might not be possibl to get a kid or two and so rais a breed of tame goat which might suppli me when my powder and shot should be spent i made a collar for thi littl creatur and with a string which i made of some ropeyarn which i alwai carri about me i led him along though with some difficulti till i came to my bower and there i enclos him and left him for i wa veri impati to be at home from whenc i had been absent abov a month i cannot express what a satisfact it wa to me to come into my old hutch and lie down in my hammockb thi littl wander journei without a settl place of abod had been so unpleas to me that my own hous as i call it to myself wa a perfect settlement to me compar to that and it render everi thing about me so comfort that i resolv i would never go a great wai from it again while it should be my lot to stai on the island i repos myself here a week to rest and regal myself after my long journei dure which most of the time wa taken up in the weighti affair of make a cage for my pol who began now to be a mere domest and to be mighti well acquaint with me then i began to think of the poor kid which i had pent in within my littl circl and resolv to go and fetch it home and give it some food accordingli i went and found it where i left it for inde it could not get out but wa almost starv for want of food i went and cut bough of tree and branch of such shrub as i could find and threw it over and have fed it i ti it as i did befor to lead it awai but it wa so tame with be hungri that i had no need to have ti it for it follow me like a dog and as i continu fed it the creatur becam so love so gentl and so fond that it becam from that time on of my domest also and would never leav me afterward the raini season of the autumn equinox wa now come and i kept the th of septemb in the same solemn manner as befor be the anniversari of my land on the island have now been there two year and no more prospect of be deliv than the first dai i came there i spent the whole dai in humbl and thank acknowledg of the mani wonder merci which my solitari condit wa attend with and without which it might have been infinit more miser i gave humbl and hearti thank that god had been pleas to discov to me even that it wa possibl i might be more happi in thi solitari condit than i should have been in a liberti of societi and in all the pleasur of the world that he could fulli make up to me the defici of my solitari state and the want of human societi by hi presenc and the commun of hi grace to my soul support comfort and encourag me to depend upon hi provid here and hope for hi etern presenc hereaft it wa now that i began sensibl to feel how much more happi the life i now led wa with all it miser circumst than the wick curs abomin life i led all the past part of my dai and now have chang both my sorrow and my joi my veri desir alter my affect chang their gust and my delight were perfectli new from what thei were at first come or inde for the two year past befor as i walk about either on my hunt or for view the countri the anguish of my soul at my condit would break out upon me on a sudden and my veri heart would die within me to think of the wood the mountain the desert i wa in and how i wa a prison lock up with the etern bar and bolt of the ocean in an uninhabit wilder without redempt in the midst of the greatest composur of my mind thi would break out upon me like a storm and made me wring my hand and weep like a child sometim it would take me in the middl of my work and i would immedi sit down and sigh and look upon the ground for an hour or two togeth and thi wa still wors to me for if i could burst out into tear or vent myself by word it would go off and the grief have exhaust itself would abat but now i began to exercis myself with new thought i daili read the word of god and appli all the comfort of it to my present state on morn be veri sad i open the bibl upon these word i will never never leav thee nor forsak thee immedi it occur that these word were to me why els should thei be direct in such a manner just at the moment when i wa mourn over my condit as on forsaken of god and man well then said i if god doe not forsak me of what ill consequ can it be or what matter it though the world should all forsak me see on the other hand if i had all the world and should lose the favour and bless of god there would be no comparison in the loss from thi moment i began to conclud in my mind that it wa possibl for me to be more happi in thi forsaken solitari condit than it wa probabl i should have ever been in ani other particular state in the world and with thi thought i wa go to give thank to god for bring me to thi place i know not what it wa but someth shock my mind at that thought and i durst not speak the word how canst thou be such an hypocrit said i even audibl to pretend to be thank for a condit which howev thou mayst endeavour to be content with thou wouldst rather prai heartili to be deliv from so i stop there but though i could not sai i thank god for be there yet i sincer gave thank to god for open my ey by whatev afflict provid to see the former condit of my life and to mourn for my wicked and repent i never open the bibl or shut it but my veri soul within me bless god for direct my friend in england without ani order of mine to pack it up among my good and for assist me afterward to save it out of the wreck of the ship thu and in thi disposit of mind i began my third year and though i have not given the reader the troubl of so particular an account of my work thi year as at the first yet in gener it mai be observ that i wa veri seldom idl have regularli divid my time accord to the sever daili employ that were befor me such as first my duti to god and read the scriptur which i constantli set apart some time for thrice everi dai secondli the go abroad with my gun for food which gener took me up three hour everi morn when it did not rain thirdli the order cure preserv and cook what i had kill or catch for my suppli these took up great part of the dai also it is to be consid that in the middl of the dai when the sun wa in the zenith the violenc of the heat wa too great to stir out so that about four hour in the even wa all the time i could be suppos to work in with thi except that sometim i chang my hour of hunt and work and went to work in the morn and abroad with my gun in the afternoon to thi short time allow for labour i desir mai be ad the exceed labori of my work the mani hour which for want of tool want of help and want of skill everi thing that i did took up out of my time for exampl i wa full twoandforti dai make me a board for a long shelf which i want in my cave wherea two sawyer with their tool and sawpit would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a dai my case wa thi it wa to be a larg tree which wa to be cut down becaus my board wa to be a broad on the tree i wa three dai a cut down and two more cut off the bough and reduc it to a log or piec of timber with inexpress hack and hew i reduc both the side of it into chip till it began to be light enough to move then i turn it and made on side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to end then turn that side downward cut the other side till i brought the plank to be about three inch thick and smooth on both side ani on mai judg the labour of my hand in such a piec of work but labour and patienc carri me through that and mani other thing i onli observ thi in particular to shew the reason why so much of my time went awai with so littl work viz that what might be a littl to be done with help and tool wa a vast labour and requir a prodigi time to do alon and by hand but notwithstand thi with patienc and labour i went through mani thing and inde ever thing that my circumst made necessari for me to do as will appear by what follow i wa now in the month of novemb and decemb expect my crop of barlei and rice the ground i had manur or dug up for them wa not great for as i observ my seed of each wa not abov the quantiti of half a peck for i had lost on whole crop by sow in the dry season but now my crop promis veri well when on a sudden i found i wa in danger of lose it all again by enemi of sever sort which it wa scarc possibl to keep from it as first the goat and wild creatur which i call hare which tast the sweet of the blade lai in it night and dai as soon as it came up and at it so close that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk thi i saw no remedi for but by make an enclosur about it with a hedg which i did with a great deal of toil and the more becaus it requir a great deal of speed the creatur daili spoil my corn howev as my arabl land wa but small suit to my crop i got it total well fenc in about three week time and shoot some of the creatur in the daytim i set my dog to guard it in the night ty him up to a stake at the gate where he would stand and bark all night long so in a littl time the enemi forsook the place and the corn grew veri strong and well and began to ripen apac but as the beast ruin me befor while my corn wa in the blade so the bird were as like to ruin me now when it wa in the ear for go along by the place to see how it throve i saw my littl crop surround with fowl of i know not how mani sort which stood as it were watch till i should be gone i immedi let fly among them for i alwai had my gun with me i had no sooner shot but there aros up a littl cloud of fowl which i had not seen at all from among the corn itself thi touch me sensibl for i foresaw that in a few dai thei would devour all my hope that i should be starv and never be abl to rais a crop at all and what to do i could not tell howev i resolv not to lose my corn if possibl though i should watch it night and dai in the first place i went among it to see what damag wa alreadi done and found thei had spoil a good deal of it but that as it wa yet too green for them the loss wa not so great but the remaind wa like to be a good crop if it could be save i stai by it to load my gun and then come awai i could easili see the thiev sit upon all the tree about me as if thei onli wait till i wa gone awai and the event prove it to be so for as i walk off as if i wa gone i wa no sooner out of their sight but thei drop down on by on into the corn again i wa so provok that i could not have patienc to stai till more came on know that everi grain that thei at now wa as it might be said a peck loaf to me in the consequ but come up to the hedg i fire again and kill three of them thi wa what i wish for so i took them up and serv them as we serv notori thiev in england viz hang them in chain for a terror to other it is imposs to imagin almost that thi should have such an effect as it had for the fowl would not onli not come at the corn but in short thei forsook all that part of the island and i could never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrow hung there thi i wa veri glad of you mai be sure and about the latter end of decemb which wa our second harvest of the year i reap my corn i wa sadli put to it for a scyth or a sickl to cut it down and all i could do wa to make on as well as i could out of on of the broadsword or cutlass which i save among the arm out of the ship howev as my crop wa but small i had no great difficulti to cut it down in short i reap it my wai for i cut noth off but the ear and carri it awai in a great basket which i had made and so rub it out with my hand and at the end of all my harvest i found that out of my halfpeck of seed i had near two bushel of rice and abov two bushel and a half of barlei that is to sai by my guess for i had no measur at that time howev thi wa a great encourag to me and i foresaw that in time it would pleas god to suppli me with bread and yet here i wa perplex again for i neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn or inde how to clean it and part it nor if made into meal how to make bread of it and if how to make it yet i knew not how to bake it these thing be ad to my desir of have a good quantiti for store and to secur a constant suppli i resolv not to tast ani of thi crop but to preserv it all for seed against the next season and in the meantim to emploi all my studi and hour of work to accomplish thi great work of provid myself with corn and bread it might be truli said that i now work for my bread it is a littl wonder and what i believ few peopl have thought much upon viz the strang multitud of littl thing necessari in the provid produc cure dress make and finish thi on articl of bread i that wa reduc to a mere state of natur found thi to be my daili discourag and wa made more and more sensibl of it everi hour even after i got the first hand of seed corn which as i have said came up unexpectedli and inde to a surpris first i had no plough to turn the earth no spade or shovel to dig it well thi i conquer by make a wooden spade as i observ befor but thi did my work but in a wooden manner and though it cost me a great mani dai to make it yet for want of iron it not onli wore out the sooner but made my work the harder and made it be perform much wors howev thi i bore with too and wa content to work it out with patienc and bear with the bad of the perform when the corn wa sow i had no harrow but wa forc to go over it myself and drag a great heavi bough of a tree over it to scratch the earth as it mai be call rather than rake or harrow it when it wa grow or grown i have observ alreadi how mani thing i want to fenc it secur it mow or reap it cure or carri it home thresh part it from the chaff and save it then i want a mill to grind it siev to dress it yeast and salt to make it into bread and an oven to bake it in and all these thing i did without as shall be observ and yet the corn wa an inestim comfort and advantag to me too but all thi as i said made everi thing labori and tediou to me but that there wa no help for neither wa my time so much loss to me becaus i had divid it a certain part of it wa everi dai appoint to these work and as i resolv to us none of the corn for bread till i had a greater quantiti by me i had the next six month to appli myself wholli by labour and invent to furnish myself with utensil proper for the perform all the oper necessari for the make the corn when i had it fit for my us but first i wa to prepar more land for i had now seed enough to sow abov an acr of ground befor i did thi i had a week work at least to make me a spade which when it wa done wa a veri sorri on inde and veri heavi and requir doubl labour to work with it howev i went through that and sow my seed in two larg flat piec of ground as near my hous as i could find them to my mind and fenc them in with a good hedg the stake of which were all cut off that wood which i had set befor which i knew would grow so that in on year time i knew i should have a quick or live hedg that would want but littl repair thi work wa not so littl as to take me up less than three month becaus great part of that time wa in the wet season when i could not go abroad withindoor that is when it rain and i could not go out i found employ on the follow occas alwai observ that all the while i wa at work i divert myself with talk to my parrot and teach him to speak and i quickli learnt him to know hi own name at last to speak it out pretti loud pol which wa the first word i ever heard spoken in the island by ani mouth but my own thi therefor wa not my work but an assist to my work for now as i said i had a great employ upon my hand as follow viz i had long studi by some mean or other to make myself some earthen vessel which inde i want sore but knew not where to come at them howev consid the heat of the climat i did not doubt but if i could find out ani such clai i might botch up some such pot as might be dri by the sun be hard enough and strong enough to bear handl and to hold ani thing that wa dry and requir to be kept so and as thi wa necessari in prepar corn meal c which wa the thing i wa upon i resolv to make some as larg as i could and fit onli to stand like jar to hold what should be put into them it would make the reader piti me or rather laugh at me to tell how mani awkward wai i look to rais thi past what odd misshapen ugli thing i made how mani of them fell in and how mani fell out the clai not be stiff enough to bear it own weight how mani crack by the overviol heat of the sun be set out too hastili and how mani fell to piec with onli remov as well befor as after thei were dri and in a word how after have labour hard to find the clai to dig it to temper it to bring it home and work it i could not make abov two larg earthen ugli thing i cannot call them jar in about two month labour howev as the sun bake these two veri dry and hard i lift them veri gentli up and set them down again in two great wickerbasket which i had made on purpos for them that thei might not break and as between the pot and the basket there wa a littl room to spare i stuf it full of the rice and barleystraw and these two pot be to stand alwai dry i thought would hold my dry corn and perhap the meal when the corn wa bruis though i miscarri so much in my design for larg pot yet i made sever smaller thing with better success such as littl round pot flat dish pitcher and pipkin and ani thing my hand turn to and the heat of the sun bake them strang hard but all thi would not answer my end which wa to get an earthen pot to hold what wa liquid and bear the fire which none of these could do it happen after some time make a pretti larg fire for cook my meat when i went to put it out after i had done with it i found a broken piec of on of my earthenwar vessel in the fire burnt as hard as a stone and red as a tile i wa agreeabl surpris to see it and said to myself that certainli thei might be made to burn whole if thei would burn broken thi set me to studi how to order my fire so as to make it burn me some pot i had no notion of a kiln such as the potter burn in or of glaze them with lead though i had some lead to do it with but i place three larg pipkin and two or three pot in a pile on upon anoth and place my firewood all round it with a great heap of ember under them i pile the fire with fresh fuel round the outsid and upon the top till i saw the pot in the insid redhot quit through and observ that thei did not crack at all when i saw them clear red i let them stand in that heat about five or six hour till i found on of them though it did not crack did melt or run for the sand which wa mix with the clai melt by the violenc of the heat and would have run into glass if i had gone on so i slack my fire gradual till the pot began to abat of the red colour and watch them all night that i might not let the fire abat too fast in the morn i had three veri good i will not sai handsom pipkin and two other earthen pot as hard burnt as could be desir and on of them perfectli glaze with the run of the sand after thi experi i need not sai that i want no sort of earthenwar for my us but i must need sai as to the shape of them thei were veri indiffer as ani on mai suppos when i had no wai of make them but as the children make dirtpi or as a woman would make pi that never learnt to rais past no joi at a thing of so mean a natur wa ever equal to mine when i found i had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire and i had hardli patienc to stai till thei were cold befor i set on upon the fire again with some water in it to boil me some meat which i did admir well and with a piec of a kid i made some veri good broth though i want oatmeal and sever other ingredi requisit to make it so good as i would have had it my next concern wa to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn in for as to the mill there wa no thought of arriv to that perfect of art with on pair of hand to suppli thi want i wa at a great loss for of all trade in the world i wa as perfectli unqualifi for a stonecutt as for ani whatev neither had i ani tool to go about it with i spent mani a dai to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar and could find none at all except what wa in the solid rock and which i had no wai to dig or cut out nor inde were the rock in the island of hard suffici but were all of a sandi crumbl stone which would neither bear the weight of an heavi pestl nor would break the corn without fill it with sand so after a great deal of time lost in search for a stone i gave it over and resolv to look out a great block of hard wood which i found inde much easier and get on as big as i had strength to stir i round it and form it on the outsid with my ax and hatchet and then with the help of fire and infinit labour made an hollow place in it as the indian in brasil make their cano after thi i made a great heavi pestl or beater of the wood call the ironwood and thi i prepar and laid by against i had my next crop of corn when i propos to myself to grind or rather pound my corn or meal to make my bread my next difficulti wa to make a siev or searc to dress my meal and part it from the bran and the husk without which i did not see it possibl i could have ani bread thi wa a most difficult thing so much as but to think on for to be sure i had noth like the necessari thing to make it with i mean fine thin canvass or stuff to searc the meal through and here i wa at a full stop for mani month nor did i realli know what to do linen i had none left but what wa mere rag i had goat hair but neither knew i how to weav or spin it and had i known how here were no tool to work it with all the remedi that i found for thi wa that at last i did rememb i had among the seamen cloth which were save out of the ship some neckcloth of calico or muslin and with some piec of these i made three small siev but proper enough for the work and thu i made shift for some year how i did afterward i shall shew in it place the bake part wa the next thing to be consid and how i should make bread when i came to have corn for first i had no yeast as to that part there wa no suppli the want so i did not concern myself much about it but for an oven i wa inde in great pain at length i found out an experi for that also which wa thi i made some earthen vessel veri broad but not deep that is to sai about two feet diamet and not abov nine inch deep these i burnt in the fire as i had done the other and laid them by and when i want to bake i made a great fire upon the hearth which i had pave with some squar tile of my own make and burn also but i should not call them squar when the firewood wa burnt pretti much into ember or live coal i drew them forward upon thi hearth so as to cover it all over and there i let them lie till the hearth wa veri hot then sweep awai all the ember i set down my loaf or loav and whelm down the earthen pot upon them drew the ember all round the outsid of the pot to keep in and add to the heat and thu as well as in the best oven in the world i bake my barleyloav and becam in a littl time a mere pastrycook into the bargain for i made myself sever cake of the rice and pud inde i made no pi neither had i ani thing to put into them suppos i had except the flesh either of fowl or goat it need not be wonder at if all these thing took me up most part of the third year of my abod here for it is to be observ that in the interv of these thing i had my new harvest and husbandri to manag for i reap my corn in it season and carri it home as well as i could and laid it up in the ear in my larg basket till i had time to rub it out for i had no floor to thresh it on or instrument to thresh it with and now inde my stock of corn increas i realli want to build my barn bigger i want a place to lai it up in for the increas of the corn now yield me so much that i had of the barlei about twenti bushel and of the rice as much or more insomuch that i now resolv to begin to us it freeli for my bread had been quit gone a great while also i resolv to see what quantiti would be suffici for me a whole year and to sow but onc a year upon the whole i found that the forti bushel of barlei and rice were much more than i could consum in a year so i resolv to sow just the same quantiti everi year that i sow the last in hope that such a quantiti would fulli provid me with bread c all the while these thing were do you mai be sure my thought ran mani time upon the prospect of land which i had seen from the other side of the island and i wa not without secret wish that i wa on shore there fanci that see the main land and an inhabit countri i might find some wai or other to convei myself farther and perhap at last find some mean of escap but all thi while i made no allow for the danger of such a condit and how i might fall into the hand of savag and perhap such as i might have reason to think far wors than the lion and tiger of africa that if i onc came into their power i should run an hazard more than a thousand to on of be kill and perhap of be eaten for i had heard that the peopl of the caribean coast were cannib or meneat and i knew by the latitud that i could not be far off from that shore that suppos thei were not cannib yet thei might kill me as mani european who had fallen into their hand had been serv even when thei had been ten or twenti togeth much more i that wa but on and could make littl or no defenc all these thing i sai which i ought to have consid well of and i did cast up in my thought afterward yet took none of my apprehens at first and my head ran mightili upon the thought of get over to that shore now i wish for my boi xuri and the longboat with the shoulder of mutton sail with which i sail abov a thousand mile on the coast of africa but thi wa in vain then i thought i would go and look on our ship boat which as i have said wa blown up upon the shore a great wai in the storm when we were first cast awai she lai almost where she did at first but not quit and wa turn by the forc of the wave and the wind almost bottom upward against the high ridg of a beachi rough sand but no water about her as befor if i had had hand to have refit her and have launch her into the water the boat would have done well enough and i might have gone back into the brasil with her easi enough but i might have easili foreseen that i could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom than i could remov the island howev i went to the wood and cut lever and roller and brought them to the boat resolv to try what i could do suggest to myself that if i could but turn her down i might easili repair the damag she had receiv and she would be a veri good boat and i might go to sea in her veri easili i spare no pain inde in thi piec of fruitless toil and spent i think three or four week about it at last find it imposs to heav it up with my littl strength i fell to dig awai the sand to undermin it and so to make it fall down set piec of wood to thrust and guid it right in the fall but when i had done thi i wa unabl to stir it up again or to get under it much less to move it forward toward the water so i wa forc to give it over and yet though i gave over the hope of the boat my desir to ventur over for the main increas rather than decreas as the mean for it seem imposs thi at length set me upon think whether it wa not possibl to make myself a cano or periagua such as the nativ of those climat make even without tool or as i might sai without hand viz of the trunk of a great tree thi i not onli thought possibl but easi and pleas myself extrem with my thought of make it and with my have much more conveni for it than ani of the negro or indian but not at all consid the particular inconveni which i lai under more than the indian did viz want of hand to move it into the water when it wa made a difficulti much harder for me to surmount than all the consequ of want of tool could be to them for what wa it to me that when i had chosen a vast tree in the wood i might with great troubl cut it down if after i might be abl with my tool to hew and dub the outsid into a proper shape of a boat and burn or cut out the insid to make it hollow so to make a boat of it if after all thi i must leav it just there where i found it and wa not abl to launch it into the water on would have thought i could not have had the least reflect upon my mind of thi circumst while i wa make thi boat but i should have immedi thought how i should get it into the sea but my thought were so intent upon my voyag over the sea in it that i never onc consid how i should get it off the land and it wa realli in it own natur more easi for me to guid it over fortyf mile of sea than about fortyf fathom of land where it lai to set it afloat in the water i went to work upon thi boat the most like a fool that ever man did who had ani of hi sens awak i pleas myself with the design without determin whether i wa ever abl to undertak it not but that the difficulti of launch my boat came often into my head but i put a stop to my own inquiri into it by thi foolish answer which i gave myself let me first make it ill warrant ill find some wai or other to get it along when it is done thi wa a most preposter method but the eager of my fanci prevail and to work i went and fell a cedartre i question much whether solomon ever had such an on for the build the templ at jerusalem it wa five feet ten inch diamet at the lower part next the stump and four feet eleven inch diamet at the end of twentytwo feet after which it lessen for a while and then part into branch it wa not without infinit labour that i fell thi tree i wa twenti dai hack and hew at it at the bottom i wa fourteen more get the branch and limb and the vast spread head of it cut off which i hack and hew through with my ax and hatchet with inexpress labour after thi it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proport and to someth like the bottom of a boat that it might swim upright as it ought to do it cost me near three month more to clear the insid and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it thi i did inde without fire by mere mallet and chissel and by the dint of hard labour till i had brought it to be a veri handsom periagua and big enough to have carri sixandtwenti men and consequ big enough to have carri me and all my cargo when i had gone through thi work i wa extrem delight with it the boat wa realli much bigger than i ever saw a cano or periagua that wa made of on tree in my life mani a weari stroke it had cost you mai be sure for there remain noth but to get it into the water and had i gotten it into the water i make no question but i should have begun the maddest voyag and the most unlik to be perform that ever wa undertaken but all my devic to get it into the water fail me though thei cost infinit labour too it lai about on hundr yard from the water and not more but the first inconveni wa it wa up hill toward the creek well to take awai thi discourag i resolv to dig into the surfac of the earth and so make a decliv thi i began and it cost me a prodigi deal of pain but who grudg pain that have their deliver in view but when thi wa work through and thi difficulti manag it wa still much at on for i could no more stir the cano than i could the other boat then i measur the distanc of ground and resolv to cut a dock or canal to bring the water up to the cano see i could not bring the cano down to the water well i began thi work and when i began to enter into it and calcul how deep it wa to be dug how broad how the stuff to be thrown out i found that by the number of hand i had be none but my own it must have been ten or twelv year befor i should have gone through with it for the shore lai high so that at the upper end it must have been at least twenti feet deep so at length though with great reluct i gave thi attempt over also thi griev me heartili and now i saw though too late the folli of begin a work befor we count the cost and befor we judg lightli of our own strength to go through with it in the middl of thi work i finish my fourth year in thi place and kept my anniversari with the same devot and with as much comfort as ever befor for by a constant studi and seriou applic of the word of god and by the assist of hi grace i gain a differ knowledg from what i had befor i entertain differ notion of thing i look now upon the world as a thing remot which i had noth to do with no expect from and inde no desir about in a word i had noth inde to do with it nor wa ever like to have so i thought it look as we mai perhap look upon it hereaft viz as a place i had live in but wa come out of it and well i might sai as father abraham to dive between me and thee there is a great gulf fix in the first place i wa remov from all the wicked of the world here i had neither the lust of the flesh the lust of the ey or the pride of life i had noth to covet for i had all i wa now capabl of enjoi i wa lord of the whole manor or if i pleas i might call myself king or emperor over the whole countri which i had possess of there were no rival i had no competitor none to disput sovereignti or command with me i might have rais shipload of corn but i had no us for it so i let as littl grow as i thought enough for my occas i had tortois or turtl enough but now and then on wa as much as i could put to ani us i had timber enough to have built a fleet of ship i had grape enough to have made wine or to have cure into raisin to have load that fleet when thei had been built but all i could make us of wa all that wa valuabl i had enough to eat and to suppli my want and what wa all the rest to me if i kill more flesh than i could eat the dog must eat it or the vermin if i sow more corn than i could eat it must be spoil the tree that i cut down were ly to rot on the ground i could make no more us of them than for fuel and that i had no occas for but to dress my food in a word the natur and experi of thing dictat to me upon just reflect that all the good thing of thi world ar no farther good to us than as thei ar for our us and that whatev we mai heap up inde to give to other we enjoi as much as we can us and no more the most covet gripe miser in the world would have been cure of the vice of covet if he had been in my case for i possess infinit more than i knew what to do with i had no room for desir except it wa of thing which i had not and thei were but trifl though inde of great us to me i had as i hint befor a parcel of monei as well gold as silver about thirtysix pound sterl ala there the nasti sorri useless stuff lai i had no manner of busi for it and i often thought with myself that i would have given an hand of it for a gross of tobaccopip or for an handmil to grind my corn nai i would have given it all for sixpennyworth of turnip and carrot seed out of england or for an hand of pea and bean and a bottl of ink as it wa i had not the least advantag by it or benefit from it but there it lai in a drawer and grew mouldi with the damp of the cave in the wet season and if i had had the drawer full of diamond it had been the same case and thei had been of no manner of valu to me becaus of no us i had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it wa at first and much easier to my mind as well as to my bodi i frequent sat down to my meat with thank and admir the hand of god provid which had thu spread my tabl in the wilder i learnt to look more upon the bright side of my condit and less upon the dark side and to consid what i enjoi rather than what i want and thi gave me sometim such secret comfort that i cannot express them and which i take notic of here to put those discont peopl in mind of it who cannot enjoi comfort what god hath given them becaus thei see and covet someth that he ha not given them all our discont about what we want appear to me to spring from the want of thank for what we have anoth reflect wa of great us to me and doubtless would be so to ani on that should fall into such distress as mine wa and thi wa to compar my present condit with what i at first expect it should be nai with what it would certainli have been if the good provid of god had not wonderfulli order the ship to be cast up near to the shore where i not onli could come at her but could bring what i got out of her to the shore for my relief and comfort without which i had want tool to work weapon for defenc or gunpowd and shot for get my food i spent whole hour i mai sai whole dai in repres to myself in the most live colour how i must have act if i had got noth out of the ship how i could not have so much as got ani food except fish and turtl and that as it wa long befor i found ani of them i must have perish first that i should have live if i had not perish like a mere savag that if i had kill a goat or a fowl by ani contriv i had no wai to flai or open them or part the flesh from the skin and the bowel or to cut it up but must gnaw it with my teeth and pull it with my claw like a beast these reflect made me veri sensibl of the good of provid to me and veri thank for my present condit with all it hardship and misfortun and thi part also i cannot but recommend to the reflect of those who ar apt in their miseri to sai is ani afflict like mine let them consid how much wors the case of some peopl ar and what their case might have been if provid had thought fit i had anoth reflect which assist me also to comfort my mind with hope and thi wa compar my present condit with what i had deserv and had therefor reason to expect from the hand of provid i had live a dread life perfectli destitut of the knowledg and fear of god i had been well instruct by father and mother neither had thei been want to me in their earli endeavour to infus a religi aw of god into my mind a sens of my duti and of what the natur and end of my be requir of me but ala fall earli into the seafar life which of all the live is the most destitut of the fear of god though hi terror ar alwai befor them i sai fall earli into the seafar life and into seafar compani all that littl sens of religion which i had entertain wa laugh out of me by my messmat by an harden despis of danger and the view of death which grew habitu to me by my long absenc from all manner of opportun to convers with ani thing but what wa like myself or to hear ani thing of what wa good or tend toward it so void wa i of everi thing that wa good or of the least sens of what i wa or wa to be that in the greatest deliver i enjoi such as my escap from salle my be taken up by the portugues master of the ship my be plant so well in brasil my receiv the cargo from england and the like i never onc had the word thank god so much as on my mind or in my mouth nor in the greatest distress had i so much thought as to prai to him nor so much as to sai lord have merci upon me no not to mention the name of god unless it wa to swear by and blasphem it i had terribl reflect upon my mind for mani month as i have alreadi observ on the account of my wick and harden life past and when i look about me and consid what particular provid had attend me sinc my come into thi place and how god had dealt bountifulli with me had not onli punish me less than my iniqu deserv but had so plentifulli provid for me thi gave me great hope that my repent wa accept and that god had yet merci in store for me with these reflect i work my mind up not onli to resign to the will of god in the present disposit of my circumst but even to a sincer thank of my condit and that i who wa yet a live man ought not to complain see i had not the due punish of my sin that i enjoi so mani merci which i had no reason to have expect in that place that i ought never more to repin at my condit but to rejoic and to give daili thank for that daili bread which noth but a cloud of wonder could have brought that i ought to consid i had been fed even by a miracl even as great as that of feed elijah by raven nai by a long seri of miracl and that i could hardli have name a place in the uninhabit part of the world where i could have been cast more to my advantag a place where as i had no societi which wa my afflict on on hand so i found no raven beast no furiou wolv or tiger to threaten my life no venom creatur or poison which i might have fed on to my hurt no savag to murder and devour me in a word as my life wa a life of sorrow on wai so it wa a life of merci anoth and i want noth to make it a life of comfort but to be abl to make my sens of god good to me and care over me in thi condit be my daili consol and after i made a just improv of these thing i went awai and wa no more sad i had now been here so long that mani thing which i brought on shore for my help were either quit gone or veri much wast and near spent my ink as i observ had been gone for some time all but a veri littl which i ek out with water a littl and a littl till it wa so pale it scarc left ani appear of black upon the paper as long as it last i made us of it to minut down the dai of the month on which ani remark thing happen to me and first by cast up time past i rememb that there wa a strang concurr of dai in the variou provid which befel me and which if i had been superstiti inclin to observ dai as fatal or fortun i might have had reason to have look upon with a great deal of curios first i had observ that the same dai that i broke awai from my father and my friend and ran awai to hull in order to go to sea the same dai afterward i wa taken by the salle man of war and made a slave the same dai of the year that i escap out of the wreck of the ship in yarmouth road that same dai of the year afterward i made my escap from salle in the boat the same dai of the year i wa born on viz the th of septemb the same dai i had my life so miracul save twentysix year after when i wa cast on shore in thi island so that my wick life and solitari life both began on a dai the next thing to my ink be wast wa that of my bread i mean the biscuit which i brought out of the ship thi i had husband to the last degre allow myself but on cake of bread a dai for abov a year and yet i wa quit without bread for a year befor i got ani corn of my own and great reason i had to be thank that i had ani at all the get it be as ha been alreadi observ next to miracul my cloth too began to decai mightili as to linen i had none a good while except some chequer shirt which i found in the chest of the other seamen and which i carefulli preserv becaus mani time i could bear no other cloth on but a shirt and it wa a veri great help to me that i had among all the men cloth of the ship almost three dozen of shirt there were also sever thick watchcoat of the seamen which were left behind but thei were too hot to wear and though it is true that the weather wa so violent hot that there wa no need of cloth yet i could not go quit nake no though i had been inclin to it which i wa not nor could i abid the thought of it though i wa all alon on reason why i could not go quit nake wa i could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quit nake as with some cloth on nai the veri heat frequent blister my skin wherea with a shirt on the air itself made some motion and whistl under the shirt wa twofold cooler than without it no more could i ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat the heat of the sun beat with such violenc as it doe in that place would give me the headach present by dart so directli on my head without a cap or hat on so that i could not bear it wherea if i put on my hat it would present go awai upon these view i began to consid about put the few rag i had which i call cloth into some order i had worn out all the waistcoat i had and my busi wa now to try if i could not make jacket out of the great watchcoat which i had by me and with such other materi as i had so i set to work atailor or rather inde abotch for i made most piteou work of it howev i made shift to make two or three waistcoat which i hope would serv me a great while as for breech or drawer i made but veri sorri shift inde till afterward i have mention that i save the skin of all the creatur that i kill i mean fourfoot on and i had hung them up stretch out with stick in the sun by which mean some of them were so dry and hard that thei were fit for littl but other it seem were veri us the first thing i made of these wa a great cap for my head with the hair on the outsid to shoot off the rain and thi i perform so well that after thi i made a suit of cloth wholli of those skin that is to sai a waistcoat and breech open at the knee and both loos for thei were rather want to keep me cool than to keep me warm i must not omit to acknowledg that thei were wretchedli made for if i wa a bad carpent i wa a wors tailor howev thei were such as i made a veri good shift with and when i wa abroad if it happen to rain the hair of the waistcoat and cap be outmost i wa kept veri dry after thi i spent a deal of time and pain to make me an umbrella i wa inde in great want of on and had a great mind to make on i had seen them made in the brasil where thei ar veri us in the great heat which ar there and i felt the heat everi jot as great here and greater too be nearer the equinox besid as i wa oblig to be much abroad it wa a most us thing to me as well for the rain as the heat i took a world of pain at it and wa a great while befor i could make ani thing like to hold nai after i thought i had hit the wai i spoil two or three befor i made on to my mind but at last i made on that answer indiffer well the main difficulti i found wa to make it to let down i could make it to spread but if it did not let down too and draw in it would not be portabl for me ani wai but just over my head which would not do howev at last as i said i made on to answer i cover it with skin the hair upward so that it cast off the rain like a penthous and kept off the sun so effectu that i could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantag than i could befor in the coolest and when i had no need of it i could close it and carri it under my arm thu i live mighti comfort my mind be entir compos by resign to the will of god and throw myself wholli upon the dispos of hi provid thi made my life better than sociabl for when i began to regret the want of convers i would ask myself whether thu convers mutual with my own thought and as i hope i mai sai with even my maker by ejacul and petit wa not better than the utmost enjoy of human societi in the world i cannot sai that after thi for five year ani extraordinari thing happen to me but i live on in the same cours in the same postur and place just as befor the chief thing i wa emploi in besid my yearli labour of plant my barlei and rice and cure my raisin of both which i alwai kept up just enough to have suffici stock of the year provis beforehand i sai besid thi yearli labour and my daili labour of go out with my gun i had on labour to make me a cano which at last i finish so that by dig a canal to it six feet wide and four feet deep i brought it into the creek almost half a mile as for the first that wa so vastli big as i made it without consid beforehand as i ought to do how i should be abl to launch it so never be abl to bring it to the water or bring the water to it i wa oblig to let it lie where it wa as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time inde the next time though i could not get a tree proper for it and wa in a place where i could not get the water to it at ani less distanc than as i have said of near half a mile yet as i saw it wa practic at last i never gave it over and though i wa near two year about it yet i never grudg my labour in hope of have a boat to go off to sea at last howev though my littl periagua wa finish yet the size of it wa not at all answer to the design which i had in view when i made the first i mean of ventur over to the terra firma where it wa abov forti mile broad accordingli the small of my boat assist to put an end to that design and now i thought no more of it but as i had a boat my next design wa to make a tour round the island for as i had been on the other side in on place cross as i have alreadi describ it over the land so the discoveri i made in that journei made me veri eager to see the other part of the coast and now i had a boat i thought of noth but sail round the island for thi purpos and that i might do everi thing with discret and consider i fit up a littl mast to my boat and made a sail to it out of some of the piec of the ship sail which lai in store and of which i had a great store by me have fit my mast and sail and tri the boat i found she would sail veri well then i made littl locker and box at each end of my boat to put provis necessari and ammunit c into to be kept dry either from rain or the sprai of the sea and a littl long hollow place i cut in the insid of the boat where i could lai my gun make a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry i fix my umbrella also in a step at the stern like a mast to stand over my head and keep the heat of the sun off me like an awn and thu i everi now and then took a littl voyag upon the sea but never went far out nor far from the littl creek but at last be eager to view the circumfer of my littl kingdom i resolv upon my tour and accordingli i victual my ship for the voyag put in two dozen of my loav cake i should rather call them of barleybread an earthen pot full of parch rice a food i at a great deal of a littl bottl of rum half a goat and powder with shot for kill more and two larg watchcoat of those which as i mention befor i had save out of the seamen chest these i took on to lie upon and the other to cover me in the night it wa the th of novemb in the sixth year of my reign or my captiv which you pleas that i set out on thi voyag and i found it much longer than i expect for though the island itself wa not veri larg yet when i came to the east side of it i found a great ledg of rock lie out about two leagu into the sea some abov water some under it and beyond thi a shoal of sand ly dry half a leagu more so that i wa oblig to go a great wai out to sea to doubl that point when i first discov them i wa go to give over my enterpris and come back again not know how far it might oblig me to go out to sea and abov all doubt how i should get back again so i came to an anchor for i had made me a kind of an anchor with a piec of broken grappl which i got out of the ship have secur my boat i took my gun and went on shore climb up an hill which seem to overlook that point where i saw the full extent of it and resolv to ventur in my view the sea from that hill where i stood i perceiv a strong and inde a most furiou current which ran to the east even came close to the point and i took the more notic of it becaus i saw there might be some danger that when i came into it i might be carri out to sea by the strength of it and not be abl to make the island again and inde had i not gotten first upon thi hill i believ it would have been so for there wa the same current on the other side of the island onli that it set off at a farther distanc and i saw there wa a strong eddi under the shore so i had noth to do but to get out of the first current and i should present be in an eddi i lai here howev two dai becaus the wind blow pretti fresh at es and that be just contrari to the said current made a great breach of the sea upon the point so that it wa not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach nor to go too far off becaus of the stream the third dai in the morn the wind have abat overnight the sea wa calm and i ventur but i am a warningpiec again to all rash and ignor pilot for no sooner wa i come to the point when i wa not my boat length from the shore but i found myself in a great depth of water and a current like a sluic of a mill it carri my boat along with it with such violenc that all i could do could not keep her so much as on the edg of it but i found it hurri me farther and farther out from the eddi which wa on the left hand there wa no wind stir to help me and all that i could do with my paddl signifi noth and now i began to give myself over for lost for as the current wa on both side the island i knew in a few leagu distanc thei must join again and then i wa irrecover gone nor did i see ani possibl of avoid it so that i had no prospect befor me but of perish not by the sea for that wa calm enough but of starv for hunger i had inde found a tortois on the shore as big almost as i could lift and had toss it into the boat and i had a great jar of fresh water that is to sai on of my earthen pot but what wa all thi to be driven into the vast ocean where to be sure there wa no shore no main land or island for a thousand leagu at least and now i saw how easi it wa for the provid of god to make the most miser condit that mankind could be in wors now i look back upon my desol solitari island as the most pleasant place in the world and all the happi my heart could wish for wa to be there again i stretch out my hand to it with eager wish o happi desert said i i shall never see thee more o miser creatur said i whither am i go then i reproach myself with my unthank temper and how i had repin at my solitari condit and now what would i give to be on shore there again thu we never see the true state of our condit till it is illustr to us by it contrari nor know how to valu what we enjoi but by the want of it it is scarc possibl to imagin the constern i wa now in be driven from my belov island for so it appear to me now to be into the wide ocean almost two leagu and in the utmost despair of ever recov it again howev i work hard till inde my strength wa almost exhaust and kept my boat as much to the northward that is toward the side of the current which the eddi lai on as possibl i could when about noon as the sun pass the meridian i thought i felt a littl breez of wind in my face spring up from the sse thi cheer my heart a littl and especi when in about half an hour more it blew a pretti small gentl gale by thi time i wa gotten at a fright distanc from the island and had the least cloud or hazi weather interven i had been undon anoth wai too for i had no compass on board and should never have known how to have steer toward the island if i had but onc lost sight of it but the weather continu clear i appli myself to get up my mast again and spread my sail stand awai to the north as much as possibl to get out of the current just as i had set my mast and sail and the boat began to stretch awai i saw even by the clear of the water some alter of the current wa near where the current wa so strong the water wa foul but perceiv the water clear i found the current abat and present i found to the east at about half a mile a breach of the sea upon some rock these rock i found caus the current to part again and as the main stress of it ran awai more southerli leav the rock to the northeast so the other return by the repuls of the rock and made a strong eddi which ran back again to the northwest with a veri sharp stream thei who know what it is to have a repriev brought to them upon the ladder or to be rescu from thiev just go to murder them or who have been in such like extrem mai guess what my present surpris of joi wa and how gladli i put my boat into the stream of thi eddi and the wind also freshen how gladli i spread my sail to it run cheerfulli befor the wind and with a strong tide or eddi under foot thi eddi carri me about a leagu in my wai back again directli toward the island but about two leagu more toward the northward than the current lai which carri me awai at first so that when i came near the island i found myself open to the northern shore of it that is to sai the other end of the island opposit to that which i went out from when i had made someth more than a leagu of wai by the help of thi current or eddi i found it wa spent and serv me no farther howev i found that be between the two great current viz that on the south side which had hurri me awai and that on the north which lai about two leagu on the other side i sai between these two in the west of the island i found the water at least still and run no wai and have still a breez of wind fair for me i kept on steer directli for the island though not make such fresh wai as i did befor about four oclock in the even be then within about a leagu of the island i found the point of the rock which occas thi distanc stretch out as is describ befor to the southward and cast off the current more southwardli had of cours made anoth eddi to the north and thi i found veri strong but directli set the wai my cours lai which wa due west but almost full north howev have a fresh gale i stretch across thi eddi slant northwest and in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore where it be smooth water i soon got to land when i wa on shore i fell on my knee and gave god thank for my deliver resolv to lai asid all thought of my deliver by my boat and refresh myself with such thing as i had i brought my boat close to the shore in a littl cove that i had espi under some tree and laid me down to sleep be quit spent with the labour and fatigu of the voyag i wa now at a great loss which wai to get home with my boat i had run so much hazard and knew too much the case to think of attempt it by the wai i went out and what might be at the other side i mean the west side i knew not nor had i ani mind to run ani more ventur so i onli resolv in the morn to make my wai westward along the shore and to see if there wa no creek where i might lai up my frigat in safeti so as to have her again if i want her in about three mile or thereabout coast the shore i came to a veri good inlet or bai about a mile over which narrow till it came to a veri littl rivulet or brook where i found a conveni harbour for my boat and where she lai as if she had been in a littl dock made on purpos for her here i put in and have stow my boat veri safe i went on shore to look about me and see where i wa i soon found i had but a littl pass by the place where i had been befor when i travel on foot to that shore so take noth out of my boat but my gun and my umbrella for it wa exceed hot i began my march the wai wa comfort enough after such a voyag as i had been upon and i reach my old bower in the even where i found everi thing stand as i left it for i alwai kept it in good order be as i said befor my countryhous i got over the fenc and laid me down in the shade to rest my limb for i wa veri weari and fell asleep but judg you if you can that read my stori what a surpris i must be in when i wa awak out of my sleep by a voic call me by my name sever time robin robin robin cruso poor robin cruso where ar you robin cruso where ar you where have you been i wa so dead asleep at first be fatigu with row or paddl as it is call the first part of the dai and walk the latter part that i did not awak thoroughli and doze between sleep and wake thought i dream that somebodi spoke to me but as the voic continu to repeat robin cruso robin cruso at last i began to awak more perfectli and wa at first dreadfulli fright and start up in the utmost constern but no sooner were my ey open but i saw my pol sit on the top of the hedg and immedi knew that thi wa he that spoke to me for just in such bemoan languag i had us to talk to him and teach him and he had learnt it so perfectli that he would sit upon my finger and lai hi bill close to my face and cry poor robin cruso where ar you where have you been how came you here and such thing as i had taught him howev even though i knew it wa the parrot and that inde it could be nobodi els it wa a good while befor i could compos myself first i wa amaz how the creatur got thither and then how he should just keep about the place and no where els but as i wa well satisfi it could be nobodi but honest poll i got it over and hold out my hand and call him by hi name poll the sociabl creatur came to me and sat upon my thumb as he us to do and continu talk to me poor robin cruso and how did i come here and where had i been just as if he had been overjoi to see me again and so i carri him home along with me i had now had enough of rambl to sea for some time and had enough to do for mani dai to sit still and reflect upon the danger i had been in i would have been veri glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island but i knew not how it wa practic to get it about as to the east side of the island which i had gone round i knew well enough there wa no ventur that wai my veri heart would shrink and my veri blood run chill but to think of it and as to the other side of the island i did not know how it might be there but suppos the current ran with the same forc against the shore at the east as it pass by it on the other i might run the same risk of be driven down the stream and carri by the island as i had been befor of be carri awai from it so with these thought i content my self to be without ani boat though it had been the product of so mani month labour to make it and of so mani more to get it unto the sea in thi govern of my temper i remain near a year live a veri sedat retir life as you mai well suppos and my thought be veri much compos as to my condit and fulli comfort in resign my self to the disposit of provid i thought i live realli veri happili in all thing except that of societi i improv my self in thi time in all the mechan exercis which my necess put me upon appli my self to and i believ could upon occas make a veri good carpent especi consid how few tool i had besid thi i arriv at an unexpect perfect in my earthen ware and contriv well enough to make them with a wheel which i found infinit easier and better becaus i made thing round and shapeabl which befor were filthi thing inde to look on but i think i wa never more vain of my own perform or more joy for ani thing i found out than for my be abl to make a tobaccopip and tho it wa a veri ugli clumsi thing when it wa done and onli burnt red like other earthen ware yet as it wa hard and firm and would draw the smoke i wa exceedingli comfort with it for i had been alwai us to smoke and there were pipe in the ship but i forgot them at first not know that there wa tobacco in the island and afterward when i search the ship again i could not come at ani pipe at all in my wicker ware also i improv much and made abund of necessari basket as well as my invent shew me tho not veri handsom yet thei were such as were veri handi and conveni for my lai thing up in or fetch thing home in for exampl if i kill a goat abroad i could hang it up in a tree flea it and dress it and cut it in piec and bring it home in a basket and the like by a turtl i could cut it up take out the egg and a piec or two of the flesh which wa enough for me and bring them home in a basket and leav the rest behind me also larg deep basket were my receiv for my corn which i alwai rub out as soon as it wa dry and cure and kept it in great basket i began now to perceiv my powder abat consider and thi wa a want which it wa imposs for me to suppli and i began serious to consid what i must do when i should have no more powder that is to sai how i should do to kill ani goat i had as is observ in the third year of my be here kept a young kid and bred her up tame and i wa in hope of get a hegoat but i could not by ani mean bring it to pass till my kid grew an old goat and i could never find in my heart to kill her till she dy at last of mere ag but be now in the eleventh year of my resid and as i have said my ammunit grow low i set myself to studi some art to trap and snare the goat to see whether i could not catch some of them aliv and particularli i want a shegoat great with young to thi purpos i made snare to hamper them and believ thei were more than onc taken in them but my tackl wa not good for i had no wire and alwai found them broken and my bait devour at length i resolv to try a pitfal so i dug sever larg pit in the earth in place where i had observ the goat us to feed and over these pit i place hurdl of my own make too with a great weight upon them and sever time i put ear of barlei and dry rice without set the trap and i could easili perceiv that the goat had gone in and eaten up the corn that i could see the mark of their feet at length i set three trap in on night and go the next morn i found them all stand and yet the bait eaten and gone thi wa veri discourag howev i alter my trap and not to troubl you with particular go on morn to see my trap i found in on of them a larg old hegoat and in on of the other three kid a male and two femal as to the old on i knew not what to do with him he wa so fierc i durst not go into the pit to him that is to sai to go about to bring him awai aliv which wa what i want i could have kill him but that wa not my busi nor would it answer my end so i een let him out and he ran awai as if he had been frighten out of hi wit but i did not then know what i afterward learnt that hunger would tame a lion if i had let him stai there three or four dai without food and then have carri him some water to drink and then a littl corn he would have been as tame as on of the kid for thei ar mighti sagaci tractabl creatur where thei ar well us howev for the present i let him go know no better at that time then i went to the three kid and take them on by on i ti them with string togeth and with some difficulti brought them all home it wa a good while befor thei would feed but throw them some sweet corn it tempt them and thei began to be tame and now i found that if i expect to suppli myself with goat flesh when i had no powder or shot left breed some up tame wa my onli wai when perhap i might have them about my hous like a flock of sheep but then it present occur to me that i must keep the tame from the wild or els thei would alwai run wild when thei grew up and the onli wai for thi wa to have some enclos piec of ground well fenc either with hedg or pale to keep them up so effectu that those within might not break out or those without break in thi wa a great undertak for on pair of hand yet as i saw there wa an absolut necess of do it my first piec of work wa to find out a proper piec of ground viz where there wa like to be herbag for them to eat water for them to drink and cover to keep them from the sun those who understand such enclosur will think i had veri littl contriv when i pitch upon a place veri proper for all these be a plain open piec of meadowland or savanna as our peopl call it in the western coloni which had two or three littl drill of fresh water in it and at on end wa veri woodi i sai thei will smile at my forecast when i shall tell them i began my enclos of thi piec of ground in such a manner that my hedg or pale must have been at least two mile about nor wa the mad of it so great as to the compass for if it wa ten mile about i wa like to have time enough to do it in but i did not consid that my goat would be as wild in so much compass as if thei had had the whole island and i should have so much room to chase them in that i should never catch them my hedg wa begun and carri on i believ about fifti yard when thi thought occur to me so i present stop short and for the first begin i resolv to enclos a piec of about on hundr and fifti yard in length and on hundr yard in breadth which as it would maintain as mani as i should have in ani reason time so as my flock increas i could add more ground to my enclosur thi wa act with some prudenc and i went to work with courag i wa about three month hedg in the first piec and till i had done it i tether the three kid in the best part of it and us them to feed as near me as possibl to make them familiar and veri often i would go and carri them some ear of barlei or a hand of rice and feed them out of my hand so that after my enclosur wa finish and i let them loos thei would follow me up and down bleat after me for a hand of corn thi answer my end and in about a year and a half i had a flock of about twelv goat kid and all and in two year more i had threeandforti besid sever that i took and kill for my food and after that i enclos five sever piec of ground to feed them in with littl pen to drive them into to take them as i want them and gate out of on piec of ground into anoth but thi wa not all for now i not onli had goat flesh to feed on when i pleas but milk too a thing which inde in my begin i did not so much as think of and which when it came into my thought wa realli an agreeabl surpris for now i set up my dairi and had sometim a gallon or two of milk in a dai and as natur who give suppli of food to everi creatur dictat even natur how to make us of it so i that never milk a cow much less a goat or saw butter or chees made veri readili and handili though after a great mani essai and miscarriag made me both butter and chees at last and never want it afterward how mercifulli can our great creator treat hi creatur even in those condit in which thei seem to be overwhelm in destruct how can he sweeten the bitterest provid and give us caus to prais him for dungeon and prison what a tabl wa here spread for me in a wilder where i saw noth at first but to perish for hunger it would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my littl famili sit down to dinner there wa my majesti the princ and lord of the whole island i had the live of all my subject at absolut command i could hang draw give life and liberti and take it awai and no rebel among all my subject then to see how like a king i dine too all alon attend by my servant pol as if he had been my favourit as the onli person permit to talk to me my dog which wa now grown veri old and crazi and found no speci to multipli hi kind upon sat alwai at my right hand and two cat on on on side the tabl and on on the other expect now and then a bit from my hand as a mark of special favour but these were not the two cat which i brought on shore at first for thei were both of them dead and had been inter near my habit by my own hand but on of them have multipli by i know not what kind of creatur these were two which i preserv tame wherea the rest ran wild into the wood and becam inde troublesom to me at last for thei would often come into my hous and plunder me too till at last i wa oblig to shoot them and did kill a great mani at length thei left me with thi attend and in thi plenti manner i live neither could i be said to want ani thing but societi and of that in some time after thi i wa like to have too much i wa someth impati as i had observ to have the us of my boat though veri loath to run ani more hazard and therefor sometim i sat contriv wai to get her about the island and at other time i sat myself down content enough without her but i had a strang uneasi in my mind to go down to the point of the island where as i have said in my last rambl i went up the hill to see how the shore lai and how the current set that i might see what i had to do thi inclin increas upon me everi dai and at length i resolv to travel thither by land and follow the edg of the shore i did so but had ani on in england been to meet such a man as i wa it must either have fright them or rais a great deal of laughter and as i frequent stood still to look at myself i could not but smile at the notion of my travel through yorkshir with such an equipag and in such a dress be pleas to take a sketch of my figur as follow i had a great high shapeless cap made of goat skin with a flap hang down behind as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from run into my neck noth be so hurt in these climat as the rain upon the flesh under the cloth i had a short jacket of goat skin the skirt come down to about the middl of my thigh and a pair of openkne breech of the same the breech were made of a skin of an old hegoat whose hair hung down such a length on either side that like pantaloon it reach to the middl of my leg stock and shoe i had none but i had made me a pair of someth i scarc knew what to call them like buskin to flap over my leg and lace on either side like spatterdash but of a most barbar shape as inde were all the rest of my cloth i had on a broad belt of goat skin dri which i drew togeth with two thong of the same instead of buckl and in a kind of a frog on either side of thi instead of a sword and dagger hung a littl saw and a hatchet on on on side on on the other i had anoth belt not so broad and fasten in the same manner which hung over my shoulder and at the end of it under my left arm hung two pouch both made of goat skin too in on of which hung my powder in the other my shot at my back i carri my basket on my shoulder my gun and over my head a great clumsi ugli goat skin umbrella but which after all wa the most necessari thing i had about me next to my gun as for my face the colour of it wa realli not so mulattolik as on might expect from a man not at all care of it and live within nine or ten degre of the equinox my beard i had onc suffer to grow till it wa about a quarter of a yard long but as i had both scissar and razor suffici i had cut it pretti short except what grew on my upper lip which i had trim into a larg pair of mahometan whisker such as i had seen worn by some turk whom i saw at salle for the moor did not wear such though the turk did of these mustachio or whisker i will not sai thei were long enough to hang my hat upon them but thei were of length and shape monstrou enough and such as in england would have pass for fright but all thi is by the by for as to my figur i had so few to observ me that it wa of no manner of consequ so i sai no more to that part in thi kind of figur i went my new journei and wa out five or six dai i travel first along the sea shore directli to the place where i first brought my boat to an anchor to get up upon the rock and have no boat now to take care of i went over the land a nearer wai to the same height that i wa upon befor when look forward to the point of the rock which lai out and which i wa to doubl with my boat as i said abov i wa surpris to see the sea all smooth and quiet no rippl no motion no current ani more there than in other place i wa at a strang loss to understand thi and resolv to spend some time in the observ of it to see if noth from the set of the tide had occas it but i wa present convinc how it wa viz that the tide of ebb set from the west and join with the current of water from some great river on the shore must be the occas of thi current and that accord as the wind blew more forcibl from the west or from the north thi current came near or went farther from the shore for wait thereabout till even i went up to the rock again and then the tide of the ebb be made i plainli saw the current again as befor onli that it ran farther off be near half a leagu from the shore wherea in my case it set close upon the shore and hurri me in my cano along with it which at anoth time it would not have done thi observ convinc me that i had noth to do but to observ the eb and the flow of the tide and i might veri easili bring my boat about the island again but when i began to think of put it in practic i had such a terror upon my spirit at the remembr of the danger i had been in that i could not think of it again with ani patienc but on the contrari i took up anoth resolut which wa more safe though more labori and thi wa that i would build or rather make me anoth periagua or cano and so have on for on side of the island and on for the other you ar to understand that now i had as i mai call it two plantat in the island on my littl fortif or tent with the wall about it under the rock with the cave behind me which by thi time i had enlarg into sever apart or cave on within anoth on of these which wa the driest and largest and had a door out beyond my wall or fortif that is to sai beyond where my wall join to the rock wa all fill up with larg earthen pot of which i have given an account and with fourteen or fifteen great basket which would hold five or six bushel each where i laid up my store of provis especi my corn some in the ear cut off short from the straw and the other rub out with my hand as for my wall made as befor with long stake or pile those pile grew all like tree and were by thi time grown so big and spread so veri much that there wa not the least appear to ani on view of ani habit behind them near thi dwell of mine but a littl farther within the land and upon lower ground lai my two piec of cornground which i kept duli cultiv and sow and which duli yield me their harvest in it season and whenev i had occas for more corn i had more land adjoin as fit as that besid thi i had my countryseat and i had now a toler plantat there also for first i had my littl bower as i call it which i kept in repair that is to sai i kept the hedg which circl it in constantli fit up to it usual height the ladder stand alwai in the insid i kept the tree which at first were no more than my stake but were now grown veri firm and tall i kept them alwai so cut that thei might spread and grow thick and wild and make the more agreeabl shade which thei did effectu to my mind in the middl of thi i had my tent alwai stand be a piec of a sail spread over pole set up for that purpos and which never want ani repair or renew and under thi i had made me a squab or couch with the skin of the creatur i had kill and with other soft thing and a blanket laid on them such as belong to our seabed which i had save and a great watchcoat to cover me and here whenev i had occas to be absent from my chief seat i took up my countri habit adjoin to thi i had my enclosur for my cattl that is to sai my goat and as i had taken an inconceiv deal of pain to fenc and enclos thi ground i wa so uneasi to see it kept entir lest the goat should break through that i never left off till with infinit labour i had stuck the outsid of the hedg so full of small stake and so near to on anoth that it wa rather a pale than a hedg and there wa scarc room to put a hand through between them which afterward when those stake grew as thei all did in the next raini season made the enclosur strong like a wall inde stronger than ani wall thi will testifi for me that i wa not idl and that i spare no pain to bring to pass whatev appear necessari for my comfort support for i consid the keep up a breed of tame creatur thu at my hand would be a live magazin of flesh milk butter and chees for me as long as i live in the place if it were to be forti year and that keep them in my reach depend entir upon my perfect my enclosur to such a degre that i might be sure of keep them togeth which by thi method inde i so effectu secur that when these littl stake began to grow i had plant them so veri thick i wa forc to pull some of them up again in thi place also i had my grape grow which i princip depend on for my winter store of raisin and which i never fail to preserv veri carefulli as the best and most agreeabl dainti of my whole diet and inde thei were not agreeabl onli but physic wholesom nourish and refresh to the last degre as thi wa also about half wai between my other habit and the place where i had laid up my boat i gener staid and lai here in my wai thither for i us frequent to visit my boat and i kept all thing about or belong to her in veri good order sometim i went out in her to divert myself but no more hazard voyag would i go nor scarc ever abov a stone cast or two from the shore i wa so apprehens of be hurri out of my knowledg again by the current or wind or ani other accid but now i come to a new scene of my life it happen on dai about noon go toward my boat i wa exceedingli surpris with the print of a man nake foot on the shore which wa veri plain to be seen in the sand i stood like on thunderstruck or as if i had seen an apparit i listen i look round me i could hear noth nor see ani thing i went up to a rise ground to look farther i went up the shore and down the shore but it wa all on i could see no other impress but that on i went to it again to see if there were ani more and to observ if it might not be my fanci but there wa no room for that for there wa exactli the veri print of a foot toe heel and everi part of a foot how it came thither i knew not nor could in the least imagin but after innumer flutter thought like a man perfectli confus and out of myself i came home to my mortif not feel as we sai the ground i went on but terrifi to the last degre look behind me at everi two or three step mistak everi bush and tree and fanci everi stump at a distanc to be a man nor is it possibl to describ how mani variou shape an affright imagin repres thing to me in how mani wild idea were form everi moment in my fanci and what strang unaccount whimsi came into my thought by the wai when i came to my castl for so i think i call it ever after thi i fled into it like on pursu whether i went over by the ladder as first contriv or went in at the hole in the rock which i call a door i cannot rememb for never fright hare fled to cover or fox to earth with more terror of mind than i to thi retreat i had no sleep that night the farther i wa from the occas of my fright the greater my apprehens were which is someth contrari to the natur of such thing and especi to the usual practic of all creatur in fear but i wa so embarrass with my own fright idea of the thing that i form noth but dismal imagin to myself even though i wa now a great wai off it sometim i fanci it must be the devil and reason join in with me upon thi supposit for how should ani other thing in human shape come into the place where wa the vessel that brought them what mark were there of ani other footstep and how wa it possibl a man should come there but then to think that satan should take human shape upon him in such a place where there could be no manner of occas for it but to leav the print of hi foot behind him and that even for no purpos too for he could not be sure i should see it thi wa an amaz the other wai i consid that the devil might have found out abund of other wai to have terrifi me than thi of the singl print of a foot that as i live quit on the other side of the island he would never have been so simpl to leav a mark in a place where it wa ten thousand to on whether i should ever see it or not and in the sand too which the first surg of the sea upon an high wind would have defac entir all thi seem inconsist with the thing itself and with all notion we usual entertain of the subtleti of the devil abund of such thing as these assist to argu me out of all apprehens of it be the devil and i present conclud that it must be some more danger creatur viz that it must be some of the savag of the main land overagainst me who had wander out to sea in their cano and either driven by the current or by contrari wind had made the island and had been on shore but were gone awai again to sea be as loath perhap to have staid in thi desol island as i would have been to have had them while these reflect were roll upon my mind i wa veri thank in my thought that i wa so happi as not to be thereabout at that time or that thei did not see my boat by which thei would have conclud that some inhabit had been in the place and perhap have search farther for me then terribl thought rack my imagin about their have found my boat and that there were peopl here and that if so i should certainli have them come again in greater number and devour me that if it should happen so that thei should not find me yet thei would find my enclosur destroi all my corn carri awai all my flock of tame goat and i should perish at last for mere want thu my fear banish all my religi hope all that former confid in god which wa found upon such wonder experi as i had had of hi good now vanish as if he that had fed me by miracl hitherto could not preserv by hi power the provis which he had made for me by hi good i reproach myself with my uneasi that i would not sow ani more corn on year than would just serv me till the next season as if no accid could interven to prevent my enjoi the crop that wa upon the ground and thi i thought so just a reproof that i resolv for the futur to have two or three year corn beforehand so that whatev might come i might not perish for want of bread how strang a chequerwork of provid is the life of man and by what secret differ spring ar the affect hurri about as differ circumst present todai we love what tomorrow we hate todai we seek what tomorrow we shun todai we desir what tomorrow we fear nai even trembl at the apprehens of thi wa exemplifi in me at thi time in the most live manner imagin for i whose onli afflict wa that i seem banish from human societi that i wa alon circumscrib by the boundless ocean cut off from mankind and condemn to what i call a silent life that i wa as on whom heaven thought not worthi to be number among the live or to appear among the rest of hi creatur that to have seen on of my own speci would have seem to me a rais me from death to life and the greatest bless that heaven itself next to the suprem bless of salvat could bestow i sai that i should now trembl at the veri apprehens of see a man and wa readi to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appear of a man have set hi foot on the island such is the uneven state of human life and it afford me a great mani curiou specul afterward when i had a littl recov my first surpris i consid that thi wa the station of life the infinit wise and good provid of god had determin for me that as i could not forese what the end of divin wisdom might be in all thi so i wa not to disput hi sovereignti who as i wa hi creatur had an undoubt right by creation to govern and dispos of me absolut as he thought fit and who as i wa a creatur who had offend him had likewis a judici right to condemn me to what punish he thought fit and that it wa my part to submit to bear hi indign becaus i had sin against him i then reflect that god who wa not onli righteou but omnipot as he had thought fit thu to punish and afflict me so he wa abl to deliv me that if he did not think fit to do it it wa my unquest duti to resign myself absolut and entir to hi will and on the other hand it wa my duti also to hope in him prai to him and quietli to attend the dictat and direct of hi daili provid these thought took me up mani hour dai nai i mai sai week and month and on particular effect of my cogit on thi occas i cannot omit viz on morn earli ly in my bed and fill with thought about my danger from the appear of savag i found it discompos me veri much upon which those word of the scriptur came into my thought call upon me in the dai of troubl and i will deliv thee and thou shalt glorifi me upon thi rise cheerfulli out of my bed my heart wa not onli comfort but i wa guid and encourag to prai earnestli to god for deliver when i had done prai i took up my bibl and open it to read the first word that present to me were wait on the lord and be of good cheer and he shall strengthen thy heart wait i sai on the lord it is imposs to express the comfort thi gave me and in return i thankfulli laid down the book and wa no more sad at least not on that occas in the middl of these cogit apprehens and reflect it came into my thought on dai that all thi might be a mere chimera of my own and that thi foot might be the print of my own foot when i came on shore from my boat thi cheer me up a littl too and i began to persuad myself it wa all a delus that it wa noth els but my own foot and why might not i come that wai from the boat as well as i wa go that wai to the boat again i consid also that i could by no mean tell for certain where i had trod and where i had not and that if at last thi wa onli the print of my own foot i had plai the part of those fool who strive to make stori of spectr and apparit and then ar themselv fright at them more than ani bodi els now i began to take courag and to peep abroad again for i had not stir out of my castl for three dai and night so that i began to starv for provis for i had littl or noth within door but some barleycak and water then i knew that my goat want to be milk too which usual wa my even divers and the poor creatur were in great pain and inconveni for want of it and inde it almost spoil some of them and almost dri up their milk hearten myself therefor with the belief that thi wa noth but the print of on of my own feet and so i might be truli said to start at my own shadow i began to go abroad again and went to my countryhous to milk my flock but to see with what fear i went forward how often i look behind me how i wa readi everi now and then to lai down my basket and run for my life it would have made ani on have thought i wa haunt with an evil conscienc or that i had been late most terribl fright and so inde i had howev as i went down thu two or three dai and have seen noth i began to be a littl bolder and to think there wa realli noth in it but my own imagin but i could not persuad myself fulli of thi till i should go down to the shore again and see thi print of a foot and measur it by my own and see if there wa ani similitud or fit that i might be assur it wa my own foot but when i came to the place first it appear evid to me that when i laid up my boat i could not possibl be on shore ani where thereabout secondli when i came to measur the mark with my own foot i found my foot not so larg by a great deal both these thing fill my head with new imagin and gave me the vapour again to the highest degre so that i shook with cold like on in an agu and i went home again fill with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there or in short that the island wa inhabit and i might be surpris befor i wa awar and what cours to take for my secur i knew not o what ridicul resolut men take when possess with fear it depriv them of the us of those mean which reason offer for their relief the first thing i propos to myself wa to throw down my enclosur and turn all my tame cattl wild into the wood that the enemi might not find them and then frequent the island in prospect of the same or the like booti then to the simpl thing of dig up my two corn field that thei might not find such a grain there and still to be prompt to frequent the island then to demolish my bower and tent that thei might not see ani vestig of my habit and be prompt to look farther in order to find out the person inhabit these were the subject of the first night cogit after i wa come home again while the apprehens which had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me and my head wa full of vapour as abov thu fear of danger is ten thousand time more terrifi than danger itself when appar to the ey and we find the burden of anxieti greater by much than the evil which we ar anxiou about but which wa wors than all thi i had not that relief in thi troubl from the resign i us to practis that i hope to have i look i thought like saul who complain not onli that the philistin were upon him but that god had forsaken him for i did not now take due wai to compos my mind by cry to god in my distress and rest upon hi provid as i had done befor for my defenc and deliver which if i had done i had at least been more cheerfulli support under thi new surpris and perhap carri through it with more resolut thi confus of my thought kept me wake all night but in the morn i fell asleep and have by the amus of my mind been as it were tire and my spirit exhaust i slept veri soundli and i awak much better compos than i had ever been befor and now i began to think sedat and upon the utmost debat with myself i conclud that thi island which wa so exceed pleasant fruit and no farther from the main land than as i had seen wa not so entir abandon as i might imagin that although there were no state inhabit who live on the spot yet that there might sometim come boat off from the shore who either with design or perhap never but when thei were driven by cross wind might come to thi place that i had live here fifteen year now and had not met with the leastshadow or figur of ani peopl befor and that if at ani time thei should be driven here it wa probabl thei went awai again as soon as ever thei could see thei had never thought fit to fix there upon ani occas to thi time that the most i could suggest ani danger from wa from ani such casual accident land of straggl peopl from the main who as it wa like if thei were driven hither were here against their will so thei made no stai here but went off again with all possibl speed seldom stai on night on shore lest thei should not have the help of the tide and daylight back again and that therefor i had noth to do but to consid of some safe retreat in case i should see ani savag land upon the spot now i began sore to repent that i had dug my cave so larg as to bring a door through again which door as i said came out beyond where my fortif join to the rock upon matur consid thi therefor i resolv to draw me a second fortif in the manner of a semicircl at a distanc from my wall just where i had plant a doubl row of tree about twelv year befor of which i made mention these tree have been plant so thick befor there want but a few pile to be driven between them that thei should be thicker and stronger and my wall would be soon finish so that i had now a doubl wall and my outer wall wa thicken with piec of timber old cabl and everi thing i could think of to make it strong have in it seven littl hole about as big as i might put my arm out at in the insid of thi i thicken my wall to about ten feet thick continu bring earth out of my cave and lai it at the foot of the wall and walk upon it and through the seven hole i contriv to plant the musket of which i took notic that i got seven on shore out of the ship these i sai i plant like my cannon and fit them into frame that held them like a carriag that so i could fire all the seven gun in two minut time thi wall i wa mani a weari month in finish and yet never thought myself safe till it wa done when thi wa done i stuck all the ground without my wall for a great wai everi wai as full with stake or stick of the osierlik wood which i found so apt to grow as thei could well stand insomuch that i believ i might set in near twenti thousand of them leav a pretti larg space between them and my wall that i might have room to see an enemi and thei might have no shelter from the young tree if thei attempt to approach my outer wall thu in two year time i had a thick grove and in five or six year time i had a wood befor my dwell grown so monstrou thick and strong that it wa inde perfectli impass and no man of what kind soever would ever imagin that there wa ani thing beyond it much less an habit as for the wai i propos myself to go in and out for i left no avenu it wa by set two ladder on to a part of the rock which wa low and then broke in and left room to place anoth ladder upon that so when the two ladder were taken down no man live could come down to me without mischief himself and if thei had come down thei were still on the outsid of my outer wall thu i took all the measur human prudenc could suggest for my own preserv and it will be seen at length that thei were not altogeth without just reason though i foresaw noth at that time more than my mere fear suggest while thi wa do i wa not altogeth careless of my other affair for i had a great concern upon me for my littl herd of goat thei were not onli a present suppli to me upon everi occas and began to be suffici for me without the expens of powder and shot but also abat the fatigu of my hunt after the wild on and i wa loath to lose the advantag of them and to have them all to nurs up over again to thi purpos after long consider i could think but of two wai to preserv them on wa to find anoth conveni place to dig a cave under ground and to drive them into it everi night and the other wa to enclos two or three littl bit of land remot from on anoth and as much conceal as i could where i might keep about half a dozen young goat in each place so that if ani disast happen to the flock in gener i might be abl to rais them again with littl troubl and time and thi though it would requir a great deal of time and labour i thought wa the most ration design accordingli i spent some time to find out the most retir part of the island and i pitch upon on which wa as privat inde as my heart could wish for it wa a littl damp piec of ground in the middl of the hollow and thick wood where as is observ i almost lost myself onc befor endeavour to come back that wai from the eastern part of the island here i found a clear piec of land near three acr so surround with wood that it wa almost an enclosur by natur at least it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other piec of ground i had work so hard at i immedi went to work with thi piec of ground and in less than a month time i had so fenc it round that my flock or herd call it which you pleas which were not so wild now as at first thei might be suppos to be were well enough secur in it so without ani farther delai i remov ten shegoat and two hegoat to thi piec and when there i continu to perfect the fenc till i had made it as secur as the other which howev i did at more leisur and it took me up more time by a great deal all thi labour i wa at the expens of pure from my apprehens on the account of the print of a man foot which i had seen for as yet i never saw ani human creatur come near the island and i had now live two year under these uneasi which inde made my life much less comfort than it wa befor as mai well be imagin by ani who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man and thi i must observ with grief too that the discomposur of my mind had too great impress also upon the religi part of my thought for the dread and terror of fall into the hand of savag and cannib lai so upon my spirit that i seldom found myself in a due temper for applic to my maker at least not with the sedat calm and resign of soul which i wa wont to do i rather prai to god as under great afflict and pressur of mind surround with danger and in expect everi night of be murder and devour befor the morn and i must testifi from my experi that a temper of peac thank love and affect is much more the proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposur and that under the dread of mischief impend a man is no more fit for a comfort perform of the duti of prai to god than he is for repent on a sick bed for these discomposur affect the mind as the other do the bodi and the discomposur of the mind must necessarili be as great a disabl as that of the bodi and much greater prai to god be properli an act of the mind not of the bodi but to go on after i had thu secur on part of my littl live stock i went about the whole island search for anoth privat place to make such anoth deposit when wander more to the west point of the island than i had ever done yet and look out to sea i thought i saw a boat upon the sea at a great distanc i had found a perspect glass or two in on of the seamen chest which i save out of our ship but i had it not about me and thi wa so remot that i could not tell what to make of it though i look at it till my ey were not abl to look ani longer whether it wa a boat or not i do not know but as i descend from the hill i could see no more of it so i gave it over onli i resolv to go no more without a perspect glass in my pocket when i wa come down the hill to the end of the island where inde i had never been befor i wa present convinc that the see the print of a man foot wa not such a strang thing in the island as i imagin and but that it wa a special provid that i wa cast upon the side of the island where the savag never came i should easili have known that noth wa more frequent than for the cano from the main when thei happen to be a littl too far out at sea to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour likewis as thei often met and fought in their cano the victor have taken ani prison would bring them over to thi shore where accord to their dread custom be all cannib thei would kill and eat them of which hereaft when i wa come down the hill to the shore as i said abov be the sw point of the island i wa perfectli confound and amaz nor is it possibl for me to express the horror of my mind at see the shore spread with skull hand feet and other bone of human bodi and particularli i observ a place where there had been a fire made and a circl dug in the earth like a cockpit where it is suppos the savag wretch had sat down to their inhuman feast upon the bodi of their fellowcreatur i wa so astonish with the sight of these thing that i entertain no notion of ani danger to myself from it for a long while all my apprehens were buri in the thought of such a pitch of inhuman hellish brutal and the horror of the degeneraci of human natur which though i had heard of often yet i never had so near a view of befor in short i turn awai my face from the horrid spectacl my stomach grew sick and i wa just at the point of faint when natur discharg the disord from my stomach and have vomit with an uncommon violenc i wa a littl reliev but could not bear to stai in the place a moment so i got me up the hill again with all the speed i could and walk on toward my own habit when i came a littl out of that part of the island i stood still a while as amaz and then recov myself i look up with the utmost affect of my soul and with a flood of tear in my ey gave god thank that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where i wa distinguish from such dread creatur as these and that though i had esteem my present condit veri miser had yet given me so mani comfort in it that i had still more to give thank for than to complain of and thi abov all that i had even in thi miser condit been comfort with the knowledg of himself and the hope of hi bless which wa a felic more than suffici equival to all the miseri which i had suffer or could suffer in thi frame of thank i went home to my castl and began to be much easier now as to the safeti of my circumst than ever i wa befor for i observ that these wretch never came to thi island in search of what thei could get perhap not seek not want or not expect ani thing here and have often no doubt been up in the cover woodi part of it without find ani thing to their purpos i knew i had been here now almost eighteen year and never saw the least footstep of a human creatur there befor and might be here eighteen more as entir conceal as i wa now if i did not discov myself to them which i had no manner of occas to do it be my onli busi to keep myself entir conceal where i wa unless i found a better sort of creatur than cannib to make myself known to yet i entertain such an abhorr of the savag wretch that i have been speak of and of the wretch inhuman custom of their devour and eat on anoth up that i continu pensiv and sad and kept close within my own circl for almost two year after thi when i sai my own circl i mean by it my three plantat viz my castl my countryseat which i call my bower and my enclosur in the wood nor did i look after thi for ani other us than as an enclosur for my goat for the avers which natur gave me to these hellish wretch wa such that i wa as fear of see them as of see the devil himself nor did i so much as go to look after my boat in all thi time but began rather to think of make me anoth for i could not think of ever make ani more attempt to bring the other boat round the island to me lest i should meet with some of those creatur at sea in which if i had happen to have fallen into their hand i knew what would have been my lot time howev and the satisfact i had that i wa in no danger of be discov by these peopl began to wear off my uneasi about them and i began to live just in the same compos manner as befor onli with thi differ that i us more caution and kept my ey more about me than i did befor lest i should happen to be seen by ani of them and particularli i wa more cautiou of fire my gun lest ani of them on the island should happen to hear it and it wa therefor a veri good provid to me that i had furnish myself with a tame breed of goat that i had no need to hunt ani more about the wood or shoot at them and if i did catch ani more of them after thi it wa by trap and snare as i had done befor so that for two year after thi i believ i never fire my gun onc off though i never went out without it and which wa more as i had save three pistol out of the ship i alwai carri them out with me or at least two of them stick them in my goatskin belt i likewis furbish up on of the great cutlass that i had out of the ship and made me a belt to put it in also so that i wa now a most formid fellow to look at when i went abroad if you add to the former descript of myself the particular of two pistol and a great broadsword hang at my side in a belt but without a scabbard thing go on thu as i have said for some time i seem except these caution to be reduc to my former calm sedat wai of live all these thing tend to shew me more and more how far my condit wa from be miser compar to some other nai to mani other particular of life which it might have pleas god to have made my lot it put me upon reflect how littl repin there would be among mankind at ani condit of life if peopl would rather compar their condit with those that ar wors in order to be thank than be alwai compar them with those which ar better to assist their murmur and complain as in my present condit there were not realli mani thing which i want so inde i thought that the fright i had been in about these savag wretch and the concern i had been in for my own preserv had taken off the edg of my invent for my own conveni and i had drop a good design which i had onc bent my thought upon and that wa to try if i could not make some of my barlei into malt and then try to brew myself some beer thi wa realli a whimsic thought and i reprov myself often for the simplic of it for i present saw there would be the want of sever thing necessari to the make my beer that it would be imposs for me to suppli as first cask to preserv it in which wa a thing that as i have observ alreadi i could never compass no though i spent not mani dai but week nai month in attempt it but to no purpos in the next place i had no hop to make it keep no yeast to make it work no copper or kettl to make it boil and yet had not all these thing interven i mean the fright and terror i wa in about the savag i had undertaken it and perhap brought it to pass too for i seldom gave ani thing over without accomplish it when i onc had it in my head enough to begin it but my invent now ran quit anoth wai for night and dai i could think of noth but how i might destroi some of these monster in their cruel bloodi entertain and if possibl save the victim thei should bring hither to destroi it would take up a larger volum than thi whole work is intend to be to set down all the contriv i hatch or rather brood upon in my thought for the destroi these creatur or at least frighten them so as to prevent their come hither ani more but all wa abort noth could be possibl to take effect unless i wa to be there to do it myself and what could on man do among them when perhap there might be twenti or thirti of them togeth with their dart or their bow and arrow with which thei could shoot as true to a mark as i could with my gun sometim i contriv to dig a hole under the place where thei made their fire and put in five or six pound of gunpowd which when thei kindl their fire would consequ take fire and blow up all that wa near it but as in the first place i should be veri loath to wast so much powder upon them my store be now within the quantiti of a barrel so neither could i be sure of it go off at ani certain time when it might surpris them and at best that it would do littl more than just blow the fire about their ear and fright them but not suffici to make them forsak the place so i laid it asid and then propos that i would place myself in ambush in some conveni place with my three gun all doubleload and in the middl of their bloodi ceremoni let fly at them when i should be sure to kill or wound perhap two or three at everi shoot and then fall in upon them with my three pistol and my sword i made no doubt but that if there were twenti i should kill them all thi fanci pleas my thought for some week and i wa so full of it that i often dream of it and sometim that i wa just go to let fly at them in my sleep i went so far with it in my indign that i emploi myself sever dai to find out proper place to put myself in ambuscad as i said to watch for them and i went frequent to the place itself which wa now grown more familiar to me and especi while my mind wa thu fill with thought of reveng and of a bloodi put twenti or thirti of them to the sword as i mai call it but the horror i had at the place and at the signal of the barbar wretch devour on anoth abat my malic well at length i found a place in the side of the hill where i wa satisfi i might secur wait till i saw ani of the boat come and might then even befor thei would be readi to come on shore convei myself unseen into thicket of tree in on of which there wa an hollow larg enough to conceal me entir and where i might sit and observ all their bloodi do and take my full aim at their head when thei were so close togeth as that it would be next to imposs that i should miss my shoot or that i could fail wound three or four of them at the first shoot in thi place then i resolv to fix my design and accordingli i prepar two musket and my ordinari fowlingpiec the two musket i load with a brace of slug each and four or five smaller bullet about the size of pistolbullet and the fowlingpiec i load with near an hand of swanshot of the largest size i also load my pistol with about four bullet each and in thi postur well provid with ammunit for a second and third charg i prepar myself for my expedit after i had thu laid the scheme for my design and in my imagin put it in practic i continu made my tour everi morn up to the top of the hill which wa from my castl as i call it about three mile or more to see if i could observ ani boat upon the sea come near the island or stand over toward it but i began to tire of thi hard duti after i had for two or three month constantli kept my watch but came alwai back without ani discoveri there have not in all that time been the least appear not onli on or near the shore but not on the whole ocean so far as my ey or glass could reach everi wai as long as i kept up my daili tour to the hill to look out so long also i kept up the vigour of my design and my spirit seem to be all the while in a suitabl frame for so outrag an execut as the kill twenti or thirti nake savag for an offenc which i had not at all enter into a discuss of in my thought ani further than my passion were at first fire by the horror i conceiv at the unnatur custom of the peopl of that countri who it seem had been suffer by provid in hi wise disposit of the world to have no other guid than that of their own abomin and vitiat passion and consequ were left and perhap had been for some ag to act such horrid thing and receiv such dread custom as noth but natur entir abandon of heaven and actuat by some hellish degeneraci could have run them into but now when as i have said i began to be weari of the fruitless excurs which i had made so long and so far everi morn in vain so my opinion of the action itself began to alter and i began with cooler and calmer thought to consid what it wa i wa go to engag in what author or call i had to pretend to be judg and execution upon these men as crimin whom heaven had thought fit for so mani ag to suffer unpunish to go on and to be as it were the execution of hi judgment upon on anoth also how far these peopl were offend against me and what right i had to engag in the quarrel of that blood which thei shed promiscu on upon anoth i debat thi veri often with myself thu how do i know what god himself judg in thi particular case it is certain these peopl do not commit thi as a crime it is not against their own conscienc reprov or their light reproach them thei do not know it to be an offenc and then commit it in defianc of divin justic as we do in almost all the sin we commit thei think it no more a crime to kill a captiv taken in war than we do to kill an ox nor to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton when i had consid thi a littl it follow necessarili that i wa certainli in the wrong in it that these peopl were not murder in the sens that i had befor condemn them in my thought ani more than those christian were murder who often put to death the prison taken in battl or more frequent upon mani occas put whole troop of men to the sword without give quarter though thei threw down their arm and submit in the next place it occur to me that albeit the usag thei gave on anoth wa thu brutish and inhuman yet it wa realli noth to me these peopl had done me no injuri that if thei attempt me or i saw it necessari for my immedi preserv to fall upon them someth might be said for it but that i wa yet out of their power and thei had realli no knowledg of me and consequ no design upon me and therefor it could not be just for me to fall upon them that thi would justifi the conduct of the spaniard in all their barbar practis in america where thei destroi million of these peopl who howev thei were idolat and barbarian and had sever bloodi and barbar rite in these custom such as sacrif human bodi to their idol were yet as to the spaniard veri innoc peopl and that the root them out of the countri is spoken of with the utmost abhorr and detest even by the spaniard themselv at thi time and by all other christian nation of europ as a mere butcheri a bloodi and unnatur piec of cruelti unjustifi either to god or man and such as for which the veri name of a spaniard is reckon to be fright and terribl to all peopl of human or of christian compass as if the kingdom of spain were particularli emin for the product of a race of men who were without principl of tender or the common bowel of piti to the miser which is reckon to be a mark of a gener temper in the mind these consider realli put me to a paus and to a kind of a full stop and i began by littl and littl to be off of my design and to conclud i had taken a wrong measur in my resolut to attack the savag that it wa not my busi to meddl with them unless thei first attack me and thi it wa my busi if possibl to prevent but that if i were discov and attack then i knew my duti on the other hand i argu with myself that thi realli wa the wai not to deliv myself but entir to ruin and destroi myself for unless i wa sure to kill everi on that not onli should be on shore at that time but that should ever come on shore afterward if but on of them escap to tell their countrypeopl what had happen thei would come over again by thousand to reveng the death of their fellow and i should onli bring upon myself a certain destruct which at present i had no manner of occas for upon the whole i conclud that neither in principl nor in polici i ought on wai or other to concern myself in thi affair that my busi wa by all possibl mean to conceal myself from them and not to leav the least signal to them to guess by that there were ani live creatur upon the island i mean of human shape religion join in with thi prudenti and i wa convinc now mani wai that i wa perfectli out of my duti when i wa lai all my bloodi scheme for the destruct of innoc creatur i mean innoc as to me as to the crime thei were guilti of toward on anoth i had noth to do with them thei were nation punish to make a just retribut for nation offenc and to bring public judgment upon those who offend in a public manner by such wai as best pleas god thi appear so clear to me now that noth wa a greater satisfact to me than that i had not been suffer to do a thing which i now saw so much reason to believ would have been no less a sin than that of wil murder if i had commit it and i gave most humbl thank on my knee to god that had thu deliv me from bloodguilti beseech him to grant me the protect of hi provid that i might not fall into the hand of barbarian or that i might not lai my hand upon them unless i had a more clear call from heaven to do it in defenc of my own life in thi disposit i continu for near a year after thi and so far wa i from desir an occas for fall upon these wretch that in all that time i never onc went up the hill to see whether there were ani of them in sight or to know whether ani of them had been on shore there or not that i might not be tempt to renew ani of my contriv against them or be provok by ani advantag which might present itself to fall upon them onli thi i did i went and remov my boat which i had on the other side of the island and carri it down to the east end of the whole island where i ran it into a littl cove which i found under some high rock and where i knew by reason of the current the savag durst not at least would not come with their boat upon ani account whatsoev with my boat i carri awai everi thing that i had left there belong to her though not necessari for the bare go thither viz a mast and sail which i had made for her and a thing like an anchor but inde which could not be call either anchor or grappl howev it wa the best i could make of it kind all these i remov that there might not be the least shadow of ani discoveri or ani appear of ani boat or of ani habit upon the island besid thi i kept myself as i said more retir than ever and seldom went from my cell other than upon my constant employ viz to milk my shegoat and manag my littl flock in the wood which as it wa quit on the other part of the island wa quit out of danger for certain it is that these savag peopl who sometim haunt thi island never came with ani thought of find ani thing here and consequ never wander off from the coast and i doubt not but thei might have been sever time on shore after my apprehens of them had made me cautiou as well as befor and inde i look back with some horror upon the thought of what my condit would have been if i had chop upon them and been discov befor that when nake and unarm except with on gun and that load often onli with small shot i walk everi where peep and peer about the island to see what i could get what a surpris should i have been in if when i discov the print of a man foot i had instead of that seen fifteen or twenti savag and found them pursu me and by the swift of their run no possibl of my escap them the thought of thi sometim sunk my veri soul within me and distress my mind so much that i could not soon recov it to think what i should have done and how i not onli should not have been abl to resist them but even should not have had presenc of mind enough to do what i might have done much less what now after so much consider and prepar i might be abl to do inde after seriou think of these thing i would be veri melancholi and sometim it would last a great while but i resolv it at last all into thank to that provid which had deliv me from so mani unseen danger and had kept me from those mischief which i could no wai have been the agent in deliv myself from becaus i had not the least notion of ani such thing depend or the least supposit of it be possibl thi renew a contempl which often had come to my thought in former time when first i began to see the merci disposit of heaven in the danger we run through in thi life how wonderfulli we ar deliv when we know noth of it how when we ar in a quandari as we call it a doubt or hesit whether to go thi wai or that wai a secret hint shall direct us thi wai when we intend to go anoth wai nai when sens our own inclin and perhap busi ha call to go the other wai yet a strang impress upon the mind from we know not what spring and by we know not what power shall overrul us to go thi wai and it shall afterward appear that had we gone that wai which we would have gone and even to our imagin ought to have gone we should have been ruin and lost upon these and mani like reflect i afterward made it a certain rule with me that whenev i found those secret hint or press of my mind to do or not do ani thing that present or to go thi wai or that wai i never fail to obei the secret dictat though i new no other reason for it than that such a pressur or such an hint hung upon my mind i could give mani exampl of the success of thi conduct in the cours of my life but more especi in the latter part of my inhabit thi unhappi island besid mani occas which it is veri like i might have taken notic of if i had seen with the same ey then that i saw with now but ti never too late to be wise and i cannot but advis all consid men whose live ar attend with such extraordinari incid as mine or even though not so extraordinari not to slight such secret intim of provid let them come from what invis intellig thei will that i shall not discuss and perhap cannot account for but certainli thei ar a proof of the convers of spirit and the secret commun between those embodi and those unembodi and such a proof as can never be withstood of which i shall have occas to give some veri remark instanc in the remaind of my solitari resid in thi dismal place i believ the reader of thi will not think it strang if i confess that these anxieti these constant danger i live in and the concern that wa now upon me put an end to all invent and to all the contriv that i had laid for my futur accommod and conveni i had the care of my safeti more now upon my hand than that of my food i care not to drive a nail or chop a stick of wood now for fear the nois i should make should be heard much less would i fire a gun for the same reason and abov all i wa veri uneasi at make ani fire lest the smoke which is visibl at a great distanc in the dai should betrai me and for thi reason i remov that part of my busi which requir fire such as burn of pot and pipe c into my new apart in the wood where after i had been some time i found to my unspeak consol a mere natur cave in the earth which went in a vast wai and where i dare sai no savag had he been at the mouth of it would be so hardi as to ventur in nor inde would ani man els but on who like me want noth so much as a safe retreat the mouth of thi hollow wa at the bottom of a great rock where by mere accid i would sai if i did not see an abund reason to ascrib all such thing now to provid i wa cut down some thick branch of tree to make charcoal and befor i go on i must observ the reason of my make thi charcoal which wa thu i wa afraid of make a smoke about my habit as i said befor and yet i could not live there without bake my bread cook my meat c so i contriv to burn some wood here as i had seen done in england under turf till it becam chark or dry coal and then put the fire out i preserv the coal to carri home and perform the other servic which fire wa want for at home without danger or smoke but thi by the by while i wa cut down some wood here i perceiv that behind a veri thick branch of low brushwood or underwood there wa a kind of hollow place i wa curiou to look into it and get with difficulti into the mouth of it i found it wa pretti larg that is to sai suffici for me to stand upright in it and perhap anoth with me but i must confess to you i made more hast out than i did in when look further into the place which wa perfectli dark i saw two broad shine ey of some creatur whether devil or man i knew not which twinkl like two star the dim light from the cave mouth shine directli in and make the reflect howev after some paus i recov myself and began to call myself a thousand fool and tell myself that he that wa afraid to see the devil wa not fit to live twenti year in an island all alon and that i durst to believ there wa noth in thi cave that wa more fright than myself upon thi pluck up my courag i took up a larg firebrand and in i rush again with the stick flame in my hand i had not gone three step in but i wa almost as much frighten as i wa befor for i heard a veri loud sigh like that of a man in some pain and it wa follow by a broken nois as if of word halfexpress and then a deep sigh again i step back and wa inde struck with such a surpris that it put me into a cold sweat and if i had had an hat on my head i will not answer for it that my hair might not have lift it off but still pluck up my spirit as well as i could and encourag myself a littl with consid that the power and presenc of god wa everi where and wa abl to protect me upon thi i step forward again and by the light of the firebrand hold it up a littl over my head i saw ly on the ground a most monstrou fright old hegoat just make hi will as we sai gasp for life and dy inde of a mere old ag i stir him a littl to see if i could get him out and he essai to get up but wa not abl to rais himself and i thought with myself he might even lie there for if he had frighten me so he would certainli fright ani of the savag if ani of them should be so hardi as to come in there while he had ani life in him i wa now recov from my surpris and began to look round me when i found the cave wa but veri small that is to sai it might be about twelv feet over but in no manner of shape either round or squar no hand have ever been emploi in make it but those of mere natur i observ also that there wa a place at the farther side of it that went in farther but so low that it requir me to creep upon my hand and knee to get into it and whither it went i knew not so have no candl i gave it over for some time but resolv to come again the next dai provid with candl and a tinderbox which i had made of the lock of on of the musket with some wildfir in the pan accordingli the next dai i came provid with six larg candl of my own make for i made veri good candl now of goat tallow and go into thi low place i wa oblig to creep upon all four as i have said almost ten yard which by the wai i thought wa a ventur bold enough consid that i knew not how far it might go or what wa beyond it when i wa got through the streight i found the roof rose higher up i believ near twenti feet but never wa such a gloriou sight seen in the island i dare sai as it wa to look round the side and roof of thi vault or cave the wall reflect an hundr thousand light to me from my two candl what it wa in the rock whether diamond or ani other preciou stone or gold which i rather suppos it to be i knew not the place i wa in wa a most delight caviti or grotto of it kind as could be expect though perfectli dark the floor wa dry and level and had a sort of small loos gravel upon it so that there wa no nauseou creatur to be seen neither wa there ani damp or wet on the side of the roof the onli difficulti in it wa the entranc which howev as it wa a place of secur and such a retreat as i want i thought that wa a conveni so that i wa realli rejoic at the discoveri and resolv without ani delai to bring some of those thing which i wa most anxiou about to thi place particularli i resolv to bring hither my magazin of powder and all my spare arm viz two fowlingpiec for i had three in all and three musket for of them i had eight in all so i kept at my castl onli five which stood readi mount like piec of cannon on my utmost fenc and were readi also to take out upon ani expedit upon thi occas of remov my ammunit i wa oblig to open the barrel of powder which i took up out of the sea and which had been wet and i found that the water had penetr about three or four inch into the powder on everi side which cake and grow hard had preserv the insid like a kernel in a shell so that i had near sixti pound of veri good powder in the centr of the cask and thi wa an agreeabl discoveri to me at that time so i carri all awai thither never keep abov two or three pound of powder with me in my castl for fear of a surpris of ani kind i also carri thither all the lead i had left for bullet i fanci myself now like on of the ancient giant which were said to live in cave and hole in the rock where none could come at them for i persuad myself while i wa here if five hundr savag were to hunt me thei could never find me out or if thei did thei would not ventur to attack me here the old goat which i found expir di in the mouth of the cave the next dai after i made thi discoveri and i found it much easier to dig a great hole there and throw him in and cover him with earth than to drag him out so i inter him there to prevent offenc to my nose i wa now in my twentythird year of resid in thi island and wa so natur to the place and to the manner of live that could i have but enjoi the certainti that no savag would come to the place to disturb me i could have been content to have capitul for spend the rest of my time there even to the last moment till i had laid me down and di like the old goat in the cave i had also arriv to some littl divers and amus which made the time pass more pleasantli with me a great deal than it did befor as first i had taught my pol as i note befor to speak and he did it so familiarli and talk so articul and plain that it wa veri pleasant to me and he live with me no less than sixandtwenti year how long he might live afterward i knew not though i know thei have a notion in the brasil that thei live an hundr year perhap some of my poll mai be aliv there still call after poor robin cruso to thi dai i wish no englishman the ill luck to come there and hear them but if he did he would certainli believ it wa the devil my dog wa a veri pleasant and love companion to me for no less than sixteen year of my time and then di of mere old ag as for my cat thei multipli as i have observ to that degre that i wa oblig to shoot sever of them at first to keep them from devour me and all i had but at length when the two old on i brought with me were gone and after some time continu drive them from me and let them have no provis with me thei all ran wild into the wood except two or three favourit which i kept tame and whose young when thei had ani i alwai drown and these were part of my famili besid these i alwai kept two or three household kid about me which i taught to feed out of my hand and i had also more parrot which talk pretti well and would all call robin cruso but none like my first nor inde did i take the pain with ani of them that i had done with him i had also sever tame seafowl whose name i know not which i caught upon the shore and cut their wing and the littl stake which i had plant befor my castl wall be now grown up to a good thick grove these fowl all live among these low tree and bred there which wa veri agreeabl to me so that as i said abov i began to be veri well content with the life i led if it might but have been secur from the dread of savag but it wa otherwis direct and it might not be amiss for all peopl who shall meet with my stori to make thi just observ from it viz how frequent in the cours of our live the evil which in itself we seek most to shun and which when we ar fallen into is the most dread to us is oftentim the veri mean or door of our deliver by which alon we can be rais again from the afflict we ar fallen into i could give mani exampl of thi in the cours of my unaccount life but in noth wa it more particularli remark than in the circumst of my last year of solitari resid in thi island it wa now the month of decemb as i said abov in my twentythird year and thi be the southern solstic for winter i cannot call it wa the particular time of my harvest and requir my be pretti much abroad in the field when go out pretti earli in the morn even befor it wa thorough daylight i wa surpris with see a light of some fire upon the shore at a distanc from me of about two mile toward the end of the island where i had observ some savag had been as befor but not on the other side but to my great afflict it wa on my side of the island i wa inde terribl surpris at the sight and stop short within my grove not dare to go out lest i might be surpris and yet i had no more peac within from the apprehens i had that if these savag in rambl over the island should find my corn stand or cut or ani of my work and improv thei would immedi conclud that there were peopl in the place and would then never give over till thei found me out in thi extrem i went back directli to my castl pull up the ladder after me have made all thing without look as wild and natur as i could then i prepar myself within put myself in a postur of defenc i load all my cannon as i call them that is to sai my musket which were mount upon my new fortif and all my pistol and resolv to defend myself to the last gasp not forget serious to recommend myself to the divin protect and earnestli to prai to god to deliv me out of the hand of the barbarian and in thi postur i continu about two hour but began to be mighti impati for intellig abroad for i had no spi to send out after sit awhil longer and muse what i should do in thi case i wa not abl to bear sit in ignor longer so set up my ladder to the side of the hill where there wa a flat place as i observ befor and then pull the ladder up after me i set it up again and mount to the top of the hill and pull out my perspect glass which i had taken on purpos i laid me down flat on my belli on the ground and began to look for the place i present found there were no less than nine nake savag sit round a small fire thei had made not to warm them for thei had no need of that the weather be extrem hot but as i suppos to dress some of their barbar diet of human flesh which thei had brought with them whether aliv or dead i could not know thei had two cano with them which thei had hale up upon the shore and as it wa then tide of ebb thei seem to me to wait the return of the flood to go awai again it is not easi to imagin what confus thi sight put me into especi see them come on my side the island and so near me too but when i observ their come must be alwai with the current of the ebb i began afterward to be more sedat in my mind be satisfi that i might go abroad with safeti all the time of tide of flood if thei were not on shore befor and have made thi observ i went abroad about my harvest work with the more composur as i expect so it prove for as soon as the tide made to the westward i saw them all take boat and row or paddl as we call it all awai i should have observ that for an hour and more befor thei went off thei went to danc and i could easili discern their postur and gestur by my glass i could onli perceiv by my nicest observ that thei were stark nake and had not the least cover upon them but whether thei were men or women that i could not distinguish as soon as i saw them ship and gone i took two gun upon my shoulder and two pistol at my girdl and my great sword by my side without a scabbard and with all the speed i wa abl to make i went awai to the hill where i had discov the first appear of all as soon as i got thither which wa not less than two hour for i could not go apac be so load with arm as i wa i perceiv there had been three cano more of savag on that place and look out further i saw thei were all at sea togeth make over for the main thi wa a dread sight to me especi when go down to the shore i could see the mark of horror which the dismal work thei had been about had left behind it viz the blood the bone and part of the flesh of human bodi eaten and devour by those wretch with merriment and sport i wa so fill with indign at the sight that i began now to premedit the destruct of the next that i saw there let them be who or how mani soever it seem evid to me that the visit which thei thu made to thi island were not veri frequent for it wa abov fifteen month befor ani more of them came on shore there again that is to sai i never saw them or ani footstep or signal of them in all that time for as to the raini season then thei ar sure not to come abroad at least not so far yet all thi while i live uncomfort by reason of the constant apprehens i wa in of their come upon me by surpris from whenc i observ that the expect of evil is more bitter than the suffer especi if there is no room to shake off that expect or those apprehens dure all thi time i wa in the murder humour and took up most of my hour which should have been better emploi in contriv how to circumv and fall upon them the veri next time i should see them especi if thei should be divid as thei were the last time into two parti nor did i consid at all that if i kill on parti suppos ten or a dozen i wa still the next dai or week or mouth to kill anoth and so anoth even ad infinitum till i should be at length no less a murder than thei were in be meneat and perhap much more so i spent my dai now in great perplex and anxieti of mind expect that i should on dai or other fall into the hand of those merciless creatur if i did at ani time ventur abroad it wa not without look round me with the greatest care and caution imagin and now i found to my great comfort how happi it wa that i had provid a tame flock or herd of goat for i durst not upon ani account fire my gun especi near that side of the island where thei usual came lest i should alarm the savag and if thei had fled from me now i wa sure to have them come back again with perhap two or three hundr cano with them in a few dai and then i knew what to expect howev i wore out a year and three month more befor i ever saw ani more of the savag and then i found them again as i shall soon observ it is true thei might have been there onc or twice but either thei made no stai or at least i did not hear them but in the month of mai as near as i could calcul and in my fourandtwentieth year i had a veri strang encount with them of which in it place the perturb of my mind dure thi fifteen or sixteen month interv wa veri great i slept unquiet dream alwai fright dream and often start out of my sleep in the night in the dai great troubl overwhelm my mind in the night i dream often of kill the savag and the reason why i might justifi the do of it but to wave all thi for awhil it wa in the middl of mai on the sixteenth dai i think as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon for i mark all upon the post still i sai it wa on the sixteenth of mai that it blew a great storm of wind all dai with a great deal of lightn and thunder and a veri foul night wa after it i know not what wa the particular occas of it but as i wa read in the bibl and taken up with seriou thought about my present condit i wa surpris with the nois of a gun as i thought fire at sea thi wa to be sure a surpris of a quit differ natur from ani i had met with befor for the notion thi put into my thought were quit of anoth kind i start up in the greatest hast imagin and in a trice clap up my ladder to the middl place of the rock and pull it after me and mount it the second time got to the top of the hill that veri moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a second gun which accordingli in about half a moment i heard and by the sound knew that it wa from that part of the sea where i wa driven out with the current in my boat i immedi consid that thi must be some ship in distress and that thei had some comrad or some other ship in compani and fire these gun for signal of distress and to obtain help i had thi presenc of mind at that minut as to think that though i could not help them it mai be thei might help me so i brought togeth all the dry wood i could get at hand and make a good handsom pile i set it on fire upon the hill the wood wa dry and blaze freeli and though the wind blew veri hard yet it burnt fairli out so that i wa certain if there wa ani such thing as a ship thei must need see it and no doubt thei did for as soon as ever my fire blaze up i heard anoth gun and after that sever other all from the same quarter i pli my fire all night long till dai broke and when it wa broad dai and the air clear up i saw someth at a great distanc at sea full east of the island whether a sail or an hull i could not distinguish no not with my glass the distanc wa so great and the weather still someth hazi also at least it wa so out at sea i look frequent at it all that dai and soon perceiv that it did not move so i present conclud that it wa a ship at anchor and be eager you mai be sure to be satisfi i took my gun in my hand and ran toward the southeast side of the island to the rock where i had been formerli carri awai with the current and get up there the weather by thi time be perfectli clear i could plainli see to my great sorrow the wreck of a ship cast awai in the night upon those conceal rock which i found when i wa out in my boat and which rock as thei check the violenc of the stream and made a kind of counterstream or eddi were the occas of my recov then from the most desper hopeless condit that ever i had been in all my life thu what is on man safeti is anoth man destruct for it seem these men whoever thei were be out of their knowledg and the rock be wholli under water had been driven upon them in the night the wind blow hard at e and en had thei seen the island as i must necessarili suppos thei did not thei must as i thought have endeavour to have save themselv on shore by the help of their boat but the fire of their gun for help especi when thei saw as i imagin my fire fill me with mani thought first i imagin that upon see my light thei might have put themselv into their boat and have endeavour to make the shore but that the sea go veri high thei might have been cast awai other time i imagin that thei might have lost their boat befor as might be the case mani wai as particularli by the break of the sea upon their ship which mani time oblig men to stave or take in piec their boat and sometim to throw it overboard with their own hand other time i imagin thei had some other ship or ship in compani who upon the signal of distress thei had made had taken them up and carri them off other while i fanci thei were all gone off to sea in their boat and be hurri awai by the current that i had been formerli in were carri out into the great ocean where there wa noth but miseri and perish and that perhap thei might by thi time think of starv and of be in a condit to eat on anoth all these were but conjectur at best so in the condit i wa in i could do no more than look upon the miseri of the poor men and piti them which had still thi good effect on my side that it gave me more and more caus to give thank to god who had so happili and comfort provid for me in my desol condit and that of two ship compani who were now cast awai upon thi part of the world not on life should be spare but mine i learnt here again to observ that it is veri rare that the provid of god cast us into ani condit of life so low or ani miseri so great but we mai see someth or other to be thank for and mai see other in wors circumst than our own such certainli wa the case of these men of whom i could not so much as see room to suppos ani of them were save noth could make it ration so much as to wish or expect that thei did not all perish there except the possibl onli of their be taken up by anoth ship in compani and thi wa but mere possibl inde for i saw not the least signal or appear of ani such thing i cannot explain by ani possibl energi of word what a strang long or hanker of desir i felt in my soul upon thi sight break out sometim thu o that there had been but on or two nai but on soul save out of the ship to have escap to me that i might but have had on companion on fellowcreatur to have spoken to me and to have convers with in all the time of my solitari life i never felt so earnest so strong a desir after the societi of my fellowcreatur or so deep a regret at want of it there ar some secret move spring in the affect which when thei ar set a go by some object in view or be it some object though not in view yet render present to the mind by the power of imagin that motion carri out the soul by it impetuos to such violent eager embrac of the object that the absenc of it is insupport such were these earnest wish that but on man had been save o that it had been but on i believ i repeat the word o that it had been but on a thousand time and my desir were so move by it that when i spoke the word my hand would clinch togeth and my finger press the palm of my hand that if i had had ani soft thing in my hand it would have crush it involuntarili and my teeth in my head would strike togeth and set against on anoth so strong that for some time i could not part them again let the naturalist explain these thing and the reason and manner of them all i can sai of them is to describ the fact which wa ever surpris to me when i found it though i knew not from what it should proce it wa doubtless the effect of ardent wish and of strong idea form in my mind realiz the comfort which the convers of on of my fellowchristian would have been to me but it wa not to be either their fate or mine or both forbad it for till the last year of my be on thi island i never knew whether ani were save out of that ship or no and had onli the afflict some dai after to see the corps of a drown boi come on shore at the end of the island which wa next the shipwreck he had on no cloth but a seaman waistcoat a pair of open kneed linen drawer and a blue linen shirt but noth to direct me so much as to guess what nation he wa of he had noth in hi pocket but two piec of eight and a tobaccopip the last wa to me of ten time more valu than the first it wa now calm and i had a great mind to ventur out in my boat to thi wreck not doubt but i might find someth on board that might be us to me but that did not altogeth press me so much as the possibl that there might be yet some live creatur on board whose life i might not onli save but might by save that life comfort my own to the last degre and thi thought clung so to my heart that i could not be quiet night nor dai but i must ventur out in my boat on board thi wreck and commit the rest to god provid i thought the impress wa so strong upon my mind that it could not be resist that it must come from some invis direct and that i should be want to myself if i did not go under the power of thi impress i hasten back to my castl prepar everi thing for my voyag took a quantiti of bread a great pot for fresh water a compass to steer by a bottl of rum for i had still a great deal of that left a basket full of raisin and thu load myself with everi thing necessari i went down to my boat got the water out of her and got her afloat load all my cargo in her and then went home again for more my second cargo wa a great bag full of rice the umbrella to set up over my head for shade anoth larg pot full of lush water and about two dozen of my small loav or barleycak more than befor with a bottl of goat milk and a chees all which with great labour and sweat i brought to my boat and prai to god to direct my voyag i put out and row or paddl the cano along the shore i came at last to the utmost point of the island on that side viz ne and now i wa to launch out into the ocean and either to ventur or not to ventur i look on the rapid current which ran constantli on both side of the island at a distanc and which were veri terribl to me from the remembr of the hazard i had been in befor and my heart began to fail me for i foresaw that if i wa driven into either of those current i should be carri a vast wai out to sea and perhap out of my reach or sight of the island again and that then as my boat wa but small if ani littl gale of wind should rise i should be inevit lost these thought so oppress my mind that i began to give over my enterpris and have hale my boat into a littl creek on the shore i step out and sat me down upon a littl spot of rise ground veri pensiv and anxiou between fear and desir about my voyag when as i wa muse i could perceiv that the tide wa turn and the flood came on upon which my go wa for so mani hour impractic upon thi it present occur to me that i should go up to the highest piec of ground i could find and observ if i could how the set of the tide or current lai when the flood came in that i might judg whether if i wa driven on wai out i might not expect to be driven anoth wai home with the same rapid of the current thi thought wa no sooner in my head but i cast my ey upon a littl hill which suffici overlook the sea both wai and from whenc i had a clear view of the current or set of the tide and which wai i wa to guid myself in my return here i found that as the current of the ebb set out close by the south point of the island so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side and that i had noth to do but to keep to the north of the island in my return and i should do well enough encourag with thi observ i resolv the next morn to set out with the first of the tide and repos myself for that night in the cano under the great watchcoat i mention i launch out i made first a littl out to sea full north till i began to feel the benefit of the current which sat eastward and which carri me at a great rate and yet did not so hurri me as the southern side current had done befor and so as to take from me all govern of the boat but have a strong steerag with my paddl i went i sai at a great rate directli for the wreck and in less than two hour i came up to it it wa a dismal sight to took at the ship which by it build wa spanish stuck fast jamb in between two rock all the stern and quarter of her wa beaten to piec with the sea and as her forecastl which stuck in the rock had run on with great violenc her mainmast and foremast were brought by the board that is to sai broken short off but her boltsprit wa sound and the head and bow appear firm when i came close to her a dog appear upon her which see me come yelp and cri and as soon as i call him jump into the sea to come to me and i took him into the boat but found him almost dead for hunger and thirst i gave him a cake of my bread and he at like a raven wolf that had been starv a fortnight in the snow i then gave the poor creatur some fresh water with which if i would have let him he would have burst himself after thi i went on board the first sight i met with wa two men drown in the cookroom or forecastl of the ship with their arm fast about on anoth i conclud as is inde probabl that when the ship struck it be in a storm the sea broke so high and so continu over her that the men were not abl to bear it and were strangl with the constant rush in of the water as much as if thei had been under water besid the dog there wa noth left in the ship that had life nor ani good that i could see but what were spoil by the water there were some cask of liquor whether wine or brandi i knew not which lai lower in the hold and which the water be eb out i could see but thei were too big to meddl with i saw sever chest which i believ belong to some of the seamen and i got two of them into the boat without examin what wa in them had the stern of the ship been fix and the fore part broken off i am persuad i might have made a good voyag for by what i found in these two chest i had room to suppos the ship had a great deal of wealth on board and if i mai guess by the cours she steer she must have been bound from the bueno ayr or the rio de la plata in the south part of america beyond the brasil to the havanna in the gulf of mexico and so perhap to spain she had no doubt a great treasur in her but of no us at that time to ani bodi and what becam of the rest of her peopl i then knew not i found besid these chest a littl cask full of liquor of about twenti gallon which i got into my boat with much difficulti there were sever musket in a cabin and a great powderhorn with about four pound of powder in it as for the musket i had no occas for them so i left them but took the powderhorn i took a fireshovel and tong which i want extrem as also two littl brass kettl a copper pot to make chocol and a gridiron and with thi cargo and the dog i came awai the tide begin to make home again and the same even about an hour within night i reach the island again weari and fatigu to the last degre i repos that night in the boat and in the morn i resolv to harbour what i had gotten in my new cave not to carri it home to my castl after refresh myself i got all my cargo on shore and began to examin the particular the cask of liquor i found to be a kind of rum but not such as we had at the brasil and in a word not at all good but when i came to open the chest i found sever thing which i want for exampl i found in on a fine case of bottl of an extraordinari kind and fill with cordial water fine and veri good the bottl held about three pint each and were tip with silver i found two pot of veri good succad or sweetmeat so fasten also on the top that the salt water had not hurt them and two more of the same which the water had spoil i found some veri good shirt which were veri welcom to me and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchief and colour neckcloth the former were also veri welcom be exceed refresh to wipe my face in a hot dai besid thi when i came to the till in the chest i found there three great bag of piec of eight which held about eleven hundr piec in all and in on of them wrapt up in a paper six doubloon of gold and some small bar or wedg of gold i suppos thei might all weigh near a pound the other chest i found had some cloth in it but of littl valu but by the circumst it must have belong to the gunner mate as there wa no powder in it but about two pound of glaze powder in the three flask kept i suppos for charg their fowlingpiec on occas upon the whole i got veri littl by thi voyag that wa of much us to me for as to the monei i had no manner of occas for it it wa to me as the dirt under my feet and i would have given it all for three or four pair of english shoe and stock which were thing i greatli want but had not had on my feet now for mani year i had inde got two pair of shoe now which i took off the feet of the two drown men whom i saw in the wreck and i found two pair more in on of the chest which were veri welcom to me but thei were not like our english shoe either for case or servic be rather what we call pump than shoe i found in the seaman chest about fifti piec of eight in royal but no gold i suppos thi belong to a poorer man than the other which seem to belong to some offic well howev i lug the monei home to my cave and laid it up as i had done that befor which i brought from our own ship but it wa great piti as i said that the other part of the ship had not come to my share for i am satisfi i might have load my cano sever time over with monei which if i had ever escap to england would have lain here safe enough till i might have come again and fetch it have now brought all my thing on shore and secur them i went back to my boat and row or paddl her along the shore to her old harbour where i laid her up and made the best of my wai to my old habit where i found everi thing safe and quiet so i began to repos myself live after my old fashion and take care of my famili affair and for awhil i live easi enough onli that i wa more vigil than i us to be look out often and did not go abroad so much and if at ani time i did stir with ani freedom it wa alwai to the east part of the island where i wa pretti well satisfi the savag never came and where i could go without so mani precaut and such a load of arm and ammunit as i alwai carri with me if i went the other wai i live in thi condit near two year more but my unlucki head that wa alwai to let me know it wa born to make my bodi miser wa all these two year fill with project and design how if it were possibl i might get awai from thi island for sometim i wa for make anoth voyag to the wreck though my reason told me that there wa noth left there worth the hazard of my voyag sometim for a rambl on wai sometim anoth and i believ veriti if i had had the boat that i went from salle in i should have ventur to sea bound ani where i knew not whither i have been in all my circumst a memento to those who ar touch with that gener plagu of mankind whenc for aught i know on half of their miseri flow i mean that of not be satisfi with the station wherein god and natur hath place them for not to look back upon my primit condit and the excel advic of my father the opposit to which wa as i mai call it my origin sin my subsequ mistak of the same kind have been the mean of my come into thi miser condit for had that provid which so happili had seat me at the brasil as a planter bless me with confin desir and could i have been content to have gone on gradual i might have been by thi time i mean in the time of my be on thi island on of the most consider planter in the brasil nai i am persuad that by the improv i had made in that littl time i live there and the increas i should probabl have made if i had stai i might have been worth a hundr thousand moidor and what busi had i to leav a settl fortun wellstock plantat improv and increas to turn supercargo to guinea to fetch negro when patienc and time would have so increas our stock at home that we could have bought them at our own door from those whose busi it wa to fetch them and though it had cost us someth more yet the differ of that price wa by no mean worth save at so great a hazard but as thi is ordinarili the fate of young head so reflect upon the folli of it is as ordinarili the exercis of more year or of the dearbought experi of time and so it wa with me now and yet so deep had the mistak taken root in my temper that i could not satisfi myself in my station but wa continu pore upon the mean and possibl of my escap from thi place and that i mai with the greater pleasur to the reader bring on the remain part of my stori it mai not be improp to give some account of my first concept on the subject of thi foolish scheme for my escap and how and upon what foundat i act i am now to be suppos to be retir into my castl after my late voyag to the wreck my frigat laid up and secur under water as usual and my condit restor to what it wa befor i had more wealth inde than i had befor but wa not at all the richer for i had no more us for it than the indian of peru had befor the spaniard came thither it wa on of the night in the raini season in march the fourandtwentieth year of my first set foot in thi island of solitari i wa ly in my bed or hammock awak and veri well in health had no pain no distemp no uneasi of bodi no nor ani uneasi of mind more than ordinari but could by no mean close my ey that is so as to sleep no not a wink all night long otherwis than as follow it is as imposs as needless to set down the innumer crowd of thought that whirl through that great thoroughfar of the brain the memori in thi night time i ran over the whole histori of my life in miniatur or by abridg as i mai call it to my come to thi island and also of that part of my life sinc i came to thi island in my reflect upon the state of my case sinc i came on shore on thi island i wa compar the happi postur of my affair in the first year of my habit here to that cours of anxieti fear and care which i had live in ever sinc i had seen the print of a foot in the sand not that i did not believ the savag had frequent the island even all the while and might have been sever hundr of them at time on the shore there but as i had never known it and wa incap of ani apprehens about it my satisfact wa perfect though my danger wa the same and i wa as happi in not know my danger as if i had never realli been expos to it thi furnish my thought with mani veri profit reflect and particularli thi on how infinit good that provid is which ha settl in it govern of mankind such narrow bound to hi sight and knowledg of thing and though he walk in the midst of so mani thousand danger the sight of which if discov to him would distract hi mind and sink hi spirit he is kept seren and calm by have the event of thing hid from hi ey and know noth of the danger which surround him after these thought had for some time entertain me i came to reflect serious upon the real danger i had been in for so mani year in thi veri island and how i had walk about in the greatest secur and with all possibl tranquil even perhap when noth but a brow on a hill a great tree or the casual approach of night had been between me and the worst kind of destruct viz that of fall into the hand of cannib and savag who would have seiz on me with the same view as i did of a goat or a turtl and have thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me than i did of a pigeon or a curlieu i would unjustli slander my self if i should sai i wa not sincer thank to my great preserv to whose singular protect i acknowledg with great humil that all these unknown deliver were due and without which i must inevit have fallen into their merciless hand when these thought were over my head wa for some time taken up in consid the natur of these wretch creatur i mean the savag and how it came to pass in the world that the wise governour of all thing should give up ani of hi creatur to such inhuman nai to someth so much below even brutal it self as to devour it own kind but as thi end in some at that time fruitless specul it occur to me to enquir what part of the world these wretch live in how far off the coast wa from whenc thei came what thei ventur over so far from home for what kind of boat thei had and why i might not order my self and my busi so that i might be as abl to go over thither as thei were to come to me i never so much as troubl my self to consid what i should do with my self when i came thither what would becom of me if i fell into the hand of the savag or how i should escap from them if thei attempt me no nor so much as how it wa possibl for me to reach the coast and not be attempt by some or other of them without ani possibl of deliv my self and if i should not fall into their hand what i should do for provis or whither i should bend my cours none of these thought i sai so much as came in my wai but my mind wa wholli bent upon the notion of my pass over in my boat to the main land i look back upon my present condit as the most miser that could possibl be that i wa not abl to throw myself into ani thing but death that could be call wors that if i reach the shore of the main i might perhap meet with relief or i might coast along as i did on the shore of africa till i came to some inhabit countri and where i might find some relief and after all perhap i might fall in with some christian ship that might take me in and if the worst came to the worst i could but die which would put an end to all these miseri at onc prai note all thi wa the fruit of a disturb mind an impati temper made as it were desper by the long continu of my troubl and the disappoint i had met in the wreck i had been on board of and where i had been so near the obtain of what i so earnestli long for viz somebodi to speak to and to learn some knowledg from of the place where i wa and of the probabl mean of my deliver i sai i wa agit wholli by these thought all my calm of mind in my resign to provid and wait the issu of the disposit of heaven seem to be suspend and i had as it were no power to turn my thought to ani thing but the project of a voyag to the main which came upon me with such forc and such an impetuos of desir that it wa not to be resist when thi had agit my thought for two hour or more with such violenc that it set my veri blood into a ferment and my puls beat as high as if i had been in a fever mere with the extraordinari fervour of my mind about it natur as if i had been fatigu and exhaust with the veri thought of it threw me into a sound sleep on would have thought i should have dream of it but i did not nor of ani thing relat to it but i dream that as i wa go out in the morn as usual from my castl i saw upon the shore two cano and eleven savag come to land and that thei brought with them anoth savag whom thei were go to kill in order to eat him when on a sudden the savag that thei were go to kill jump awai and ran for hi life then i thought in my sleep that he came run into my littl thick grove befor my fortif to hide himself and that i see him alon and not perceiv that the other sought him that wai shew myself to him and smile upon him encourag him that he kneel down to me seem to prai me to assist him upon which i shew my ladder made him go up it and carri him into my cave and he becam my servant and that as soon as i had got thi man i said to myself now i mai certainli ventur to the main land for thi fellow will serv me as a pilot and will tell me what to do and whither to go for provis and whither not to go for fear of be devour what place to ventur into and what to escap i wake with thi thought and wa under such inexpress impress of joi at the prospect of my escap in my dream that the disappoint which i felt upon come to myself and find it wa no more than a dream were equal extravag the other wai and threw me into a veri great deject of spirit upon thi howev i made thi conclus that my onli wai to go about an attempt for an escap wa if possibl to get a savag in my possess and if possibl it should be on of their prison whom thei had condemn to be eaten and should bring hither to kill but these thought still were attend with thi difficulti that it wa imposs to effect thi without attack a whole caravan of them and kill them all and thi wa not onli a veri desper attempt and might miscarri but on the other hand i had greatli scrupl the law of it to me and my heart trembl at the thought of shed so much blood though it wa for my deliver i need not repeat the argument which occur to me against thi thei be the same mention befor but though i had other reason to offer now viz that those men were enemi to my life and would devour me if thei could that it wa selfpreserv in the highest degre to deliv myself from thi death of a life and wa act in my own defenc as much as if thei were actual assault me and the like i sai though these thing argu for it yet the thought of shed human blood for my deliver were veri terribl to me and such as i could by no mean reconcil myself to a great while howev at last after mani secret disput with myself and after great perplex about it for all these argument on wai and anoth struggl in my head a long time the eager prevail desir of deliver at length master all the rest and i resolv if possibl to get on of these savag into my hand cost what it would the next thing then wa to contriv how to do it and thi inde wa veri difficult to resolv on but as i could pitch upon no probabl mean for it so i resolv to put myself upon the watch to see them when thei came on shore and leav the rest to the event take such measur as the opportun should present let it be what it would with these resolut in my thought i set myself upon the scout as often as possibl and inde so often till i wa heartili tire of it for it wa abov a year and a half that i wait and for a great part of that time went out to the west end and to the southwest corner of the island almost everi dai to see the cano but none appear thi wa veri discourag and began to troubl me much though i cant sai that it did in thi case as it had done some time befor that viz wear off the edg of my desir to the thing but the longer it seem to be delai the more eager i wa for it in a word i wa not at first more care to shun the sight of these savag and avoid be seen by them than i wa now eager to be upon them besid i fanci myself abl to manag on nai two or three savag if i had them so as to make them entir slave to me to do whatev i should direct them and to prevent their be abl at ani time to do me ani hurt it wa a great while that i pleas myself with thi affair but noth still present all my fanci and scheme came to noth for no savag came near me for a great while about a year and a half after i had entertain these notion and by long muse had as it were resolv them all into noth for want of an occas to put them in execut i wa surpris on morn earli with see no less than five cano all on shore togeth on my side the island and the peopl who belong to them all land and out of my sight the number of them broke all my measur for see so mani and know that thei alwai came four or six or sometim more in a boat i could not tell what to think of it or how to take my measur to attack twenti or thirti men singlehand so i lai still in my castl perplex and discomfort howev i put myself into all the same postur for an attack that i had formerli provid and wa just readi for action if ani thing had present have wait a good while listen to hear if thei made ani nois at length be veri impati i set my gun at the foot of my ladder and clamber up to the top of the hill by my two stage as usual stand so howev that my head did not appear abov the hill so that thei could not perceiv me by ani mean here i observ by the help of my perspect glass that thei were no less than thirti in number that thei had a fire kindl and that thei had had meat dress how thei cook it that i knew not or what it wa but thei were all danc in i know not how mani barbar gestur and figur their own wai round the fire when i wa thu look on them i perceiv by my perspect two miser wretch drag from the boat where it seem thei were laid by and were now brought out for the slaughter i perceiv on of them immedi fall be knock down i suppos with a club or wooden sword for that wa their wai and two or three other were at work immedi cut him open for their cookeri while the other victim wa left stand by himself till thei should be readi for him in that veri moment thi poor wretch see himself a littl at liberti natur inspir him with hope of life and he start awai from them and ran with incred swift along the sand directli toward me i mean toward that part of the coast where my habit wa i wa dreadfulli fright that i must acknowledg when i perceiv him to run my wai and especi when as i thought i saw him pursu by the whole bodi and now i expect that part of my dream wa come to pass and that he would certainli take shelter in my grove but i could not depend by ani mean upon my dream for the rest of it viz that the other savag would not pursu him thither and find him there howev i kept my station and my spirit began to recov when i found that there were not abov three men that follow him and still more wa i encourag when i found that he outstript them exceedingli in run and gain ground of them so that if he could but hold it for half an hour i saw easili he would fairli get awai from them all there wa between them and my castl the creek which i mention often at the first part of my stori when i land my cargo out of the ship and thi i knew he must necessarili swim over or the poor wretch would be taken there but when the savag escap came thither he made noth of it though the tide wa then up but plung in swam through in about thirti stroke or thereabout land and ran on with exceed strength and swift when the three pursuer came to the creek i found that two of them could swim but the third could not and that he stand on the other side look at the other but went no farther and soon after went softli back again which as it happen wa veri well for him in the main i observ that the two who swam were yet more than twice as long swim over the creek than the fellow wa that fled from them it came now veri warmli upon my thought and inde irresist that now wa my time to get a servant and perhap a companion or assist and that i wa call plainli by provid to save thi poor creatur life i immedi got down the ladder with all possibl expedit fetch my two gun for thei were both at the foot of the ladder as i observ abov and get up again with the same hast to the top of the hill i cross toward the sea and have a veri short cut and all down hill clap myself in the wai between the pursuer and the pursu halloo aloud to him that fled who look back wa at first perhap as much fright at me as at them but i beckon with my hand to him to come back and in the meantim i slowli advanc toward the two that follow then rush at onc upon the foremost i knock him down with the stock of my piec i wa loath to fire becaus i would not have the rest hear though at that distanc it would not have been easili heard and be out of sight of the smoke too thei would not have easili known what to make of it i have knock thi fellow down the other who pursu him stop as if he had been frighten and i advanc apac toward him but as i came nearer i perceiv present he had a bow and arrow and wa fit it to shoot at me so i wa then necessit to shoot at him first which i did and kill him at the first shot the poor savag who fled but had stop though he saw both hi enemi fallen and kill as he thought yet wa so fright with the fire and nois of my piec that he stood stockstil and neither came forward nor went backward though he seem rather inclin to fly still than to come on i halloo again to him and made sign to come forward which he easili understood and came a littl wai then stop again and then a littl farther and stop again and i could then perceiv that he stood trembl as if he had been taken prison and had just been to be kill as hi two enemi were i beckon him again to come to me and gave him all the sign of encourag that i could think of and he came nearer and nearer kneel down everi ten or twelv step in token of acknowledg for save hi life i smile at him and look pleasantli and beckon to him to come still nearer at length he came close to me and then he kneel down again kiss the ground and laid hi head upon the ground and take me by the foot set my foot upon hi head thi it seem wa in token of swear to be my slave for ever i took him up and made much of him and encourag him all i could but there wa more work to do yet for i perceiv the savag whom i knock down wa not kill but stun with the blow and began to come to himself so i point to him and show him the savag that he wa not dead upon thi he spoke some word to me and though i could not understand them yet i thought thei were pleasant to hear for thei were the first sound of a man voic that i had heard my own except for abov fiveandtwenti year but there wa no time for such reflect now the savag who wa knock down recov himself so far as to sit up upon the ground and i perceiv that my savag began to be afraid but when i saw that i present my other piec at the man as if i would shoot him upon thi my savag for so i call him now made a motion to me to lend him my sword which hung nake in a belt by my side so i did he no sooner had it but he run to hi enemi and at on blow cut off hi head so cleverli no execution in germani could have done it sooner or better which i thought veri strang for on who i had reason to believ never saw a sword in hi life befor except their own wooden sword howev it seem as i learnt afterward thei make their wooden sword so sharp so heavi and the wood is so hard that thei will cut off head even with them nai and arm and that at on blow too when he had done thi he come laugh to me in sign of triumph and brought me the sword again and with abund of gestur which i did not understand laid it down with the head of the savag that he had kill just befor me but that which astonish him most wa to know how i had kill the other indian so far off so point to him he made sign to me to let him go to him so i bade him go as well as i could when he came to him he stood like on amaz look at him turn him first on on side then on tother look at the wound the bullet had made which it seem wa just in hi breast where it had made a hole and no great quantiti of blood had follow but he had bled inwardli for he wa quit dead then he took up hi bow and arrow and came back so i turn to go awai and beckon him to follow me make sign to him that more might come after them upon thi he sign to me that he should buri them with sand that thei might not be seen by the rest if thei follow and so i made sign again to him to do so he fell to work and in an instant he had scrape a hole in the sand with hi hand big enough to buri the first in and then drag him into it and cover him and did so also by the other i believ he had buri them both in a quarter of an hour then call him awai i carri him not to my castl but quit awai to my cave on the farther part of the island so i did not let my dream come to pass in that part viz that he came into my grove for shelter here i gave him bread and a bunch of raisin to eat and a draught of water which i found he wa inde in great distress for by hi run and have refresh him i made sign for him to go lie down and sleep point to a place where i had laid a great parcel of ricestraw and a blanket upon it which i us to sleep upon myself sometim so the poor creatur lai down and went to sleep he wa a come handsom fellow perfectli well made with straight long limb not too larg tall and wellshap and as i reckon about twentysix year of ag he had a veri good counten not a fierc and surli aspect but seem to have someth veri manli in hi face and yet he had all the sweet and soft of an european in hi counten too especi when he smile hi hair wa long and black not curl like wool hi forehead veri high and larg and a great vivac and sparkl sharp in hi ey the colour of hi skin wa not quit black but veri tawni and yet not of an ugli yellow nauseou tawni as the brasilian and virginian and other nativ of america ar but of a bright kind of a dun oliv colour that had in it someth veri agreeabl though not veri easi to describ hi face wa round and plump hi nose small not flat like the negro a veri good mouth thin lip and hi teeth fine wellset and white as ivori after he had slumber rather than slept about half an hour he wake again and come out of the cave to me for i had been milk my goat which i had in the enclosur just by when he espi me he came run to me lai himself down again upon the ground with all the possibl sign of an humbl thank disposit make mani antic gestur to shew it at last he lai hi head flat upon the ground close to my foot and set my other foot upon hi head as he had done befor and after thi made all the sign to me of subject servitud and submiss imagin to let me know how much he would serv me as long as he live i understood him in mani thing and let him know i wa veri well pleas with him in a littl time i began to speak to him and teach him to speak to me and first i made him know hi name should be fridai which wa the dai i save hi life and i call him so for the memori of the time i likewis taught him to sai master and then let him know that wa to be my name i likewis taught him to sai ye and no and to know the mean of them i gave him some milk in an earthen pot and let him see me drink it befor him and sop my bread in it and i gave him a cake of bread to do the like which he quickli compli with and made sign that it wa veri good for him i kept there with him all that night but as soon as it wa dai i beckon him to come with me and let him know i would give him some cloth at which he seem veri glad for he wa starknak as we went by the place where he had buri the two men he point exactli to the spot and shew me the mark that he had made to find them again make sign to me that we should dig them up again and eat them at thi i appear veri angri express my abhorr of it made as if i would vomit at the thought of it and beckon with my hand to him to come awai which he did immedi with great submiss i then led him up to the top of the hill to see if hi enemi were gone and pull out my glass i look and saw plainli the place where thei had been but no appear of them or of their cano so that it wa plain that thei were gone and had left their two comrad behind them without ani search after them but i wa not content with thi discoveri but have now more courag and consequ more curios i took my man fridai with me give him the sword in hi hand with the bow and arrow at hi back which i found he could us veri dexter make him carri on gun for me and i two for myself and awai we march to the place where these creatur had been for i had a mind now to get some further intellig of them when i came to the place my veri blood ran chill in my vein and my heart sunk within me at the horror of the spectacl inde it wa a dread sight at least it wa so to me though fridai made noth of it the place wa cover with human bone the ground dy with the blood great piec of flesh left here and there halfeaten mangl and scorch and in short all the token of the triumphant feast thei had been make there after a victori over their enemi i saw three skull five hand and the bone of three or four leg and feet and abund of other part of the bodi and fridai by hi sign made me understand that thei brought over four prison to feast upon that three of them were eaten up and that he point to himself wa the fourth that there had been a great battl between them and their next king whose subject it seem he had been on of and that thei had taken a great number of prison all which were carri to sever place by those that had taken them in the flight in order to feast upon them as wa done here by these wretch upon those thei brought hither i caus fridai to gather all the skull bone flesh and whatev remain and lai them togeth on an heap and make a great fire upon it and burn them all to ash i found fridai had still a hanker stomach after some of the flesh and wa still a cannib in hi natur but i discov so much abhorr at the veri thought of it and at the least appear of it that he durst not discov it for i had by some mean let him know that i would kill him if he offer it when we had done thi we came back to our castl and there i fell to work for my man fridai and first of all i gave him a pair of linen drawer which i had out of the poor gunner chest i mention and which i found in the wreck and which with a littl alter fit him veri well then i made him a jerkin of goat skin as well as my skill would allow and i wa now grown a toler good tailor and i gave him a cap which i had made of a hareskin veri conveni and fashion enough and thu he wa dress for the present toler well and mighti well wa he pleas to see himself almost as well cloth as hi master it is true he went awkwardli in these thing at first wear the drawer wa veri awkward to him and the sleev of the waistcoat gall hi shoulder and the insid of hi arm but a littl eas them where he complain thei hurt him and us himself to them at length he took to them veri well the next dai after i came home to my hutch with him i began to consid where i should lodg him and that i might do well for him and yet be perfectli easi myself i made a littl tent for him in the vacant place between my two fortif in the insid of the last and in the outsid of the first and as there wa a door or entranc there into my cave i made a formal frame doorcas and a door to it of board and set it up in the passag a littl within the entranc and caus the door to open on the insid i bar it up in the night take in my ladder too so that fridai could no wai come at me in the insid of my innermost wall without make so much nois in get over that it must need awaken me for my first wall had now a complet roof over it of long pole cover all my tent and lean up to the side of the hill which wa again laid cross with small stick instead of lath and then thatch over a great thick with the rice straw which wa strong like reed and at the hole or place which wa left to go in or out by the ladder i had place a kind of trapdoor which if it had been attempt on the outsid would not have open at all but would have fallen down and made a great nois and as to weapon i took them all in to my side everi night but i need none of all thi precaut for never man had a more faith love sincer servant than fridai wa to me without passion sullen or design perfectli oblig and engag hi veri affect were ti to me like those of a child to a father and i dare sai he would have sacrif hi life for the save mine upon ani occas whatsoev the mani testimoni he gave me of thi put it out of doubt and soon convinc me that i need to us no precaut as to my safeti on hi account thi frequent gave me occas to observ and that with wonder that howev it had pleas god in hi provid and in the govern of the work of hi hand to take from so great a part of the world of hi creatur the best us to which their faculti and the power of their soul ar adapt yet that he ha bestow upon them the same power the same reason the same affect the same sentiment of kind and oblig the same passion and resent of wrong the same sens of gratitud sincer fidel and all the capac of do good and receiv good that he ha given to us and that when he pleas to offer them occas of exert these thei ar as readi nai more readi to appli them to the right us for which thei were bestow than we ar and thi made me veri melancholi sometim in reflect as the sever occas present how mean a us we make of all these even though we have these power enlighten by the great lamp of instruct the spirit of god and by the knowledg of hi word ad to our understand and why it ha pleas god to hide the life save knowledg from so mani million of soul who if i might judg by thi poor savag would make a much better us of it than we did from henc i sometim wa led too far to invad the sovereignti of provid and as it were arraign the justic of so arbitrari a disposit of thing that should hide that light from some and reveal it to other and yet expect a like duti from both but i shut it up and check my thought with thi conclus first that we do not know by what light and law these should be condemn but that as god wa necessarili and by the natur of hi be infinit holi and just so it could not be but that if these creatur were all sentenc to absenc from himself it wa on account of sin against that light which as the scriptur sai wa a law to themselv and by such rule as their conscienc would acknowledg to be just though the foundat wa not discov to us and secondli that still as we ar all clai in the hand of the potter no vessel could sai to him why hast thou form me thu but to return to my new companion i wa greatli delight with him and made it my busi to teach him everi thing that wa proper to make him us handi and help but especi to make him speak and understand me when i spake and he wa the aptest scholar that ever wa and particularli wa so merri so constantli dilig and so pleas when he could but understand me or make me understand him that it wa veri pleasant to me to talk to him and now my life began to be so easi that i began to sai to myself that could i but have been safe from more savag i care not if i wa never to remov from the place while i live after i had been two or three dai return to my castl i thought that in order to bring fridai off from hi horrid wai of feed and from the relish of a cannib stomach i ought to let him tast other flesh so i took him out with me on morn to the wood i went inde intend to kill a kid out of my own flock and bring it home and dress it but as i wa go i saw a she goat ly down in the shade and two young kid sit by her i catch hold of fridai hold said i stand still and made sign to him not to stir immedi i present my piec shot and kill on of the kid the poor creatur who had at a distanc inde seen me kill the savag hi enemi but did not know or could imagin how it wa done wa sensibl surpris trembl and shook and look so amaz that i thought he would have sunk down he did not see the kid i had shot at or perceiv i had kill it but rip up hi waistcoat to feel if he wa not wound and as i found present thought i wa resolv to kill him for he came and kneel down to me and embrac my knee said a great mani thing i did not understand but i could easili see that hi mean wa to prai me not to kill him i soon found a wai to convinc him that i would do him no harm and take him up by the hand laugh at him and point to the kid which i had kill beckon to him to run and fetch it which he did and while he wa wonder and look to see how the creatur wa kill i load my gun again and by and by i saw a great fowl like a hawk sit upon a tree within shot so to let fridai understand a littl what i would do i call him to me again point at the fowl which wa inde a parrot though i thought it had been a hawk i sai point to the parrot and to my gun and to the ground under the parrot to let him see i would make him fall i made him understand that i would shoot and kill that bird accordingli i fire and bid him look and immedi he saw the parrot fall he stood like on fright again notwithstand all that i had said to him and i found he wa the more amaz becaus he did not see me put ani thing into the gun but thought there must be some wonder fund of death and destruct in that thing abl to kill man beast bird or ani thing near or far off for the astonish thi creat in him wa such as could not wear off for a long time and i believ if i would have let him he would have worship me and my gun as for the gun itself he would not so much as touch it for sever dai over but would speak to it and talk to it as if it had answer him when he wa by himself which as i afterward learnt of him wa to desir it not to kill him well after hi astonish wa a littl over at thi i point to him to run and fetch the bird i had shot which he did but staid some time for the parrot not be quit dead had flutter a good wai off from the place where she fell howev he found her took her up and brought her to me and as i had perceiv hi ignor about the gun befor i took thi advantag to charg the gun again and not let him see me do it that i might be readi for ani other mark that might present but noth more offer at that time so i brought home the kid and the same even i took the skin off and cut it out as well as i could and have a pot for that purpos i boil or stew some of the flesh and made some veri good broth after i had begun to eat some i gave some to my man who seem veri glad of it and like it veri well but that which wa strangest to him wa to see me eat salt with it he made a sign to me that the salt wa not good to eat and put a littl into hi own month he seem to nauseat it and would spit and sputter at it wash hi mouth with fresh water after it on the other hand i took some meat in my mouth without salt and i pretend to spit and sputter for want of salt as fast as he had done at the salt but it would not do he would never care for salt with meat or in hi broth at least not a great while and then but a veri littl have thu fed him with boil meat and broth i wa resolv to feast him the next dai with roast a piec of the kid thi i did by hang it befor the fire in a string as i had seen mani peopl do in england set two pole up on on each side the fire and on cross on the top and ty the string to the cross stick let the meat turn continu thi fridai admir veri much but when he came to tast the flesh he took so mani wai to tell me how well he like it that i could not but understand him and at last he told me he would never eat man flesh ani more which i wa veri glad to hear the next dai i set him to work to beat some corn out and sift it in the manner i us to do as i observ befor and he soon understood how to do it as well as i especi after he had seen what the mean of it wa and that it wa to make bread of for after that i let him see me make my bread and bake it too and in a littl time fridai wa abl to do all the work for me as well as i could do it myself i began now to consid that have two mouth to feed instead of on i must provid more ground for my harvest and plant a larger quantiti of corn than i us to do so i mark out a larger piec of land and began the fenc in the same manner as befor in which fridai not onli work veri willingli and veri hard but did it veri cheerfulli and i told him what it wa for that it wa for corn to make more bread becaus he wa now with me and that i might have enough for him and myself too he appear veri sensibl of that part and let me know that he thought i had much more labour upon me on hi account than i had for myself and that he would work the harder for me if i would tell him what to do thi wa the pleasantest year of all the life i led in thi place fridai began to talk pretti well and understand the name of almost everi thing i had occas to call for and of everi place i had to send him to and talk a great deal to me so that in short i began now to have some us for my tongu again which inde i had veri littl occas for befor that is to sai about speech besid the pleasur of talk to him i had a singular satisfact in the fellow himself hi simpl unfeign honesti appear to me more and more everi dai and i began realli to love the creatur and on hi side i believ he love me more than it wa possibl for him ever to love ani thing befor i had a mind onc to try if he had ani hanker inclin to hi own countri again and have learnt him english so well that he could answer me almost ani question i ask him whether the nation that he belong to never conquer in battl at which he smile and said ye ye we alwai fight the better that is he meant alwai get the better in fight and so we began the follow discours you alwai fight the better said i how came you to be taken prison then fridai fridai my nation beat much for all that master how beat if your nation beat them how came you to be taken fridai thei more than my nation in the place where me wa thei take on two three and me my nation overbeat them in the yonder place where me no wa there my nation take on two great thousand master but why did not your side recov you from the hand of your enemi then fridai thei run on two three and me and make go in the cano my nation have no cano that time master well fridai and what doe your nation do with the men thei take do thei carri them awai and eat them as these did fridai ye my nation eat man too eat all up master where do thei carri them fridai go to other place where thei think master do thei come hither fridai ye ye thei come hither come other els place master have you been here with them fridai ye i been here point to the nw side of the island which it seem wa their side by thi i understood that my man fridai had formerli been among the savag who us to come on shore on the farther part of the island on the said man eat occas that he wa now brought for and some time after when i took the courag to carri him to that side be the same i formerli mention he present knew the place and told me he wa there onc when thei at up twenti men two women and on child he could not tell twenti in english but he number them by lai so mani stone in a row and point to me to tell them over i have told thi passag becaus it introduc what follow that after i had had thi discours with him i ask him how far it wa from our island to the shore and whether the cano were not often lost he told me there wa no danger no cano ever lost but that after a littl wai out to sea there wa a current and a wind alwai on wai in the morn the other in the afternoon thi i understand to be no more than the set of the tide as go out or come in but i afterward understood it wa occas by the great draught and reflux of the mighti river oroonoqu in the mouth of which river as i thought afterward our island lai and that thi land which i perceiv to the w and nw wa the great island trinidad on the north point of the mouth of the river i ask fridai a thousand question about the countri the inhabit the sea the coast and what nation were near he told me all he knew with the greatest open imagin i ask him the name of the sever nation of hi sort of peopl but could get no other name than carib from whenc i easili understood that these were the caribe which our map place on that part of america which reach from the mouth of the river oroonoqu to guinea and onward to st martha he told me that up a great wai beyond the moon that wa beyond the set of the moon which must be w from their countri there dwelt whitebeard men like me and point to my great whisker which i mention befor and that thei had kill much man that wa hi word by which i understood he meant the spaniard whose cruelti in america had been spread over the whole countri and were rememb by all the nation from father to son i inquir if he could tell me how i might come from thi island and get among those white men he told me ye ye i might go in two cano i could not understand what he meant by two cano till at last with great difficulti i found he meant that it must be in a larg great boat as big as two cano thi part of fridai discours began to relish with me veri well and from thi time i entertain some hope that on time or other i might find an opportun to make my escap from thi place and that thi poor savag might be a mean to help me to do it dure the long time that fridai had now been with me and that he began to speak to me and understand me i wa not want to lai a foundat of religi knowledg in hi mind particularli i ask him on time who made him the poor creatur did not understand me at all but thought i had ask who wa hi father but i took it by anoth handl and ask him who made the sea the ground he walk on and the hill and wood he told me it wa on old benamucke that live beyond all he could describ noth of thi great person but that he wa veri old much older he said than the sea or the land than the moon or the star i ask him then if thi old person had made all thing why did not all thing worship him he look veri grave and with a perfect look of innoc said all thing said o to him i ask him if the peopl who die in hi countri went awai ani where he said ye thei all went to benamucke then i ask him whether those thei at up went thither too he said ye from these thing i began to instruct him in the knowledg of the true god i told him that the great maker of all thing live there point up toward heaven that he govern the world by the same power and provid by which he made it that he wa omnipot could do everi thing for us give everi thing to us take everi thing from us and thu by degre i open hi ey he listen with great attent and receiv with pleasur the notion of jesu christ be sent to redeem us and of the manner of make our prayer to god and hi be abl to hear us even into heaven he told me on dai that if our god could hear us up beyond the sun he must need be a greater god than their benamucke who live but a littl wai off and yet could not hear till thei went up to the great mountain where he dwelt to speak to him i ask him if ever he went thither to speak to him he said no thei never went that were young men none went thither but the old men whom he call their oowookake that is as i made him explain it to me their religi or clergi and that thei went to sai o so he call sai prayer and then came back and told them what benamucke said by thi i observ that there is priestcraft even amongst the most blind ignor pagan in the world and the polici of make a secret religion in order to preserv the vener of the peopl to the clergi is not onli to be found in the roman but perhap among all religi in the world even among the most brutish and barbar savag i endeavour to clear up thi fraud to my man fridai and told him that the pretenc of their old men go up to the mountain to sai o to their god benamucke wa a cheat and their bring word from thenc what he said wa much more so that if thei met with ani answer or spoke with ani on there it must be with an evil spirit and then i enter into a long discours with him about the devil the origin of him hi rebellion against god hi enmiti to man the reason of it hi set himself up in the dark part of the world to be worship instead of god and as god and the mani stratagem he made us of to delud mankind to their ruin how he had a secret access to our passion and to our affect to adapt hi snare so to our inclin as to caus us even to be our own tempter and to run upon our own destruct by our own choic i found it wa not so easi to imprint right notion in hi mind about the devil as it wa about the be of a god natur assist all my argument to evid to him even the necess of a great first caus and overrul govern power a secret direct provid and of the equiti and justic of pai homag to him that made us and the like but there appear noth of all thi in the notion of an evil spirit of hi origin hi be hi natur and abov all of hi inclin to do evil and to draw us in to do so too and the poor creatur puzzl me onc in such a manner by a question mere natur and innoc that i scarc knew what to sai to him i had been talk a great deal to him of the power of god hi omnipot hi dread avers to sin hi be a consum fire to the worker of iniqu how as he had made as all he could destroi us and all the world in a moment and he listen with great serious to me all the while after thi i had been tell him how the devil wa god enemi in the heart of men and us all hi malic and skill to defeat the good design of provid and to ruin the kingdom of christ in the world and the like well sai fridai but you sai god is so strong so great is he not much strong much might as the devily ye said i fridai god is stronger than the devil god is abov the devil and therefor we prai to god to tread him under our feet and enabl us to resist hi temptat and quench hi fieri dartsbut sai he again if god much strong much might as the devil why god not kill the devil so make him no more wick i wa strang surpris at hi question and after all though i wa now an old man yet i wa but a young doctor and ill enough qualifi for a casuist or a solver of difficulti and at first i could not tell what to sai so i pretend not to hear him and ask him what he said but he wa too earnest for an answer to forget hi question so that he repeat it in the veri same broken word as abov by thi time i had recov myself a littl and i said god will at last punish him sever he is reserv for the judgment and is to be cast into the bottomless pit to dwell with everlast fire thi did not satisfi fridai but he return upon me repeat my word reserv at last me no understand but why not kill the devil now not kill great agoy mai as well ask me said i why god doe not kill you and me when we do wick thing here that offend him we ar preserv to repent and be pardon he muse awhil at thi well well sai he mighti affection that well so you i devil all wick all preserv repent god pardon all here i wa run down again by him to the last degre and it wa a testimoni to me how the mere notion of natur though thei will guid reason creatur to the knowledg of a god and of a worship or homag due to the suprem be of god as the consequ of our natur yet noth but divin revel can form the knowledg of jesu christ and of a redempt purchas for us of a mediat of a new coven and of an intercessor at the footstool of god throne i sai noth but a revel from heaven can form these in the soul and that therefor the gospel of our lord and saviour jesu christ i mean the word of god and the spirit of god promis for the guid and sanctifi of hi peopl ar the absolut necessari instructor of the soul of men in the save knowledg of god and the mean of salvat i therefor divert the present discours between me and my man rise up hastili as upon some sudden occas of go out then send him for some thing a great wai off i serious prai to god that he would enabl me to instruct savingli thi poor savag assist by hi spirit the heart of the poor ignor creatur to receiv the light of the knowledg of god in christ reconcil him to himself and would guid me to speak so to him from the word of god as hi conscienc might be convinc hi ey open and hi soul save when he came again to me i enter into a long discours with him upon the subject of the redempt of man by the saviour of the world and of the doctrin of the gospel preach from heaven viz of the repent toward god and faith in our bless lord jesu i then explain to him as well as i could why our bless redeem took not on him the natur of angel but the seed of abraham and how for that reason the fallen angel had no share in the redempt that he came onli to the lost sheep of the hous of israel and the like i had god know more sincer than knowledg in all the method i took for thi poor creatur instruct and must acknowledg what i believ all that act upon the same principl will find that in lai thing open to him i realli inform and instruct myself in mani thing that either i did not know or had not fulli consid befor but which occur natur to my mind upon my search into them for the inform of thi poor savag and i had more affect in my inquiri after thing upon thi occas than ever i felt befor so that whether thi poor wild wretch wa the better for me or no i had great reason to be thank that ever he came to me my grief sat lighter upon me my habit grew comfort to me beyond measur and when i reflect that in thi solitari life which i had been confin to i had not onli been move myself to look up to heaven and to seek to the hand that brought me thither but wa now to be made an instrument under provid to save the life and for aught i knew the soul of a poor savag and bring him to the true knowledg of religion and of the christian doctrin that he might know christ jesu to know whom is life etern i sai when i reflect upon all these thing a secret joi ran through everi part of my soul and i frequent rejoic that ever i wa brought to thi place which i had often thought the most dread of all afflict that could possibl have befallen me in thi thank frame i continu all the remaind of my time and the convers which emploi the hour between fridai and me wa such as made the three year which we live there togeth perfectli and complet happi if ani such thing as complet happi can be found in a sublunari state the savag wa now a good christian a much better than i though i have reason to hope and bless god for it that we were equal penit and comfort restor penit we had here the word of god to read and no farther off from hi spirit to instruct than if we had been in england i alwai appli myself to read the scriptur and to let him know as well as i could the mean of what i read and he again by hi seriou inquiri and question made me as i said befor a much better scholar in the scriptur knowledg than i should ever have been by my own privat read anoth thing i cannot refrain from observ here also from experi in thi retir part of my life viz how infinit and inexpress a bless it is that the knowledg of god and of the doctrin of salvat by christ jesu is so plainli laid down in the word of god so easi to be receiv and understood that as the bare read the scriptur made me capabl of understand enough of my duti to carri me directli on to the great work of sincer repent for my sin and lai hold of a saviour for life and salvat to a state reform in practic and obedi to all god command and thi without ani teacher or instructor i mean human so the plain instruct suffici serv to the enlighten thi savag creatur and bring him to be such a christian as i have known few equal to him in my life as to the disput wrangl strife and content which ha happen in the world about religion whether niceti in doctrin or scheme of churchgovern thei were all perfectli useless to us as for aught i can yet see thei have been to all the rest in the world we had the sure guid to heaven viz the word of god and we had bless be god comfort view of the spirit of god teach and instruct us by hi word lead us into all truth and make us both will and obedi to hi instruct of hi word and i cannot see the least us that the greatest knowledg of the disput point in religion which have made such confus in the world would have been to us if we could have obtain it but i must go on with the histor part of thing and take everi part in it order after fridai and i becam more intim acquaint and that he could understand almost all i said to him and speak fluentli though in broken english to me i acquaint him with my own stori or at least so much of it as relat to my come into the place how i had live there and how long i let him into the mysteri for such it wa to him of gunpowd and bullet and taught him how to shoot i gave him a knife which he wa wonderfulli delight with and i made him a belt with a frog hang to it such as in england we wear hanger in and in the frog instead of a hanger i gave him a hatchet which wa not onli as good a weapon in some case but much more us upon mani occas i describ to him the countri of europ and particularli england which i came from how we live how we worship god how we behav to on anoth and how we trade in ship to all the part of the world i gave him an account of the wreck which i had been on board of and shew him as near as i could the place where she lai but she wa all beaten in piec long befor and quit gone i shew him the ruin of our boat which we lost when we escap and which i could not stir with my whole strength then but wa now fallen almost all to piec upon see thi boat fridai stood muse a great while and said noth i ask him what it wa he studi upon at last sai he me see such boat like come to place at my nation i did not understand him a good while but at last when i had examin further into it i understood by him that a boat such as that had been came on shore upon the countri where he live that is as he explain it wa driven thither by stress of weather i present imagin that some european ship must have been cast awai upon their coast and the boat might get loos and drive ashor but wa so dull that i never onc thought of men make escap from a wreck thither much less whenc thei might come so i onli inquir after a descript of the boat fridai describ the boat to me well enough but brought me better to understand him when he ad with some warmth we save the white man from drown then i present ask him if there were white man as he call them in the boat ye he said the boat full of while man i ask him how mani he told upon hi finger seventeen i ask him then what becam of them he told me thei live thei dwell at my nation thi put new thought into my head again for i present imagin that these might be the men belong to the ship that wa cast awai in sight of my island as i now call it and who after the ship wa struck on the rock and thei saw her inevit lost had save themselv in their boat and were land upon that wild shore among the savag upon thi i inquir of him more critic what wa becom of them he assur me thei live still there that thei had been there about four year that the savag let them alon and gave them victual to live i ask him how it came to pass thei did not kill them and eat them he said no thei make brother with them that is as i understood him a truce and then he ad thei eat no man but when make the war fight that is to sai thei never eat ani men but such as come to fight with them and ar taken in battl it wa after thi some consider time that be on the top of the hill at the east side of the island from whenc as i have said i had in a clear dai discov the main or contin of america fridai the weather be veri seren look veri earnestli toward the main land and in a kind of surpris fall ajump and danc and call out to me for i wa at some distanc from him i ask him what wa the matter o joi sai he o glad there see my countri there my nation i observ an extraordinari sens of pleasur appear in hi face and hi ey sparkl and hi counten discov a strang eager as if he had a mind to be in hi own countri again and thi observ of mine put a great mani thought into me which made me at first not so easi about my new man fridai as i wa befor and i made no doubt but that if fridai could get back to hi own nation again he would not onli forget all hi religion but all hi oblig to me and would be forward enough to give hi countrymen an account of me and come back perhap with an hundr or two of them and make a feast upon me at which he might be as merri as he us to be with those of hi enemi when thei were taken in war but i wrong the poor honest creatur veri much for which i wa veri sorri afterward howev as my jealousi increas and held me some week i wa a littl more circumspect and not so familiar and kind to him as befor in which i wa certainli in the wrong too the honest grate creatur have no thought about it but what consist of the best principl both as a religi christian and as a grate friend as appear afterward to my full satisfact whilst my jealousi of him last you mai be sure i wa everi dai pump him to see if he would discov ani of the new thought which i suspect were in him but i found everi thing he said wa so honest and so innoc that i could find noth to nourish my suspicion and in spite of all my uneasi he made me at last entir hi own again nor did he in the least perceiv that i wa uneasi and therefor i could not suspect him of deceit on dai walk up the same hill but the weather be hazi at sea so that we could not see the contin i call to him and said fridai do not you wish yourself in your own countri your own nationy he said i be much o glad to be at my own nationwhat would you do there said i would you turn wild again eat men flesh again and be a savag as you were befor he look full of concern and shake hi head said no no fridai tell them to live good tell them to prai god tell them to eat cornbread cattleflesh milk no eat man againwhi then said i to him thei will kill you he look grave at that and then said no thei no kill me thei will love learn he meant by thi thei would be will to learn he ad thei learnt much of the beard man that came in the boat then i ask him if he would go back to them he smile at that and told me he could not swim so far i told him i would make a cano for him he told me he would go if i would so with him i go said i why thei will eat me if i come thereno no sai he me make them no eat you me make thei much love you he meant he would tell them how i had kill hi enemi and save hi life and so he would make them love me then he told me as well as he could how kind thei were to seventeen white men or beard men as he call them who came on shore in distress from thi time i confess i had a mind to ventur over and see if i could possibl join with these beard men who i made no doubt were spaniard or portugues not doubt but if i could we might find some method to escap from thenc be upon the contin and a good compani togeth better than i could from an island forti mile off the shore and alon without help so after some dai i took fridai to work again by wai of discours and told him i would give him a boat to go back to hi own nation and accordingli i carri him to my frigat which lai on the other side of the island and have clear it of water for i alwai kept it sunk in the water i brought it out shew it him and we both went into it i found he wa a most dexter fellow at manag it would make it go almost as swift and fast again as i could so when he wa in i said to him well now fridai shall we go to your nation he look veri dull at my sai so which it seem wa becaus he thought the boat too small to go so far i told him then i had a bigger so the next dai i went to the place where the first boat lai which i had made but which i could not get into the water he said that wa big enough but then as i had taken no care of it and it had lain two or three and twenti year there the sun had split and dri it that it wa in a manner rotten fridai told me such a boat would do veri well and would carri much enough vittl drink bread that wa hi wai of talk upon the whole i wa by thi time so fix upon my design of go over with him to the contin that i told him we would go and make on as big as that and he should go home in it he answer not on word but look veri grave and sad i ask him what wa the matter with him he ask me again thu why you angri mad with fridai what me done i ask him what he meant i told him i wa not angri with him at all no angri no angri sai he repeat the word sever time why send fridai home awai to my nationwhi said i fridai did you not sai you wish you were therey ye sai he wish be both there no wish fridai there no master there in a word he would not think of go there without me i go there fridai said i what should i do there he turn veri quick upon me at thi you do great deal much good sai he you teach wild man be good sober tame man you tell them know god prai god and live new lifeala fridai said i thou knowest not what thou sayest i am but an ignor man myselfy ye sai he you teeche me good you teeche them goodno no fridai said i you shall go without me leav me here to live by myself as i did befor he look confus again at that word and run to on of the hatchet which he us to wear he take it up hastili and give it me what must i do with thi said i to him you take kill fridai sai he what must i kill you for said i again he return veri quick what you send fridai awai for take kill fridai no send fridai awai thi he spoke so earnestli that i saw tear stand in hi ey in a word i so plainli discov the utmost affect in him to me and a firm resolut in him that i told him then and often after that i would never send him awai from me if he wa will to stai with me upon the whole as i found by all hi discours a settl affect to me and that noth should part him from me so i found all the foundat of hi desir to go to hi own countri wa laid in hi ardent affect to the peopl and hi hope of my do them good a thing which as i had no notion of myself so i had not the least thought or intent or desir of undertak it but still i found a strong inclin to my attempt an escap as abov found on the supposit gather from the former discours viz that there were seventeen beard men there and therefor without ani delai i went to work with fridai to find out a great tree proper to fell and make a larg periagua or cano to under take the voyag there were tree enough in the island to have built a littl fleet not of periagua and cano onli but even of good larg vessel but the main thing i look at wa to get on so near the water that we might launch it when it wa made to avoid the mistak i commit at first at last fridai pitch upon a tree for i found he knew much better than i what kind of wood wa fittest for it nor can i tell to thi dai what wood to call the tree we cut down except that it wa veri like the tree we call tustick or between that and the nicaragua wood for it wa much of the same colour and smell fridai wa for burn the hollow or caviti of thi tree out to make it into a boat but i shew him how rather to cut it out with tool which after i shew him how to us he did veri handili and in about a month hard labour we finish it and made it veri handsom especi when with our ax which i shew him how to handl we cut and hew the outsid into the true shape of a boat after thi howev it cost us near a fortnight time to get her along as it were inch by inch upon great roller into the water but when she wa in she would have carri twenti men with great eas when she wa in the water and though she wa so big it amaz me to see with what dexter and how swift my man fridai could manag her turn her and paddl her along so i ask him if he would and if we might ventur over in her ye he said he ventur over in her veri well though great blow wind howev i had a farther design that he knew noth of and that wa to make a mast and sail and to fit her with an anchor and cabl as to a mast that wa easi enough to get so i pitch upon a straight young cedartre which i found near the place and which there wa a great plenti of in the island and i set fridai to work to cut it down and gave him direct how to shape and order it but as to the sail that wa my particular care i knew i had old sail or rather piec of old sail enough but as i had had them now twentysix year by me and had not been veri care to preserv them not imagin that i should ever have thi kind of us for them i did not doubt but thei were all rotten and inde most of them were so howev i found two piec which appear pretti good and with these i went to work and with a great deal of pain and awkward tediou stitch you mai be sure for want of needl i at length made a threecorn ugli thing like what we call in england a shoulderofmutton sail to go with a boom at bottom and a littl short sprit at the top such as usual our ship longboat sail with and such as i best knew how to manag becaus it wa such a on as i us in the boat in which i made my escap from barbari as relat in the first part of my stori i wa near two month perform thi last work viz rig and fit my mast and sail for i finish them veri complet make a small stai and a sail or foresail to it to assist if we should turn to windward and which wa more than all i fix a rudder to the stern of her to steer with and though i wa but a bungl shipwright yet as i knew the us and even necess of such a thing i appli myself with so much pain to do it that at last i brought it to pass though consid the mani dull contriv i had for it that fail i think it cost me almost as much labour as make the boat after all thi wa done i had my man fridai to teach as to what belong to the navig of my boat for though he knew veri well how to paddl the cano he knew noth what belong to a sail and a rudder and wa the more amaz when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder and how the sail gibe and fill thi wai or that wai as the cours we sail chang i sai when he saw thi he stood like on astonish and amaz howev with a littl us i made all these thing familiar to him and he becam an expert sailor except that as to the compass i could make him understand veri littl of that on the other hand as there wa veri littl cloudi weather and seldom or never ani fog in those part there wa the less occas for a compass see the star were alwai to be seen by night and the shore by dai except in the raini season and then nobodi care to stir abroad either by land or sea i wa now enter on the sevenandtwentieth year of my captiv in thi place though the three last year that i had thi creatur with me ought rather to be left out of the account my habit be quit of anoth kind than in all the rest of my time i kept the anniversari of my land here with the same thank to god for hi merci as at first and if i had such caus of acknowledg at first i had much more so now have such addit testimoni of the care of provid over me and the great hope i had of be effectu and speedili deliv for i had an invinc impress upon my thought that my deliver wa at hand and that i should not be anoth year in thi place howev i went on with my husbandri dig plant and fenc as usual i gather and cure my grape and did everi necessari thing as befor the raini season wa in the mean time upon me when i kept more within door than at other time so i had stow our now vessel as secur as we could bring her up into the creek where as i said in the begin i land my raft from the ship and hale her up to the shore at high water mark i made my man fridai dig a littl dock just big enough for her to float in and then when the tide wa out we made a strong dam cross the end of it to keep the water out and so she lai dry as to the tide from the sea and to keep the rain off we laid a great mani bough of tree so thick that she wa as well thatch as a hous and thu we wait for the month of novemb and decemb in which i design to make my adventur when the settl season began to come in as the thought of my design return with the fair weather i wa prepar daili for the voyag and the first thing i did wa to lai up a certain quantiti of provis be the store for the voyag and intend in a week or a fortnight time to open the dock and launch out our boat i wa busi on morn upon someth of thi kind when i call to fridai and bid him go to the seashor and see if he could find a turtl or tortois a thing which we gener got onc a week for the sake of the egg as well as the flesh fridai had not been long gone when he came run back and flew over my outward wall or fenc like on that felt not the ground or the step he set hi feet on and befor i had time to speak to him he cri out to me o master o master o sorrow o badwhat the matter fridai said i o yonder there sai he on two three cano on two three by thi wai of speak i conclud there were six but on inquiri i found there were but three well fridai said i do not be fright so i hearten him up as well as i could howev i saw the poor fellow most terribl scare for noth ran in hi head but that thei were come to look for him and would cut him in piec and eat him the poor fellow trembl so that i scarc knew what to do with him i comfort him as well as i could and told him i wa in as much danger as he and that thei would eat me as well as him but said i fridai we must resolv to fight them can you fight fridai me shoot sai he but there come mani great number no matter for that said i again our gun will fright them that we do not kill so i ask him whether if i resolv to defend him he would defend me and stand by me and do just as i bade him he said me die when you bid die master so i went and fetch a good dram of rum and gave him for i had been so good a husband of my rum that i had a great deal left when he had drank it i made him take the two fowlingpiec which we alwai carri and load them with larg swanshot as big as small pistol bullet then i took four musket and load them with two slug and five small bullet each and my two pistol i load with a brace of bullet each i hung my great sword as usual nake by my side and gave fridai hi hatchet when i had thu prepar myself i took my perspectiveglass and went up to the side of the hill to see what i could discov and i found quickli by my glass that there were on and twenti savag three prison and three cano and that their whole busi seem to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodi a barbar feast inde but noth more than as i had observ wa usual with them i observ also that thei were land not where thei had done when fridai made hi escap but nearer to my creek where the shore wa low and where a thick wood came close almost down to the sea thi with the abhorr of the inhuman errand these wretch came about so fill me with indign that i came down again to fridai and told him i wa resolv to go down to them and kill them all and ask him if he would stand by me he wa now gotten over hi fright and hi spirit be a littl rais with the dram i had given him he wa veri cheer and told me as befor he would die when i bid die in thi fit of furi i took first and divid the arm which i had charg as befor between us i gave fridai on pistol to stick in hi girdl and three gun upon hi shoulder and i took on pistol and the other three myself and in thi postur we march out i took a small bottl of rum in my pocket and gave fridai a larg bag with more powder and bullet and as to order i charg him to keep close behind me and not to stir shoot or do ani thing till i bid him and in the mean time not to speak a word in thi postur i fetch a compass to my right hand of near a mile as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood so that i might come within shot of them befor i could be discov which i had seen by my glass it wa easi to do while i wa make thi march my former thought return i began to abat my resolut i do not mean that i entertain ani fear of their number for as thei were nake unarm wretch it is certain i wa superior to them nai though i had been alon but it occur to my thought what call what occas much less what necess i wa in to go and dip my hand in blood to attack peopl who had neither done or intend me ani wrong who as to me were innoc and whose barbar custom were their own disast be in them a token inde of god have left them with the other nation of that part of the world to such stupid and to such inhuman cours but did not call me to take upon me to be a judg of their action much less an execution of hi justic that whenev he thought fit he would take the caus into hi own hand and by nation vengeanc punish them for nation crime but that in the mean time it wa none of my busi that it wa true fridai might justifi it becaus he wa a declar enemi and in a state of war with those veri particular peopl and it wa law for him to attack them but i could not sai the same with respect to me these thing were so warmli press upon my thought all the wai as i went that i resolv i would onli go place myself near them that i might observ their barbar feast and that i would act then as god should direct but that unless someth offer that wa more a call to me than yet i knew of i would not meddl with them with thi resolut i enter the wood and with all possibl wari and silenc fridai follow close at my heel i march till i came to the skirt of the wood on the side which wa next to them onli that on corner of the wood lai between me and them here i call softli to fridai and shew him a great tree which wa just at the corner of the wood i bade him go to the tree and bring me word if he could see there plainli what thei were do he did so and came immedi back to me and told me thei might be plainli view there that thei were all about the fire eat the flesh of on of their prison and that anoth lai bound upon the sand a littl from them whom he said thei would kill next and which fire the veri soul within me he told me it wa not on of their nation but on of the beard men whom he had told me of who came to their countri in the boat i wa fill with horror at the veri name the whitebeard man and go to the tree i saw plainli by my glass a white man who lai upon the beach of the sea with hi hand and hi feet ti with flag or thing like rush and that he wa an european and had cloth on there wa anoth tree and a littl thicket beyond it about fifti yard nearer to them than the place where i wa which by go a littl wai about i saw i might come at undiscov and that then i should be within halfshot of them so i withheld my passion though i wa inde enrag to the highest degre and go back about twenti pace i got behind some bush which held all the wai till i came to the other tree and then i came to a littl rise ground which gave me a full view of them at the distanc of about eighti yard i had now not a moment to lose for nineteen of the dread wretch sat upon the ground all close huddl togeth and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor christian and bring him perhap limb by limb to their fire and thei were stoop down to unti the band at hi feet i turn to fridai now fridai said i do as i bid thee fridai said he would then fridai said i do exactli as you see me do fail in noth so i set down on of the musket and the fowlingpiec upon the ground and fridai did the like by hi and with the other musket i took my aim at the savag bid him do the like then ask him if he wa readi he said ye then fire at them said i and the same moment i fire also fridai took hi aim so much better than i that on the side that he shot he kill two of them and wound three more and on my side i kill on and wound two thei were you mai be sure in a dread constern and all of them who were not hurt jump up upon their feet immedi but did not know which wai to run or which wai to look for thei knew not from whenc their destruct came fridai kept hi ey close upon me that as i had bid him he might observ what i did so as soon as the first shot wa made i threw down the piec and took up the fowlingpiec and fridai did the like he see me cock and present he did the same again ar you readi fridai said i ye sai he let fly then said i in the name of god and with that i fire again among the amaz wretch and so did fridai and as our piec were now loaden with what i call swan shot or small pistolbullet we found onli two drop but so mani were wound that thei ran about yell and scream like mad creatur all bloodi and miser wound most of them whereof three more fell quickli after though not quit dead now fridai said i lai down the discharg piec and take up the musket which wa yet loaden follow me said i which he did with a deal of courag upon which i rush out of the wood and shew myself and fridai close at my foot as soon as i perceiv thei saw me i shout as loud as i could and bade fridai do so too and run as fast as i could which by the wai wa not veri fast be load with arm as i wa i made directli toward the poor victim who wa as i said ly upon the beach or shore between the place where thei sat and the sea the two butcher who were just go to work with him had left him at the surpris of our first fire and fled in a terribl fright to the seasid and had jump into a cano and three more of the rest made the same wai i turn to fridai and bade him step forward and fire at them he understood me immedi and run about forti yard to be near them he shot at them and i thought he had kill them all for i saw them all fall on an heap into the boat though i saw two of them up again quickli howev he kill two of them and wound the third so that he lai down in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead while my man fridai fire at them i pull out my knife and cut the flag that bound the poor victim and loos hi hand and feet i lift him up and ask him in the portugues tongu what he wa he answer in latin christianu but wa so weak and faint that he could scarc stand or speak i took my bottl out of my pocket and gave it him make sign that he should drink which he did and i gave him a piec of bread which he at then i ask him what countryman he wa and he said espagnol and be a littl recov let me know by all the sign he could possibl make how much he wa in my debt for hi deliver seignior said i with as much spanish as i could make up we will talk afterward but we must fight now if you have ani strength left take thi pistol and sword and lai about you he took them veri thankfulli and no sooner had he the arm in hi hand but as if thei had put new vigour into him he flew upon hi murder like a furi and had cut two of them in piec in an instant for the truth is as the whole wa a surpris to them so the poor creatur were so much fright with the nois of our piec that thei fell down for mere amaz and fear and had no more power to attempt their own escap than their flesh had to resist our shot and that wa the case of those five that fridai shot in the boat for as three of them fell with the hurt thei receiv so the other two fell with the fright i kept my piec in my hand still without fire be will to keep my charg readi becaus i had given the spaniard my pistol and sword so i call to fridai and bade him run up to the tree from whenc we first fire and fetch the arm which lai there that had been discharg which he did with great swift and then give him my musket i sat down myself to load all the rest again and bade them come to me when thei want while i wa load these piec there happen a fierc engag between the spaniard and on of the savag who made at him with on of their great wooden sword the same weapon that wa to have kill him befor if i had not prevent it the spaniard who wa as bold and as brave as could be imagin though weak had fought thi indian a good while and had cut him two great wound on hi head but the savag be a stout lusti fellow close in with him had thrown him down be faint and wa wring my sword out of hi hand when the spaniard though undermost wise quit hi sword drew the pistol from hi girdl shot the savag through the bodi and kill him upon the spot befor i who wa run to help could come near him fridai be now left at hi liberti pursu the fly wretch with no weapon in hi hand but hi hatchet and with that he dispatch those three who as i said befor were wound at first and fallen and all the rest he could come up with and the spaniard come to me for a gun i gave him on of the fowlingpiec with which he pursu two of the savag and wound them both but as he wa not abl to run thei both got from him into the wood where fridai pursu them and kill on of them but the other wa too nimbl for him and though he wa wound yet he plung into the sea and swam with all hi might off to those who were left in the cano which three in the cano with on wound who we know not whether he di or no were all that escap our hand of oneandtwenti the account of the rest is as follow kill at our shot from the tree kill at the next shot kill by fridai in the boat kill by ditto of those at first wound kill by ditto in the wood kill by the spaniard kill be found dropt here and there of their wound or kill by fridai in hi chase of them escap in the boat whereof on wound if not dead in all those that were in the cano work hard to get out of gunshot and though fridai made two or three shot at them i did not find that he hit ani of them fridai would fain have had me take on of their cano and pursu them and inde i wa veri anxiou about their escap lest carri the new home to their peopl thei should come back perhap with two or three hundr of their cano and devour us by mere multitud so i consent to pursu them by sea and run to on of their cano i jump in and bade fridai follow me but when i wa in the cano i wa surpris to find anoth poor creatur lie there aliv bound hand and foot as the spaniard wa for the slaughter and almost dead with fear not know what the matter wa for he had not been abl to look up over the side of the boat he wa ti so hard neck and heel and had been ti so long that he had realli littl life in him i immedi cut the twist flag or rush which thei had bound him with and would have help him up but he could not stand or speak but groan most piteous believ it seem still that he wa onli unbound in order to be kill when fridai came to him i bade him speak to him and tell him of hi deliver and pull out my bottl made him give the poor wretch a dram which with the new of hi be deliv reviv him and he sat up in the boat but when fridai came to hear him speak and look in hi face it would have move ani on to tear to have seen how fridai kiss him embrac him hug him cri laugh halloo jump about danc sung then cri again wrung hi hand beat hi own face and head and then sung and jump about again like a distract creatur it wa a good while befor i could make him speak to me or tell me what wa the matter but when he came a littl to himself he told me that it wa hi father it wa not easi for me to express how it move me to see what ecstasi and filial affect had work in thi poor savag at the sight of hi father and of hi be deliv from death nor inde can i describ half the extravag of hi affect after thi for he went into the boat and out of the boat a great mani time when he went in to him he would sit down by him open hi breast and hold hi father head close to hi bosom half an hour togeth to nourish it then he took hi arm and ankl which were numb and stiff with the bind and chafe and rub them with hi hand and i perceiv what the case wa gave him some rum out of my bottl to rub them with which did them a great deal of good thi action put an end to our pursuit of the cano with the other savag who were now gotten almost out of sight and it wa happi for us that we did not for it blew so hard within two hour after and befor thei could be gotten a quarter of their wai and continu blow so hard all night and that from the northwest which wa against them that i could not suppos their boat could live or that thei ever reach to their own coast but to return to fridai he wa so busi about hi father that i could not find in my heart to take him off for some time but after i thought he could leav him a littl i call him to me and he came jump and laugh and pleas to the highest extrem then i ask him if he had given hi father ani bread he shook hi head and said none ugli dog eat all up self so i gave him a cake of bread out of a littl pouch i carri on purpos i also gave him a dram for himself but he would not tast it but carri it to hi father i had in my pocket also two or three bunch of my raisin so i gave him a hand of them for hi father he had no sooner given hi father these raisin but i saw him come out of the boat and run awai as if he had been bewitch he ran at such a rate for he wa the swiftest fellow of hi feet that ever i sawi sai he ran at such a rate that he wa out of sight as it were in an instant and though i call and halloo too after him it wa all on awai he went and in a quarter of an hour i saw him come back again though not so fast as he went and as he came nearer i found hi pace wa slacker becaus he had someth in hi hand when he came up to me i found he had been quit home for an earthen jug or pot to bring hi father some fresh water and that he had get two more cake or loav of bread the bread he gave me but the water he carri to hi father howev as i wa veri thirsti too i took a littl sip of it thi water reviv hi father more than all the rum or spirit i had given him for he wa just faint with thirst when hi father had drank i call him to know if there wa ani water left he said ye and i bade him give it to the poor spaniard who wa in as much want of it as hi father and i sent on of the cake that fridai brought to the spaniard too who wa inde veri weak and wa repos himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree and whose limb were also veri stiff and veri much swell with the rude bandag he had been ti with when i saw that upon fridai come to him with the water he sat up and drank and took the bread and began to eat i went to him and gave him a hand of raisin he look up in my face with all the token of gratitud and thank that could appear in ani counten but wa so weak notwithstand he had so exert himself in the fight that he could not stand upon hi feet he tri to do it two or three time but wa realli not abl hi ankl were so swell and so pain to him so i bade him sit still and caus fridai to rub hi ankl and bath them with rum as he had done hi father i observ the poor affection creatur everi two minut or perhap less all the while he wa here turn hi head about to see if hi father wa in the same place and postur as he left him sit and at last he found he wa not to be seen at which he start up and without speak a word flew with that swift to him that on could scarc perceiv hi feet to touch the ground as he went but when he came he onli found he had laid himself down to eas hi limb so fridai came back to me present and i then spoke to the spaniard to let fridai help him up if he could and load him to the boat and then he should carri him to our dwell where i would take care of him but fridai a lusti young fellow took the spaniard quit up upon hi back and carri him awai to the boat and set him down softli upon the side or gunnel of the cano with hi feet in the insid of it and then lift them quit in and set him close to hi father and present step out again launch the boat off and paddl it along the shore faster than i could walk though the wind blew pretti hard too so he brought them both safe into our creek and leav them in the boat run awai to fetch the other cano as he pass me i spoke to him and ask him whither he went he told me go fetch more boat so awai he went like the wind for sure never man or hors ran like him and he had the other cano in the creek almost as soon as i got to it by land so he waft me over and then went to help our new guest out of the boat which he did but thei were neither of them abl to walk so that poor fridai knew not what to do to remedi thi i went to work in my thought and call to fridai to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me i soon made a kind of handbarrow to lai them on and fridai and i carri them up both togeth upon it between us but when we got them to the outsid of our wall or fortif we were at a wors loss than befor for it wa imposs to get them over and i wa resolv not to break it down so i set to work again and fridai and i in about two hour time made a veri handsom tent cover with old sail and abov that with bough of tree be in the space without our outward fenc and between that and the grove of young wood which i had plant and here we made two bed of such thing as i had viz of good ricestraw with blanket laid upon it to lie on and anoth to cover them on each bed my island wa now peopl and i thought myself veri rich in subject and it wa a merri reflect which i frequent made how like a king i look first of all the whole countri wa my own mere properti so that i had an undoubt right of dominion dly my peopl were perfectli subject i wa absolut lord and lawgiv thei all ow their live to me and were readi to lai down their live if there had been occas for it for me it wa remark too i had but three subject and thei were of three differ religion my man fridai wa a protest hi father a pagan and a cannib and the spaniard wa a papist howev i allow liberti of conscienc throughout my dominion but thi by the wai as soon as i had secur my two weak rescu prison and given them shelter and a place to rest them upon i began to think of make some provis for them and the first thing i did i order fridai to take a yearl goat betwixt a kid and a goat out of my particular flock to be kill then i cut off the hind quarter and chop it into small piec i set fridai to work to boil and stew and made them a veri good dish i assur you of flesh and broth have put some barlei and rice also into the broth and as i cook it without door for i made no fire within my inner wall so i carri it all into the new tent and have set a tabl there for them i sat down and at my dinner also with them and as well as i could cheer them and encourag them fridai be my interpret especi to hi father and inde to the spaniard too for the spaniard spoke the languag of the savag pretti well after we had dine or rather sup i order fridai to take on of the cano and go and fetch our musket and other firearm which for want of time we had left upon the place of battl and the next dai i order him to go and buri the dead bodi of the savag which lai open to the sun and would present be offens and i also order him to buri the horrid remain of their barbar feast which i knew were pretti much and which i could not think of do myself nai i could not bear to see them if i went that wai all which he punctual perform and defac the veri appear of the savag be there so that when i went again i could scarc know where it wa otherwis than by the corner of the wood point to the place i then began to enter into a littl convers with my two new subject and first i set fridai to inquir of hi father what he thought of the escap of the savag in that cano and whether he might expect a return of them with a power too great for us to resist hi first opinion wa that the savag in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that night thei went off but must of necess be drown or driven south to those other shore where thei were as sure to be devour as thei were to be drown if thei were cast awai but as to what thei would do if thei came safe on shore he said he knew not but it wa hi opinion that thei were so dreadfulli fright with the manner of be attack the nois and the fire that he believ thei would tell their peopl thei were all kill by thunder and lightn and not by the hand of man and that the two which appear viz fridai and i were two heavenli spirit or furi come down to destroi them and not men with weapon thi he said he knew becaus he heard them all cry out so in their languag to on anoth for it wa imposs for them to conceiv that a man should dart fire and speak thunder and kill at a distanc without lift up the hand as wa done now and thi old savag wa in the right for as i understood sinc by other hand the savag of that part never attempt to go over to the island afterward thei were so terrifi with the account given by these four men for it seem thei did escap the sea that thei believ whoever went to that enchant island would be destroi with fire from the god thi howev i knew not and therefor wa under continu apprehens for a good while and kept alwai upon my guard i and all my armi for as there were now four of us i would have ventur a hundr of them fairli in the open field at ani time in a littl time howev no more cano appear the fear of their come wore off and i began to take my former thought of a voyag to the main into consider be likewis assur by fridai father that i might depend upon good usag from their nation on hi account if i would go but my thought were a littl suspend when i had a seriou discours with the spaniard and when i understood that there were sixteen more of hi countrymen and portugues who have been cast awai and made their escap to that side live there at peac inde with the savag but were veri sore put to it for necessari and inde for life i ask him all the particular of their voyag and found thei were a spanish ship bound from the rio de la plata to the havanna be direct to leav their load there which wa chiefli hide and silver and to bring back what european good thei could meet with there that thei had five portugues seamen on board whom thei took out of anoth wreck that five of their own men were drown when first the ship wa lost and that these escap through infinit danger and hazard and arriv almost starv on the cannib coast where thei expect to have been devour everi moment he told me thei had some arm with them but thei were perfectli useless for that thei had neither powder nor ball the wash of the sea have spoil all their powder but a littl which thei us at their first land to provid themselv some food i ask him what he thought would becom of them there and if thei had form no design of make ani escap he said thei had mani consult about it but that have neither vessel nor tool to build on or provis of ani kind their counsel alwai end in tear and despair i ask him how he thought thei would receiv a propos from me which might tend toward an escap and whether if thei were all here it might not be done i told him with freedom i fear mostli their treacheri and ill usag of me if i put my life in their hand for that gratitud wa no inher virtu in the natur of man nor did men alwai squar their deal by the oblig thei had receiv so much as thei did by the advantag thei expect i told him it would be veri hard that i should be the instrument of their deliver and that thei should afterward make me their prison in new spain where an englishman wa certain to be made a sacrific what necess or what accid soever brought him thither and that i had rather be deliv up to the savag and be devour aliv than fall into the merciless claw of the priest and be carri into the inquisit i ad that otherwis i wa persuad if thei were all here we might with so mani hand build a bark larg enough to carri us all awai either to the brasil southward or to the island or spanish coast northward but that if in requit thei should when i had put weapon into their hand carri me by forc among their own peopl i might be ill us for my kind to them and make my case wors than it wa befor he answer with a great deal of candour and ingenu that their condit wa so miser and thei were so sensibl of it that he believ thei would abhor the thought of us ani man unkindli that should contribut to their deliver and that if i pleas he would go to them with the old man and discours with them about it and return again and bring me their answer that he would make condit with them upon their solemn oath that thei would be absolut under my lead as their command and captain and that thei should swear upon the holi sacrament and gospel to be true to me and go to such christian countri as i should agre to and no other and to be direct wholli and absolut by my order till thei were land safe in such countri as i intend and that he would bring a contract from them under their hand for that purpos then he told me he would first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me as long as he live till i gave him order and that he would take my side to the last drop of blood if there should happen the least breach of faith among hi countrymen he told me thei were all of them veri civil honest men and thei were under the greatest distress imagin have neither weapon or cloth nor ani food but at the merci and discret of the savag out of all hope of ever return to their own countri and that he wa sure if i would undertak their relief thei would live and die by me upon these assur i resolv to ventur to reliev them if possibl and to send the old savag and the spaniard over to them to treat but when he had gotten all thing in readi to go the spaniard himself start an object which had so much prudenc in it on on hand and so much sincer on the other hand that i could not but be veri well satisfi in it and by hi advic put off the deliver of hi comrad for at least half a year the case wa thu he had been with us now about a month dure which time i had let him see in what manner i had provid with the assist of provid for my support and he saw evid what stock of corn and rice i had laid up which as it wa more than suffici for myself so it wa not suffici at least without good husbandri for my famili now it wa increas to number four but much less would it be suffici if hi countrymen who were as he said fourteen still aliv should come over and least of all would it be suffici to victual our vessel if we should build on for a voyag to ani of the christian coloni of america so he told me he thought it would be more advis to let him and the other two dig and cultiv some more land as much as i could spare seed to sow and that we should wait anoth harvest that we might have a suppli of corn for hi countrymen when thei should come for want might be a temptat to them to disagre or not to think themselv deliv otherwis than out of on difficulti into anoth you know sai he the children of israel though thei rejoic at first at their be deliv out of egypt yet rebel even against god himself that deliv them when thei came to want bread in the wilder hi caution wa so season and hi advic so good that i could not but be veri well pleas with hi propos as well as i wa satisfi with hi fidel so we fell to dig all four of us as well as the wooden tool we were furnish with permit and in about a month time by the end of which it wa seed time we had gotten as much land cure and trim up as we sow twentytwo bushel of barlei on and sixteen jar of rice which wa in short all the seed we had to spare nor inde did we leav ourselv barlei suffici for our own food for the six month that we had to expect our crop that is to sai reckon from the time we set our seed asid for sow for it is not to be suppos it is six month in the ground in that countri have now societi enough and our number be suffici to put us out of fear of the savag if thei had come unless their number had been veri great we went freeli all over the island wherev we found occas and as here we had our escap or deliver upon our thought it wa imposs at least for me to have the mean of it out of mine to thi purpos i mark out sever tree which i thought fit for our work and i set fridai and hi father to cut them down and then i caus the spaniard to whom i impart my thought on that affair to overse and direct their work i show them with what indefatig pain i had hew a larg tree into singl plank and i caus them to do the like till thei had about a dozen larg plank of good oak near two feet broad thirtyf feet long and from two inch to four inch thick what prodigi labour it took up ani on mai imagin at the same time i contriv to increas my littl flock of tame goat as much as i could and to thi purpos i made fridai and the spaniard to go out on dai and myself with fridai the next dai for we took our turn and by thi mean we got about twenti young kid to breed up with the rest for whenev we shot the dam we save the kid and ad them to our flock but abov all the season for cure the grape come on i caus such a prodigi quantiti to be hung up in the sun that i believ had we been at alic where the raisin of the sun ar cure we should have fill sixti or eighti barrel and these with our bread wa a great part of our food and veri good live too i assur you for it is an exceed nourish food it wa now harvest and our crop in good order it wa not the most plenti increas i had seen in the island but howev it wa enough to answer our end for from twenti two bushel of barlei we brought in and thresh out abov two hundr and twenti bushel and the like in proport of the rice which wa store enough for our food to the next harvest though all the sixteen spaniard had been on shore with me or if we had been readi for a voyag it would veri plentifulli have victual our ship to have carri us to ani part of the world that is to sai of america when we had thu hous and secur our magazin of corn we fell to work to make more wickerwork viz great basket in which we kept it and the spaniard wa veri handi and dexter at thi part and often blame me that i did not make some thing for defenc of thi kind of work but i saw no need of it and now have a full suppli of food for all the guest expect i gave the spaniard leav to go over to the main to see what he could do with those he left behind him there i gave him a strict charg in write not to bring ani man with him who would not first swear in the presenc of himself and of the old savag that he would no wai injur fight with or attack the person he should find in the island who wa so kind to send for them in order to their deliver but that thei would stand by and defend him against all such attempt and wherev thei went would be entir under and subject to hi command and that thi should be put in write and sign with their hand how we were to have thi done when i knew thei had neither pen or ink that inde wa a question which we never ask under these instruct the spaniard and the old savag the father of fridai went awai in on of the cano which thei might be said to come in or rather were brought in when thei came as prison to be devour by the savag i gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it and about eight charg of powder and ball charg them to be veri good husband of both and not to us either of them but upon urgent occas thi wa a cheer work be the first measur us by me in view of my deliver for now twentyseven year and some dai i gave them provis of bread and of dri grape suffici for themselv for mani dai and suffici for their countrymen for about eight dai time and wish them a good voyag i let them go agre with them about a signal thei should hang out at their return by which i should know them again when thei came back at a distanc befor thei came on shore thei went awai with a fair gale on the dai that the moon wa at the full by my account in the month of octob but as for the exact reckon of dai after i had onc lost it i could never recov it again nor had i kept even the number of year so punctual as to be sure that i wa right though as it prove when i afterward examin my account i found i had kept a true reckon of year it wa no less than eight dai i wait for them when a strang and unforeseen accid interven of which the like ha not perhap been heard of in histori i wa fast asleep in my hutch on morn when my man fridai came run in to me and call aloud master master thei ar come thei ar come i jump up and regardless of danger i went out as soon as i could get my cloth on through my littl grove which by the wai wa by thi time grown to be a veri thick wood i sai regardless of danger i went without my arm which wa not my custom to do but i wa surpris when turn my ey to the sea i present saw a boat at about a leagu and a half distanc stand in for the shore with a shoulder of mutton sail as thei call it and the wind blow pretti fair to bring them in also i observ present that thei did not come from that side which the shore lai on but from the southernmost end of the island upon thi i call fridai in and bid him be close for these were not the peopl we look for and that we did not know yet whether thei were friend or enemi in the next place i went in to fetch my perspect glass to see what i could make of them and have taken the ladder out i climb up to the top of the hill as i us to do when i wa apprehens of ani thing and to take my view the plainer without be discov i had scarc set my foot on the hill when my ey plainli discov a ship ly at an anchor at about two leagu and a half distanc from me sse but not abov a leagu and a half from the shore by my observ it appear plainli to be an english ship and the boat appear to be an english longboat i cannot express the confus i wa in though the joi of see a ship and on whom i had reason to believ wa man by my own countrymen and consequ friend wa such as i cannot describ but yet i had some secret doubt hung about me i cannot tell from whenc thei came bid me keep upon my guard in the first place it occur to me to consid what busi an english ship could have in that part of the world sinc it wa not the wai to or from ani part of the world where the english had ani traffic and i knew there had been no storm to drive them in there as in distress and that if thei were english realli it wa most probabl that thei were here upon no good design and that i had better continu as i wa than fall into the hand of thiev and murder let no man despis the secret hint and notic of danger which sometim ar given him when he mai think there is no possibl of it be real that such hint and notic ar given us i believ few that have made ani observ of thing can deni that thei ar certain discoveri of an invis world and a convers of spirit we cannot doubt and if the tendenc of them seem to be to warn us of danger why should we not suppos thei ar from some friendli agent whether suprem or inferior and subordin is not the question and that thei ar given for our good the present question abundantli confirm me in the justic of thi reason for had i not been made cautiou by thi secret admonit come from whenc it will i had been undon inevit and in a far wors condit than befor as you will see present i had not kept myself long in thi postur but i saw the boat draw near the shore as if thei look for a creek to thrust in at for the conveni of land howev as thei did not come quit far enough thei did not see the littl inlet where i formerli land my raft but run their boat on shore upon the beach at about half a mile from me which wa veri happi for me for otherwis thei would have land just as i mai sai at my door and would have soon beaten me out of my castl and perhap have plunder me of all i had when thei were on shore i wa fulli satisfi thei were englishmen at least most of them on or two i thought were dutch but it did not prove so there were in all eleven men whereof three of them i found were unarm and as i thought bound and when the first four or five of them were jump on shore thei took those three out of the boat as prison on of the three i could perceiv us the most passion gestur of entreati afflict and despair even to a kind of extravag the other two i could perceiv lift up their hand sometim and appear concern inde but not to such a degre as the first i wa perfectli confound at the sight and knew not what the mean of it should be fridai call out to me in english as well as he could o master you see english man eat prison as well as savag manswhi said i fridai do you think thei ar go to eat them theny sai fridai thei will eat themno no said i fridai i am afraid thei will murder them inde but you mai be sure thei will not eat them all thi while i had no thought of what the matter realli wa but stood trembl with the horror of the sight expect everi moment when the three prison should be kill nai onc i saw on of the villain lift up hi arm with a great cutlass as the seamen call it or sword to strike on of the poor men and i expect to see him fall everi moment at which all the blood in my bodi seem to run chill in my vein i wish heartili now for our spaniard and the savag that wa gone with him or that i had ani wai to have come undiscov within shot of them that i might have rescu the three men for i saw no firearm thei had among them but it fell out to my mind anoth wai after i had observ the outrag usag of the three men by the insol seamen i observ the fellow ran scatter about the land as if thei want to see the countri i observ also that the three other men had liberti to go where thei pleas but thei sat down all three upon the ground veri pensiv and look like men in despair thi put me in mind of the finest time when i came on shore and began to look about me how i gave myself over for lost how wildli i look round me what dread apprehens i had and how i lodg in the tree all night for fear of be devour by wild beast as i knew noth that night of the suppli i wa to receiv by the providenti drive of the ship nearer the land by the storm and tide by which i have sinc been so long nourish and support so these three poor desol men knew noth how certain of deliver and suppli thei were how near it wa to them and how effectu and realli thei were in a condit of safeti at the same time thei thought themselv lost and their case desper so littl do we see befor us in the world and so much reason have we to depend cheerfulli upon the great maker of the world that he doe not leav hi creatur so absolut destitut but that in the worst circumst thei have alwai someth to be thank for and sometim ar nearer their deliver than thei imagin nai ar even brought to their deliver by the mean by which thei seem to be brought to their destruct it wa just at the top of high water when these peopl came on shore and while partli thei stood parlei with the prison thei brought and partli while thei rambl about to see what kind of place thei were in thei had carelessli staid till the tide wa spent and the water wa eb consider awai leav their boat aground thei had left two men in the boat who as i found afterward have drank a littl too much brandi fell asleep howev on of them wake sooner than the other and find the boat too fast aground for him to stir it halloo for the rest who were straggl about upon which thei all soon came to the boat but it wa past all their strength to launch her the boat be veri heavi and the shore on that side be a soft oozi sand almost like a quicksand in thi condit like true seamen who ar perhap the least of all mankind given to forethought thei gave it over and awai thei stroll about the countri again and i heard on of them sai aloud to anoth call them off from the boat why let her alon jack cant ye shell float next tide by which i wa fulli confirm in the main inquiri of what countrymen thei were all thi while i kept myself close not onc dare to stir out of my castl ani further than to my place of observ near the top of the hill and veri glad i wa to think how well it wa fortifi i know it wa no less then ten hour befor the boat could be on float again and by that time it would be dark and i might be more at liberti to see their motion and to hear their discours if thei had ani in the meantim i fit myself up for a battl as befor though with more caution know i had to do with anoth kind of enemi than i had at first i order fridai also whom i had made an excel marksman with hi gun to load himself with arm i took myself two fowlingpiec and i gave him three musket my figur inde wa veri fierc i had my formid goatskin coat on with the great cap i mention a nake sword two pistol in my belt and a gun upon each shoulder it wa my design as i said abov not to have made ani attempt till it wa dark but about two oclock be the heat of the dai i found that in short thei were all gone straggl into the wood and as i thought were all laid down to sleep the three poor distress men too anxiou for their condit to get ani sleep were howev set down under the shelter of a great tree at about a quarter of a mile from me and as i thought out of sight of ani of the rest upon thi i resolv to discov myself to them and learn someth of their condit immedi i march in the figur abov my man fridai at a good distanc behind me as formid for hi arm as i but not make quit so stare a spectrelik figur as i did i came as near them undiscov as i could and then befor ani of them saw me i call aloud to them in spanish what ar ye gentlemen thei start up at the nois but were ten time more confound when thei saw me and the uncouth figur that i made thei made no answer at all but i thought i perceiv them just go to fly from me when i spoke to them in english gentlemen said i do not be surpriz at me perhap you mai have a friend near you when you did not expect ith must be sent directli from heaven then said on of them veri grave to me and pull off hi hat at the same time to me for our condit is past the help of manal help is from heaven sir said i but can you put a stranger in the wai how to help you for you seem to me to be in some great distress i saw you when you land and when you seem to make applic to the brute that came with you i saw on of them lift up hi sword to kill you the poor man with tear run down hi face and trembl look like on astonish return am i talk to god or man is it a real man or an angelb in no fear about that sir said i if god had sent an angel to reliev you he would have come better cloath and arm after anoth manner than you see me in prai lai asid your fear i am a man an englishman and dispos to assist you you see i have on servant onli we have arm and ammunit tell us freeli can we serv youwhat is your case our case said he sir is too long to tell you while our murther ar so near but in short sir i wa command of that ship my men have mutini against me thei have been hardli prevail on not to murther me and at last have set me on shore in thi desol place with these two men with me on my mate the other a passeng where we expect to perish believ the place to be uninhabit and know not yet what to think of it where ar those brute your enemi said i do you know where thei ar gonether thei ar sir said he point to a thicket of tree my heart trembl for fear thei have seen us and heard you speak if thei have thei will certainli murder us all have thei ani firearm said i he answer thei had onli two piec and on which thei left in the boatwel then said i leav the rest to me i see thei ar all asleep it is an easi thing to kill them all but shall we rather take them prison he told me there were two desper villain among them that it wa scarc safe to shew ani merci to but if thei were secur he believ all the rest would return to their duti i ask him which thei were he told me he could not at that distanc describ them but he would obei my order in ani thing i would direct well sai i let us retreat out of their view or hear least thei awak and we will resolv further so thei willingli went back with me till the wood cover us from them look you sir said i if i ventur upon your deliver ar you will to make two condit with me he anticip my propos by tell me that both he and the ship if recov should be wholli direct and command by me in everi thing and if the ship wa not recov he would live and dye with me in what part of the world soever i would send him and the two other men said the same well sai i my condit ar but two that while you stai on thi island with me you will not pretend to ani author here and if i put arm into your hand you will upon all occas give them up to me and do no prejudic to me or mine upon thi island and in the mean time be govern by my order that if the ship is or mai be recov you will carri me and my man to england passag free he gave me all the assur that the invent and faith of a man could devis that he would compli with these most reason demand and besid would ow hi life to me and acknowledg it upon all occas as long as he live well then said i here ar three musket for you with powder and ball tell me next what you think is proper to be done he shew all the testimoni of hi gratitud that he wa abl but offer to be wholli guid by me i told him i thought it wa hard ventur ani thing but the best method i could think of wa to fire upon them at onc as thei lai and if ani were not kill at the first vollei and offer to submit we might save them and so put it wholli upon god provid to direct the shot he said veri modestli that he wa loath to kill them if he could help it but that those two were incorrig villain and had been the author of all the mutini in the ship and if thei escap we should be undon still for thei would go on board and bring the whole ship compani and destroi us all well then said i necess legitim my advic for it is the onli wai to save our live howev see him still cautiou of shed blood i told him thei should go themselv and manag as thei found conveni in the middl of thi discours we heard some of them awak and soon after we saw two of them on their feet i ask him if either of them were the men who he had said were the head of the mutini he said no well then said i you mai let them escap and provid seem to have waken them on purpos to save themselvesnow said i if the rest escap you it is your fault anim with thi he took the musket i had given him in hi hand and pistol in hi belt and hi two comrad with him with each man a piec in hi hand the two men who were with him go first made some nois at which on of the seamen who wa awak turn about and see them come cri out to the rest but it wa too late then for the moment he cri out thei fire i mean the two men the captain wise reserv hi own piec thei had so well aim their shot at the men thei knew that on of them wa kill on the spot and the other veri much wound but not be dead he start up on hi feet and call eagerli for help to the other but the captain step to him told him it wa too late to cry for help he should call upon god to forgiv hi villani and with that word knock him down with the stock of hi musket so that he never spoke more there were three more in the compani and on of them wa also slightli wound by thi time i wa come and when thei saw their danger and that it wa in vain to resist thei beg for merci the captain told them he would spare their live if thei would give him ani assur of their abhorr of the treacheri thei had been guilti of and would swear to be faith to him in recov the ship and afterward in carri her back to jamaica from whenc thei came thei gave him all the protest of their sincer that could be desir and he wa will to believ them and spare their live which i wa not against onli i oblig him to keep them bound hand and foot while thei were upon the island while thi wa do i sent fridai with the captain mate to the boat with order to secur her and bring awai the oar and sail which thei did and by and by three straggl men that were happili for them part from the rest came back upon hear the gun fire and see their captain who befor wa their prison now their conqueror thei submit to be bound also and so our victori wa complet it now remain that the captain and i should inquir into on anoth circumst i began first and told him my whole histori which he heard with an attent even to amaz and particularli at the wonder manner of my be furnish with provis and ammunit and inde as my stori is a whole collect of wonder it affect him deepli but when he reflect from thenc upon himself and how i seem to have been preserv there on purpos to save hi life the tear ran down hi face and he could not speak a word more after thi commun wa at an end i carri him and hi two men into my apart lead them in just where i came out viz at the top of the hous where i refresh them with such provis as i had and shew them all the contriv i had made dure my long long inhabit that place all i shew them all i said to them wa perfectli amaz but abov all the captain admir my fortif and how perfectli i had conceal my retreat with a grove of tree which have now been plant near twenti year and the tree grow much faster than in england wa becom a littl wood and so thick that it wa impass in ani part of it but at that on side where i had reserv my littl wind passag into it thi i told him wa my castl and my resid but that i had a seat in the countri as most princ have whither i could retreat upon occas and i would shew him that too anoth time but at present our busi wa to consid how to recov the ship he agre with me as to that but told me he wa perfectli at a loss what measur to take for that there were still sixandtwenti hand on board who have enter into a curs conspiraci by which thei had all forfeit their live to the law would be harden in it now by desper and would carri it on know that if thei were reduc thei should be brought to the gallow as soon as thei came to england or to ani of the english coloni and that therefor there would be no attack them with so small a number as we were i muse for some time upon what he had said and found it wa a veri ration conclus and that therefor someth wa to be resolv on veri speedili as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their surpris as to prevent their land upon us and destroi us upon thi it present occur to me that in a littl while the ship crew wonder what wa becom of their comrad and of the boat would certainli come on shore in their other boat to see for them and that then perhap thei might come arm and be too strong for us thi he allow wa ration upon thi i told him the first thing we had to do wa to stave the boat which lai upon the beach so that thei might not carri her off and take everi thing out of her leav her so far useless as not to be fit to swim accordingli we went on board took the arm which were left on board out of her and whatev els we found there which wa a bottl of brandi and anoth of rum a few biscuit cake an horn of powder and a great lump of sugar in a piec of canva the sugar wa five or six pound all which wa veri welcom to me especi the brandi and sugar of which i had had none left for mani year when we had carri all these thing on shore the oar mast sail and rudder of the boat were carri befor as abov we knock a great hole in her bottom that if thei had come strong enough to master us yet thei could not carri off the boat inde it wa not much in my thought that we could be capabl to recov the ship but my view wa that if thei went awai without the boat i did not much question to make her fit again to carri us awai to the leeward island and call upon our friend the spaniard in my wai for i had them still in my thought while we were thu prepar our design and had first by main strength heav the boat up upon the beach so high that the tide would not float her off at high water mark and besid had broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickli stop and were sat down muse what we should do we heard the ship fire a gun and saw her make a waft with her ancient as a signal for the boat to come on board but no boat stir and thei fire sever time make other signal for the boat at last when all their signal and fire prove fruitless and thei found the boat did not stir we saw them by the help of our glass hoist anoth boat out and row toward the shore and we found as thei approach that there were no less than ten men in her and that thei had firearm with them as the ship lai almost two leagu from the shore we had a full view of them as thei came and a plain sight of the men even of their face becaus the tide have set them a littl to the east of the other boat thei row up under shore to come to the same place where the other had land and where the boat lai by thi mean i sai we had a full view of them and the captain knew the person and charact of all the men in the boat of whom he said that there were three veri honest fellow who he wa sure were led into thi conspiraci by the rest be overpow and fright but that for the boatswain who it seem wa the chief offic among them and all the rest thei were as outrag as ani of the ship crew and were no doubt made desper in their new enterpris and terribl apprehens he wa that thei would be too power for us i smile at him and told him that men in our circumst were past the oper of fear that see almost everi condit that could be wa better than that we were suppos to be in we ought to expect that the consequ whether death or life would be sure to be a deliver i ask him what he thought of the circumst of my life and whether a deliver were not worth ventur for and where sir said i is your belief of my be preserv here on purpos to save your life which elev you a littl while ago for my part said i there seem to be but on thing amiss in all the prospect of itwhat that sai he why said i ti that as you sai there ar three or four honest fellow among them which should be spare had thei been all of the wick part of the crew i should have thought god provid had singl them out to deliv them into your hand for depend upon it everi man of them that come ashor ar our own and shall die or live as thei behav to us as i spoke thi with a rais voic and cheer counten i found it greatli encourag him so we set vigor to our busi we had upon the first appear of the boat come from the ship consid of separ our prison and had inde secur them effectu two of them of whom the captain wa less assur than ordinari i sent with fridai and on of the three deliv men to my cave where thei were remot enough and out of danger of be heard or discov or of find their wai out of the wood if thei could have deliv themselv here thei left them bound but gave them provis and promis them if thei continu there quietli to give them their liberti in a dai or two but that if thei attempt their escap thei should be put to death without merci thei promis faithfulli to bear their confin with patienc and were veri thank that thei had such good usag as to have provis and a light left them for fridai gave them candl such as we made ourselv for their comfort and thei did not know but that he stood centinel over them at the entranc the other prison had better usag two of them were kept pinion inde becaus the captain wa not free to trust them but the other two were taken into my servic upon their captain recommend and upon their solemnli engag to live and die with us so with them and the three honest men we were seven men well arm and i made no doubt we should be abl to deal well enough with the ten that were acom consid that the captain had said there were three or four honest men among them also as soon as thei got to the place where their other boat lai thei ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore haul the boat up after them which i wa glad to see for i wa afraid thei would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distanc from the shore with some hand in her to guard her and so we should not be abl to seiz the boat be on shore the first thing thei did thei ran all to the other boat and it wa easi to see thei were under a great surpris to find her strip as abov of all that wa in her and a great hole in her bottom after thei had muse awhil upon thi thei set up two or three great shout halloo with all their might to try if thei could make their companion hear but all wa to no purpos then thei came all close in a ring and fire a vollei of their small arm which inde we heard and the echo made the wood ring but it wa all on those in the cave we were sure could not hear and those in our keep though thei heard it well enough yet durst give no answer to them thei were so astonish at the surpris of thi that as thei told us afterward thei resolv to go all on board again to their ship and let them know there that the men were all murder and the longboat stave accordingli thei immedi launch the boat again and got all of them on board the captain wa terribl amaz and even confound at thi believ thei would go on board the ship again and set sail give their comrad up for lost and so he should still lose the ship which he wa in hope we should have recov but he wa quickli as much fright the other wai thei had not been long put off with the boat but we perceiv them all come on shore again but with thi new measur in their conduct which it seem thei consult togeth upon viz to leav three men in the boat and the rest to go on shore and go up into the countri to look for their fellow thi wa a great disappoint to us for now we were at a loss what to do for our seiz those seven men on shore would be no advantag to us if we let the boat escap becaus thei would then row awai to the ship and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail and so our recov the ship would be lost howev we had no remedi but to wait and see what the issu of thing might present the seven men came on shore and the three who remain in the boat put her off to a good distanc from the shore and came to an anchor to wait for them so that it wa imposs for us to come at them in the boat those that came on shore kept close togeth march toward the top of the littl hill under which my habit lai and we could see them plainli though thei could not perceiv us we could have been veri glad thei would have come nearer to us so that we might have fire at them or that thei would have gone farther off that we might have come abroad but when thei were come to the brow of the hill where thei could see a great wai in the vallei and wood which lai toward the northeast part and where the island lai lowest thei shout and halloo till thei were weari and not care it seem to ventur far from the shore nor far from on anoth thei sat down togeth under a tree to consid of it had thei thought fit to have gone to sleep there as the other parti of them had done thei had done the job for us but thei were too full of apprehens of danger to ventur to go to sleep though thei could not tell what the danger wa thei had to fear neither the captain made a veri just propos to me upon thi consult of their viz that perhap thei would all fire a vollei again to endeavour to make their fellow hear and that we should all salli upon them just at the junctur when their piec were all discharg and thei would certainli yield and we should have them without bloodsh i like the propos provid it wa done while we heard when thei were present stop by the creek where the water be up thei could not get over and call for the boat to come up and set them over as inde i expect when thei had set themselv over i observ that the boat be gone up a good wai into the creek and as it were in a harbour within the land thei took on of the three men out of her to go along with them and left onli two in the boat have fasten her to the stump of a littl tree on the shore thi wa what i wish for and immedi leav fridai and the captain mate to their busi i took the rest with me and cross the creek out of their sight we surpriz the two men befor thei were awar on of them ly on shore and the other be in the boat the fellow on shore wa between sleep and wake and go to start up the captain who wa foremost ran in upon him and knock him down and then call out to him in the boat to yield or he wa a dead man there need veri few argument to persuad a singl man to yield when he saw five men upon him and hi comrad knock down besid thi wa it seem on of the three who were not so hearti in the mutini as the rest of the crew and therefor wa easili persuad not onli to yield but afterward to join veri sincer with us in the mean time fridai and the captain mate so well manag their busi with the rest that thei drew them by holloo and answer from on hill to anoth and from on wood to anoth till thei not onli heartili tire them but left them where thei were veri sure thei could not reach back to the boat befor it wa dark and inde thei were heartili tire themselv also by the time thei came back to us we had noth now to do but to watch for them in the dark and to fall upon them so as to make sure work with them it wa sever hour after fridai came back to me befor thei came back to their boat and we could hear the foremost of them long befor thei came quit up call to those behind to come along and could also hear them answer and complain how lame and tire thei were and not be abl to come ani faster which wa veri welcom new to us at length thei came up to the boat but it is imposs to express their confus when thei found the boat fast aground in the creek the tide eb out and their two men gone we could hear them call to on anoth in a most lament manner tell on anoth thei were gotten into an enchant island that either there were inhabit in it and thei should all be murder or els there were devil or spirit in it and thei should be all carri awai and devour thei halloo again and call their two comrad by their name a great mani time but no answer after some time we could see them by the littl light there wa run about wring their hand like men in despair and that sometim thei would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselv then come ashor and walk about again and so the same thing over again my men would fain have had me given them leav to fall upon them at onc in the dark but i wa will to take them at some advantag so to spare them and kill as few of them as i could and especi i wa unwil to hazard the kill ani of our men know the other men were veri well arm i resolv to wait to see if thei did not separ and therefor to make sure of them i drew my ambuscad nearer and order fridai and the captain to creep upon their hand and feet as close to the ground as thei could that thei might not be discov and get as near them as thei could possibl befor thei offer to fire thei had not been long in that postur till the boatswain who wa the princip ringlead of the mutini and had now shewn himself the most deject and dispirit of all the rest came walk toward them with two more of the crew the captain wa so eager at have the princip rogu so much in hi power that he could hardli have patienc to let him come so near as to be sure of him for thei onli heard hi tongu befor but when thei came nearer the captain and fridai start up on their feet let fly at them the boatswain wa kill upon the spot the next man wa shot in the bodi and fell just by him though he did not die till an hour or two after and the third ran for it at the nois of the fire i immedi advanc with my whole armi which wa now eight men viz myself generalissimo fridai my lieutenantgener the captain and hi two men and the three prison of war whom he had trust with arm we came upon them inde in the dark so that thei could not see our number and i made the man thei had left in the boat who wa now on of us to call them by name to try if i could bring them to a parlei and so might perhap reduc them to term which fell out just as we desir for inde it wa easi to think as their condit then wa thei would be verywil to capitul so he call out as loud as he could to on of them tom smith tom smith tom smith answer immedi who that robinson for it seem he knew hi voic the other answer ay ay for god sake tom smith throw down your arm and yield or you ar all dead men thi moment who must we yield to where ar thei sai smith again here thei ar sai he here is our captain and fifti men with him have been hunt you thi two hour the boatswain is kill will frye is wound and i am a prison and if you do not yield your ar all lost will thei give us quarter then sai tom smith and we will yieldil go and ask if you promis to yield sai robinson so he ask the captain and the captain himself then call out you smith you know my voic if you lai down your arm immedi and submit you shall have your live all but will atkin upon thi will atkin cri out for god sake captain give me quarter what have i done thei have been all as bad us i which by the wai wa not true either for it seem thi will atkin wa the first man that laid hold of the captain when thei first mutini and us him barbar in ty hi hand and give him injuri languag howev the captain told him he must lai down hi arm at discret and trust to the governor merci by which he meant me for thei all call me governor in a word thei all laid down their arm and beg their live and i sent the man that had parlei with them and two more who bound them all and then my great armi of fifti men which particularli with those three were all but eight came up and seiz upon them all and upon their boat onli that i kept myself and on more out of sight for reason of state our next work wa to repair the boat and to think of seiz the ship and as for the captain now he had leisur to parlei with them he expostul with them upon the villani of their practic with him and at length upon the farther wicked of their design and how certainli it must bring them to miseri and distress in the end and perhap to the gallow thei all appear veri penit and beg hard for their live as for that he told them thei were none of hi prison but the command of the island that thei thought thei had set him on shore in a barren uninhabit island but it had pleas god so to direct them that the island wa inhabit and that the governor wa an englishman that he might hang them all there if he pleas but as he had given them all quarter he suppos he would send them to england to be dealt with there as justic requir except atkin whom he wa command by the governor to advis to prepar for death for that he would be hang in the morn though thi wa all a fiction of hi own yet it had it desir effect atkin fell upon hi knee to beg the captain to interced with the governor for hi life and all the rest beg of him for god sake that thei might not be sent to england it now occur to me that the time of our deliver wa come and that it would be a most easi thing to bring these fellow in to be hearti in get possess of the ship so i retir in the dark from them that thei might not see what kind of a governor thei had and call the captain to me when i call as at a good distanc on of the men wa order to speak again and sai to the captain captain the command call for you and present the captain repli tell hi excel i am just acom thi more perfectli amus them and thei all believ that the command wa just by with hi fifti men upon the captain come to me i told him my project for seiz the ship which he like wonderfulli well and resolv to put it in execut the next morn but in order to execut it with more art and to be secur of success i told him we must divid the prison and that he should go and take atkin and two more of the worst of them and send them pinion to the cave where the other lai thi wa commit to fridai and the two men who came on shore with the captain thei convei them to the cave as to a prison and it wa inde a dismal place especi to men in their condit the other i order to my bower as i call it of which i have given a full descript and as it wa fenc in and thei pinion the place wa secur enough consid thei were upon their behaviour to these in the morn i sent the captain who wa to enter into a parlei with them in a word to try them and tell me whether he thought thei might be trust or no to go on board and surpris the ship he talk to them of the injuri done him of the condit thei were brought to and that though the governor had given them quarter for their live as to the present action yet that if thei were sent to england thei would all be hang in chain to be sure but that if thei would join in such an attempt as to recov the ship he would have the governor engag for their pardon ani on mai guess how readili such a propos would be accept by men in their condit thei fell down on their knee to the captain and promis with the deepest imprec that thei would be faith to him to the last drop and that thei should ow their live to him and would go with him all over the world that thei would own him for a father to them as long as thei live well sai the captain i must go and tell the governor what you sai and see what i can do to bring him to consent to it so he brought me an account of the temper he found them in and that he verili believ thei would be faith howev that we might be veri secur i told him he should go back again and choos out five of them and tell them that thei should see that thei did not want men but he would take out those five to be hi assist and that the governor would keep the other two and the three that were sent prison to the castl my cave as hostag for the fidel of those five and that if thei prove unfaith in the execut the five hostag should be hang in chain aliv upon the shore thi look sever and convinc them that the governor wa in earnest howev thei had no wai left them but to accept it and it wa now the busi of the prison as much as of the captain to persuad the other five to do their duti our strength wa now thu order for the expedit the captain hi mate and passeng then the two prison of the first gang to whom have their charact from the captain i had given their liberti and trust them with arm the other two whom i kept till now in my bower pinion but upon the captain motion had now releas these five releas at last so that thei were twelv in all besid five we kept prison in the cave for hostag i ask the captain if he wa will to ventur with these hand on board the ship for as for me and my man fridai i did not think it wa proper for us to stir have seven men left behind and it wa employ enough for us to keep them asund and suppli them with victual as to the five in the cave i resolv to keep them fast but fridai went twice a dai to them to suppli them with necessari and i made the other two carri provis to a certain distanc where fridai wa to take it when i shew myself to the two hostag it wa with the captain who told them i wa the person the governor had order to look after them and that it wa the governor pleasur that thei should not stir ani where but by my direct that if thei did thei should be fetch into the castl and be laid in iron so that as we never suffer them to see me as governor so i now appear as anoth person and spoke of the governor the garrison the castl and the like upon all occas the captain now had no difficulti befor him but to furnish hi two boat stop the breach of on and man them he made hi passeng captain of on with four other men and himself and hi mate and five more went in the other and thei contriv their busi veri well for thei came up to the ship about midnight as soon as thei came within call of the ship he made robinson hail them and tell them he had brought off the men and the boat but that it wa a long time befor thei had found them and the like hold them in a chat till thei came to the ship side when the captain and the mate enter first with their arm immedi knock down the second mate and carpent with the but end of their musket be veri faithfulli second by their men thei seem all the rest that were upon the main and quarter deck and began to fasten the hatch to keep them down who were below when the other boat and their men enter at the fore chain secur the forecastl of the ship and the skuttl which went down into the cookroom make three men thei found there prison when thi wa done and all safe upon the deck the captain order the mate with three men to break into the roundhous where the new rebel captain lai and have taken the alarm wa gotten up and with two men and a boi had gotten fire arm in their hand and when the mate with a crow split upon the door the new captain and hi men fire boldli among them and wound the mate with a musketbal which broke hi arm and wound two more of the men but kill nobodi the mate call for help rush howev into the roundhous wound as he wa and with hi pistol shot the new captain through the head the bullet enter at hi mouth and came out again behind on of hi ear so that he never spoke a word upon which the rest yield and the ship wa taken effectu without ani more live be lost as soon as the ship wa thu secur the captain order seven gun to be fire which wa the signal agre upon with me to give me notic of hi success which you mai be sure i wa veri glad to hear have sat watch upon the shore for it till near two of the clock in the morn have thu heard the signal plainli i laid me down and it have been a dai of great fatigu to me i slept veri sound till i wa someth surpris with the nois of a gun and present start up i heard a man call me by the name of governor governor and present i knew the captain voic when climb up to the top of the hill there he stood and point to the ship he embrac me in hi arm my dear friend and deliver sai he there your ship for she is all your and so ar we and all that belong to her i cast my ey to the ship and there she rode within a littl more than half a mile of the shore for thei had weigh her anchor as soon as thei were master of her and the weather be fair had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of a littl creek and the tide be up the captain had brought the pinnac in near the place where i first land my raft and so land just at my door i wa at first readi to sink down with the surpris for i saw my deliver inde visibl put into my hand all thing easi and a larg ship just readi to carri me awai whither i pleas to go at first for some time i wa not abl to answer on word but as he had taken me in hi arm i held fast by him or i should have fallen to the ground he perceiv the surpris and immedi pull a bottl out of hi pocket and gave me a dram of cordial which he had brought on purpos for me after i drank it i sat down upon the ground and though it brought me to myself yet it wa a good while befor i could speak a word to him all thi while the poor man wa in as great an ecstasi as i onli not under ani surpris as i wa and he said a thousand kind tender thing to me to compos and bring me to myself but such wa the flood of joi in my breast that it put all my spirit into confus at last it broke into tear and in a littl while after i recov my speech then i took my turn and embrac him as my deliver and we rejoic togeth i told him i look upon him as a man sent from heaven to deliv me and that the whole transact seem to be a chain of wonder that such thing as these were the testimoni we had of a secret hand of provid govern the world and an evid that the ey of an infinit power could search into the remotest corner of the world and send help to the miser whenev he pleas i forgot not to lift up my heart in thank to heaven and what heart could forbear to bless him who had not onli in a miracul manner provid for on in such a wilder and in such a desol condit but from whom everi deliver must alwai be acknowledg to proce when we had talk awhil the captain told me he had brought me some littl refresh such as the ship afford and such as the wretch who had been so long hi master had not plunder him of upon thi he call aloud to the boat and bid hi men bring the thing ashor that were for the governor and inde it wa a present as if i had been on not that i wa to be carri along with them but as if i had been to dwell upon the island still and thei were to go without me first he had brought me a case of bottl full of excel cordial water six larg bottl of madeira wine the bottl held two quart apiec two pound of excel good tobacco twelv good piec of the ship beef and six piec of pork with a bag of pea and about a hundr weight of biscuit he brought me also a box of sugar a box of flour a bag full of lemon and two bottl of limejuic and abund of other thing but besid these and what wa a thousand time more us to me he brought me six clean new shirt six veri good neckcloth two pair of glove on pair of shoe a hat and on pair of stock and a veri good suit of cloth of hi own which had been worn but veri littl in a word he cloth me from head to foot it wa a veri kind and agreeabl present as ani on mai imagin to on in my circumst but never wa ani thing in the world of that kind so unpleas awkward and uneasi as it wa to me to wear such cloth at their first put on after these ceremoni pass and after all hi thing were brought into my littl apart we began to consult what wa to be done with the prison we had for it wa worth consid whether we might ventur to take them awai with us or no especi two of them whom we knew to be incorrig and refractori to the last degre and the captain said he knew thei were such rogu that there wa no oblig them and if he did carri them awai it must be in iron as malefactor to be deliv over to justic at the first english coloni he could come at and i found that the captain himself wa veri anxiou about it upon thi i told him that if he desir it i durst undertak to bring the two men he spoke of to make their own request that he should leav them upon the island i should be veri glad of that sai the captain with all my heart well said i i will send for them and talk with them for you so i caus fridai and the two hostag for thei were now discharg their comrad have perform their promis i sai i caus them to go to the cave and bring up the five men pinion as thei were to the bower and keep them there till i came after some time i came thither dress in my new habit and now i wa call governor again be all met and the captain with me i caus the men to be brought befor me and i told them i had had a full account of their villan behaviour to the captain and how thei had run awai with the ship and were prepar to commit farther robberi but that provid had ensnar them in their own wai and that thei were fallen into the pit which thei had dig for other i let them know that by my direct the ship had been seiz that she lai now in the road and thei might see by and by that their new captain had receiv the reward of hi villani for that thei might see him hang at the yardarm that as to them i want to know what thei had to sai why i should not execut them as pirat taken in the fact as by my commiss thei could not doubt i had author to do on of them answer in the name of the rest that thei had noth to sai but thi that when thei were taken the captain promis them their live and thei humbl implor my merci but i told them i knew not what merci to shew them for as for myself i had resolv to quit the island with all my men and had taken passag with the captain to go for england and as for the captain he could not carri them to england other than as prison in iron to be tri for mutini and run awai with the ship the consequ of which thei must need know would be the gallow so that i could not tell which wa best for them unless thei had a mind to take their fate in the island if thei desir that i did not care as i had liberti to leav it i had some inclin to give them their live if thei thought thei could shift on shore thei seem veri thank for it said thei would much rather ventur to stai there than to be carri to england to be hang so i left it on that issu howev the captain seem to make some difficulti of it as if he durst not leav them there upon thi i seem to be a littl angri with the captain and told him that thei were my prison not hi and that see i had offer them so much favour i would be as good as my word and that if he did not think fit to consent to it i would set them at liberti as i found them and if he did not like that he might take them again if he could catch them upon thi thei appear veri thank and i accordingli set them at liberti and bade them retir into the wood to the place whenc thei came and i would leav them some firearm some ammunit and some direct how thei should live veri well if thei thought fit upon thi i prepar to go on board the ship but told the captain that i would stai that night to prepar my thing and desir him to go on board in the meantim and keep all right in the ship and send the boat on shore the next dai for me order him in the meantim to caus the new captain who wa kill to be hang at the yardarm that these men might see him when the captain wa gone i sent for the men up to me to my apart and enter serious into discours with them of their circumst i told them i thought thei had made a right choic that if the captain carri them awai thei would certainli be hang i shew them their captain hang at the yardarm of the ship and told them thei had noth less to expect when thei had all declar their willing to stai i then told them i would let them into the stori of my live there and put them into the wai of make it easi to them accordingli i gave them the whole histori of the place and of my come to it shew them my fortif the wai i made my bread plant my corn cure my grape and in a word all that wa necessari to make them easi i told them the stori of the sixteen spaniard that were to be expect for whom i left a letter and made them promis to treat them in common with themselv i left them my firearm viz five musket three fowlingpiec and three sword i had about a barrel of powder left for after the first year or two i us but littl and wast none i gave them a descript of the wai i manag the goat and direct to milk and fatten them to make both butter and chees in a word i gave them everi part of my own stori and i told them i would prevail with the captain to leav them two barrel of gunpowd more and some gardense which i told them i would have been veri glad of also i gave them the bag of pea which the captain had brought me to eat and bade them be sure to sow and increas them have done all thi i left them the next dai and went on board the ship we prepar immedi to sail but did not weigh that night the next morn earli two of the five men came swim to the ship side and make a most lament complaint of the other three beg to be taken into the ship for god sake for thei should be murder and beg the captain to take them on board though he hang them immedi upon thi the captain pretend to have no power without me but after some difficulti and after their solemn promis of amend thei were taken on board and were some time after soundli whip and pickl after which thei prove veri honest and quiet fellow some time after thi i went with the boat on shore the tide be up with the thing promis to the men to which the captain at my intercess caus their chest

when i look over these letter and especi when i found all my wealth about me for as the brasil ship come all in fleet the same ship which brought my letter brought my good and the effect were safe in the river befor the letter came to my hand in a word i turn pale and grew sick and had not the old man run and fetch me a cordial i believ the sudden surpriz of joi had overset natur and i had di upon the spot nai after that i continu veri ill and wa so some hour till a physician be sent for and someth of the real caus of my ill be known he order me to be let blood after which i had relief and grew well but i verili believ if it had not been eas by a vent given in that manner to the spirit i should have di i wa now master all on a sudden of abov l sterl in monei and had an estat as i might well call it in the brasil of abov a thousand pound a year as sure as an estat of land in england and in a word i wa in a condit which i scarc knew how to understand or how to compos my self for the enjoy of it the first thing i did wa to recompens my origin benefactor my good old captain who had been first charit to me in my distress kind to me in my begin and honest to me at the end i shew him all that wa sent me i told him that next to the provid of heaven which dispos all thing it wa ow to him and that it now lai on me to reward him which i would do a hundr fold so i first return to him the hundr moidor i had receiv of him then i sent for a notari and caus him to draw up a gener releas or discharg for the moidor which he had acknowledg he ow me in the fullest and firmest manner possibl after which i caus a procur to be drawn impow him to be my receiv of the annual profit of my plantat and appoint my partner to account to him and make the return by the usual fleet to him in my name and a claus in the end be a grant of moidor a year to him dure hi life out of the effect and moidor a year to hi son after him for hi life and thu i requit my old man i wa now to consid which wai to steer my cours next and what to do with the estat that provid had thu put into my hand and inde i had more care upon my head now than i had in my silent state of life in the island where i want noth but what i had and had noth but what i want wherea i had now a great charg upon me and my busi wa how to secur it i had neer a cave now to hide my monei in or a place where it might lie without lock or kei till it grew mouldi and tarnish befor ani bodi would meddl with it on the contrari i knew not where to put it or who to trust with it my old patron the captain inde wa honest and that wa the onli refug i had in the next place my interest in the brasil seem to summon me thither but now i could not tell how to think of go thither till i had settl my affair and left my effect in some safe hand behind me at first i thought of my old friend the widow who i knew wa honest and would be just to me but then she wa in year and but poor and for ought i knew might be in debt so that in a word i had no wai but to go back to england my self and take my effect with me it wa some month howev befor i resolv upon thi and therefor as i had reward the old captain fulli and to hi satisfact who had been my former benefactor so i began to think of my poor widow whose husband had been my first benefactor and she while it wa in her power my faith steward and instructor so the first thing i did i got a merchant in lisbon to write to hi correspond in london not onli to pai a bill but to go find her out and carri her in monei an hundr pound from me and to talk with her and comfort her in her poverti by tell her she should if i live have a further suppli at the same time i sent my two sister in the countri each of them an hundr pound thei be though not in want yet not in veri good circumst on have been marri and left a widow and the other have a husband not so kind to her as he should be but among all my relat or acquaint i could not yet pitch upon on to whom i durst commit the gross of my stock that i might go awai to the brasil and leav thing safe behind me and thi greatli perplex me i had onc a mind to have gone to the brasil and have settl my self there for i wa as it were natur to the place but i had some littl scrupl in my mind about religion which insens drew me back of which i shall sai more present howev it wa not religion that kept me from go thither for the present and as i had made no scrupl of be openli of the religion of the countri all the while i wa among them so neither did i yet onli that now and then have of late thought more of it than formerli when i began to think of live and dy among them i began to regret my have profess myself a papist and thought it might not be the best religion to die in but as i have said thi wa not the main thing that kept me from go to the brasil but that realli i did not know with whom to leav my effect behind me so i resolv at last to go to england with them where if i arriv i conclud i should make some acquaint or find some relat that would be faith to me and accordingli i prepar to go for england with all my wealth in order to prepar thing for my go home i first the brasil fleet be just go awai resolv to give answer suitabl to the just and faith account of thing i had from thenc and first to the prior of st augustin i wrote a letter full of thank for hi just deal and the offer of the eight hundr and seventytwo moidor which wa undispos of which i desir might be given five hundr to the monasteri and three hundr and seventytwo to the poor as the prior should direct desir the good padr prayer for me and the like i wrote next a letter of thank to my two truste with all the acknowledg that so much justic and honesti call for as for send them ani present thei were far abov have ani occas of it lastli i wrote to my partner acknowledg hi industri in the improv the plantat and hi integr in increas the stock of the work give him instruct for hi futur govern of my part accord to the power i had left with my old patron to whom i desir him to send whatev becam due to me till he should hear from me more particularli assur him that it wa my intent not onli to come to him but to settl myself there for the remaind of my life to thi i ad a veri handsom present of some italian silk for hi wife and two daughter for such the captain son inform me he had with two piec of fine english broadcloth the best i could get in lisbon five piec of black bai and some flander lace of a good valu have thu settl my affair sold my cargo and turn all my effect into good bill of exchang my next difficulti wa which wai to go to england i had been accustom enough to the sea and yet i had a strang avers to go to england by sea at that time and though i could give no reason for it yet the difficulti increas upon me so much that though i had onc ship my baggag in order to go yet i alter my mind and that not onc but two or three time it is true i had been veri unfortun by sea and thi might be on of the reason but let no man slight the strong impuls of hi own thought in case of such moment two of the ship which i had singl out to go in i mean more particularli singl out than ani other that is to sai so as in on of them to put my thing on board and in the other to have agre with the captain i sai two of these ship miscarri viz on wa taken by the algerin and the other wa cast awai on the start near torbai and all the peopl drown except three so that in either of those vessel i had been made miser and in which most it wa hard to sai have been thu harass in my thought my old pilot to whom i commun everi thing press me earnestli not to go to sea but either to go by land to the groyn and cross over the bai of biscai to rochel from whenc it wa but an easi and safe journei by land to pari and so to calai and dover or to go up to madrid and so all the wai by land through franc in a word i wa so prepossess against my go by sea at all except from calai to dover that i resolv to travel all the wai by land which as i wa not in hast and did not valu the charg wa by much the pleasant wai and to make it more so my old captain brought an english gentleman the son of a merchant in lisbon who wa will to travel with me after which we pick up two who were english and merchant also and two young portugues gentlemen the last go to pari onli so that we were in all six of us and five servant the two merchant and the two portugues content themselv with on servant between two to save the charg and as for me i got an english sailor to travel with me as a servant besid my man fridai who wa too much a stranger to be capabl of suppli the place of a servant upon the road in thi manner i set out from lisbon and our compani be all veri well mount and arm we made a littl troop whereof thei did me the honour to call me captain as well becaus i wa the oldest man as becaus i had two servant and inde wa the origin of the whole journei as i have troubl you with none of my sea journal so shall i troubl you with none of my land journal but some adventur that happen to us in thi tediou and difficult journei i must not omit when we came to madrid we be all of us stranger to spain were will to stai some time to sec the court of spain and to see what wa worth observ but it be the latter part of the summer we hasten awai and set out from madrid about the middl of octob but when we came to the edg of navarr we were alarm at sever town on the wai with an account that so much snow wa fallen on the french side of the mountain that sever travel were oblig to come back to pampeluna after have attempt at an extrem hazard to pass on when we came to pampeluna itself we found it so inde and to me that had been alwai us to a hot climat and inde to countri where we could scarc bear ani cloth on the cold wa insuffer nor inde wa it more pain than it wa surpris to come but ten dai befor out of the old castil where the weather wa not onli warm but veri hot and immedi to feel a wind from the pyrene mountain so veri keen so sever cold as to be intoler and to endang benumb and perish of our finger and toe wa veri strang poor fridai wa realli fright when he saw the mountain all cover with snow and felt cold weather which he had never seen or felt befor in hi life to mend the matter after we came to pampeluna it continu snow with so much violenc and so long that the peopl said winter wa come befor it time and the road which were difficult befor were now quit impass in a word the snow lai in some place too thick for us to travel and be not hard frozen as is the case in northern countri there wa no go without be in danger of be buri aliv everi step we staid no less than twenti dai at pampeluna when see the winter come on and no likelihood of it be better for it wa the severest winter all over europ that had been known in mani year propos that we should all go awai to fontarabia and there take ship for boardeaux which wa a veri littl voyag but while we were consid thi there came in four french gentlemen who have been stop on the french side of the pass as we were on the spanish had found out a guid who travers the countri near the head of languedoc had brought them over the mountain by such wai that thei were not much incommod with the snow and where thei met with snow in ani quantiti thei said it wa frozen hard enough to bear them and their hors we sent for thi guid who told us he would undertak to carri us the same wai with no hazard from the snow provid we were arm suffici to protect us from wild beast for he said upon these great snow it wa frequent for some wolv to show themselv at the foot of the mountain be made raven for want of food the ground be cover with snow we told him we were well enough prepar for such creatur as thei were if he would ensur us from a kind of twoleg wolv which we were told we were in most danger from especi on the french side of the mountain he satisfi us there wa no danger of that kind in the wai that we were to go so we readili agre to follow him as did also twelv other gentlemen with their servant some french some spanish who as i said had attempt to go and were oblig to come back again accordingli we all set out from pampeluna with our guid on the fifteenth of novemb and inde i wa surpris when instead of go forward he came directli back with us on the same road that we came from madrid abov twenti mile when have pass two river and come into the plain countri we found ourselv in a warm climat again where the countri wa pleasant and no snow to be seen but on a sudden turn to the left he approach the mountain anoth wai and though it is true the hill and the precipic look dreadfulli yet he made so mani tour such meander and led us by such wind wai we insens pass the height of the mountain without be much encumb with the snow and all on a sudden he shew us the pleasant fruit provinc of languedoc and gascoign all green and flourish though inde thei were at a great distanc and we had some rough wai to pass yet we were a littl uneasi howev when we found it snow on whole dai and a night so fast that we could not travel but he bid us be easi we should soon be past it all we found inde that we began to descend everi dai and to come more north than befor and so depend upon our guid we went on it wa about two hour befor night when our guid be someth befor us and not just in sight out rush three monstrou wolv and after them a bear out of a hollow wai adjoin to a thick wood two of the wolv flew upon the guid and had he been half a mile befor us he had been devour inde befor we could have help him on of them fasten upon hi hors and the other attack the man with that violenc that he had not time or not presenc of mind enough to draw hi pistol but halloo and cri out to us most lustili my man fridai be next to me i bid him ride up and see what wa the matter as soon as fridai came in sight of the man he halloo as loud as the other o master o master but like a bold fellow rode directli up to the man and with hi pistol shot the wolf that attack him in the head it wa happi for the poor man that it wa my man fridai for he have been us to that kind of creatur in hi countri had no fear upon him but went close up to him and shot him as abov wherea ani of us would have fire at a farther distanc and have perhap either miss the wolf or endang shoot the man but it wa enough to have terrifi a bolder man than i and inde it alarm all our compani when with the nois of fridai pistol we heard on both side the dismallest howl of wolv and the nois redoubl by the echo of the mountain that it wa to us as if there had been a prodigi multitud of them and perhap inde there wa not such a few as that we had no caus of apprehens howev as fridai had kill thi wolf the other that had fasten upon the hors left him immedi and fled have happili fasten upon hi head where the boss of the bridl had stuck in hi teeth so that he had not done him much hurt the man inde wa most hurt for the rage creatur had bit him twice onc on the arm and the other time a littl abov hi knee and he wa just as it were tumbl down by the disord of the hors when fridai came up and shot the wolf it is easi to suppos that at the nois of fridai pistol we all mend our pace and rid up as fast as the wai which wa veri difficult would give us leav to see what wa the matter as soon as we came clear of the tree which blind us befor we saw plainli what had been the case and how fridai had disengag the poor guid though we did not present discern what kind of creatur it wa he had kill but never wa a fight manag so hardili and in such a surpris manner as that which follow between fridai and the bear which gave us all though at first we were surpris and afraid for him the greatest divers imagin as the bear is a heavi clumsi creatur and doe not gallop as the wolf doe which is swift and light so he ha two particular qualiti which gener ar the rule of hi action first as to men who ar not hi proper prei i sai not hi proper prei becaus though i cant sai what excess hunger might do which wa now their case the ground be all cover with snow yet as to men he doe not usual attempt them unless thei first attack him on the contrari if you meet him in the wood if you dont meddl with him he wont meddl with you yet then you must take care to be veri civil to him and give him the road for he is a veri nice gentleman he wont go a step out of the wai for a princ nai if you ar realli afraid your best wai is to look anoth wai and keep go on for sometim if you stop and stand still and look steadfastli at him he take it for an affront and if you throw or toss ani thing at him and it hit him though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger he take it for an affront and set all other busi asid to pursu hi reveng for he will have satisfact in point of honour and thi is hi first qualiti the next is that if he be onc affront he will never leav you night or dai till he ha hi reveng but follow at a good round rate till he overtak you my man fridai had deliv our guid and when we came up to him he wa help him off from hi hors for the man wa both hurt and fright and inde the last more than the first when on a sudden we espi the bear come out of the wood and a veri monstrou on it wa the biggest by far that ever i saw we were all a littl surpris when we saw him but when fridai saw him it wa easi to see joi and courag in the fellow counten o o o sai fridai three time point to him o master you give me te leav me shake te hand with him me make you good laugh i wa surpris to see the fellow so pleas you fool you said i he will eat you upeate me up eate me up sai fridai twice over again me eate him up me make you good laugh you all stai here me shew you good laugh so down he sit and get hi boot off in a moment and put on a pair of pump as we call the flat shoe thei wear and which he had in hi pocket and give my other servant hi hors and with hi gun awai he flew swift like the wind the bear wa walk softli on and offer to meddl with nobodi till fridai come pretti near call to him as if the bear could understand him hark ye hark ye sai fridai me speake wit you we follow at a distanc for now be come down to the gascoign side of the mountain we were enter a vast great forest where the countri wa plain and pretti open though mani tree in it scatter here and there fridai who had as we sai the heel of the bear came up with him quickli and take up a great stone and throw at him and hit him just on the head but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall but it answer fridai end for the rogu wa so void of fear that he did it pure to make the bear follow him and shew us some laugh as he call it as soon as the bear felt the stone and saw him he turn about and come after him take devilish long stride and stroll along at a strang rate so as he would put a hors to a middl gallop awai run fridai and take hi cours as if he ran toward us for help so we all resolv to fire at onc upon the bear and deliv my man though i wa angri at him heartili for bring the bear back upon us when he wa go about hi own busi anoth wai and especi i wa angri that he had turn the bear upon us and then run awai and i call out you dog said i is thi your make us laugh come awai and take your hors that we mai shoot the creatur he hear me and cri out no shoot no shoot stand still you get much laugh and as the nimbl creatur ran two feet for the beast on he turn on a sudden on on side of us and see a great oak tree fit for hi purpos he beckon us to follow and doubl hi pace he get nimbl up the tree lai hi gun down upon the ground at about five or six yard from the bottom of the tree the bear soon came to the tree and we follow at a distanc the first thing he did he stop at the gun smelt to it but let it lie and up he scrambl into the tree climb like a cat though so monstrou heavi i wa amaz at the folli as i thought it of my man and could not for my life see ani thing to laugh at yet till see the bear get up the tree we all rode nearer to him when we came to the tree there wa fridai got out to the small of a larg limb of the tree and the bear got about half wai to him as soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree wa weaker ha sai he to us now you see me teache the bear danc so he fall ajump and shake the bough at which the bear began to totter but stood still and began to look behind him to see how he should get back then inde we did laugh heartili but fridai had not done with him by a great deal when he see him stand still he call out to him again as if he had suppos the bear could speak english what you come no farther prai you come farther so he left jump and shake the bough and the bear just as if he understood what he said did come a littl farther then he fell ajump again and the bear stop again we thought now wa a good time to knock him on the head and call to fridai to stand still and we would shoot the bear but he cri out earnestli o prai o prai no shoot me shoot by and then he would have said by and by howev to shorten the stori fridai danc so much and the bear stood so ticklish that we had laugh enough inde but still could not imagin what the fellow would do for first we thought he depend upon shake the bear off and we found the bear wa too cun for that too for he would not get out far enough to be thrown down but cling fast with hi great broad claw and feet so that we could not imagin what would be the end of it and where the jest would be at last but fridai put us out of doubt quickli for see the bear cling fast to the bough and that he would not be persuad to come ani farther well well said fridai you no come farther me go me go you no come to me me come to you and upon thi he goe out to the smallest end of the bough where it would bend with hi weight and gentli let himself down by it slide down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on hi feet and awai he ran to hi gun take it up and stand still well said i to him fridai what will you do now why dont you shoot himno shoot sai fridai no yet me shoot now me no kill me stai give you on more laugh and inde so he did as you will see present for when the bear saw hi enemi gone he come back from the bough where he stood but did it mighti leisur look behind him everi step and come backward till he got into the bodi of the tree then with the same hinder end foremost he came down the tree grasp it with hi claw and move on foot at a time veri leisur at thi junctur and just befor he could set hi hind feet upon the ground fridai step close to him clap the muzzl of hi piec into hi ear and shot him as dead as a stone then the rogu turn about to see if we did not laugh and when he saw we were pleas by our look he fall alaugh himself veri loud so we kill bear in my countri sai fridai so you kill them said i why you have no gunsno sai he no gun but shoot great much long arrow thi wa inde a good divers to us but we were still in a wild place and our guid veri much hurt and what to do we hardli knew the howl of wolv ran much in my head and inde except the nois i onc heard on the shore of africa of which i have said someth alreadi i never heard ani thing that fill me with so much horror these thing and the approach of night call us off or els as fridai would have had us we should certainli have taken the skin of thi monstrou creatur off which wa worth save but we had three leagu to go and our guid hasten us so we left him and went forward on our journei the ground wa still cover with snow though not so deep and danger as on the mountain and the raven creatur as we heard afterward were come down into the forest and plain countri press by hunger to seek for food and had done a great deal of mischief in the villag where thei surpris the countrypeopl kill a great mani of their sheep and hors and some peopl too we had on danger place to pass of which our guid told us if there were ani more wolv in the countri we should find them there and thi wa a small plain surround with wood on everi side and a long narrow defil or lane which we were to pass to get through the wood and then we should come to the villag where we were to lodg it wa within half an hour of sunset when we enter the first wood and a littl after sunset when we came into the plain we met with noth in the first wood except that in a littl plain within the wood which wa not abov two furlong over we saw five great wolv cross the road full speed on after anoth as if thei had been in chase of some prei and had it in view thei took no notic of us and were gone and out of sight in a few moment upon thi our guid who by the wai wa a wretch faintheart fellow bade us keep in a readi postur for he believ there were more wolv acom we kept our arm readi and our ey about us but we saw no more wolv till we came through that wood which wa near half a leagu and enter the plain as soon as we came into the plain we had occas enough to look about us the first object we met with wa a dead hors that is to sai a poor hors which the wolv had kill and at least a dozen of them at work we could not sai eat of him but pick of hi bone rather for thei had eaten up all the flesh befor we did not think fit to disturb them at their feast neither did thei take much notic of us fridai would have let fly at them but i would not suffer him by ani mean for i found we were like to have more busi upon our hand than we were awar of we were not half gone over the plain but we began to hear the wolv howl in the wood on our left in a fright manner and present after we saw about a hundr come on directli toward us all in a bodi and most of them in a line as regularli as an armi drawn up by experienc offic i scarc knew in what manner to receiv them but found to draw ourselv in a close line wa the onli wai so we form in a moment but that we might not have too much interv i order that onli everi other man should fire and that the other who had not fire should stand readi to give them a second vollei immedi if thei continu to advanc upon us and that then those who had fire at first should not pretend to load their fusil again but stand readi with everi on a pistol for we were all arm with a fusil and a pair of pistol each man so we were by thi method abl to fire six volli half of us at a time howev at present we had no necess for upon fire the first vollei the enemi made a full stop be terrifi as well with the nois as with the fire four of them be shot in the head drop sever other were wound and went bleed off as we could see by the snow i found thei stop but did not immedi retreat whereupon rememb that i had been told that the fiercest creatur were terrifi at the voic of a man i caus all our compani to halloo as loud as we could and i found the notion not altogeth mistaken for upon our shout thei began to retir and turn about then i order a second vollei to be fire in their rear which put them to the gallop and awai thei went to the wood thi gave us leisur to charg our piec again and that we might lose no time we kept do but we had but littl more than load our fusil and put ourselv into a readi when we heard a terribl nois in the same wood on our left onli that it wa farther onward the same wai we were to go the night wa come on and the night began to be duski which made it the wors on our side but the nois increas we could easili perceiv that it wa the howl and yell of those hellish creatur and on a sudden we perceiv two or three troop of wolv on our left on behind us and on on our front so that we seem to be surround with them howev as thei did not fall upon us we kept our wai forward as fast as we could make our hors go which the wai be veri rough wa onli a good larg trot and in thi manner we onli came in view of the entranc of the wood through which we were to pass at the farther side of the plain but we were greatli surpris when come near the lane or pass we saw a confus number of wolv stand just at the entranc on a sudden at anoth open of the wood we heard the nois of a gun and look that wai out rush a hors with a saddl and a bridl on him fly like the wind and sixteen or seventeen wolv after him full speed inde the hors had the heel of them but as we suppos that he could not hold it at that rate we doubt not but thei would get up with him at last and no question but thei did here we had a most horribl sight for ride up to the entranc where the hors came out we found the carcass of anoth hors and of two men devour by these raven creatur and of on the man wa no doubt the same whom we heard fire a gun for there lai a gun just by him fire off but as to the man hi head and the upper part of hi bodi were eaten up thi fill us with horror and we knew not what cours to take but the creatur resolv us soon for thei gather about us present in hope of prei and i verili believ there were three hundr of them it happen veri much to our advantag that at the entranc into the wood but a littl wai from it there by some larg timber tree which had been cut down the summer befor and i suppos lai there for carriag i drew my littl troop in among these tree and place ourselv in a line behind on long tree i advis them all to alight and keep that tree befor us for a breastwork to stand in a triangl or three front enclos our hors in the centr we did so and it wa well we did for never wa a more furiou charg than the creatur made upon us in thi place thei came on us with a growl kind of a nois and mount the piec of timber which as i said wa our breastwork as if thei were onli rush upon their prei and thi furi of their it seem wa princip occas by their see our hors behind us which wa the prei thei aim at i order our men to fire as befor everi man and thei took their aim so sure that inde thei kill sever of the wolv at the first vollei but there wa a necess to keep a continu fire for thei came on like devil those behind push on those befor when we had fire our second vollei of fusil we thought thei stop a littl and i hope thei would have gone off but it wa but a moment for other came forward again so we fire our volli of pistol and i believ in these four fire we kill seventeen or eighteen of them and lame twice as mani yet thei came on again i wa loath to spend our last shot too hastili so i call my servant not my man fridai for he wa better emploi for with the greatest dexter imagin he charg my fusil and hi own while we were engag but as i said i call my other man and give him a horn of powder i bade him lai a train all along the piec of timber and let it be a larg train he did so and had but time to get awai when the wolv came up to it and some were got up upon it when i snap an uncharg pistol close to the powder set it on fire and those that were upon the timber were scorch with it and six or seven of them fell or rather jump in among us with the forc and fright of the fire we dispatch these in an instant and the rest were so fright with the light which the night for now it wa veri near dark made more terribl that thei drew back a littl upon which i order our last pistol to be fire off in on vollei and after that we gave a shout upon thi the wolv turn tail and we salli immedi upon near twenti lame on which we found struggl on the ground and fell acut them with our sword which answer our expect for the cry and howl thei made were better understood by their fellow so that thei fled and left us we had first and last kill about three score of them and had it been daylight we had kill mani more the field of battl be thu clear we made forward again for we had still near a leagu to go we heard the raven creatur howl and yell in the wood as we went sever time and sometim we fanci we saw some of them but the snow dazzl our ey we were not certain so in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodg which we found in a terribl fright and all in arm for it seem that the night befor the wolv and some bear had broken into that villag and put them in a terribl fright and thei were oblig to keep guard night and dai but especi in the night to preserv their cattl and inde their peopl the next morn our guid wa so ill and hi limb so swell with the rankl of hi two wound that he could go no farther so we were oblig to take a new guid there and go to tholous where we found a warm climat a fruit pleasant countri and no snow no wolv or ani thing like them but when we told our stori at tholous thei told us it wa noth but what wa ordinari in the great forest at the foot of the mountain especi when the snow lai on the ground but thei inquir much what kind of a guid we had gotten that would ventur to bring us that wai in such a sever season and told us it wa veri much we were not all devour when we told them how we place ourselv and the hors in the middl thei blame us exceedingli and told us it wa fifti to on but we had been all destroi for it wa the sight of the hors that made the wolv so furiou see their prei and that at other time thei ar realli afraid of a gun but thei be excess hungri and rage on that account the eager to come at the hors had made them senseless of danger and that if we had not by the continu fire and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder master them it had been great odd but that we had been torn to piec wherea had we been content to have sat still on horseback and fire as horsemen thei would not have taken the hors so much for their own when men were on their back as otherwis and withal thei told us that at last if we had stood all togeth and left our hors thei would have been so eager to have devour them that we might have come off safe especi have our firearm in our hand and be so mani in number for my part i wa never so sensibl of danger in my life for see abov three hundr devil come roar and openmouth to devour us and have noth to shelter us or retreat to i gave myself over for lost and as it wa i believ i shall never care to cross those mountain again i think i would much rather go a thousand leagu by sea though i were sure to meet with a storm onc a week i have noth uncommon to take notic of in my passag through franc noth but what other travel have given an account of with much more advantag than i can i travel from tholous to pari and without ani consider stai came to calai and land safe at dover the fourteenth of januari after have had a sever cold season to travel in i wa now come to the centr of my travel and had in a littl time all my newdiscov estat safe about me the bill of exchang which i brought with me have been veri current paid my princip guid and privycounsellor wa my good ancient widow who in gratitud for the monei i had sent her thought no pain too much or care too great to emploi for me and i trust her so entir with everi thing that i wa perfectli easi as to the secur of my effect and inde i wa veri happi from my begin and now to the end in the unspot integr of thi good gentlewoman and now i began to think of leav my effect with thi woman and set out for lisbon and so to the brasil but now anoth scrupl came in the wai and that wa religion for as i had entertain some doubt about the roman religion even while i wa abroad especi in my state of solitud so i knew there wa no go to the brasil for me much less go to settl there unless i resolv to embrac the roman cathol religion without ani reserv except on the other hand i resolv to be a sacrific to my principl be a martyr for religion and die in the inquisit so i resolv to stai at home and if i could find mean for it to dispos of my plantat to thi purpos i wrote to my old friend at lisbon who in return gave me notic that he could easili dispos of it there but that if i thought fit to give him leav to offer it in my name to the two merchant the survivor of my truste who live in the brasil who must fulli understand the valu of it who live just upon the spot and who i knew to be veri rich so that he believ thei would be fond of bui it he did not doubt but i should make or piec of eight the more of it accordingli i agre gave him order to offer it to them and he did so and in about eight month more the ship be then return he sent me an account that thei had accept the offer and had remit piec of eight to a correspond of their at lisbon to pai for it in return i sign the instrument of sale in the form which thei sent from lisbon and sent it to my old man who sent me the bill of exchang for piec of eight for the estat reserv the payment of moidor a year to him the old man dure hi life and moidor afterward to hi son for hi life which i had promis them and which the plantat wa to make good as a rent charg and thu i have given the first part of a life of fortun and adventur a life of provid chequerwork and of a varieti which the world will seldom be abl to shew the like of begin foolishli but close much more happili than ani part of it ever gave me leav to much as to hope for ani on would think that in thi state of complic good fortun i wa past run ani more hazard and so inde i had been if other circumst had concur but i wa inur to a wander life had no famili nor mani relat nor howev rich had i contract much acquaint and though i had sold my estat in the brasil yet i could not keep that countri out of my head and had a great mind to be upon the wing again especi i could not resist the strong inclin i had to see my island and to know if the poor spaniard were in be there and how the rogu i left there had us them my true friend the widow earnestli dissuad me from it and so far prevail with me that almost for seven year she prevent my run abroad dure which time i took my two nephew the children of on of my brother into my care the eldest have someth of hi own i bred up as a gentleman and gave him a settlement of some addit to hi estat after my deceas the other i put out to a captain of a ship and after five year find him a sensibl bold enterpris young fellow i put him into a good ship and sent him to sea and thi young fellow afterward drew me in as old as i wa to farther adventur myself in the meantim i in part settl myself here for first of all i marri and that not either to my disadvantag or dissatisfact and had three children two son and on daughter but my wife dy and my nephew come home with good success from a voyag to spain my inclin to go abroad and hi importun prevail and engag me to go in hi ship as a privat trader to the east indi thi in the year in thi voyag i visit my new coloni in the island saw my successor the spaniard had the whole stori of their live and of the villain i left there how at first thei insult the poor spaniard how thei afterward agre disagre unit separ and how at last the spaniard were oblig to us violenc with them how thei were subject to the spaniard how honestli the spaniard us them an histori if it were enter into as full of varieti and wonder accid as my own part particularli also as to their battl with the caribbean who land sever time upon the island and as to the improv thei made upon the island itself and how five of them made an attempt upon the main land and brought awai eleven men and five women prison by which at my come i found about twenti young children on the island here i stai about twenti dai left them suppli of all necessari thing and particularli of arm powder shot cloth tool and two workmen which i brought from england with me viz a carpent and a smith besid thi i share the land into part with them reserv to myself the properti of the whole but gave them such part respect as thei agre on and have settl all thing with them and engag them not to leav the place i left them there from thenc i touch at the brasil from whenc i sent a bark which i bought there with more peopl to the island and in it besid other suppli i sent seven women be such as i found proper for servic or for wive to such as would take them as for the englishmen i promis them to send them some women from england with a good cargo of necessari if thei would appli themselv to plant which i afterward could not perform the fellow prove veri honest and dilig after thei were master and had their properti set apart for them i sent them also from the brasil five cow three of them be big with calf some sheep and some hog which when i came again were consider increas but all these thing with an account how three hundr caribbe came and invad them and ruin their plantat and how thei fought with that whole number twice and were at first defeat and some of them kill but at last a storm destroi their enemi cano thei famish or destroi almost all the rest and renew and recov the possess of their plantat and still live upon the island all these thing with some veri surpris incid in some new adventur of my own for ten year more i mai perhap give a further account of hereaft that home proverb us on so mani occas in england viz that what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh wa never more verifi than in the stori of my life ani on would think that after thirtyf year afflict and a varieti of unhappi circumst which few men if ani ever went through befor and after near seven year of peac and enjoy in the ful of all thing grown old and when if ever it might be allow me to have had experi of everi state of middl life and to know which wa most adapt to make a man complet happi i sai after all thi ani on would have thought that the nativ propens to rambl which i gave an account of in my first set out into the world to have been so predomin in my thought should be worn out the volatil part be fulli evacu or at least condens and i might at sixtyon year of ag have been a littl inclin to stai at home and have done ventur life and fortun ani more nai farther the common motiv of foreign adventur wa taken awai in me for i had no fortun to make i had noth to seek if i had gain ten thousand pound i had been no richer for i had alreadi suffici for me and for those i had to leav it to and that i had wa visibl increas for have no great famili i could not spend the incom of what i had unless i would set up for an expens wai of live such as a great famili servant equipag gaieti and the like which were thing i had no notion of or inclin to so that i had noth inde to do but to sit still and fulli enjoi what i had got and see it increas daili upon my hand yet all these thing had no effect upon me or at least not enough to resist the strong inclin i had to go abroad again which hung about me like a chronic distemp particularli the desir of see my new plantat in the island and the coloni i left there ran in my head continu i dream of it all night and my imagin ran upon it all dai it wa uppermost in all my thought and my fanci work so steadili and strongli upon it that i talk of it in my sleep in short noth could remov it out of my mind it even broke so violent into all my discours that it made my convers tiresom for i could talk of noth els all my discours ran into it even to impertin and i saw it myself i have often heard person of good judgment sai that all the stir peopl make in the world about ghost and apparit is ow to the strength of imagin and the power oper of fanci in their mind that there is no such thing as a spirit appear or a ghost walk and the like that peopl pore affection upon the past convers of their deceas friend so realiz it to them that thei ar capabl of fanci upon some extraordinari circumst that thei see them talk to them and ar answer by them when in truth there is noth but shadow and vapour in the thing and thei realli know noth of the matter for my part i know not to thi hour whether there ar ani such thing as real apparit spectr or walk of peopl after thei ar dead or whether there is ani thing in the stori thei tell us of that kind more than the product of vapour sick mind and wander fanci but thi i know that my imagin work up to such a height and brought me into such excess of vapour or what els i mai call it that i actual suppos myself oftentim upon the spot at my old castl behind the tree saw my old spaniard fridai father and the reprob sailor whom i left upon the island nai i fanci i talk with them and look at them so steadili though i wa broad awak as at person just befor me and thi i did till i often frighten myself with the imag my fanci repres to me on time in my sleep i had the villani of the three pirat sailor so live relat to me by the first spaniard and fridai father that it wa surpris thei told me how thei barbar attempt to murder all the spaniard and that thei set fire to the provis thei had laid up on purpos to distress and starv them thing that i had never heard of and that were yet all of them true in fact but it wa so warm in my imagin and so realiz to me that to the hour i saw them i could not be persuad but that it wa or would be true also how i resent it when the spaniard complain to me and how i brought them to justic tri them befor me and order them all three to be hang what there wa realli in thi shall be seen in it place for howev i came to form such thing in my dream and what secret convers of spirit inject it yet there wa i sai veri much of it true i own that thi dream had noth liter and specif true but the gener part wa so true the base and villan behaviour of these three harden rogu wa such and had been so much wors than all i can describ that the dream had too much similitud of the fact and as i would afterward have punish them sever so if i had hang them all i had been much in the right and should have been justifi both by the law of god and man but to return to my storyin thi kind of temper i had live some year i had no enjoy of my life no pleasant hour no agreeabl divers but what had someth or other of thi in it so that my wife who saw my mind so wholli bent upon it told me veri serious on night that she believ there wa some secret power impuls of provid upon me which had determin me to go thither again and that she found noth hinder my go but my be engag to a wife and children she told me that it wa true she could not think of part with me but as she wa assur that if she wa dead it would be the first thing i would do so as it seem to her that the thing wa determin abov she would not be the onli obstruct for if i thought fit and resolv to goher she found me veri intent upon her word and that i look veri earnestli at her so that it a littl disord her and she stop i ask her why she did not go on and sai out what she wa go to sai but i perceiv her heart wa too full and some tear stood in her ey speak out my dear said i ar you will i should gono sai she veri affection i am far from will but if you ar resolv to go sai she and rather than i will be the onli hindranc i will go with you for though i think it a preposter thing for on of your year and in your condit yet if it must be said she again weep i wont leav you for if it be of heaven you must do it there is no resist it and if heaven make it your duti to go he will also make it mine to go with you or otherwis dispos of me that i mai not obstruct it thi affection behaviour of my wife brought me a littl out of the vapour and i began to consid what i wa do i correct my wander fanci and began to argu with myself sedat what busi i had after threescor year and after such a life of tediou suffer and disast and close in so happi and easi a manner i sai what busi had i to rush into new hazard and put myself upon adventur fit onli for youth and poverti to run into with those thought i consid my new engag that i had a wife on child born and my wife then great with child of anoth that i had all the world could give me and had no need to seek hazard for gain that i wa declin in year and ought to think rather of leav what i had gain than of seek to increas it that as to what my wife had said of it be an impuls from heaven and that it should be my duti to go i had no notion of that so after mani of these cogit i struggl with the power of my imagin reason myself out of it as i believ peopl mai alwai do in like case if thei will and in a word i conquer it compos myself with such argument as occur to my thought and which my present condit furnish me plentifulli with and particularli as the most effectu method i resolv to divert myself with other thing and to engag in some busi that might effectu tie me up from ani more excurs of thi kind for i found the thing return upon me chiefli when i wa idl had noth to do or ani thing of moment immedi befor me to thi purpos i bought a littl farm in the counti of bedford and resolv to remov myself thither i had a littl conveni hous upon it and the land about it i found wa capabl of great improv and that it wa mani wai suit to my inclin which delight in cultiv manag plant and improv of land and particularli be an inland countri i wa remov from convers among ship sailor and thing relat to the remot part of the world in a word i went down to my farm settl my famili bought me plough harrow a cart waggon hors cow sheep and set serious to work becam in on half year a mere countri gentleman my thought were entir taken up in manag my servant cultiv the ground enclos plant c and i live as i thought the most agreeabl life that natur wa capabl of direct or that a man alwai bred to misfortun wa capabl of be retreat to i farm upon my own land i had no rent to pai wa limit by no articl i could pull up or cut down as i pleas what i plant wa for myself and what i improv wa for my famili and have thu left off the thought of wander i had not the least discomfort in ani part of my life as to thi world now i thought inde that i enjoi the middl state of life which my father so earnestli recommend to me a kind of heavenli life someth like what is describ by the poet upon the subject of a countri life free from vice free from care ag ha no pain and youth no snare but in the middl of all thi felic on blow from unforeseen provid unhing me at onc and not onli made a breach upon me inevit and incur but drove me by it consequ upon a deep relaps into the wander disposit which as i mai sai be born in my veri blood soon recov it hold of me and like the return of a violent distemp came on with an irresist forc upon me so that noth could make ani more impress upon me thi blow wa the loss of my wife it is not my busi here to write an elegi upon my wife to give a charact of her particular virtu and make my court to the sex by the flatteri of a funer sermon she wa in a few word the stai of all my affair the centr of all my enterpris the engin that by her prudenc reduc me to that happi compass i wa in from the most extravag and ruinou project that flutter in my head as abov and did more to guid my rambl geniu than a mother tear a father instruct a friend counsel or all my own reason power could do i wa happi in listen to her tear and in be move by her entreati and to the last degre desol and disloc in the world by the loss of her when she wa gone the world look awkwardli round me i wa as much a stranger in it in my thought as i wa in the brasil when i went first on shore there and as much alon except as to the assist of servant as i wa in my island i knew neither what to do or what not to do i saw the world busi round me on part labour for bread and the other part squander in vile excess or empti pleasur equal miser becaus the end thei propos still fled from them for the men of pleasur everi dai surfeit of their vice and heap up work for sorrow and repent and the men of labour spent their strength in daili struggl for bread to maintain the vital strength thei labour with so live in a daili circul of sorrow live but to work and work but to live as if daili bread were the onli end of a wearisom life and a wearisom life the onli occas of daili bread thi put me in mind of the life i live in my kingdom the island where i suffer no more corn to grow becaus i did not want it and bred no more goat becaus i had no more us for them where the monei lai in the drawer till it grew mildew and had scarc the favour to be look upon in twenti year all these thing had i improv them as i ought to have done and as reason and religion had dictat to me would have taught me to search farther than human enjoy for a full felic and that there wa someth which certainli wa the reason and end of life superior to all these thing and which wa either to be possess or at least hope for on thi side the grave but my sage counsellor wa gone i wa like a ship without a pilot that could onli run befor the wind my thought run all awai again into the old affair my head wa quit turn with the whimsi of foreign adventur and all the pleas innoc amus of my farm and my garden my cattl and my famili which befor entir possess me were noth to me had no relish and were like music to on that ha no ear or food to on that ha no tast in a word i resolv to leav off housekeep let my farm and return to london and in a few month after i did so when i came to london i wa still as uneasi as befor i had no relish to the place no employ in it noth to do but to saunter about like an idl person of whom it mai be said he is perfectli useless in god creation and it is not on farth matter to the rest of hi kind whether he be dead or aliv thi also wa the thing which of all circumst of life wa the most my avers who had been all my dai us to an activ life and i would often sai to myself a state of idl is the veri dreg of life and inde i thought i wa much more suitabl emploi when i wa twentysix dai make me a deal board it wa now the begin of the year when my nephew whom as i have observ befor i had brought up to the sea and had made him command of a ship wa come home from a short voyag to bilboa be the first he had made he came to me and told me that some merchant of hi acquaint had been propos to him to go a voyag for them to the east indi and to china as privat trader and now uncl sai he if you will go to sea with me ill engag to land you upon your old habit in the island for we ar to touch at the brasil noth can be a greater demonstr of a futur state and of the exist of an invis world than the concurr of second caus with the idea of thing which we form in our mind perfectli reserv and not commun to ani in the world my nephew knew noth how far my distemp of wander wa return upon me and i knew noth of what he had in hi thought to sai when that veri morn befor he came to me i had in a great deal of confus of thought and revolv everi part of my circumst in my mind come to thi resolut viz that i would go to lisbon and consult with my old seacaptain and so if it wa ration and practic i would go and see the island again and see what wa becom of my peopl there i had pleas myself also with the thought of peopl the place and carri inhabit from henc get a patent for the possess and i know not what when in the middl of all thi in come my nephew as i have said with hi project of carri me thither in hi wai to the east indi i paus awhil at hi word and look steadili at him what devil said i sent you of thi unlucki errand my nephew startl as if he had been fright at first but perceiv i wa not much displeas with the propos he recov himself i hope it mai not be an unlucki propos sir sai he i dare sai you would be pleas to see your new coloni there where you onc reign with more felic than most of your brothermonarch in the world in a word the scheme hit so exactli with my temper that is to sai with the prepossess i wa under and of which i have said so much that i told him in a few word if he agre with the merchant i would go with him but i told him i would not promis to go ani farther than my own island why sir sai he you dont want to be left there again i hopewhi said i can you not take me up again in your return he told me it could not be possibl that the merchant would allow him to come that wai with a loaden ship of such valu it be a month sail out of hi wai and might be three or four besid sir if i should miscarri said he and not return at all then you would be just reduc to the condit you were in befor thi wa veri ration but we both found out a remedi for it which wa to carri a frame sloop on board the ship which be taken in piec and ship on board the ship might by the help of some carpent whom we agre to carri with us be set up again in the island and finish fit to go to sea in a few dai i wa not long resolv for inde the importun of my nephew join in so effectu with my inclin that noth could oppos me on the other hand my wife be dead i had nobodi concern themselv so much for me as to persuad me on wai or other except my ancient good friend the widow who earnestli struggl with me to consid my year my easi circumst and the needless hazard of a long voyag and abov all my young children but it wa all to no purpos i had an irresist desir to the voyag and i told her i thought there wa someth so uncommon in the impress i had upon my mind for the voyag that it would be a kind of resist provid if i should attempt to stai at home after which she ceas her expostul and join with me not onli in make provis for my voyag but also in settl my famili affair in my absenc and provid for the educ of my children in order to thi i made my will and settl the estat i had in such a manner for my children and place in such hand that i wa perfectli easi and satisfi thei would have justic done them whatev might befal me and for their educ i left it wholli to my widow with a suffici mainten to herself for her care all which she richli deserv for no mother could have taken more care in their educ or understood it better and as she live till i came home i also live to thank her for it my nephew wa readi to sail about the begin of januari and i with my man fridai went on board in the down the th have besid that sloop which i mention abov a veri consider cargo of all kind of necessari thing for my coloni which if i did not find in good condit i resolv to leav so first i carri with me some servant whom i purpos to place there as inhabit or at least to set on work there upon my own account while i stai and either to leav them there or carri them forward as thei should appear will particularli i carri two carpent a smith and a veri handi ingeni fellow who wa a cooper by trade but wa also a gener mechan for he wa dexter at make wheel and handmil to grind corn wa a good turner and a good potmak he also made ani thing that wa proper to make of earth or of wood in a word we call him our jack of all trade with these i carri a tailor who had offer himself to go passeng to the east indi with my nephew but afterward consent to stai on our new plantat and prove a most necessari handi fellow as could be desir in mani other busi besid that of thi trade for as i observ formerli necess arm us for all employ my cargo as near as i can recollect for i have not kept an account of the particular consist of a suffici quantiti of linen and some thin english stuff for cloth the spaniard that i expect to find there and enough of them as by my calcul might comfort suppli them for seven year if i rememb right the materi which i carri for cloth them with glove hat shoe stock and all such thing as thei could want for wear amount to abov two hundr pound includ some bed bed and householdstuff particularli kitchen utensil with pot kettl pewter brass c besid near a hundr pound more in ironwork nail tool of everi kind stapl hook hing and everi necessari thing i could think of i carri also a hundr spare arm musket and fuze besid some pistol a consider quantiti of shot of all size three or four ton of lead and two piec of brass cannon and becaus i knew not what time and what extrem i wa provid for i carri an hundr barrel of powder besid sword cutlass and the iron part of some pike and halbert so that in short we had a larg magazin of all sort of store and i made my nephew carri two small quarterdeck gun more than he want for hi ship to leav behind if there wa occas that when thei came there we might build a fort and man it against all sort of enemi and inde i at first thought there would be need enough of it all and much more if we hope to maintain our possess of the island as shall be seen in the cours of the stori i had not such bad luck in thi voyag as i had been us to meet with and therefor shall have the less occas to interrupt the reader who perhap mai be impati to hear how matter went with my coloni yet some odd accid cross wind and bad weather happen on thi first set out which made the voyag longer than i expect it at first and i who had never made but on voyag viz my first voyag to guinea in which i might be said to come back again as the voyag wa at first design began to think the same ill fate still attend me and that i wa born to be never content with be on shore and yet to be alwai unfortun at sea contrari wind first put us to the northward and we were oblig to put in at galwai in ireland where we lai wind bound twoandthirti dai but we had thi satisfact with the disast that provis were here exceed cheap and in the utmost plenti so that while we lai here we never touch the ship store but rather ad to them here also i took sever hog and two cow with their calv which i resolv if i had a good passag to put on shore in my island but we found occas to dispos otherwis of them we set out the th of februari from ireland and had a veri fair gale of wind for some dai as i rememb it might be about the th of februari in the even late when the mate have the watch came into the roundhous and told us he saw a flash of fire and heard a gun fire and while he wa tell us of it a boi came in and told us the boatswain heard anoth thi made us all run out upon the quarterdeck where for a while we heard noth but in a few minut we saw a veri great light and found that there wa some veri terribl fire at a distanc immedi we had recours to our reckon in which we all agre that there could be no land that wai in which the fire shew itself no not for five hundr leagu for it appear at wnw upon thi we conclud it must be some ship on fire at sea and as by our hear the nois of gun just befor we conclud it could not be far off we stood directli toward it and were present satisfi we should discov it becaus the farther we sail the greater the light appear though the weather be hazi we could not perceiv ani thing but the light for a while in about half an hour sail the wind be fair for us though not much of it and the weather clear up a littl we could plainli discern that it wa a great ship on fire in the middl of the sea i wa most sensibl touch with thi disast though not at all acquaint with the person engag in it i present recollect my former circumst in what condit i wa in when taken up by the portug captain and how much more deplor the circumst of the poor creatur belong to thi ship must be if thei had no other ship in compani with them upon thi i immedi order that five gun should be fire on soon after anoth that if possibl we might give notic to them that there wa help for them at hand and that thei might endeavour to save themselv in their boat for though we could see the flame in the ship yet thei it be night could see noth of us we lai by some time upon thi onli drive as the burn ship drove wait for daylight when on a sudden to our great terror though we had reason to expect it the ship blew up in the air and immedi sunk thi wa terribl and inde an afflict sight for the sake of the poor men who i conclud must be either all destroi in the ship or be in the utmost distress in their boat in the middl of the ocean which at present by reason it wa dark i could not see howev to direct them as well as i could i caus light to be hung out in all the part of the ship where we could and which we had lantern for and kept fire gun all the night long let them know by thi that there wa a ship not far off about eight oclock in the morn we discov the ship boat by the help of our perspectiveglass and found there were two of them both throng with peopl and deep in the water we perceiv thei row the wind be against them that thei saw our ship and did the utmost to make us see them we immedi spread our ancient to let them know we saw them and hung a waft out as a signal for them to come on board and then made more sail stand directli to them in a littl more than half an hour we came up with them and in a word took them all in be no less than sixtyfour men women and children for there were a great mani passeng upon the whole we found it wa a french merchantship of three hundr ton homewardbound from quebec in the river of canada the master gave us a long account of the distress of hi ship how the fire began in the steerag by the neglig of the steersman but on hi cry out for help wa as everybodi thought entir put out but thei soon found that some spark of the first fire had gotten into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that thei could not effectu quench it and afterward get in between the timber and within the ceil of the ship it proceed into the hold and master all the skill and all the applic thei were abl to exert thei had no more to do then but to get into their boat which to their great comfort were pretti larg be their longboat and a great shallop besid a small skiff which wa of no great servic to them other than to get some fresh water and provis into her after thei had secur themselv from the fire thei had inde small hope of their live by get into these boat at that distanc from ani land onli as thei said well that thei were escap from the fire and had a possibl that some ship might happen to be at sea and might take them in thei had sail oar and a compass and were prepar to make the best of their wai to newfoundland the wind blow pretti fair for it blew an easi gale at se by e thei had as much provis and water as with spare it so as to be next door to starv might support them about twelv dai in which if thei had no bad weather and no contrari wind the captain said he hope he might get to the bank of newfoundland and might perhap take some fish to sustain them till thei might go on shore but there were so mani chanc against them in all these case such as storm to overset and founder them rain and cold to benumb and perish their limb contrari wind to keep them out and starv them that it must have been next to miracul if thei had escap in the midst of their consult everi on be hopeless and readi to despair the captain with tear in hi ey told me thei were on a sudden surpris with the joi of hear a gun fire and after that four more these were the five gun which i caus to be fire at first see the light thi reviv their heart and gave them the notic which as abov i design it should viz that there wa a ship at hand for their help it wa upon the hear these gun that thei took down their mast and sail and the sound come from the windward thei resolv to lie by till morn some time after thi hear no more gun thei fire three musket on a consider while after anoth but these the wind be contrari we never heard some time after that again thei were still more agreeabl surpris with see our light and hear the gun which as i have said i caus to be fire all the rest of the night thi set them to work with their oar to keep their boat ahead at least that we might the sooner come up with them and at last to their inexpress joi thei found we saw them it is imposs for me to express the sever gestur the strang ecstasi the varieti of postur which these poor deliv peopl ran into to express the joi of their soul at so unexpect a deliver grief and fear ar easili describ sigh tear groan and a veri few motion of head and hand make up the sum of it varieti but an excess of joi a surpris of joi ha a thousand extravag in it there were some in tear some rage and tear themselv as if thei had been in the greatest agoni of sorrow some stark rave and downright lunat some ran about the ship stamp with their feet other wring their hand some were danc sever sing some laugh more cry mani quit dumb not abl to speak a word other sick and vomit sever swoon and readi to faint and a few were cross themselv and give god thank i would not wrong them neither there might be mani that were thank afterward but the passion wa too strong for them at first and thei were not abl to master it thei were thrown into ecstasi and a kind of frenzi and so there were but a veri few who were compos and seriou in their joi perhap also the case mai have some addit to it from the particular circumst of the nation thei belong to i mean the french whose temper is allow to be more volatil more passion and more sprightli and their spirit more fluid than of other nation i am not philosoph to determin the caus but noth i had ever seen befor came up to it the ecstasi poor fridai my trusti savag wa in when he found hi father in the boat came the nearest to it and the surpris of the master and hi two companion whom i deliv from the two villain that set them on shore in the island came a littl wai toward it but noth wa to compar to thi either that i saw in fridai or ani where els in my life it is farther observ that these extravag did not shew themselv in that differ manner i have mention in differ person onli but all the varieti would appear in a short success of moment in on and the same person a man that we saw thi minut dumb and as it were stupid and confound should the next minut be danc and halloo like an antic and the next moment atear hi hair or pull hi cloth to piec and stamp them under hi feet like a madman a few minut after that we should have him all in tear then sick then swoon and had not immedi help been had would in a few moment more have been dead and thu it wa not with on or two or ten or twenti but with the greatest part of them and if i rememb right our surgeon wa oblig to let abov thirti of them blood there were two priest among them on an old man and the other a young man and that which wa strangest wa that the oldest man wa the worst as soon as he set hi foot on board our ship and saw himself safe he drop down stone dead to all appear not the least sign of life could be perceiv in him our surgeon immedi appli proper remedi to recov him and wa the onli man in the ship that believ he wa not dead and at length he open a vein in hi arm have first chafe and rub the part so as to warm it as much as possibl upon thi the blood which onli drop at first flow someth freeli in three minut after the man open hi ey and about a quarter of an hour after that he spoke grew better and in a littl time quit well after the blood wa stop he walk about told us he wa perfectli well took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him and wa what we call come to himself about a quarter of an hour after thi thei came run into the cabin to the surgeon who wa bleed a french woman that had faint and told him the priest wa gone stark mad it seem he had begun to revolv the chang of hi circumst in hi mind and thi put him into an ecstasi of joi hi spirit whirl about faster than the vessel could convei them the blood grew hot and feverish and the man wa as fit for bedlam as ani creatur that ever wa in it the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condit but gave him someth to doze and put him to sleep which after some time oper upon him and he wake next morn perfectli compos and well the younger priest behav himself with great command of hi passion and wa realli an exampl of a seriou wellgovern mind at hi first come on board the ship he threw himself flat on hi face prostrat himself in thank for hi deliver in which i unhappili and unseason disturb him realli think he had been in a swoon but he spoke calmli thank me told me he wa give god thank for hi deliver beg me to leav him a few moment and that next to hi maker he would give me thank also i wa heartili sorri that i disturb him and not onli left him but kept other from interrupt him also he continu in that postur about three minut or a littl more after i left him then came to me as he had said he would and with a great deal of serious and affect but with tear in hi ey thank me that had under god given him and so mani miser creatur their live i told him i had no room to move him to thank god for it rather than me for i had seen that he had done that alreadi but i ad that it wa noth but what reason and human dictat to all men and that we had as much reason as he to give thank to god who had bless us so far as to make us the instrument of hi merci to so mani of hi creatur after thi the young priest appli himself to hi countryfolk labour to compos them persuad entreat argu reason with them and did hi utmost to keep them within the exercis of their reason and with some he had success though other were for a time out of all govern of themselv i cannot help commit thi to write as perhap it mai be us to those into whose hand it mai fall in the guid themselv in all the extravag of their passion for if an excess of joi can carri men out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason what will not the extravag of anger rage and a provok mind carri us to and inde here i saw reason for keep an exceed watch over our passion of everi kind as well those of joi and satisfact as those of sorrow and anger we were someth disord by these extravag among our new guest for the first dai but when thei had been retir lodg provid for them as well as our ship would allow and thei had slept heartili as most of them did be fatigu and frighten thei were quit anoth sort of peopl the next dai noth of good manner or civil acknowledg for the kind shown them wa want the french it is known ar natur apt enough to exce that wai the captain and on of the priest came to me the next dai and desir to speak with me and my nephew the command began to consult with us what should be done with them and first thei told us that as we had save their live so all thei had wa littl enough for a return to us for the kind receiv the captain said thei had save some monei and some thing of valu in their boat catch hastili out of the flame and if we would accept it thei were order to make an offer of it all to us thei onli desir to be set on shore somewher in our wai where if possibl thei might get a passag to franc my nephew wa for accept their monei at first word and to consid what to do with them afterward but i overrul him in that part for i knew what it wa to be set on shore in a strang countri and if the portug captain that took me up at sea had serv me so and took all i had for my deliver i must have starv or have been as much a slave at the brasil as i had been at barbari the be sold to a mahometan onli except and perhap a portugues is not a much better master than a turk if not in some case a much wors i therefor told the french captain that we had taken them up in their distress it wa true but that it wa our duti to do so as we were fellowcreatur and as we would desir to be so deliv if we were in the like or ani other extrem that we had done noth for them but what we believ thei would have done for us if we had been in their case and thei in our but that we took them up to serv them not to plunder them and that it would be a most barbar thing to take that littl from them which thei had save out of the fire and then set them on shore and leav them that thi would be first to save them from death and then kill them ourselv save them from drown and then abandon them to starv and therefor i would not let the least thing be taken from them as to set them on shore i told them inde that wa an exceed difficulti to us for that the ship wa bound to the east indi and though we were driven out of our cours to the westward a veri great wai which perhap wa direct by heaven on purpos for their deliver yet it wa imposs for us wilfulli to chang our voyag on thi particular account nor could my nephew the captain answer it to the freighter with whom he wa under charterparti to pursu hi voyag by the wai of brasil and all i knew he could do for them wa to put ourselv in the wai of meet with other ship homewardbound from the west indi and get them passag if possibl to england or franc the first part of the propos wa so gener and kind thei could not but be veri thank for it but thei were in a great constern especi the passeng at the notion of be carri awai to the east indi thei then entreat me that see i wa driven so far to the westward befor i met with them i would at least keep on the same cours to the bank of newfoundland where it wa possibl i might meet some ship or sloop that thei might hire to carri them back to canada from whenc thei came i thought thi wa but a reason request on their part and therefor i inclin to agre to it for inde i consid that to carri thi whole compani to the east indi would not onli be an intoler sever to the poor peopl but would be ruin our voyag by devour all our provis so i thought it no breach of charterparti but what an unforeseen accid made absolut necessari to us and in which no on could sai we were to blame for the law of god and natur would have forbid that we should refus to take up two boat full of peopl in such a distress condit and the natur of the thing as well respect ourselv as the poor peopl oblig us to see them on shore somewher or other for their deliver so i consent that we would carri them to newfoundland if wind and weather would permit and if not that i would carri them to martinico in the west indi the wind continu fresh easterli but the weather pretti good and as it had blow continu in the point between ne and se a long time we miss sever opportun of send them to franc for we met sever ship bound to europ whereof two were french from st christoph but thei had been so long beat up against the wind that thei durst take in no passeng for fear of want provis for the voyag as well for themselv as for those thei should take in so we were oblig to go on it wa about a week after thi that we made the bank of newfoundland where to shorten my stori we put all our french peopl on board a bark which thei hire at sea there to put them on shore and afterward to carri them to franc if thei could get provis to victual themselv with when i sai all the french went on shore i should rememb that the young priest i spoke of hear we were bound to the east indi desir to go the voyag with us and to be set on shore on the coast of coromandel i readili agre to that for i wonderfulli like the man and had veri good reason as will appear afterward also four of the seamen enter themselv in our ship and prove veri us fellow from henc we direct our cours for the west indi steer awai s and s by e for about twenti dai togeth sometim littl or no wind at all when we met with anoth subject for our human to work upon almost as deplor as that befor it wa in the latitud of degre minut n and the th dai of march when we espi a sail our cours se and by s we soon perceiv it wa a larg vessel and that she bore up to us but could not at first know what to make of her till after come a littl nearer we found she had lost her maintopmast foremast and bowsprit and present she fire a gun as a signal of distress the weather wa pretti good wind at nnw a fresh gale and we soon came to speak with her we found her a ship of bristol bound home from barbado but had been blown out of the road at barbado a few dai befor she wa readi to sail by a terribl hurrican while the captain and chief mate were both gone on shore so that besid the terror of the storm thei were but in an indiffer case for good artist to bring the ship home thei had been alreadi nine week at sea and had met with anoth terribl storm after the hurrican wa over which had blown them quit out of their knowledg to the westward and in which thei had lost their mast as abov thei told us thei expect to have seen the bahama island but were then driven awai again to the southeast by a strong gale of wind at nnw the same that blew now and have no sail to work the ship with but a maincours and a kind of squar sail upon a juryforemast which thei had set up thei could not lie near the wind but were endeavour to stand awai for the canari but that which wa worst of all wa that thei were almost starv for want of provis besid the fatigu thei had undergon their bread and flesh wa quit gone thei had not an ounc left in the ship and had had none for eleven dai the onli relief thei had wa their water wa not all spent and thei had about half a barrel of flour left thei had sugar enough some succad or sweetmeat thei had at first but thei were devour and thei had seven cask of rum there wa a youth and hi mother and a maidserv on board who were go passeng and think the ship wa readi to sail unhappili came on board the even befor the hurrican began and have no provis of their own left thei were in a more deplor condit than the rest for the seamen be reduc to such an extrem necess themselv had no compass we mai be sure for the poor passeng and thei were inde in a condit that their miseri is veri hard to describ i had perhap not known thi part if my curios had not led me the weather be fair and the wind abat to go on board the ship the second mate who upon thi occas command the ship had been on board our ship and he told me inde that thei had three passeng in the great cabin that thei were in a deplor condit nai sai he i believ thei ar dead for i have heard noth of them for abov two dai and i wa afraid to inquir after them said he for i had noth to reliev them with we immedi appli ourselv to give them what relief we could spare and inde i had so far overrul thing with my nephew that i would have victual them though we had gone awai to virginia or ani part of the coast of america to have suppli ourselv but there wa no necess for that but now thei were in a new danger for thei were afraid of eat too much even of that littl we gave them the mate or command brought six men with him in hi boat but these poor wretch look like skeleton and were so weak thei could hardli sit to their oar the mate himself wa veri ill and halfstarv for he declar he had reserv noth from the men and went share and share alik with them in everi bit thei at i caution him to eat sparingli but set meat befor him immedi and he had not eaten three mouth befor he began to be sick and out of order so he stop awhil and our surgeon mix him up someth with some broth which he said would be to him both food and physic and after he had taken it he grew better in the meantim i forgot not the men i order victual to be given them and the poor creatur rather devour than at it thei were so exceed hungri that thei were in a manner raven and had no command of themselv and two of them at with so much greedi that thei were in danger of their live the next morn the sight of these peopl distress wa veri move to me and brought to mind what i had a terribl respect of at my first come on shore in my island where i had not the least mouth of food or ani hope of procur it besid the hourli apprehens i had of be made the food of other creatur but all the while the mate wa thu relat to me the miser condit of the ship compani i could not put out of my thought the stori he had told me of the three poor creatur in the great cabin viz the mother her son and the maidserv whom he had heard noth of for two or three dai and whom he seem to confess thei had wholli neglect their own extrem be so great by which i understood that thei had realli given them no food at all and that therefor thei must be perish and be all ly dead perhap on the floor or deck of the cabin as i therefor kept the mate whom we then call captain on board with hi men to refresh them so i also forgot not the starv crew that were left on board but order my own boat to go on board the ship and with my mate and twelv men to carri them a sack of bread and four or five piec of beef to boil our surgeon charg the men to caus the meat to be boil while thei stai and to keep guard in the cookroom to prevent the men take it to eat raw or take it out of the pot befor it wa well boil and then to give everi man but a littl at a time and by thi caution he preserv the men who would otherwis have kill themselv with that veri food that wa given them on purpos to save their live at the same time i order the mate to go into the great cabin and see what condit the poor passeng were in and if thei were aliv to comfort them and give them what refresh wa proper and the surgeon gave him a larg pitcher with some of the prepar broth which he had given the mate that wa on board and which he did not question would restor them gradual i wa not satisfi with thi but as i said abov have a great mind to see the scene of miseri which i knew the ship itself would present me with in a more live manner than i could have it by report i took the captain of the ship as we now call him with me and went myself a littl after in their boat i found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the victual out of the boiler befor it wa readi but my mate observ hi order and kept a good guard at the cookroom door and the man he place there after us all possibl persuas to have patienc kept them off by forc howev he caus some biscuit cake to be dip in the pot and soften them with the liquor of the meat which thei call brewi and gave everi on on to stai their stomach and told them it wa for their own safeti that he wa oblig to give them but littl at a time but it wa all in vain and had i not come on board and their own command and offic with me and with good word and some threat also of give them no more i believ thei would have broke into the cookroom by forc and torn the meat out of the furnac for word inde ar of a veri small forc to an hungri belli howev we pacifi them and fed them gradual and cautious for the first time and the next time gave them more and at last fill their belli and the men did well enough but the miseri of the poor passeng in the cabin wa of anoth natur and far beyond the rest for as first the ship compani had so littl for themselv it wa but too true that thei had at first kept them veri low and at last total neglect them so that for six or seven dai it might be said thei had realli had no food at all and for sever dai befor veri littl the poor mother who as the first mate report wa a woman of good sens and good breed had spare all she could get so affection for her son that at last she entir sunk under it and when the mate of our ship went in she sat upon the floor or deck with her back up against the side between two chair which were lash fast and her head sunk in between her shoulder like a corps though not quit dead my mate said all he could to reviv and encourag her and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth she open her lip and lift up on hand but could not speak yet she understood what he said and made sign to him intim that it wa too late for her but point to her child as if she would have said thei should take care of him howev the mate who wa exceedingli move with the sight endeavour to get some of the broth into her mouth and as he said got two or three spoon down though i question whether he could be sure of it or not but it wa too late and she di the same night the youth who wa preserv at the price of hi most affection mother life wa not so far gone yet he lai in a cabinb as on stretch out with hardli ani life left in him he had a piec of an old glove in hi mouth have eaten up the rest of it howev be young and have more strength than hi mother the mate got someth down hi throat and he began sensibl to reviv though by give him some time after but two or three spoon extraordinari he wa veri sick and brought it up again but the next care wa the poor maid she lai all along upon the deck hard by her mistress and just like on that had fallen down with an apoplexi and struggl for life her limb were distort on of her hand wa clasp round the frame of on chair and she gripe it so hard that we could not easili make her let it go her other arm lai over her head and her feet lai both togeth set fast against the frame of the cabint in short she lai just like on in the last agoni of death and yet she wa aliv too the poor creatur wa not onli starv with hunger and terrifi with the thought of death but as the men told us afterward wa brokenheart for her mistress whom she saw dy two or three dai befor and whom she love most tenderli we knew not what to do with thi poor girl for when our surgeon who wa a man of veri great knowledg and experi and with great applic recov her as to life he had her upon hi hand as to her sens for she wa littl less than distract for a consider time after as shall appear present whoever shall read these memorandum must be desir to consid that visit at sea ar not like a journei into the countri where sometim peopl stai a week or a fortnight at a place our busi wa to reliev thi distress ship crew but not lie by for them and though thei were will to steer the same cours with us for some dai yet we could carri no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no mast howev as their captain beg of us to help him to set up a maintopmast and a kind of topmast to hi juryforemast we did as it were lie by him for three or four dai and then have given him five barrel of beef and pork two hogshead of biscuit and a proport of pea flour and what other thing we could spare and take three cask of sugar and some rum and some piec of eight of them for satisfact we left them take on board with us at their own earnest request the youth and the maid and all their good the young lad wa about seventeen year of ag a pretti wellbr modest and sensibl youth greatli deject with the loss of hi mother and as it happen had lost hi father but a few month befor at barbado he beg of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship for he said the cruel fellow had murder hi mother and inde so thei had that is to sai passiv for thei might have spare a small susten to the poor helpless widow that might have preserv her life though it had been just to keep her aliv but hunger know no friend no relat no justic no right and therefor is remorseless and capabl of no compass the surgeon told him how far we were go and how it would carri him awai from all hi friend and put him perhap in as bad circumst almost as we found them in that is to sai starv in the world he said it matter not whither he went if he wa but deliv from the terribl crew that he wa among that the captain by which he meant me for he could know noth of my nephew had save hi life and he wa sure would not hurt him and as for the maid he wa sure if she came to herself she would be veri thank for it let us carri them whither we would the surgeon repres the case so affection to me that i yield and we took them both on board with all their good except eleven hogshead of sugar which could not be remov or come at and as the youth had a bill of lade for them i made hi command sign a write oblig him to go as soon as he came to bristol to on mr roger a merchant there to whom the youth said he wa relat and to deliv a letter which i wrote to him and all the good he had belong to the deceas widow which i suppos wa not done for i could never learn that the ship came to bristol but wa as is most probabl lost at sea be in so disabl a condit and so far from ani land that i am of opinion the first storm she met with afterward she might founder in the sea for she wa leaki and had damag in her hold when i met with her i wa now in the latitud of deg min and had hitherto had a toler voyag as to weather though at first the wind had been contrari i shall troubl nobodi with the littl incid of wind weather current c on the rest of our voyag but shorten my stori for the sake of what is to follow shall observ that i came to my old habit the island on the th of april it wa with no small difficulti that i found the place for as i came to it and went from it befor on the south and east side of the island as come from the brasil so now come in between the main and the island and have no chart for the coast nor ani landmark i did not know it when i saw it or know whether i saw it or no we beat about a great while and went on shore on sever island in the mouth of the great river oroonoqu but none for my purpos onli thi i learnt by my coast the shore that i wa under on great mistak befor viz that the contin which i thought i saw from the island i live in wa realli no contin but a long island or rather a ridg of island reach from on to the other side of the extend mouth of that great river and that the savag who came to my island were not properli those which we call caribbe but island and other barbarian of the same kind who inhabit someth nearer to our side than the rest in short i visit sever of the island to no purpos some i found were inhabit and some were not on on of them i found some spaniard and thought thei had live there but speak with them found thei had a sloop lai in a small creek hard by and that thei came thither to make salt and catch some pearlmuscl if thei could but thei belong to the isl de trinidad which lai farther north in the latitud of and degre thu coast from on island to anoth sometim with the ship sometim with the frenchman shallop which we had found a conveni boat and therefor kept her with their veri good will at length i came fair on the south side of my island and i present knew the veri counten of the place so i brought the ship safe to an anchor broadsid with the littl creek where wa my old habit as soon as i saw the place i call for fridai and ask him if he knew where he wa he look about a littl and present clap hi hand cri o ye o there o ye o there point to our old habit and fell adanc and caper like a mad fellow and i had much ado to keep him from jump into the sea to swim ashor to the place well fridai said i do you think we shall find ani bodi here or no and what do you think shall we see your father the fellow stood mute as a stock a good while

abroad to divert him in short if the same filial affect wa to be found in christian to their parent in our part of the world on would be tempt to sai there hardli would have been ani need of the fifth command but thi is a digress i return to my land it would be endless to take notic of all the ceremoni and civil that the spaniard receiv me with the first spaniard whom as i said i knew veri well wa he whose life i save he came toward the boat attend by on more carri a flag of truce also and he did not onli not know me at first but he had no thought no notion of it be me that wa come til i spoke to him seignior said i in portugues do you not know me at which he spoke not a word but give hi musket to the man that wa with him threw hi arm abroad and sai someth in spanish that i did not perfectli hear came forward and embrac me tell me he wa inexcus not to know that face again that he had onc seen as of an angel from heaven sent to save hi life he said abund of veri handsom thing as

own hous again and where i should see there had been but mean improv so i walk along with him but ala i could no more find the place again than if i had never been there for thei had plant so mani tree and place them in such a postur so thick and close to on anoth in ten year time thei were grown so big that in short the place wa inaccess except by such wind and blind wai as thei themselv onli who made them could find i ask them what put them upon all these fortif he told me i would sai there wa need enough of it when thei had given an account how thei had pass their time sinc their arriv in the island especi after thei had the misfortun to find that i wa gone he told me he could not but have some satisfact in my good fortun when he heard that i wa gone in a good ship and to my satisfact and that he had oftentim a strong persuas that on time or other he should see me again but noth that ever befel him in hi life he said wa so surpris and afflict to him at first as the disappoint he wa under when he came back to the island and found i wa not there as to the three barbarian so he call them that were left behind and of whom he said he had a long stori to tell me the spaniard all thought themselv much better among the savag onli that their number wa so small and sai he had thei been strong enough we had been all long ago in purgatori and with that he cross himself upon the breast but sir sai he i hope you will not be displeas when i shall tell you how forc by necess we were oblig for our own preserv to disarm them and make them our subject who would not be content with be moder our master but would be our murder i answer i wa heartili afraid of it when i left them there and noth troubl me at my part from the island but that thei were not come back that i might have put them in possess of everi thing first and left the other in a state of subject as thei deserv but if thei had reduc them to it i wa veri glad and should be veri far from find ani fault with it for i knew thei were a parcel of refractori ungovern villain and were fit for ani manner of mischief while i wa sai thi came the man whom he had sent back and with him eleven men more in the dress thei were in it wa imposs to guess what nation thei were of but he made all clear both to them and to me first he turn to me and point to them said these sir ar some of the gentlemen who ow their live to you and then turn to them and point to me he let them know who i wa upon which thei all came up on by on not as if thei had been sailor and ordinari fellow and i the like but realli as if thei had been ambassador or noblemen and i a monarch or a great conqueror their behaviour wa to the last degre oblig and courteou and yet mix with a manli majest graviti which veri well becam them and in short thei had so much more manner than i that i scarc knew how to receiv their civil much less how to return them in kind the histori of their come to and conduct in the island after my go awai is so remark and ha so mani incid which the former part of my relat will help to understand and which will in most of the particular refer to that account i have alreadi given that i cannot but commit them with great delight to the read of those that come after me i shall no longer troubl the stori with a relat in the first person which will put me to the expens of ten thousand said is and said he and he told me and i told him and the like but i shall collect the fact histor as near as i can gather them out of my memori from what thei relat to me and from what i met with in my convers with them and with the place in order to do thi succinctli and as intellig as i can i must go back to the circumst in which i left the island and which the person were in of whom i am to speak at first it is necessari to repeat that i had sent awai fridai father and the spaniard the two whose live i had rescu from the savag i sai i had sent them awai in a larg cano to the main as i then thought it to fetch over the spaniard companion whom he had left behind him in order to save them from the like calam that he had been in and in order to succour them for the present and that if possibl we might togeth find some wai for our deliver afterward when i sent them awai i had no visibl appear of or the least room to hope for my own deliver ani more than i had twenti year befor much less had i ani foreknowledg of what after happen i mean of an english ship come on shore there to fetch them off and it could not but be a veri great surpris to them when thei came back not onli to find that i wa gone but to find three stranger left on the spot possess of all that i had left behind me which would otherwis have been their own the first thing howev which i inquir into that i might begin where i left off wa of their own part and i desir he would give me a particular account of hi voyag back to hi countrymen with the boat when i sent him to fetch them over he told me there wa littl varieti in that part for noth remark happen to them on the wai thei have veri calm weather and a smooth sea for hi countrymen it could not be doubt he said but that thei were overjoi to see him it seem he wa the princip man among them the captain of the vessel thei had been shipwreck in have been dead some time thei were he said the more surpris to see him becaus thei knew that he wa fallen into the hand of savag who thei were satisfi would devour him as thei did all the rest of their prison that when he told them the stori of the deliver and in what manner he wa furnish for carri them awai it wa like a dream to them and their astonish thei said wa someth like that of joseph brethren when he told them who he wa and told them the stori of hi exalt in pharaoh court but when he shew them the arm the powder the ball and the provis that he brought them for their journei or voyag thei were restor to themselv took a just share of the joi of their deliver and immedi prepar to come awai with him their first busi wa to get cano and in thi thei were oblig not to stick so much upon the honest part of it but to trespass upon their friendli savag and to borrow two larg cano or periagua on pretenc of go out afish or for pleasur in these thei came awai the next morn it seem thei want no time to get themselv readi for thei had no baggag neither cloth or provis or ani thing in the world but what thei had on them and a few root to eat of which thei us to make their bread thei were in all three week absent and in that time unluckili for them i had the occas offer for my escap as i mention in my other part and to get off from the island leav three of the most impud harden ungovern disagre villain behind me that ani man could desir to meet with to the poor spaniard great grief and disappoint you mai be sure the onli just thing the rogu did wa that when the spaniard came on shore thei gave my letter to them and gave them provis and other relief as i had order them to do also thei gave them the long paper of direct which i had left with them contain the particular method which i took for manag everi part of my life there the wai how i bake my bread bred up my tame goat and plant my corn how i cure my grape made my pot and in a word everi thing i did all thi be written down thei gave to the spaniard two of whom understood english well enough nor did thei refus to accommod the spaniard with ani thing els for thei agre veri well for some time thei gave them an equal admiss into the hous or cave and thei began to live veri sociabl and the head spaniard who had seen pretti much of my method and fridai father togeth manag all their affair for as for the englishmen thei did noth but rambl about the island shoot parrot and catch tortois and when thei came home at night the spaniard provid their supper for them the spaniard would have been satisfi with thi would the other but have left them alon which howev thei could not find in their heart to do long but like the dog in the manger thei would not eat themselv and would not let other eat neither the differ nevertheless were at first but trivial and such as ar not worth relat but at last it broke out into open war and it began with all the rude and insol that can be imagin without reason without provoc contrari to natur and inde to common sens and though it is true the first relat of it came from the spaniard themselv whom i mai call the accus yet when i came to examin the fellow thei could not deni a word of it but befor i come to the particular of thi part i must suppli a defect in my former relat and thi wa that i forgot to set down among the rest that just as we were weigh the anchor to set sail there happen a littl quarrel on board our ship which i wa afraid onc would turn to a second mutini nor wa it appeas till the captain rous up hi courag and take us all to hi assist part them by forc and make two of the most refractori fellow prison he laid them in iron and as thei had been activ in the former disord and let fall some ugli danger word the second time he threaten to carri them in iron to england and have them hang there for mutini and run awai with the ship thi it seem though the captain did not intend to do it fright some other men in the ship and some of them had put it in the head of the rest that the captain onli gave them good word for the present till thei should come to some english port and that then thei should be all put into a gaol and tri for their live the mate got intellig of thi and acquaint us with it upon which it wa desir that i who still pass for a great man among them should go down with the mate and satisfi the men and tell them that thei might be assur if thei behav well the rest of the voyag all thei had done for the time past should be pardon so i went and after pass my honour word to them thei appear easi and the more so when i caus the two men who were in iron to be releas and forgiven but thi mutini had brought us to an anchor for that night the wind also fall calm next morn we found that our two men who had been laid in iron had stole each of them a musket and some other weapon what powder or shot thei had we knew not and had taken the ship pinnac which wa not yet hale up and run awai with her to their companion in rogueri on shore as soon as we found thi i order the longboat on shore with twelv men and the mate and awai thei went to seek the rogu but thei could neither find them nor ani of the rest for thei all fled into the wood when thei saw the boat come on shore the mate wa onc resolv in justic to their rogueri to have destroi their plantat burnt all their household stuff and furnitur and left them to shift without it but have no order he let all alon left everi thing as thei found it and bring the pinnac awai came on board without them these two men made their number five but the other three villain were so much wicked than these that after thei had been two or three dai togeth thei turn their two newcom out of door to shift for themselv and would have noth to do with them nor could thei for a good while be persuad to give them ani food as for the spaniard thei were not yet come when the spaniard came first on shore the busi began to go forward the spaniard would have persuad the three english brute to have taken in their two countrymen again that as thei said thei might be all on famili but thei would not hear of it so the two poor fellow live by themselv and find noth but industri and applic would make them live comfort thei pitch their tent on the north shore of the island but a littl more to the west to be out of the danger of the savag who alwai land on the east part of the island here thei built two hut on to lodg in and the other to lai up their magazin and store in and the spaniard have given them some corn for seed and especi some of the pea which i had left them thei dug and plant and enclos after the pattern i had set for them all and began to live pretti well their first crop of corn wa on the ground and though it wa but a littl bit of land which thei had dug up at first have had but a littl time yet it wa enough to reliev them and find them with bread or other eatabl and on of the fellow be the cook mate of the ship wa veri readi at make soup pud and such other prepar as the rice and the milk and such littl flesh as thei got furnish him to do thei were go on in a littl thrive postur when the three unnatur rogu their own countrymen too in mere humour and to insult them came and bulli them and told them the island wa their that the governor mean me had given them possess of it and nobodi els had ani right to it and damn them thei should build no hous upon their ground unless thei would pai them rent for them the two men thought thei had jest at first and ask them to come and sit down and see what fine hous thei were that thei had built and tell them what rent thei demand and on of them merrili told them if thei were groundlandlord he hope if thei built tenement upon the land and made improv thei would accord to the custom of all landlord grant them a long leas and bid them go fetch a scriven to draw the write on of the three damn and rage told them thei should see thei were not in jest and go to a littl place at a distanc where the honest men had made a fire to dress their victual he take a firebrand and clap it to the outsid of their hut and veri fairli set it on fire and it would have been all burnt down in a few minut if on of the two had not run to the fellow thrust him awai and trod the fire out with hi feet and that not without some difficulti too the fellow wa in such a rage at the honest man thrust him awai that he turn upon him with a pole he had in hi hand and had not the man avoid the blow veri nimbl and run into the hut he had end hi dai at onc hi comrad see the danger thei were both in ran in after him and immedi thei came both out with their musket and the man that wa first struck at with the pole knock the fellow down who began the quarrel with the stock of hi musket and that befor the other two could come to help him and then see the rest come at them thei stood togeth and present the other end of their piec to them bade them stand off the other had firearm with them too but on of the two honest men bolder than hi comrad and made desper by hi danger told them if thei offer to move hand or foot thei were all dead men and boldli command them to lai down their arm thei did not inde lai down their arm but see him resolut it brought them to a parlei and thei consent to take their wound man with them and be gone and inde it seem the fellow wa wound suffici with the blow howev thei were much in the wrong sinc thei had the advantag that thei did not disarm them effectu as thei might have done and have gone immedi to the spaniard and given them an account how the rogu treat them for the three villain studi noth but reveng and everi dai gave them some intim that thei did so but not to crowd thi part with an account of the lesser part of their rogueri such as tread down their corn shoot three young kid and a shegoat which the poor men had got to breed up tame for their store and in a word plagu them night and dai in thi manner it forc the two men to such a desper that thei resolv to fight them all three the first time thei had a fair opportun in order to thi thei resolv to go to the castl as thei call it that wa my old dwell where the three rogu and the spaniard all live togeth at that time intend to have a fair battl and the spaniard should stand by to see fair plai so thei got up in the morn befor dai and came to the place and call the englishmen by their name tell a spaniard that answer that thei want to speak with them it happen that the dai befor two of the spaniard have been in the wood had seen on of the two englishmen whom for distinct i call the honest men and he had made a sad complaint to the spaniard of the barbar usag thei had met with from their three countrymen and how thei had ruin their plantat and destroi their corn that thei had labour so hard to bring forward and kill the milchgoat and their three kid which wa all thei had provid for their susten and that if he and hi friend mean the spaniard did not assist them again thei should be starv when the spaniard came home at night and thei were all at supper he took the freedom to reprov the three englishmen though in gentl and mannerli term and ask them how thei could be so cruel thei be harmless inoffens fellow and that thei were put themselv in a wai to subsist by their labour and that it had cost them a great deal of pain to bring thing to such perfect as thei had on of the englishmen return veri briskli what had thei to do there that thei came on shore without leav and that thei should not plant or build upon the island it wa none of their groundwhi sai the spaniard veri calmli seignior ingles thei must not starv the englishman repli like a true roughhewn

the same rule we must be your servant tooai sai the bold dog and so you shall too befor we have done with you mix two or three gd dmme in the proper interv of hi speech the spaniard onli smile at that and made him no answer howev thi littl discours had heat them and start up on sai to the other i think it wa he thei call will atkin come jack let us go and have the other brush with them we will demolish their castl i will warrant you thei shall plant no coloni in our dominion upon thi thei were all troop awai with everi man a gun a pistol and a sword and mutter some insol thing among

hard for take the two englishmen part whither thei went or how thei bestow their time that even the spaniard said thei did not know but it seem thei wander about the countri part of the night and then ly down in the place which i us to call my bower thei were weari and overslept themselv the case wa thi thei had resolv to stai till midnight and so to take the poor men when thei were asleep and thei acknowledg it afterward intend to set fire to their hut while thei were in them and either burn them in them or murder them as thei came out and as malic seldom sleep veri sound it wa veri strang thei should not have been kept wake howev as the two men had also a design upon them as i have said though a much fairer on than that of burn and murder it happen and veri luckili for them all that thei were up and gone abroad befor the bloodymind rogu came to their hut when thei came thither and found the men gone atkin who it seem wa the forwardest man call out to hi comrad ha jack here the nest but dn them the bird ar flown thei muse awhil to think what should be the occas of their be gone abroad so soon and suggest present that the spaniard had given them notic of it and with that thei shook hand and swore to on anoth that thei would be reveng of the spaniard as soon as thei had made thi bloodi bargain thei fell to work with the poor men habit thei did not set fire inde to ani thing but thei pull down both their hous and pull them so limb from limb that thei left not the least stick stand or scarc ani sign on the ground where thei stood thei tore all their littl collect householdstuff in piec and threw everi thing about in such a manner that the poor men found afterward some of their thing a mile off from their habit when thei had done thi thei pull up all the young tree which the poor men had plant pull up the enclosur thei had made to secur their cattl and their corn and in a word sack and plunder everi thing as complet as a herd of tartar would have done the two men were at thi junctur gone to find them out and had resolv to fight them wherev thei had been though thei were but two to three so that had thei met there certainli would have been bloodsh among them for thei were all veri stout resolut fellow to give them their due but provid took more care to keep them asund than thei themselv could do to meet for as thei had dog on anoth when the three were gone thither the two were here and afterward when the two went back to find them the three were come to the old habit again we shall see their differ conduct present when the three came back like furiou creatur flush with the rage which the work thei had been about put them into thei came up to the spaniard and told them what thei had done by wai of scoff and bravado and on of them step up to on of the spaniard as if thei had been a coupl of boi at plai take hold of hi hat as it wa upon hi head and give it a twirl about jeer in hi face sai he to him and you seignior jack spaniard shall have the same sauc if you do not mend your manner the spaniard who though quit a civil man wa as brave as a man could desir to be and withal a strong wellmad man look steadili at him for a good while and then have no weapon in hi hand step grave up to him and with on blow of hi fist knock him down as an ox is fell with a poleax at which on of the rogu insol as the first fix hi pistol at the spaniard immedi he miss hi bodi inde for the bullet went through hi hair but on of them touch the tip of hi ear and he bled pretti much the blood made the spaniard believ he wa more hurt than he realli wa and that put him into some heat for befor he act all in a perfect calm but now resolv to go through with hi work he stoop and took the fellow musket whom he had knock down and wa just go to shoot the man who had fire at him when the rest of the spaniard be in the cave came out and call to him not to shoot thei step in secur the other two and took their arm from them when thei were thu disarm and found thei had made all the spaniard their enemi as well as their own countrymen thei began to cool and give the spaniard better word would have had their arm again but the spaniard consid the feud that wa between them and the other two englishmen and that it would be the best method thei could take to keep them from on anoth told them thei would do them no harm and if thei would live peaceabl thei would be veri will to assist and associ with them as thei did befor but that thei could not think of give them their arm again while thei appear so resolv to do mischief with them to their own countrymen and had even threaten them all to make them their servant the rogu were now more capabl to hear reason than to act reason but be refus their arm thei went rave awai and rage like madmen threaten what thei would do though thei had no firearm but the spaniard despis their threaten told them thei should take care how thei offer ani injuri to their plantat or cattl for if thei did thei would shoot them as thei would do raven beast wherev thei found them and if thei fell into their hand aliv thei would certainli be hang howev thi wa far from cool them but awai thei went swear

made for themselv so thei had littl to do when thei were will to rise but to get upon their feet and perhap put on a coat such as it wa and their pump and thei were readi for go ani wai that their thought guid them be thu got up he look out but be dark he could see littl or noth and besid the tree which i had plant and which were now grown tall intercept hi sight so that he could onli look up and see that it wa a starlight night and hear no nois he return and lai down again but to no purpos he could not compos himself to anyth like rest but hi thought were to the last degre uneasi and he knew not for what have made some nois with rise and walk about go out and come in anoth of them wake and call ask who it wa that wa up the governor told him how it had been with him sai you so sai the other spaniard such thing ar not to be slight i assur you there is certainli some mischief work sai he near us and present he ask him where ar the englishmen thei ar all in their hut sai he safe enough it seem the spaniard had kept possess of the main apart and had made a place where the three englishmen sinc their last mutini alwai quarter by themselv and could not come at the rest well sai the spaniard there is someth in it i am persuad from my own experi i am satisfi our spirit embodi have convers with and receiv intellig from the spirit unembodi and inhabit the invis world and thi friendli notic is given for our advantag if we know how to make us of it come sai he let us go out and look abroad and if we find noth at all in it to justifi our troubl ill tell you a stori of the purpos that shall convinc you of the justic of my propos it in a word thei went out to go to the top of the hill where i us to go but thei be strong and in good compani nor alon as i wa us none of my caution to go up by the ladder and then pull it up after them to go up a second stage to the top but were go round through the grove unconcern and unwari when thei were surpris with see a light as of fire a veri littl wai off from them and hear the voic of men not of on or two but of a great number in all the discoveri i had made of the savag land on the island it wa my constant care to prevent them make the least discoveri of there be ani inhabit upon the place and when by ani necess thei came to know it thei felt it so effect that thei that got awai were scarc abl to give ani account of it for we disappear as soon as possibl nor did ever ani that had seen me escap to tell ani on els except it were the three savag in our last encount who jump into the boat of whom i mention that i wa afraid thei should go home and bring more help whether it wa the consequ of the escap of those men that so great a number came now togeth or whether thei came ignorantli and by accid on their usual bloodi errand the spaniard could not it seem understand but whatev it wa it had been their busi either to have conceal themselv and not have seen them at all much less to have let the savag have seen that there were ani inhabit in the place but to have fallen upon them so effectu as that not a man of them should have escap which could onli have been by get in between them and their boat but thi presenc of mind wa want to them which wa the ruin of their tranquil for a great while we need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him surpris with thi sight ran back immedi and rais their fellow give them an account of the immin danger thei were all in and thei again as readili took the alarm but it wa imposs to persuad them to stai close within where thei were but that thei must all run out to see how thing stood while it wa dark inde thei were well enough and thei had opportun enough for some hour to view them by the light of three fire thei had made at some distanc from on anoth what thei were do thei knew not and what to do themselv thei knew not for first the enemi were too mani and secondli thei did not keep togeth but were divid into sever parti and were on shore in sever place the spaniard were in no small constern at thi sight and as thei found that the fellow ran straggl all over the shore thei made no doubt but first or last some of them would chop in upon their habit or upon some other place where thei would see the token of inhabit and thei were in great perplex also for fear of their flock of goat which would have been littl less than starv them if thei should have been destroi so the first thing thei resolv upon wa to dispatch three men awai befor it wa light viz two spaniard and on englishman to drive all the goat awai to the great vallei where the cave wa and if need were to drive them into the veri cave itself could thei have seen the savag all togeth in on bodi and at a distanc from their cano thei resolv if there had been an hundr of them to have attack them but that could not be obtain for there were some of them two mile off from the other and as it appear afterward were of two differ nation after have muse a great while on the cours thei should take and beaten their brain in consid their present circumst thei resolv at last while it wa dark to send the old savag fridai father out as a spy to learn if possibl someth concern them as what thei came for and what thei intend to do and the like the old man readili undertook it and strip himself quit nake as most of the savag were awai he went after he had been gone an hour or two he bring word that he had been among them undiscov that he found thei were two parti and of two sever nation who had war with on anoth and had had a great battl in their own countri and that both side have had sever prison taken in the fight thei were by mere chanc land in the same island for the devour their prison and make merri but thi come so by chanc to the same place had spoil all their mirth that thei were in a great rage at on anoth and were so near that he believ thei would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear he did not perceiv that thei had ani notion of anybodi be on the island but themselv he had hardli made an end of tell the stori when thei could perceiv by the unusu nois thei made that the two littl armi were engag in a bloodi fight fridai father us all the argument he could to persuad our peopl to lie close and not be seen he told them their safeti consist in it and that thei had noth to do but to lie still and the savag would kill on anoth to their hand and the rest would go awai and it wa so to a tittl but it wa imposs to prevail especi upon the englishmen their curios wa so importun upon their prudenti that thei must run out and see the battl howev thei us some caution viz thei did not go openli just by their own dwell but went farther into the wood and place themselv to advantag where thei might secur see them manag the fight and as thei thought not to be seen by them but it seem the savag did see them as we shall find hereaft the battl wa veri fierc and if i might believ the englishmen on of them said he could perceiv that some of them were men of great braveri of invinc spirit and of great polici in guid the fight the battl thei said held two hour befor thei could guess which parti would be beaten but then that parti which wa nearest our peopl habit began to appear weakest and after some time more some of them began to fly and thi put our men again into a great constern lest ani of those that fled should run into the grove befor their dwell for shelter and therebi involuntarili discov the place and that by consequ the pursuer should do the like in search for them upon thi thei resolv that thei would stand arm within the wall and whoever came into the grove thei should salli out over the wall and kill them so that if possibl not on should return to give an account of it thei order also that it should be done with their sword or by knock them down with the stock of the musket not by shoot them for fear of rais an alarm by the nois as thei expect it fell out three of the rout armi fled for life and cross the creek ran directli into the place not in the least know whither thei went but run as into a thick wood for shelter the scout thei kept to look abroad gave notic of thi within with thi addit to our men great satisfact viz that the conqueror had not pursu them or seen which wai thei were gone upon thi the spaniard governor a man of human would not suffer them to kill the three fugit but send three men out by the top of the hill order them to go round and come in behind them surpris and take them prison which wa done the residu of the conquer peopl fled to their cano and got off to sea the victor retir and made no pursuit or veri littl but draw themselv into a bodi togeth gave two great scream shout which thei suppos were by wai of triumph and so the fight end and the same dai about three oclock in the afternoon thei also march to their cano and thu the spaniard had their island again free to themselv their fright wa over and thei saw no savag in sever year after after thei were all gone the spaniard came out of their den and view the field of battl thei found about twoandthirti dead men upon the spot some were kill with great long arrow sever of which were found stick in their bodi but most of them were kill with their great wooden sword sixteen or seventeen of which thei found in the field of battl and as mani bow with a great mani arrow these sword were great unwieldi thing and thei must be veri strong men that us them most of those men that were kill with them had their head mash to piec as we mai sai or as we call it in english their brain knock out and sever of their arm and leg broken so that it is evid thei fight with inexpress rage and furi thei found not on wound man that wa not stone dead for either thei stai by their enemi till thei have quit kill them or thei carri all the wound men that ar not quit dead awai with them thi deliver tame our englishmen for a great while the sight had fill them with horror and the consequ appear terribl to the last degre especi upon suppos that some time or other thei should fall into the hand of those creatur who would not onli kill them as enemi but kill them for food as we kill our cattl and thei profess to me that the thought of be eaten up like beef or mutton though it wa suppos it wa not to be till thei were dead had someth in it so horribl that it nauseat their veri stomach made them sick when thei thought of it and fill their mind with unusu terror that thei were not themselv for some week after thi as i said tame even the three english brute i have been speak of and for a great while after thei were veri tractabl and went about the common busi of the whole societi well enough plant sow reap and began to be all natur to the countri but some time after thi thei fell all into such simpl measur again as brought them into a great deal of troubl thei had taken three prison as i had observ and these three be lusti stout young fellow thei made them servant and taught them to work for them and as slave thei did well enough but thei did not take their measur with them as i did by my man fridai viz to begin with them upon the principl of have save their live and then instruct them in the ration principl of life much less of religion civil and reduc them by kind usag and affection argu but as thei gave them their food everi dai so thei gave them their work too and kept them fulli emploi in drudgeri enough but thei fail in thi by it that thei never had them to assist them and fight for them as i had my man fridai who wa as true to me as the veri flesh upon my bone but to come to the famili part be all now good friend for common danger as i said abov had effectu reconcil them thei began to consid their gener circumst and the first thing that came under their consider wa whether see the savag particularli haunt that side of the island and that there were more remot and retir part of it equal adapt to their wai of live and manifestli to their advantag thei should not rather remov their habit and plant in some more proper place for their safeti and especi for the secur of their cattl and corn upon thi after long debat it wa conceiv that thei should not remov their habit becaus that some time or other thei thought thei might hear from their governor again mean me and if i should send ani on to seek them i would be sure to direct them on that side where if thei should find the place demolish thei would conclud the savag had kill us all and we were gone and so our suppli would go awai too but as to their corn and cattl thei agre to remov them into the vallei where my cave wa where the land wa as proper to both and where inde there wa land enough howev upon second thought thei alter on part of that resolut too and resolv onli to remov part of their cattl thither and plant part of their corn there and so if on part wa destroi the other might be save and on piec of prudenc thei us which it wa veri well thei did viz that thei never trust these three savag which thei had taken prison with know ani thing of the plantat thei had made in that vallei or of ani cattl thei had there much less of the cave there which thei kept in case of necess as a safe retreat and thither thei carri also the two barrel of powder which i had left them at my come awai but howev thei resolv not to chang their habit yet thei agre that as i had carefulli cover it first with a wall and fortif and then with a grove of tree so see their safeti consist entir in their be conceal of which thei were now fulli convinc thei set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectu than befor to thi purpos as i had plant tree or rather thrust in stake which in time all grew to be tree for some good distanc befor the entranc into my apart thei went on in the same manner and fill up the rest of that whole space of ground from the tree i had set quit down to the side of the creek where as i said i land my float and even into the veri ooz where the tide flow not so much as leav ani place to land or ani sign that there had been ani land thereabout these stake also be of a wood veri forward to grow as i had note formerli thei took care to have gener veri much larger and taller than those which i had plant and place them so veri thick and close that when thei had been three or four year grown there wa no pierc with the ey ani consider wai into the plantat as for that part which i had plant the tree were grown as thick as a man thigh and among them thei place so mani other short on and so thick that in a word it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick and it wa next to imposs to penetr it but with a littl armi to cut it all down for a littl dog could hardli get between the tree thei stood so close but thi wa not all for thei did the same by all the ground to the right hand and to the left and round even to the top of the hill leav no wai not so much as for themselv to come out but by the ladder place up to the side of the hill and then lift up and place again from the first stage up to the top which ladder when it wa taken down noth but what had wing or witchcraft to assist it could come at them thi wa excel well contriv nor wa it less than what thei afterward found occas for which serv to convinc me that as human prudenc ha author of provid to justifi it so it ha doubtless the direct of provid to set it to work and would we listen carefulli to the voic of it i am fulli persuad we might prevent mani of the disast which our live ar now by our own neglig subject to but thi by the wai i return to the stori thei live two year after thi in perfect retir and had no more visit from the savag thei had inde an alarm given them on morn which put them in a great constern for some of the spaniard be out earli on morn on the west side or rather end of the island which by the wai wa that end where i never went for fear of be discov thei were surpris with see abov twenti cano of indian just come on shore thei made the best of their wai home in hurri enough and give the alarm to their comrad thei kept close all that dai and the next go out onli at night to make observ but thei had the good luck to be mistaken for wherev the savag went thei did not land at that time on the island but pursu some other design and now thei had anoth broil with the three englishmen on of which a most turbul fellow be in a rage at on of the three slave which i mention thei had taken becaus the fellow had not done someth right which he bid him do and seem a littl untract in hi shew him drew a hatchet out of a frogbelt in which he bore it by hi side and fell upon him the poor savag not to correct him but to kill him on of the spaniard who wa by see him give the fellow a barbar cut with the hatchet which he aim at hi head but struck into hi shoulder so that he thought he had cut the poor creatur arm off ran to him and entreat him not to murder the poor man clapt in between him and the savag to prevent the mischief the fellow be enrag the more at thi struck at the spaniard with hi hatchet and swore he would serv him as he intend to serv the savag which the spaniard perceiv avoid the blow and with a shovel which he had in hi hand for thei were work in the field about the cornland knock the brute down anoth of the englishmen run at the same time to help hi comrad knock the spaniard down and then two spaniard more came to help their man and a third englishman fell upon them thei had none of them ani firearm or ani other weapon but hatchet and other tool except the third englishman he had on of my old rusti cutlass with which he made at the last spaniard and wound them both thi frai set the whole famili in an uproar and more help come in thei took the three englishmen prison the next question wa what should be done with them thei had been so often mutin and were so furiou so desper and so idl withal that thei knew not what cours to take with them for thei were mischiev to the highest degre and valu not what hurt thei did ani man so that in short it wa not safe to live with them the spaniard who wa governor told them in so mani word that if thei had been hi own countrymen he would have hang them all for all law and all governor were to preserv societi and those who were danger to the societi ought to be expel out of it but as thei were englishmen and that it wa to the gener kind of an englishman that thei all ow their preserv and deliver he would us them with all possibl leniti and would leav them to the judgment of the other two englishmen who were their countrymen on of the two honest englishmen stood up and said thei desir it might not be left to them for sai he i am sure we ought to sentenc them to the gallow and with that give an account how will atkin on of the three had propos to have all the five englishmen join togeth and murder all the spaniard when thei were in their sleep when the spanish governor heard thi he call to will atkin how seignior atkin sai he will you murder us all what have you to sai to that that harden villain wa so far from deni it that he said it wa true and gd dmn him thei would do it still befor thei had done with them well but seignior atkin said the spaniard what have we done to you that you will kill us and what would you get by kill us and what must we do to prevent your kill us must we kill you or will you kill us why will you put us to the necess of thi seignior atkin sai the spaniard veri calmli and smile seignior atkin wa in such a rage at the spaniard make a jest of it that had he not been held by three men and withal had no weapon with him it wa thought he would have attempt to have kill the spaniard in the middl of all the compani thi harebrain carriag oblig them to consid serious what wa to be done the two englishmen and the spaniard who save the poor savag were of the opinion that thei should hang on of the three for an exampl to the rest and that particularli it should be he that had twice attempt to commit murder with hi hatchet and inde there wa some reason to believ he had done it for the poor savag wa in such a miser condit with the wound he had receiv that it wa thought he could not live but the governor spaniard still said no it wa an englishman that had save all their live and he would never consent to put an englishman to death though he had murder half of them nai he said if he had been kill himself by an englishman and had time left to speak it should be that thei should pardon him thi wa so posit insist on by the governor spaniard that there wa no gainsai it and as merci counsel ar most apt to prevail where thei ar so earnestli press so thei all came into it but then it wa to be consid what should be done to keep them from the mischief thei design for all agre governor and all that mean were to be us for preserv the societi from danger after a long debat it wa agre first that thei should be disarm and not permit to have either gun or powder or shot or sword or ani weapon and should be turn out of the societi and left to live where thei would and how thei could by themselv but that none of the rest either spaniard or english should convers with them speak with them or have ani thing to do with them that thei should be forbid to come within a certain distanc of the place where the rest dwelt and that if thei offer to commit ani disord so as to spoil burn kill or destroi ani of the corn plant build fenc or cattl belong to the societi that thei should die without merci and would shoot them wherev thei could find them the governor a man of great human muse upon the sentenc consid a littl upon it and turn to the two honest englishmen said hold you must reflect that it will be long er thei can rais corn and cattl of their own and thei must not starv we must therefor allow them provis so he caus to be ad that thei should have a proport of corn given them to last them eight month and for seed to sow by which time thei might be suppos to rais some of their own that thei should have six milchgoat four hegoat and six kid given them as well for present subsist as for a store and that thei should have tool given them for their work in the field such as six hatchet an ax a saw and the like but thei should have none of these tool or provis unless thei would swear solemnli that thei would not hurt or injur ani of the spaniard with them or of their fellow englishmen thu thei dismiss them the societi and turn them out to shift for themselv thei went awai sullen and refractori as neither content to go awai or to stai but as there wa no remedi thei went pretend to go and choos a place where thei should settl themselv to plant and live by themselv and some provis were given but no weapon about four or five dai after thei came again for some victual and gave the governor an account where thei had pitch their tent and mark themselv out an habit or plantat it wa a veri conveni place inde on the remotest part of the island ne much about the place where i providenti land in my first voyag when i wa driven out to sea the lord alon know whither in my foolish attempt to surround the island here thei built themselv two handsom hut and contriv them in a manner like my first habit be close under the side of a hill have some tree grow alreadi to the three side of it so that by plant other it would be veri easili cover from the sight unless narrowli search for thei desir some dry goatskin for bed and cover which were given them and upon their give their word that thei would not disturb the rest or injur ani of their plantat thei gave them hatchet and what other tool thei could spare some pea barlei and rice for sow and in a word ani thing thei want but arm and ammunit thei live in thi separ condit about six month and had got in their first harvest though the quantiti wa but small the parcel of land thei had plant be but littl for inde have all their plantat to form thei had a great deal of work upon their hand and when thei came to make board and pot and such thing thei were quit out of their element and could make noth of it and when the raini season came on for want of a cave in the earth thei could not keep their grain dry and it wa in great danger of spoil and thi humbl them much so thei came and beg the spaniard to help them which thei veri readili did and in four dai work a great hole in the side of the hill for them big enough to secur their corn and other thing from the rain but it wa but a poor place at best compar to mine and especi as mine wa then for the spaniard had greatli enlarg it and made sever new apart in it about three quarter of a year after thi separ a new frolic took these rogu which togeth with the former villani thei had commit brought mischief enough upon them and had veri near been the ruin of the whole coloni the three new associ began it seem to be weari of the labori life thei led and that without hope of better their circumst and a whim took them that thei would make a voyag to the contin from whenc the savag came and would try if thei could not seiz upon some prison among the nativ there and bring them home so as to make them do the labori part of the work for them the project wa not so preposter if thei had gone no farther but thei did noth and propos noth but had either mischief in the design or mischief in the event and if i mai give my opinion thei seem to be under a blast from heaven for if we will not allow a visibl curs to pursu visibl crime how shall we reconcil the event of thing with divin justic it wa certainli an appar vengeanc on their crime of mutini and piraci that brought them to the state thei were in and as thei shew not the least remors for the crime but ad new villani to it such as particularli that piec of monstrou cruelti of wound a poor slave becaus he did not or perhap could not understand to do what he wa direct and to wound him in such a manner as no question made him a crippl all hi life and in a place where no surgeon or medicin could be had for hi cure and what wa still wors the murder intent or to do justic to the crime the intent murder for such to be sure it wa as wa afterward the form design thei all laid to murder the spaniard in cold blood and in their sleep but i leav observ and return to the stori the three fellow came down to the spaniard on morn and in veri humbl term desir to be admit to speak with them the spaniard veri readili heard what thei had to sai which wa thi that thei were tire of live in the manner thei did that thei were not handi enough to make the necessari thei want and that have no help thei found thei should be starv but if the spaniard would give them leav to take on of the cano which thei came over in and give them arm and ammunit proport for their defenc thei would go over to the main and seek their fortun and so deliv them from the troubl of suppli them with ani other provis the spaniard were glad enough to be rid of them but yet veri honestli repres to them the certain destruct thei were run into told them thei had suffer such hardship upon that veri spot that thei could without ani spirit of propheci tell them that thei would be starv or murder and bade them consid of it the men repli audaci thei should be starv if thei stai here for thei could not work and would not work and thei could but be starv abroad and if thei were murder there wa an end of them thei had no wive or children to cry after them and in short insist importun upon their demand declar that thei would go whether thei would give them ani arm or no the spaniard told them with great kind that if thei were resolv to go thei should not go like nake men and be in no condit to defend themselv and that though thei could ill spare their firearm have not enough for themselv yet thei would let them have two musket a pistol and a cutlass and each man a hatchet which thei thought suffici for them in a word thei accept the offer and have bake them bread enough to serv them a month and given them as much goat flesh as thei could eat while it wa sweet and a great basket full of dri grape a pot full of fresh water and a young kid aliv to kill thei boldli set out in a cano for a voyag over the sea where it wa at least forti mile broad the boat wa inde a larg on and would have veri well carri fifteen or twenti men and therefor wa rather too big for them to manag but as thei had a fair breez and the floodtid with them thei did well enough thei had made a mast of a long pole and a sail of four larg goatskin dri which thei had sew or lace togeth and awai thei went merrili enough the spaniard call after them bon veajo and no man ever thought of see them ani more the spaniard would often sai to on anoth and the two honest englishmen who remain behind how quietli and comfort thei live now those three turbul fellow were gone as for their ever come again that wa the remotest thing from their thought could be imagin when behold after twentytwo dai absenc on of the englishmen be abroad upon hi plant work see three strang men come toward him at a distanc two of them with gun upon their shoulder awai run the englishman as if he wa bewitch and becam fright and amaz to the governor spaniard and tell him thei were all undon for there were stranger land upon the island he could not tell who the spaniard paus a while sai to him how do you mean you cannot tell who thei ar savag to be sureno no sai the englishman thei ar men in cloth with armsnai then sai the spaniard why ar you concern if thei ar not savag thei must be friend for there is no christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than harm while thei were debat thu came the three englishmen and stand without the wood which wa newplant halloo to them thei present knew their voic and so all the wonder of that kind ceas but now the admir wa turn upon anoth question viz what could be the matter and what made them come back again it wa not long befor thei brought the men in and inquir where thei had been and what thei had been do thei gave them a full account of their voyag in a few word viz that thei reach the land in two dai or someth less but find the peopl alarm at their come and prepar with bow and arrow to fight them thei durst not go on shore but sail on to the northward six or seven hour till thei came to a great open by which thei perceiv that the land thei saw from our island wa not the main but an island that enter that open of the sea thei saw anoth island on the right hand north and sever more west and be resolv to land somewher thei put over to on of the island which lai west and went boldli on shore that thei found the peopl were courteou and friendli to them and thei gave them sever root and some dri fish and appear veri sociabl and the women as well as the men were veri forward to suppli them with ani thing thei could get for them to eat and brought it to them a great wai upon their head thei continu here four dai and inquir as well as thei could of them by sign what nation were thi wai and that wai and were told of sever fierc and terribl peopl that live almost everi wai who as thei made known by sign to them us to eat men but as for themselv thei said that thei never at men or women except onli such as thei took in the war and then thei own that thei made a great feast and at their prison the englishmen inquir when thei had a feast of that kind and thei told them two moon ago point to the moon and then to twofing and that their great king had two hundr prison now which he had taken in hi war and thei were feed them to make them fat for the next feast the englishmen seem mighti desir to see those prison but the other mistak them thought thei were desir to have some of them to carri awai for their own eat so thei beckon to them point to the set of the sun and then to the rise which wa to signifi that the next morn at sunris thei would bring some for them and accordingli the next morn thei brought down five women and eleven men and gave them to the englishmen to carri with them on their voyag just as we would bring so mani cow and oxen down to a seaport town to victual a ship as brutish and barbar as these fellow were at home their stomach turn at thi sight and thei did not know what to do to refus the prison would have been the highest affront to the savag gentri that offer them and what to do with them thei knew not howev upon some debat thei resolv to accept of them and in return thei gave the savag that brought them on of their hatchet an old kei a knife and six or seven of their bullet which though thei did not understand thei seem extrem pleas with and then ty the poor creatur hand behind them thei the peopl drag the prison into the boat for our men the englishmen were oblig to come awai as soon as thei had them or els thei that gave them hi nobl present would certainli have expect that thei should have gone to work with them have kill two or three of them the next morn and perhap have invit the donor to dinner but have taken their leav with all the respect and thank that could well pass between peopl where on either side thei understood not on word thei could sai thei put off with their boat and came back toward the first island where when thei arriv thei set eight of their prison at liberti there be too mani of them for their occas in their voyag thei endeavour to have some commun with their prison but it wa imposs to make them understand ani thing noth thei could sai to them or give them or do for them but wa look upon as go about to murder them thei first of all unbound them but the poor creatur scream at that especi the women as if thei had just felt the knife at their throat for thei immedi conclud thei were unbound on purpos to be kill if thei gave them ani thing to eat it wa the same thing then thei conclud it wa for fear thei should sink in flesh and so not be fat enough to kill if thei look at on of them more particularli the parti present conclud it wa to see whether he or she wa fattest and fittest to kill first nai after thei had brought them quit over and began to us them kindli and treat them well still thei expect everi dai to make a dinner or supper for their new master when the three wander had given thi unaccount histori or journal of their voyag the spaniard ask them where their new famili wa and be told that thei had brought them on shore and put them into on of their hut and were come to beg some victual for them thei the spaniard and the other two englishmen that is to sai the whole coloni resolv to go all down to the place and see them and did so and fridai father with them when thei came into the hut there thei sat all bound for when thei had brought them on shore thei bound their hand that thei might not take the boat and make their escap there i sai thei sat all of them stark nake first there were three men lusti come fellow well shape straight and fair limb about thirti or thirtyf year of ag and five women whereof two might be from thirti to forti two more not abov twentyfour or twentyf and the fifth a tall come maiden about sixteen or seventeen the women were wellfavour agreeabl person both in shape and featur onli tawni and two of them had thei been perfect white would have pass for handsom women even in london itself have veri pleasant agreeabl counten and of a veri modest behaviour especi when thei came afterward to be cloth and dress as thei call it though that dress wa veri indiffer it must be confess of which hereaft the sight you mai be sure wa someth uncouth to our spaniard who were to give them a just charact men of the best behaviour of the most calm sedat temper and perfect good humour that ever i met with and in particular of the most modesti as will present appear i sai the sight wa veri uncouth to see three nake men and five nake women all togeth bound and in the most miser circumst that human natur could be suppos to be viz to be expect everi moment to be drag out and have their brain knock out and then to be eaten up like a calf that is kill for a dainti the first thing thei did wa to caus the old indian fridai father to go in and see first if he knew ani of them and then if he understood ani of their speech as soon as the old man came in he look serious at them but knew none of them neither could ani of them understand a word he said or a sign he could make except on of the women howev thi wa enough to answer the end which wa to satisfi them that the men into whose hand thei were fallen were christian that thei abhor eat of men or women and that thei might be sure thei would not be kill as soon as thei were assur of thi thei discov such a joi and by such awkward and sever wai as is hard to describ for it seem thei were of sever nation the woman who wa their interpret wa bid in the next place to ask them if thei were will to be servant and to work for the men who had brought them awai to save their live at which thei all fell a danc and present on fell to take up thi and anoth that ani thing that lai next to carri on their shoulder to intim that thei were will to work the governor who found that the have women among them would present be attend with some inconveni and might occas some strife and perhap blood ask the three men what thei intend to do with these women and how thei intend to us them whether as servant or as women on of the englishmen answer veri boldli and readili that thei would us them as both to which the governor said i am not go to restrain you from it you ar your own master as to that but thi i think is but just for avoid disord and quarrel among you and i desir it of you for that reason onli viz that you will all engag that if ani of you take ani of these women as a woman or wife he shall take but on and that have taken on none els should touch her for though we cannot marri ani of you yet it is but reason that while you stai here the woman ani of you take should be maintain by the man that take her and should be hi wife i mean sai he while he continu here and that none els should have ani thing to do with her all thi appear so just that everi on agre to it without ani difficulti then the englishmen ask the spaniard if thei design to take ani of them but everi on answer no some of them said thei had wive in spain and the other did not like women that were not christian and all togeth declar that thei would not touch on of them which wa an instanc of such virtu as i have not met with in all my travel on the other hand to be short the five englishmen took them everi on a wife that is to sai a temporari wife and so thei set up a new form of live for the spaniard and fridai father live in my old habit which thei had enlarg exceedingli within the three servant which thei had taken in the late battl of the savag live with them and these carri on the main part of the coloni suppli all the rest with food and assist them in ani thing as thei could or as thei found necess requir but the wonder of thi stori wa how five such refractori illmatch fellow should agre about these women and that two of them should not pitch upon the same woman especi see two or three of them were without comparison more agreeabl than the other but thei took a good wai enough to prevent quarrel among themselv for thei set the five women by themselv in on of their hut and thei went all into the other hut and drew lot among them who should choos first he that drew to choos first went awai by himself to the hut where the poor nake creatur were and fetch out her he chose and it wa worth observ that he that chose first took her that wa reckon the homeliest and the oldest of the five which made mirth enough among the rest and even the spaniard laugh at it but the fellow consid better than ani of them that it wa applic and busi that thei were to expect assist in as much as ani thing els and she prove the best wife in the parcel when the poor women saw themselv in a row thu and fetch out on by on the terror of their condit return upon them again and thei firmli believ that thei were now go to be devour accordingli when the english sailor came in and fetch out on of them the rest set up a most lament cry and hung about her and took their leav of her with such agoni and such affect as would have griev the hardest heart in the world nor wa it possibl for the englishmen to satisfi them that thei were not to be immedi murder till thei fetch the old man fridai father who instantli let them know that the five men who had fetch them out on by on had chosen them for their wive when thei had done thi and the fright the women were in wa a littl over the men went to work and the spaniard came and help them and in a few hour thei had built them everi on a new hut or tent for their lodg apart for those thei had alreadi were crowd with their tool household stuff and provis the three wick on had pitch farthest off and the two honest on nearer but both on the north shore of the island so that thei continu separ as befor and thu my island wa peopl in three place and as i might sai three town were begun to be plant and here it is veri well worth observ that as it often happen in the world what the wise end of god provid ar in such a disposit of thing i cannot sai the two honest fellow had the two worst wive and the three reprob that were scarc worth hang that were fit for noth and neither seem born to do themselv good or ani on els had three clever dilig care and ingeni wive not that the two first were ill wive as to their temper or humour for all the five were most will quiet passiv and subject creatur rather like slave than wive but my mean is thei were not alik capabl ingeni or industri or alik cleanli and neat anoth observ i must make to the honour of a dilig applic on the on hand and to the disgrac of a sloth neglig idl temper on the other that when i came to the place and view the sever improv plant and manag of the sever littl coloni the two men had so far outgon the three that there wa no comparison thei had inde both of them as much ground laid out for corn as thei want and the reason wa becaus accord to my rule natur dictat that it wa to no purpos to sow more corn than thei want but the differ of the cultiv of the plant of the fenc and inde everi thing els wa easi to be seen at first view the two men had innumer young tree plant about their hut that when you came to the place noth wa to be seen but a wood and though thei had their plantat twice demolish onc by their own countrymen and onc by the enemi as shall be shewn in it place yet thei had restor all again and everi thing wa flourish and thrive about them thei had grape plant in order and manag like a vineyard though thei had themselv never seen ani thing of that kind and by their good order their vine their grape were as good again as ani of the other thei had also form themselv a retreat in the thickest part of the wood where though there wa not a natur cave as i had found yet thei made on with incess labour of their hand and where when the mischief which follow happen thei secur their wive and children so as thei could never be found thei have by stick innumer stake and pole of the wood which as i said grow so easili made a grove impass except in on place where thei climb up to get over the outsid part and then went in by wai of their own leav as to the three reprob as i justli call them though thei were much civil by their new settlement compar to what thei were befor and were not so quarrelsom have not the same opportun yet on of the certain companion of a proflig mind never left them and that wa their idl it is true thei plant corn and made fenc but solomon word were never better verifi than in them i went by the vineyard of the sloth and it wa overgrown with thorn for when the spaniard came to view their crop thei could not see it in some place for weed the hedg had sever gap in it where the wild goat had gotten in and eaten up the corn perhap here and there a dead bush wa cram in to stop them out for the present but it wa onli shut the stabl door after the steed wa stolen wherea when thei look on the coloni of the other two here wa the veri face of industri and success upon all thei did there wa not a weed to be seen in all their corn or a gap in ani of their hedg and thei on the other hand verifi solomon word in anoth place the dilig hand maketh rich for everi thing grew and thrive and thei had plenti within and without thei had more tame cattl than the other more utensil and necessari within door and yet more pleasur and divers too it is true the wive of the three were veri handi and cleanli within door and have learnt the english wai of dress and cook from on of the other englishmen who as i said wa a cook mate on board the ship thei dress their husband victual veri nice wherea the other could not be brought to understand it but then the husband who as i said had been cook mate did it himself but as for the husband of the three wive thei loiter about fetch turtl egg and caught fish and bird in a word ani thing but labour and thei fare accordingli the dilig live well and comfort and the sloth live hard and beggarli and so i believ gener speak it is all over the world but now i come to a scene differ from all that had happen befor either to them or me and the origin of the stori wa thi earli on morn there came on shore five or six cano of indian or savag call them which you pleas and there is no room to doubt that thei came upon the old errand of feed upon their slave but that part wa now so familiar to the spaniard and to our men too that thei did not concern themselv about it as i did but have been made sensibl by their experi that their onli busi wa to lie conceal and that if thei were not seen by ani of the savag thei would go off again quietli when the busi wa done have as yet not the least notion of there be ani inhabit in the island i sai have been made sensibl of thi thei had noth to do but to give notic to all the three plantat to keep within door and not to shew themselv onli place a scout in a proper place to give notic when the boat went off to sea again thi wa without doubt veri right but a disast spoil all these measur and made it known among the savag that there were inhabit there which wa in the end the desol of almost the whole coloni after the cano with the savag were gone off the spaniard peep abroad again and some of them had the curios to go to the place where thei had been to see what thei had been do here to their great surpris thei found three savag left behind and ly fast asleep upon the ground it wa suppos thei had either been so gorg with their inhuman feast that like beast thei were asleep and would not stir when the other went or thei were wander into the wood and did not come back in time to be taken in the spaniard were greatli surpris at thi sight and perfectli at a loss what to do the spaniard governor as it happen wa with them and hi advic wa ask but he profess he knew not what to do as for slave thei had enough alreadi and as to kill them thei were none of them inclin to that the spaniard governor told me thei could not think of shed innoc blood for as to them the poor creatur had done no wrong invad none of their properti and thei thought thei had no just quarrel against them to take awai their live and here i must in justic to these spaniard observ that let all the account of spanish cruelti in mexico and peru be what thei will i never met with seventeen men of ani nation whatsoev in ani foreign countri who were so univers modest temper virtuou so veri goodhumour and so courteou as these spaniard and as to cruelti thei had noth of it in their veri natur no inhuman no barbar no outrag passion and yet all of them men of great courag and spirit their temper and calm had appear in their bear the insuffer usag of the three englishmen and their justic and human appear now in the case of the savag as abov after some consult thei resolv upon thi that thei would lie still a while longer till if possibl these three men might be gone but then the governor spaniard recollect that the three savag had no boat and that if thei were left to rove about the island thei would certainli discov that there were inhabit in it and so thei should be undon that wai upon thi thei went back again and there lai the fellow fast asleep still so thei resolv to awaken them and take them prison and thei did so the poor fellow were strang fright when thei were seiz upon and bound and afraid like the women that thei should be murder and eaten for it seem those peopl think all the world do as thei do eat men flesh but thei were soon made easi as to that and awai thei carri them it wa veri happi for them that thei did not carri them home to their castl i mean to my palac under the hill but thei carri them first to the bower where wa the chief of their countri work such as the keep the goat the plant the corn c and afterward thei carri them to the habit of the two englishmen here thei were set to work though it wa not much thei had for them to do and whether it wa by neglig in guard them or that thei thought the fellow could not mend themselv i know not but on of them ran awai and take into the wood thei could never hear of him more thei had good reason to believ he got home again soon after in some other boat or cano of savag who came on shore three or four week afterward and who carri on their revel as usual went off again in two dai time thi thought terrifi them exceedingli for thei conclud and that not without good caus inde that if thi fellow got safe home among hi comrad he would certainli give them an account that there were peopl in the island as also how weak and few thei were for thi savag as i observ befor had never been told as it wa veri happi he had not how mani thei were or where thei live nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of ani of their gun much less had thei shewn him ani other of their retir place such as the cave in the vallei or the new retreat which the two englishmen had made and the like the first testimoni thei had that thi fellow had given intellig of them wa that about two month after thi six cano of savag with about seven or eight or ten men in a cano came row along the north side of the island where thei never us to come befor and land about an hour after sunris at a conveni place about a mile from the habit of the two englishmen where thi escap man had been kept as the spaniard governor said had thei been all there the damag would not have been so much for not a man of them would have escap but the case differ now veri much for two men to fifti were too much odd the two men had the happi to discov them about a leagu off so that it wa about an hour befor thei land and as thei land about a mile from their hut it wa some time befor thei could come at them now have great reason to believ that thei were betrai the first thing thei did wa to bind the slave which were left and caus two of the three men whom thei brought with the women who it seem prove veri faith to them to lead them with their two wive and whatev thei could carri awai with them to their retir place in the wood which i have spoken of abov and there to bind the two fellow hand and foot till thei heard farther in the next place see the savag were all come on shore and that thei bent their cours directli that wai thei open the fenc where their milchgoat were kept and drove them all out leav their goat to straggl into the wood whither thei pleas that the savag might think thei were all bred wild but the rogu who came with them wa too cun for that and gave them an account of it all for thei went directli to the place when the poor fright men had secur their wive and good thei sent the other slave thei had of the three who came with the women and who wa at their place by accid awai to the spaniard with all speed to give them the alarm and desir speedi help and in the mean time thei took their arm and what ammunit thei had and retreat toward the place in the wood where their wive were sent keep at a distanc yet so that thei might see if possibl which wai the savag took thei had not gone far but that from a rise ground thei could see the littl armi of their enemi come on directli to their habit and in a moment more could see all their hut and householdstuff flame up togeth to their great grief and mortif for thei had a veri great loss and to them irretriev at least for some time thei kept their station for a while till thei found the savag like wild beast spread themselv all over the place rummag everi wai and everi place thei could think of in search for prei and in particular for the peopl of whom it plainli appear thei had intellig the two englishmen see thi think themselv not secur where thei stood as it wa like some of the wild peopl might come that wai so thei might come too mani togeth thought it proper to make anoth retreat about half a mile farther believ as it afterward happen that the farther thei stroll the fewer would be togeth the next halt wa at the entranc into a veri thick grown part of the wood and where an old trunk of a tree stood which wa hollow and vastli larg and in thi tree thei both took their stand resolv to see what might offer thei had not stood there long but two of the savag appear run directli that wai as if thei had alreadi notic where thei stood and were come up to attack them and a littl wai farther thei espi three more come after them and five more beyond them all come the same wai besid which thei saw seven or eight more at a distanc run anoth wai for in a word thei ran everi wai like sportsmen beat for their game the poor men were now in great perplex whether thei should stand and keep their postur or fly but after a veri short debat with themselv thei consid that if the savag rang the countri thu befor help came thei might perhap find out their retreat in the wood and then all would be lost so thei resolv to stand them there and if there were too mani to deal with then thei would get to the top of the tree from whenc thei doubt not to defend themselv fire except as long as their ammunit last though all the savag that were land which were near fifti were to attack them have resolv upon thi thei next consid whether thei should fire at the two first or wait for the three and so take the middl parti by which the two and the five that follow would be separ at length thei resolv to let the two first pass by unless thei should spy them in the tree and come to attack them the two first savag also confirm them in thi resolut by turn a littl from them toward anoth part of the wood but the three and the five after them came forward directli to the tree as if thei had known the englishmen were there see them come so straight toward them thei resolv to take them in a line as thei came and as thei resolv to fire but on at a time perhap the first shot might hit them all three to which purpos the man who wa to fire put three or four bullet into hi piec and have a fair loophol as it were from a broken hole in the tree he took a sure aim without be seen wait till thei were within about thirti yard of the tree so that he could not miss while thei were thu wait and the savag came on thei plainli saw that on of the three wa the runawai savag that had escap from them and thei both knew him distinctli and resolv that if possibl he should not escap though thei should both fire so the other stood readi with hi piec that if he did not drop at the first shot he should be sure to have a second but the first wa too good a marksman to miss hi aim for as the savag kept near on anoth a littl behind in a line he fire and hit two of them directli the foremost wa kill outright be shot in the head the second which wa the runawai indian wa shot through the bodi and fell but wa not quit dead and the third had a littl scratch in the shoulder perhap by the same ball that went through the bodi of the second and be dreadfulli frighten though not so much hurt sat down upon the ground scream and yell in a hideou manner the five that were behind more frighten with the nois than sensibl of the danger stood still at first for the wood made the sound a thousand time bigger than it realli wa the echo rattl from on side to anoth and the fowl rise from all part scream and everi sort make a differ nois accord to their kind just as it wa when i fire the first gun that perhap wa ever shot off in the island howev all be silent again and thei not know what the matter wa came on unconcern till thei came to the place where their companion lai in a condit miser enough here the poor ignor creatur not sensibl that thei were within reach of the same mischief stood all togeth over the wound man talk and as mai be suppos inquir of him how he came to be hurt and who it is veri ration to believ told them that a flash of fire first and immedi after that thunder from their god had kill those two and wound him thi i sai is ration for noth is more certain than that as thei saw no man near them so thei had never heard a gun in all their live nor so much as heard of a gun neither knew thei anyth of kill and wound at a distanc with fire and bullet if thei had on might reason believ thei would not have stood so unconcern to view the fate of their fellow without some apprehens of their own our two men as thei confess to me were griev to be oblig to kill so mani poor creatur who had no notion of their danger yet have them all thu in their power and the first have load hi piec again resolv to let fly both togeth among them and singl out by agreement which to aim at thei shot togeth and kill or veri much wound four of them the fifth frighten even to death though not hurt fell with the rest so that our men see them all fall togeth thought thei had kill them all the belief that the savag were all kill made our two men come boldli out from the tree befor thei had charg their gun which wa a wrong step and thei were under some surpris when thei came to the place and found no less than four of them aliv and of them two veri littl hurt and on not at all thi oblig them to fall upon them with the stock of their musket and first thei made sure of the runawai savag that had been the caus of all the mischief and of anoth that wa hurt in the knee and put them out of their pain then the man that wa not hurt at all came and kneel down to them with hi two hand held up and made piteou moan to them by gestur and sign for hi life but could not sai on word to them that thei could understand howev thei made sign to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by and on of the englishmen with a piec of ropeyarn which he had by great chanc in hi pocket ti hi two hand behind him and there thei left him and with what speed thei could made after the other two which were gone befor fear thei or ani more of them should find the wai to their cover place in the wood where their wive and the few good thei had left lai thei came onc in sight of the two men but it wa at a great distanc howev thei had the satisfact to see them cross over a vallei toward the sea the quit contrari wai from that which led to their retreat which thei were afraid of and be satisfi with that thei went back to the tree where thei left their prison who as thei suppos wa deliv by hi comrad for he wa gone and the two piec of ropeyarn with which thei had bound him lai just at the foot of the tree thei were now in as great a concern as befor not know what cours to take or how near the enemi might be or in what number so thei resolv to go awai to the place where their wive were to see if all wa well there and to make them easi who were in fright enough to be sure for though the savag were their own countryfolk yet thei were most terribl afraid of them and perhap the more for the knowledg thei had of them when thei came thither thei found the savag had been in the wood and veri near the place but had not found it for inde it wa inaccess by the tree stand so thick as befor unless the person seek it had been direct by those that knew it which these were not thei found therefor everi thing veri safe onli the women in a terribl fright while thei were here thei had the comfort of seven of the spaniard come to their assist the other ten with their servant and old fridai i mean fridai father were gone in a bodi to defend their bower and the corn and cattl that were kept there in case the savag should have rove over to that side of the countri but thei did not spread so far with the seven spaniard came on of the savag who as i said were their prison formerli and with them also came the savag whom the englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the tree for it seem thei came that wai saw the slaughter of the seven men and unbound the eighth and brought him along with them where howev thei were oblig to bind him again as thei had done the two other who were left when the third run awai the prison began now to be a burden to them and thei were so afraid of their escap that thei thought thei were under an absolut necess to kill them for their own preserv howev the spaniard governor would not consent to it but order that thei should be sent out of the wai to my old cave in the vallei and be kept there with two spaniard to guard them and give them food which wa done and thei were bound there hand and foot for that night when the spaniard came the two englishmen were so encourag that thei could not satisfi themselv to stai ani longer there but take five of the spaniard and themselv with four musket and a pistol among them and two stout quarterstav awai thei went in quest of the savag and first thei came to the tree where the men lai that had been kill but it wa easi to see that some more of the savag had been there for thei attempt to carri their dead men awai and had drag two of them a good wai but had given it over from thenc thei advanc to the first rise ground where thei had stood and seen their camp destroi and where thei had the mortif still to see some of the smoke but neither could thei here see ani of the savag thei then resolv though with all possibl caution to go forward toward their ruin plantat but a littl befor thei came thither come in sight of the seashor thei saw plainli the savag all embark again in their cano in order to be gone thei seem sorri at first that there wa no wai to come at them to give them a part blow but upon the whole were veri well satisfi to be rid of them the poor englishmen be now twice ruin and all their improv destroi the rest all agre to come and help them to rebuild and to assist them with need suppli their three countrymen who were not yet note for have the least inclin to do ani thing good yet as soon as thei heard of it for thei live remot knew noth till all wa over came and offer their help and assist and did veri friendli work for sever dai to restor their habit and make necessari for them and thu in a littl time thei were set upon their leg again about two dai after thi thei had the farther satisfact of see three of the savag cano come drive onshor and at some distanc from them with two drown men by which thei had reason to believ that thei had met with a storm at sea which had overset some of them for it blew veri hard the night after thei went off howev as some might miscarri so on the other hand enough of them escap to inform the rest as well of what thei had done as of what happen to them and to whet them on to anoth enterpris of the same natur which thei it seem resolv to attempt with suffici forc to carri all befor them for except what the first man told them of inhabit thei could sai littl to it of their own knowledg for thei never saw on man and the fellow be kill that had affirm it thei had no other wit to confirm it to them it wa five or six month after thi befor thei heard ani more of the savag in which time our men were in hope thei had not forgot their former bad luck or had given over the hope of better when on a sudden thei were invad with a most formid fleet of no less than twentyeight cano full of savag arm with bow and arrow great club wooden sword and suchlik engin of war and thei brought such number with them that in short it put all our peopl into the utmost constern as thei came on shore in the even and at the easternmost side of the island our men had that night to consult and consid what to do and in the first place know that their be entir conceal wa their onli safeti befor and would much more be so now while the number of their enemi wa so great thei therefor resolv first of all to take down the hut which were built for the two englishmen and drive awai their goat to the old cave becaus thei suppos the savag would go directli thither as soon as it wa dai to plai the old game over again though thei did not now land within two leagu of it in the next place thei drove awai all the flock of goat thei had at the old bower as i call it which belong to the spaniard and in short left as littl appear of inhabit ani where as possibl and the next morn earli thei post themselv with all their forc at the plantat of the two men wait for their come as thei guess so it happen these new invad leav their cano at the east end of the island came rang along the shore directli toward the place to the number of two hundr and fifti as near as our men could judg our armi wa but small inde but that which wa wors thei had not arm for all their number neither the whole account it seem stood thusfirst as to men spaniard englishmen old fridai or fridai father slave taken with the women who prove veri faith other slave who live with the spaniard to arm these thei had musket pistol fowlingpiec musket or fowlingpiec which were taken by me from the mutin seamen whom i reduc sword old halbert to their slave thei did not give either musket or fusil but thei had everi on an halbert or a long staff like a quarterstaff with a great spike of iron fasten into each end of it and by hi side a hatchet also everi on of our men had hatchet two of the women could not be prevail upon but thei would come into the fight and thei had bow and arrow which the spaniard had taken from the savag when the first action happen which i have spoken of where the indian fought with on anoth and the women had hatchet too the spaniard governor whom i have describ so often command the whole and william atkin who though a dread fellow for wicked wa a most dare bold fellow command under him the savag came forward like lion and our men which wa the worst of their fate had no advantag in their situat onli that will atkin who now prove a most us fellow with six men wa plant just behind a small thicket of bush as an advanc guard with order to let the first of them pass by and then fire into the middl of them and as soon as he had fire to make hi retreat as nimbl as he could round a part of the wood and so come in behind the spaniard where thei stood have a thicket of tree all befor them when the savag came on thei ran straggl about everi wai in heap out of all manner of order and will atkin let about fifti of them pass by him then see the rest come in a veri thick throng he order three of hi men to fire have load their musket with six or seven bullet apiec about as big as larg pistolbullet how mani thei kill or wound thei knew not but the constern and surpris wa inexpress among the savag who were fright to the last degre to hear such a dread nois and see their men kill and other hurt but see nobodi that did it when in the middl of their fright william atkin and hi other three let fly again among the thickest of them and in less than a minut the first three be load again gave them a third vollei had william atkin and hi men retir immedi as soon as thei had fire as thei were order to do or had the rest of the bodi been at hand to have pour in their shot continu the savag had been effectu rout for the terror that wa among them came princip from thi viz that thei were kill by the god with thunder and lightn and could see nobodi that hurt them but william atkin stai to load again discov the cheat some of the savag who were at a distanc spy them came upon them behind and though atkin and hi men fire at them also two or three time and kill abov twenti retir as fast as thei could yet thei wound atkin himself and kill on of hi fellow englishmen with their arrow as thei did afterward on spaniard and on of the indian slave who came with the women thi slave wa a most gallant fellow and fought most desper kill five of them with hi own hand have no weapon but on of the arm stave and a hatchet our men be thu hard laid at atkin wound and two other men kill retreat to a rise ground in the wood and the spaniard after fire three volli upon them retreat also for their number wa so great and thei were so desper that though abov fifti of them were kill and more than so mani wound yet thei came on in the teeth of our men fearless of danger and shot their arrow like a cloud and it wa observ that their wound men who were not quit disabl were made outrag by their wound and fought like madmen when our men retreat thei left the spaniard and the englishman that were kill behind them and the savag when thei came up to them kill them over again in a wretch manner break their arm leg and head with their club and wooden sword like true savag but find our men were gone thei did not seem inclin to pursu them but drew themselv up in a kind of ring which is it seem their custom and shout twice in token of their victori after which thei had the mortif to see sever of their wound men fall dy with the mere loss of blood the spaniard governor have drawn hi littl bodi up togeth upon a rise ground atkin though he wa wound would have had him march and charg them again all togeth at onc but the spaniard repli seignior atkin you see how their wound men fight let them alon till morn all these wound men will be stiff and sore with their wound and faint with the loss of blood and so we shall have the fewer to engag the advic wa good but will atkin repli merrili that true seignior and so shall i too and that the reason i would go on while i am warmwel seignior atkin sai the spaniard you have behav gallantli and done your part we will fight for you if you cannot come on but i think it best to stai till morn so thei wait but as it wa a clear moonlight night and thei found the savag in great disord about their dead and wound men and a great hurri and nois among them where thei lai thei afterward resolv to fall upon them in the night especi if thei could come to give them but on vollei befor thei were discov thi thei had a fair opportun to do for on of the two englishmen in whose quarter it wa where the fight began led them round between the wood and the seasid westward and turn short south thei came so near where the thickest of them lai that befor thei were seen or heard eight of them fire in among them and did dread execut upon them in half a minut more eight other fire after them pour in their small shot in such a quantiti that abund were kill and wound and all thi while thei were not abl to see who hurt them or which wai to fly the spaniard charg again with the utmost expedit and then divid themselv into three bodi and resolv to fall in among them all togeth thei had in each bodi eight person that is to sai twentyfour whereof were twentytwo men and the two women who by the wai fought desper thei divid the firearm equal in each parti and so of the halbert and stave thei would have had the women keep back but thei said thei were resolv to die with their husband have thu form their littl armi thei march out from among the tree and came up to the teeth of the enemi shout and halloo as loud as thei could the savag stood all togeth but were in the utmost confus hear the nois of our men shout from three quarter togeth thei would have fought if thei had seen us and as soon as we came near enough to be seen some arrow were shot and poor old fridai wa wound though not danger but our men gave them no time but run up to them fire among them three wai and then fell in with the butt end of their musket their sword arm stave and hatchet and laid about them so well that in a word thei set up a dismal scream and howl fly to save their live which wai soever thei could our men were tire with the execut and kill or mortal wound in the two fight about on hundr and eighti of them the rest be fright out of their wit scour through the wood and over the hill with all the speed that fear and nimbl feet could help them to do and as we did not troubl ourselv much to pursu them thei got all togeth to the seasid where thei land and where their cano lai but their disast wa not at an end yet for it blew a terribl storm of wind that even from the seaward so that it wa imposs for them to put off nai the storm continu all night when the tide came up their cano were most of them driven by the surg of the sea so high upon the shore that it requir infinit toil to get them off and some of them were even dash to piec against the beach or against on anoth our men though glad of their victori yet got littl rest that night but have refresh themselv as well as thei could thei resolv to march to that part of the island where the savag were fled and see what postur thei were in thi necessarili led them over the place where the fight had been and where thei found sever of the poor creatur not quit dead and yet past recov life a sight disagre enough to gener mind for a truli great man though oblig by the law of battl to destroi hi enemi take no delight in hi miseri howev there wa no need to give ani order in thi case for their own savag who were their servant dispatch those poor creatur with their hatchet at length thei came in view of the place where the more miser remain of the savag armi lai where there appear about on hundr still their postur wa gener sit upon the ground with their knee up toward their mouth and the head put between the hand lean down upon the knee when our men came within two musketshot of them the spaniard governor order two musket to be fire without ball to alarm them thi he did that by their counten he might know what to expect viz whether thei were still in heart to fight or were so heartili beaten as to be dispirit and discourag and so he might manag accordingli thi stratagem took for as soon as the savag heard the first gun and saw the flash of the second thei start up upon their feet in the greatest constern imagin and as our men advanc swiftli toward them thei all ran scream and yawl awai with a kind of an howl nois which our men did not understand and had never heard befor and thu thei ran up the hill into the countri at first our men had much rather the weather had been calm and thei had all gone awai to sea but thei did not then consid that thi might probabl have been the occas of their come again in such multitud as not to be resist or at least to come so mani and so often as would quit desol the island and starv them will atkin therefor who notwithstand hi wound kept alwai with them prove the best counsellor in thi case hi advic wa to take the advantag that offer and clap in between them and their boat and so depriv them of the capac of ever return ani more to plagu the island thei consult long about thi and some were against it for fear of make the wretch fly into the wood and live there desper and so thei should have them to hunt like wild beast be afraid to stir about their busi and have their plantat continu rifl all their tame goat destroi and in short be reduc to a life of continu distress will atkin told them thei had better have to do with on hundr men than with on hundr nation that as thei must destroi their boat so thei must destroi the men or be all of them destroi themselv in a word he shew them the necess of it so plainli that thei all came into it so thei went to work immedi with the boat and get some dry wood togeth from a dead tree thei tri to set some of them on fire but thei were so wet that thei would scarc burn howev the fire so burn the upper part that it soon made them unfit for swim in the sea as boat when the indian saw what thei were about some of them came run out of the wood and come as near as thei could to our men kneel down and cri oa oa waramokoa and some other word of their languag which none of the other understood ani thing of but as thei made piti gestur and strang nois it wa easi to understand thei beg to have their boat spare and that thei would be gone and never return thither again but our men were now satisfi that thei had no wai to preserv themselv or to save their coloni but effectu to prevent ani of these peopl from ever go home again depend upon thi that if ever so much as on of them got back into their countri to tell the stori the coloni wa undon so that let them know that thei should not have ani merci thei fell to work with their cano and destroi them everi on that the storm had not destroi befor at the sight of which the savag rais a hideou cry in the wood which our peopl heard plain enough after which thei ran about the island like distract men so that in a word our men did not realli know at first what to do with them nor did the spaniard with all their prudenc consid that while thei made those peopl thu desper thei ought to have kept good guard at the same time upon their plantat for though it is true thei had driven awai their cattl and the indian did not find their main retreat i mean my old castl at the hill nor the cave in the vallei yet thei found out my plantat at the bower and pull it all to piec and all the fenc and plant about it trod all the corn under foot tore up the vine and grape be just then almost ripe and did our men an inestim damag though to themselv not on farthingsworth of servic though our men were abl to fight them upon all occas yet thei were in no condit to pursu them or hunt them up and down for as thei were too nimbl of foot for our men when thei found them singl so our men durst not go about singl for fear of be surround with their number the best wa thei had no weapon for though thei had bow thei had no arrow left nor ani materi to make ani nor had thei ani edg tool or weapon among them the extrem and distress thei were reduc to wa great and inde deplor but at the same time our men were also brought to veri hard circumst by them for though their retreat were preserv yet their provis wa destroi and their harvest spoil and what to do or which wai to turn themselv thei knew not the onli refug thei had now wa the stock of cattl thei had in the vallei by the cave and some littl corn which grew there the three englishmen william atkin and hi comrad were now reduc to two on of them be kill by an arrow which struck him on the side of hi head just under the templ so that he never spoke more and it wa veri remark that thi wa the same barbar fellow who cut the poor savag slave with hi hatchet and who afterward intend to have murder the spaniard i look upon their case to have been wors at thi time than mine wa at ani time after i first discov the grain of barlei and rice and got into the method of plant and rais my corn and my tame cattl for now thei had as i mai sai an hundr wolv upon the island which would devour everi thing thei could come at yet could be veri hardli come at themselv the first thing thei conclud when thei saw what their circumst were wa that thei would if possibl drive them up to the farther part of the island southeast that if ani more savag came on shore thei might not find on anoth then that thei would daili hunt and harass them and kill as mani of them as thei could come at till thei had reduc the number and if thei could at last tame them and bring them to ani thing thei would give them corn and teach them how to plant and live upon their daili labour in order to thi thei follow them and so terrifi them with their gun that in a few dai if ani of them fire a gun at an indian if he did not hit him yet he would fall down for fear and so dreadfulli fright thei were that thei kept out of sight farther and farther till at last our men follow them and everi dai almost kill and wound some of them thei kept up in the wood and hollow place so much that it reduc them to the utmost miseri for want of food and mani were afterward found dead in the wood without ani hurt but mere starv to death when our men found thi it made their heart relent and piti move them especi the spaniard governor who wa the most gentlemanlik generousmind man that ever i met with in my life and he propos if possibl to take on of them aliv and bring him to understand what thei meant so far as to be abl to act as interpret and to go among them and see if thei might be brought to some condit that might be depend upon to save their live and do us no spoil it wa some time befor ani of them could be taken but be weak and halfstarv on of them wa at last surpris and made a prison he wa sullen at first and would neither eat nor drink but find himself kindli us and victual given him and no violenc offer him he at last grew tractabl and came to himself thei brought old fridai to him who talk often with him and told him how kind the other would be to them all that thei would not onli save their live but would give them a part of the island to live in provid thei would give satisfact that thei should keep in their own bound and not come beyond them to injur or prejudic other and that thei should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for their bread and some bread given them for their present subsist and old fridai bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of hi countrymen and hear what thei said to it assur them that if thei did not agre immedi thei should all be destroi the poor wretch thoroughli humbl and reduc in number to about thirtyseven close with the propos at the first offer and beg to have some food given them upon which twelv spaniard and two englishmen well arm and three indian slave and old fridai march to the place where thei were the three indian slave carri them a larg quantiti of bread and some rice boil up to cake and dri in the sun and three live goat and thei were order to go to the side of an hill where thei sat down at the provis veri thankfulli and were the most faith fellow to their word that could be thought of for except when thei came to beg victual and direct thei never came out of their bound and there thei live when i came to the island and i went to see them thei had taught them both to plant corn make bread breed tame goat and milk them thei want noth but wive and thei soon would have been a nation thei were confin to a neck of land surround with high rock behind them and ly plain toward the sea befor them on the southeast corner of the island thei had land enough and it wa veri good and fruit for thei had a piec of land about a mile and a half broad and three or four mile in length our men taught them to make wooden spade such as i made for myself and gave among them twelv hatchet and three or four knive and there thei live the most subject innoc creatur that were ever heard of after thi the coloni enjoi a perfect tranquil with respect to the savag till i came to revisit them which wa in about two year not but that now and then some cano of savag came on shore for their triumphal unnatur feast but as thei were of sever nation and perhap had never heard of those that came befor or the reason of it thei did not make ani search or inquiri after their countrymen and if thei had it would have been veri hard for them to have found them out thu i think i have given a full account of all that happen to them to my return at least that wa worth notic the indian or savag were wonderfulli civil by them and thei frequent went among them but forbid on pain of death ani of the indian come to them becaus thei would not have their settlement betrai again on thing wa veri remark viz that thei taught the savag to make wickerwork or basket but thei soon outdid their master for thei made abund of most ingeni thing in wickerwork particularli all sort of basket siev birdcag cupboard c as also chair to sit on stool bed couch and abund of other thing be veri ingeni at such work when thei were onc put in the wai of it my come wa a particular relief to these peopl becaus we furnish them with knive scissar spade shovel pickax and all thing of that kind which thei could want with the help of these tool thei were so veri handi that thei came at last to build up their hut or hous veri handsom raddl or work it up like basketwork all the wai round which wa a veri extraordinari piec of ingenu and look veri odd but wa an exceed good fenc as well against heat as against all sort of vermin and our men were so taken with it that thei got the wild savag to come and do the like for them so that when i came to see the two englishmen coloni thei look at a distanc as if thei live all like bee in a hive and as for will atkin who wa now becom a veri industri necessari and sober fellow he had made himself such a tent of basket work as i believ wa never seen it wa on hundr and twenti pace round on the outsid as i measur by my step the wall were as close work as a basket in pannel or squar thirtytwo in number and veri strong stand about seven feet high in the middl wa anoth not abov twentytwo pace round but built stronger be eightsquar in it form and in the eight corner stood eight veri strong post round the top of which he laid strong piec join togeth with wooden pin from which he rais a pyramid befor the roof of eight rafter veri handsom i assur you and join togeth veri well though he had no nail and onli a few iron spike which he had made himself too out of the old iron that i had left there and inde thi fellow shew abund of ingenu in sever thing which he had no knowledg of he made himself a forg with a pair of wooden bellow to blow the fire he made himself charcoal for hi work and he form out of on of the iron crow a middl good anvil to hammer upon in thi manner he made mani thing but especi hook stapl and spike bolt and hing but to return to the hous after he pitch the roof of hi innermost tent he work it up between the rafter with basketwork so firm and thatch that over again so ingeni with ricestraw and over that a larg leaf of a tree which cover the top that hi hous wa as dry as if it had been tile or slate inde he own that the savag made the basketwork for him the outer circuit wa cover as a leanto all round hi inner apart and long rafter lai from the thirti two angl to the top post of the inner hous be about twenti feet distant so that there wa a space like a walk within the outer wicker wall and without the inner near twenti feet wide the inner place he partit off with the same wicker work but much fairer and divid into six apart for that he had six room on a floor and out of everi on of these there wa a door first into the entri or come into the main tent and anoth door into the space or walk that wa round it so that thi walk wa also divid into six equal part which serv not onli for a retreat but to store up ani necessari which the famili had occas for these six space not take up the whole circumfer what other apart the outer circl had were thu order as soon as you were in at the door of the outer circl you had a short passag straight befor you to the door of the inner hous but on either side wa a wicker partit and a door in it by which you went first into a larg room or storehous twenti feet wide and about thirti feet long and through that into anoth not quit so long so that in the outer circl were ten handsom room six of which were onli to be come at through the apart of the inner tent and serv as closet or retir room to the respect chamber of the inner circl and four larg warehous or barn or what you pleas to call them which went in through on anoth two on either hand of the passag that led through the outer door to the inner tent such a piec of basketwork i believ wa never seen in the world nor an hous or tent so neatli contriv much less so built in thi great beehiv live the three famili that is to sai will atkin and hi companion the third wa kill but hi wife remain with three children for she wa it seem big with child when he di and the other two were not at all backward to give the widow her full share of everi thing i mean as to their corn milk grape c and when thei kill a kid or found a turtl on the shore so that thei all live well enough though it wa true thei were not so industri as the other two as ha been observ alreadi on thing howev cannot be omit viz that as for religion i dont know that there wa ani thing of that kind among them thei pretti often inde put on anoth in mind that there wa a god by the veri common method of seamen viz swear by hi name nor were their poor ignor savag wive much the better for have been marri to christian as we must call them for as thei knew veri littl of god themselv so thei were utterli incap of enter into ani discours with their wive about a god or to talk ani thing to them concern religion the utmost of all the improv which i can sai the wive had made from them wa that thei had taught them to speak english pretti well and all the children thei had which were near twenti in all were taught to speak english too from their first learn to speak though thei at first spoke it in a veri broken manner like their mother there were none of those children abov six year old when i came thither for it wa not much abov seven year that thei had fetch these five savag ladi over but thei had all been pretti fruit for thei had all children more or less i think the cook mate wife wa big of her sixth child and the mother were all a good sort of wellgovern quiet labori women modest and decent help to on anoth mighti observ and subject to their master i cannot call them husband and want noth but to be well instruct in the christian religion and to be legal marri both which were happili brought about afterward by my mean or at least by the consequ of my come among them have thu given an account of the coloni in gener and pretti much of my five runag englishmen i must sai someth of the spaniard who were the main bodi of the famili and in whose stori there ar some incid also remark enough i had a great mani discours with them about their circumst when thei were among the savag thei told me readili that thei had no instanc to give of their applic or ingenu in that countri that thei were a poor miser deject hand of peopl that if mean had been put into their hand thei had yet so abandon themselv to despair and so sunk under the weight of their misfortun that thei thought of noth but starv on of them a grave and veri sensibl man told me he wa convinc thei were in the wrong that it wa not the part of wise men to give up themselv to their miseri but alwai to take hold of the help which reason offer as well for present support as for futur deliver he told me that grief wa the most senseless insignific passion in the world for that it regard onli thing past which were gener imposs to be recal or to be remedi but had no view to thing to come and had no share in ani thing that look like deliver but rather ad to the afflict than propos a remedi and upon thi he repeat a spanish proverb which though i cannot repeat in just the same word that he spoke it yet i rememb i made it into an english proverb of my own thu in troubl to be troubl is to have your troubl doubl he then ran on in remark upon all the littl improv i had made in my solitud my unweari applic as he call it and how i had made a condit which in it circumst wa at first much wors than their a thousand time more happi than their wa even now when thei were all togeth he told me it wa remark that englishmen had a greater presenc of mind in their distress than ani peopl that ever he met with that their unhappi nation and the portugues were the worst men in the world to struggl with misfortun for that their first step in danger after common effort ar over wa alwai to despair lie down under it and die without rous their thought up to proper remedi for escap i told him their case and mine differ exceedingli that thei were cast upon the shore without necessari without suppli of food or of present susten till thei could provid it that it is true i had thi disadvantag and discomfort that i wa alon but then the suppli i had providenti thrown into my hand by the unexpect drive of the ship on shore wa such a help as would have encourag ani creatur in the world to have appli himself as i had done seignior sai the spaniard had we poor spaniard been in your case we should never have gotten half those thing out of the ship as you did nai sai he we should never have found mean to have gotten a raft to carri them or to have gotten a raft on shore without boat or sail and how much less should we have done said he if ani of us had been alon well i desir him to abat hi compliment and go on with the histori of their come on shore where thei land he told me thei unhappili land at a place where there were peopl without provis wherea had thei had the common sens to have put off to sea again and gone to anoth island a littl farther thei had found provis though without peopl there be an island that wai as thei had been told where there were provis though no peopl that is to sai that the spaniard of trinidad had frequent been there and fill the island with goat and hog at sever time where thei have bred in such multitud and where turtl and seafowl were in such plenti that thei could have been in no want of flesh though thei had found no bread wherea here thei were onli sustain with a few root and herb which thei understood not and which had no substanc in them and which the inhabit gave them sparingli enough and who could treat them no better unless thei would turn cannib and eat men flesh which wa the great dainti of the countri thei gave me an account how mani wai thei strove to civil the savag thei were with and to teach them ration custom in the ordinari wai of live but in vain and how thei retort it upon them as unjust that thei who came thither for assist and support should attempt to set up for instructor of those that gave them bread intim it seem that none should set up for the instructor of other but those who could live without them thei gave me dismal account of the extrem thei were driven to how sometim thei were mani dai without ani food at all the island thei were upon be inhabit by a sort of savag that live more indol and for that reason were less suppli with the necessari of life than thei had reason to believ other were in the same part of the world and yet thei found that these savag were less raven and voraci than those who had better suppli of food also thei ad that thei could not but see with what demonstr of wisdom and good the govern provid of god direct the event of thing in the world which thei said appear in their circumst for if press by the hardship thei were under and the barren of the countri where thei were thei had search after a better place to live in thei had then been out of the wai of the relief that happen to them by my mean then thei gave me an account how the savag whom thei live among expect them to go out with them into their war and it wa true that as thei had firearm with them had thei not had the disast to lose their ammunit thei should not have been servic onli to their friend but have made themselv terribl both to friend and enemi but be without powder and shot and in a condit that thei could not in reason deni to go out with their landlord to their war when thei came in the field of battl thei were in a wors condit than the savag themselv for thei neither had bow nor arrow nor could thei us those the savag gave them so that thei could do noth but stand still and be wound with arrow till thei came up to the teeth of their enemi and then inde the three halbert thei had were of us to them and thei would often drive a whole littl armi befor them with those halbert and sharpen stick put into the muzzl of their musket but that for all thi thei were sometim surround with multitud and in great danger from their arrow till at last thei found the wai to make themselv larg target of wood which thei cover with skin of wild beast whose name thei knew not and these cover them from the arrow of the savag that notwithstand these thei were sometim in great danger and were onc five of them knock down togeth with the club of the savag which wa the time when on of them wa taken prison that is to sai the spaniard whom i had reliev that at first thei thought he had been kill but when afterward thei heard he wa taken prison thei were under the greatest grief imagin and would willingli have all ventur their live to have rescu him thei told me that when thei were so knock down the rest of their compani rescu them and stood over them fight till thei were come to themselv all but he who thei thought had been dead and then thei made their wai with their halbert and piec stand close togeth in a line through a bodi of abov a thousand savag beat down all that came in their wai got the victori over their enemi but to their great sorrow becaus it wa with the loss of their friend whom the other parti find him aliv carri off with some other as i gave an account in my former thei describ most affection how thei were surpris with joi at the return of their friend and companion in miseri who thei thought had been devour by wild beast of the worst kind viz by wild men and yet how more and more thei were surpris with the account he gave them of hi errand and that there wa a christian in a place near much more on that wa abl and had human enough to contribut to their deliver thei describ how thei were astonish at the sight of the relief i sent them and at the appear of loav of bread thing thei had not seen sinc their come to that miser place how often thei cross it and bless it as bread sent from heaven and what a reviv cordial it wa to their spirit to tast it as also of the other thing i had sent for their suppli and after all thei would have told me someth of the joi thei were in at the sight of a boat and pilot to carri them awai to the person and place from whenc all these new comfort came but thei told me it wa imposs to express it by word for their excess joi drive them to unbecom extravag thei had no wai to describ them but by tell me that thei border upon lunaci have no wai to give vent to their passion suitabl to the sens that wa upon them that in some it work on wai and in some anoth and that some of them through a surpris of joi would burst out into tear other be half mad and other immedi faint thi discours extrem affect me and call to my mind fridai ecstasi when he met hi father and the poor peopl ecstasi when i took them up at sea after their ship wa on fire the mate of the ship joi when he found himself deliv in the place where he expect to perish and my own joi when after twentyeight year captiv i found a good ship readi to carri me to my own countri all these thing made me more sensibl of the relat of these poor men and more affect with it have thu given a view of the state of thing as i found them i must relat the head of what i did for these peopl and the condit in which i left them it wa their opinion and mine too that thei would be troubl no more with the savag or that if thei were thei would be abl to cut them off if thei were twice as mani as befor so that thei had no concern about that then i enter into a seriou discours with the spaniard whom i call governor about their stai in the island for as i wa not come to carri ani of them off so it would not be just to carri off some and leav other who perhap would be unwil to stai if their strength wa diminish on the other hand i told them i came to establish them there not to remov them and then i let them know that i had brought with me relief of sundri kind for them that i had been at a great charg to suppli them with all thing necessari as well for their conveni as their defenc and that i had such particular person with me as well to increas and recruit their number as by the particular necessari employ which thei were bred to be artific to assist them in those thing in which at present thei were to seek thei were all togeth when i talk thu to them and befor i deliv to them the store i had brought i ask them on by on if thei had entir forgot and buri the first animos that had been among them and could shake hand with on anoth and engag in a strict friendship and union of interest so that there might be no more misunderstand or jealousi william atkin with abund of frank and good humour said thei had met with afflict enough to make them all sober and enemi enough to make them all friend that for hi part he would live and die with them and wa so far from design ani thing against the spaniard that he own thei had done noth to him but what hi own bad humour made necessari and what he would have done and perhap much wors in their case and that he would ask them pardon if i desir it for the foolish and brutish thing he had done to them and wa veri will and desir of live on term of entir friendship and union with them and would do ani thing that lai in hi power to convinc them of it and as for go to england he care not if he did not go thither these twenti year the spaniard said thei had inde at first disarm and exclud william atkin and hi two countrymen for their ill conduct as thei had let me know and thei appeal to me for the necess thei were under to do so but that william atkin had behav himself so brave in the great fight thei had with the savag and on sever occas sinc and had shew himself so faith to and concern for the gener interest of them all that thei had forgotten all that wa past and thought he merit as much to be trust with arm and suppli with necessari as ani of them and that thei had testifi their satisfact in him by commit the command to him next to the governor himself and as thei had an entir confid in him and all hi countrymen so thei acknowledg thei had merit that confid by all the method that honest men could merit to be valu and trust and thei most heartili embrac the occas of give me thi assur that thei would never have ani interest separ from on anoth upon these frank and open declar of friendship we appoint the next dai to dine all togeth and inde we made a splendid feast i caus the ship cook and hi mate to come on shore and dress our dinner and the old cook mate we had on shore assist we brought on shore six piec of good beef and four piec of pork out of the ship provis with our punchbowl and materi to fill it and in particular i gave them ten bottl of french claret and ten bottl of english beer thing that neither the spaniard nor the englishmen had tast for mani year and which it mai be suppos thei were exceed glad of the spaniard ad to our feast five whole kid which the cook roast and three of them were sent cover up close on board our ship to the seamen that thei might feast on fresh meat from on shore as we did with their salt meal from on board after thi feast at which we were veri innoc merri i brought out my cargo of good wherein that there might be no disput about divid i shew them that there wa suffici for them all and desir that thei might all take an equal quantiti of the good that were for wear that is to sai equal when made up as first i distribut linen suffici to make everi on of them four shirt and at the spaniard request afterward made them up six these were exceed comfort to them have been what as i mai sai thei had long sinc forgot the us of or what it wa to wear them i allot the thin english stuff which i mention befor to make everi on a light coat like a frock which i judg fittest for the heat of the season cool and loos and order that whenev thei decai thei should make more as thei thought fit the like for pump shoe stock and hat c i cannot express what pleasur what satisfact sat upon the counten of all these poor men when thei saw the care i had taken of them and how well i had furnish them thei told me i wa a father to them and that have such a correspond as i wa in so remot a part of the world it would make them forget that thei were left in a desol place and thei all voluntarili engag to me not to leav the place without my consent then i present to them the peopl i had brought with me particularli the tailor the smith and the two carpent all of them most necessari peopl but abov all my gener artific than whom thei could not name ani thing that wa more need to them and the tailor to shew hi concern for them went to work immedi and with my leav made them everi on a shirt the first thing he did and which wa still more he taught the women not onli how to sew and stitch and us the needl but made them assist to make the shirt for their husband and for all the rest as for the carpent i scarc need mention how us thei were for thei took in piec all my clumsi unhandi thing and made them clever conveni tabl stool bedstead cupboard locker shelv and everi thing thei want of that kind but to let them see how natur made artific at first i carri the carpent to see william atkinss basket hous as i call it and thei both own thei never saw an instanc of such natur ingenu befor nor ani thing so regular and so handili built at least of it kind and on of them when he saw it after muse a good while turn about to me i am sure sai he that man ha no need of us you need do noth but give him tool then i brought them out all my store of tool and gave everi man a dig spade a shovel and a rake for we had no harrow or plough and to everi separ place a pickax a crow a broadax and a saw alwai appoint that as often as ani were broken or worn out thei should be suppli without grudg out of the gener store that i left behind nail stapl hing hammer chisel knive scissor and all sort of tool and ironwork thei had without tale as thei requir for no man would care to take more than he want and he must be a fool that would wast or spoil them on ani account whatev and for the us of the smith i left two ton of unwrought iron for a suppli my magazin of powder and arm which i brought them wa such even to profus that thei could not but rejoic at them for now thei could march as i us to do with a musket upon each shoulder if there wa occas and were abl to fight a thousand savag if thei had but some littl advantag of situat which also thei could not miss of if thei had occas i carri on shore with me the young man whose mother wa starv to death and the maid also she wa a sober welleduc religi young woman and behav so inoffens that everi on gave her a good word she had inde an unhappi life with us there be no woman in the ship but herself but she bore it with patienc after a while see thing so well order and in so fine a wai of thrive upon my island and consid that thei had neither busi nor acquaint in the east indi or reason for take so long a voyag i sai consid all thi both of them came to me and desir i would give them leav to remain on the island and be enter among my famili as thei call it i agre to it readili and thei had a littl plot of ground allot to them where thei had three tent or hous set up surround with a basketwork palisad like atkinss and adjoin to hi plantat their tent were contriv so that thei had each of them a room a part to lodg in and a middl tent like a great storehous to lai all their good in and to eat and drink in and now the other two englishmen move their habit to the same place and so the island wa divid into three coloni and no more viz the spaniard with old fridai and the first servant at my old habit under the hill which wa in a word the capit citi and where thei had so enlarg and extend their work as well under as on the outsid of the hill that thei live though perfectli conceal yet full at larg never wa there such a littl citi in a wood and so hid i believ in ani part of the world for i verili believ a thousand men might have rang the island a month and if thei had not known there wa such a thing and look on purpos for it thei would not have found it for the tree stood so thick and so close and grew so fast mat into on anoth that noth but cut them down first could discov the place except the two narrow entranc where thei went in and out could be found which wa not veri easi on of them wa just down at the water edg on the side of the creek and it wa afterward abov two hundr yard to the place and the other wa up the ladder at twice as i have alreadi formerli describ it and thei had a larg wood thick plant also on the top of the hill which contain abov an acr which grew apac and cover the place from all discoveri there with onli on narrow place between two tree not easi to be discov to enter on that side the other coloni wa that of will atkin where there were four famili of englishmen i mean those i had left there with their wive and children three savag that were slave the widow and children of the englishman that wa kill the young man and the maid and by the wai we made a wife of her also befor we went awai there were also the two carpent and the tailor whom i brought with me for them also the smith who wa a veri necessari man to them especi as the gunsmith to take care of their arm and my other man whom i call jack of all trade who wa himself as good almost as twenti men for he wa not onli a veri ingeni fellow but a veri merri fellow and befor i went awai we marri him to the honest maid that came with the youth in the ship whom i mention befor and now i speak of marri it bring me natur to sai someth of the french ecclesiast that i had brought with me out of the ship crew whom i took at sea it is true thi man wa a roman and perhap it mai give offenc to some hereaft if i leav ani thing extraordinari upon record of a man whom befor i begin i must to set him out in just colour repres in term veri much to hi disadvantag in the account of protest as first that he wa a papist secondli a popish priest and thirdli a french popish priest but justic demand of me to give him a due charact and i must sai he wa a grave sober piou and most religi person exact in hi life extens in hi chariti and exemplari in almost everi thing he did what then can ani on sai against my be veri sensibl of the valu of such a man notwithstand hi profess though it mai be my opinion perhap as well as the opinion of other who shall read thi that he wa mistaken the first hour that i began to convers with him after he had agre to go with me to the east indi i found reason to delight exceedingli in hi convers and he first began with me about religion in the most oblig manner imagin sir sai he you have not onli under god and at that he cross hi breast save my life but you have admit me to go thi voyag in your ship and by your oblig civil have taken me into your famili give me an opportun of free convers now sir sai he you see by my habit what my profess is and i guess by your nation what your is i mai think it is my duti and doubtless it is so to us my utmost endeavour on all occas to bring all the soul that i can to the knowledg of the truth and to embrac the cathol doctrin but as i am here under your permiss and in your famili i am bound in justic to your kind as well as in decenc and good manner to be under your govern and therefor i shall not without your leav enter into ani debat on the point of religion in which we mai not agre farther than you shall give me leav i told him hi carriag wa so modest that i could not but acknowledg it that it wa true we were such peopl as thei call heret but that he wa not the first cathol that i had convers with without fall into ani inconveni or carri the question to ani height in debat that he should not find himself the wors us for be of a differ opinion from us and if we did not convers without ani dislik on either side upon that score it would be hi fault not our he repli that he thought our convers might be easili separ from disput that it wa not hi busi to cap principl with everi man he discours with and that he rather desir me to convers with him as a gentleman than as a religieux that if i would give him leav at ani time to discours upon religi subject he would readili compli with it and that then he did not doubt but i would allow him also to defend hi own opinion as well as he could but that without my leav he would not break in upon me with ani such thing he told me farther that he would not ceas to do all that becam him in hi offic as a priest as well as a privat christian to procur the good of the ship and the safeti of all that wa in her and though perhap we would not join with him and he could not prai with us he hope he might prai for us which he would do upon all occas in thi manner we convers and as he wa of a most oblig gentlemanlik behaviour so he wa if i mai be allow to sai so a man of good sens and as i believ of great learn he gave me a most divert account of hi life and of the mani extraordinari event of it of mani adventur which had befallen him in the few year that he had been abroad in the world and particularli thi wa veri remark viz that dure the voyag he wa now engag in he had the misfortun to be five time ship and unship and never to go to the place whither ani of the ship he wa in were at first design that hi first intent wa to have gone to martinico and that he went on board a ship bound thither at st malo but be forc into lisbon in bad weather the ship receiv some damag by run aground in the mouth of the river tagu and wa oblig to unload her cargo there that find a portugues ship there bound to the madeira and readi to sail and suppos he should easili meet with a vessel there bound to martinico he went on board in order to sail to the madeira but the master of the portugues ship be but an indiffer marin had been out in hi reckon and thei drove to fyal where howev he happen to find a veri good market for hi cargo which wa corn and therefor resolv not to go to the madeira but to load salt at the isl of mai to go awai to newfoundland he had no remedi in the exig but to go with the ship and had a pretti good voyag as far as the bank so thei call the place where thei catch the fish where meet with a french ship bound from franc to quebec in the river of canada and from thenc to martinico to carri provis he thought he should have an opportun to complet hi first design but when he came to quebec the master of the ship di and the ship proceed no farther so the next voyag he ship himself for franc in the ship that wa burnt when we took them up at sea and then ship them with us for the east indi as i have alreadi said thu he had been disappoint in five voyag all as i mai call it in on voyag besid what i shall have occas to mention farther of the same person but i shall not make digress into other men stori which have no relat to my own i return to what concern our affair in the island he came to me on morn for he lodg among us all the while we were upon the island and it happen to be just when i wa go to visit the englishmen coloni at the farthest part of the island i sai he came to me and told me with a veri grave counten that he had for two or three dai desir an opportun of some discours with me which he hope would not be displeas to me becaus he thought it might in some measur correspond with my gener design which wa the prosper of my new coloni and perhap might put it at least more than he yet thought it wa in the wai of god bless i look a littl surpris at the last part of hi discours and turn a littl short how sir said i can it be said that we ar not in the wai of god bless after such visibl assist and wonder deliver as we have seen here and of which i have given you a larg account if you had pleas sir said he with a world of modesti and yet with great readi to have heard me you would have found no room to have been displeas much less to think so hard of me that i should suggest that you have not had wonder assist and deliver and i hope on your behalf that you ar in the wai of god bless and your design is exceed good and will prosper but sir said he though it were more so than is even possibl to you yet there mai be some among you that ar not equal right in their action and you know that in the stori of israel on achan in the camp remov god bless from them and turn hi hand so against them that thirtysix of them though not concern in the crime were the object of divin vengeanc and bore the weight of that punish i wa sensibl touch with thi discours and told him hi infer wa so just and the whole design seem so sincer and wa realli so religi in it own natur that i wa veri sorri i had interrupt him and beg him to go on and in the meantim becaus it seem that what we had both to sai might take up some time i told him i wa go to the englishmen plantat and ask him to go with me and we might discours of it by the wai he told me he would more willingli wait on me thither becaus there partli the thing wa act which he desir to speak to me about so we walk on and i press him to be free and plain with me in what he had to sai why then sir sai he be pleas to give me leav to lai down a few proposit as the foundat of what i have to sai that we mai not differ in the gener principl though we mai be of some differ opinion in the practic of particular first sir though we differ in some of the doctrin articl of religion and it is veri unhappi that it is so especi in the case befor us as i shall shew afterward yet there ar some gener principl in which we both agre viz first that there is a god and that thi god have given us some state gener rule for our servic and obedi we ought not willingli and knowingli to offend him either by neglect to do what he ha command or by do what he ha expressli forbidden and let our differ religion be what thei will thi gener principl is readili own by us all that the bless of god doe not ordinarili follow a presumptu sin against hi command and everi good christian will be affection concern to prevent ani that ar under hi care live in a total neglect of god and hi command it is not your men be protest whatev my opinion mai be of such that discharg me from be concern for their soul and from endeavour if it li befor me that thei should live in as littl distanc from and enmiti with their maker as possibl especi if you give me leav to meddl so far in your circuit i could not yet imagin what he aim at and told him i grant all he had said and thank him that he would so far concern himself for us and beg he would explain the particular of what he had observ that like joshua to take hi own parabl i might put awai the accurs thing from us why then sir sai he i will take the liberti you give me and there ar three thing which if i am right must stand in the wai of god bless upon your endeavour here and which i should rejoic for your sake and their own to see remov and sir sai he i promis myself that you will fulli agre with me in them all as soon as i name them especi becaus i shall convinc you that everi on of them mai with great eas and veri much to your satisfact be remedi he gave me no leav to put in ani more civil but went on first sir sai he you have here four englishmen who have fetch women from among the savag and have taken them as their wive and have had mani children by them all and yet ar not marri to them after ani state legal manner as the law of god and man requir and therefor ar yet in the sens of both no less than adulter and live in adulteri to thi sir sai he i know you will object that there wa no clergyman or priest of ani kind or of ani profess to perform the ceremoni nor ani pen and ink or paper to write down a contract of marriag and have it sign between them and i know also sir what the spaniard governor ha told you i mean of the agreement that he oblig them to make when thei took these women viz that thei should choos them out by consent and keep separ to them which by the wai is noth of a marriag no agreement with the women as wive but onli an agreement among themselv to keep them from quarrel but sir the essenc of the sacrament of matrimoni so he call it be a roman consist not onli in the mutual consent of the parti to take on anoth as man and wife but in the formal and legal oblig that there is in the contract to compel the man and woman at all time to own and acknowledg each other oblig the man to abstain from all other women to engag in no other contract while these subsist and on all occas as abil allow to provid honestli for them and their children and to oblig the women to the same on like condit mutati mutandi on their side now sir sai he these men mai when thei pleas or when occas present abandon these women disown their children leav them to perish and take other women and marri them whilst these ar live and here he ad with some warmth how sir is god honour in thi unlaw liberti and how shall a bless succe your endeavour in thi place howev good in themselv and howev sincer in your design while these men who at present ar your subject under your absolut govern and dominion ar allow by you to live in open adulteri i confess i wa struck at the thing itself but much more with the convinc argument he support it with for it wa certainli true that though thei had no clergyman on the spot yet a formal contract on both side made befor wit and confirm by ani token which thei had all agre to be bound by though it had been but the break a stick between them engag the men to own these women for their wive upon all occas and never to abandon them or their children and the women to the same with their husband had been an effectu law marriag in the sight of god and it wa a great neglect that it wa not done but i thought to have gotten off with my young priest by tell him that all that part wa done when i wa not here and thei had live so mani year with them now that if it wa adulteri it wa past remedi thei could do noth in it now sir sai he ask your pardon for such freedom you ar right in thi that it be done in your absenc you could not be charg with that part of the crime but i beseech you matter not yourself that you ar not therefor under an oblig to do your uttermost now to put an end to it how can you think but that let the time past lie on whom it will all the guilt for the futur will lie entir upon you becaus it is certainli in your power now to put an end to it and in nobodi power but your i wa so dull still that i did not take him right but i imagin that by put an end to it he meant that i should part them and not suffer them to live togeth ani longer and i said to him i could not do that by ani mean for that it would put the whole island in confus he seem surpris that i should so far mistak him no sir sai he i do not mean that you should separ them but legal and effectu marri them now and sir as my wai of marri mai not be so easi to reconcil them to though it will be as effectu even by your own law so your wai mai be as well befor god and as valid among men i mean by a written contract sign by both man and woman and by all the wit present which all the law of europ would decre to be valid i wa amaz to see so much true pieti and so much sincer of zeal besid the unusu imparti in hi discours as to hi own parti or church and such a true warmth for the preserv peopl that he had no knowledg of or relat to i sai for preserv them from transgress the law of god the like of which i had inde not met with ani where but recollect what he had said of marri them by a written contract which i knew would stand too i return it back upon him and told him i grant all that he had said to be just and on hi part veri kind that i would discours with the men upon the point now when i came to them and i knew no reason why thei should scrupl to let him marri them all which i knew well enough would be grant to be as authent and valid in england as if thei were marri by on of our own clergymen what wa afterward done in thi matter i shall speak of by itself i then press him to tell me what wa the second complaint which he had to make acknowledg i wa veri much hi debtor for the first and thank him heartili for it he told me he would us the same freedom and plain in the second and hope i would take it as well and thi wa that notwithstand these english subject of mine as he call them had live with these women for almost seven year and had taught them to speak english and even to read it and that thei were as he perceiv women of toler understand and capabl of instruct yet thei had not to thi hour taught them ani thing of the christian religion no not so much as to know that there wa a god or a worship or in what manner god wa to be serv or that their own idolatri and worship thei knew not who wa fals and absurd thi he said wa an unaccount neglect and what god would certainli call them to an account for and perhap at last take the work out of their hand he spoke thi veri affection and warmli i am persuad sai he had those men live in the savag countri whenc their wive came the savag would have taken more pain to have brought them to be idolat and to worship the devil than ani of these men so far as i can see ha taken with them to teach them the knowledg of the true god now sir said he though i do not acknowledg your religion or you mine yet we should be all glad to see the devil servant and the subject of hi kingdom taught to know the gener principl of the christian religion that thei might at least hear of god and of a redeem and of the resurrect and of a futur state thing which we all believ thei had at least been so much nearer come into the bosom of the true church than thei ar now in the public profess of idolatri and devilworship i could hold no longer i took him in my arm and embrac him with an excess of passion how far said i to him have i been from understand the most essenti part of a christian viz to love the interest of the christian church and the good of other men soul i scarc have known what belong to be a christiano sir do not sai so repli he thi thing is not your faultno said i but why did i never lai it to heart as well as youit is not too late yet said he be not too forward to condemn yourselfbut what can be done now said i you see i am go awaywil you give me leav said he to talk with these poor men about ity with all my heart said i and i will oblig them to give heed to what you sai tooa to that said he we must leav them to the merci of christ but it is our busi to assist them encourag them and instruct them and if you will give me leav and god hi bless i do not doubt but the poor ignor soul shall be brought home into the great circl of christian if not into the particular faith that we all embrac and that even while you stai here upon thi i said i shall not onli give you leav but give you a thousand thank for it what follow on thi account i shall mention also again in it place i now press him for the third articl in which we were to blame why realli sai he it is of the same natur and i will proce ask your leav with the same plain as befor it is about your poor savag yonder who ar as i mai sai your conquer subject it is a maxim sir that is or ought to be receiv among all christian of what church or pretend church soever viz that christian knowledg ought to be propag by all possibl mean and on all possibl occas it is on thi principl that our church send missionari into persia india and china and that our clergi even of the superior sort willingli engag in the most hazard voyag and the most danger resid among murder and barbarian to teach them the knowledg of the true god and to bring them over to embrac the christian faith now sir you have an opportun here to have six or sevenandthirti poor savag brought over from idolatri to the knowledg of god their maker and redeem that i wonder how you can pass by such an occas of do good which is realli worth the expens of a man whole life i wa now struck dumb inde and had not on word to sai i had here a spirit of true christian zeal for god and religion befor me let hi particular principl be of what kind soever as for me i had not so much as entertain a thought of thi in my heart befor and i believ should not have thought of it for i look upon these savag as slave and peopl whom had we ani work for them to do we would have us as such or would have been glad to have transport them to ani other part of the world for our busi wa to get rid of them and we would all have been satisfi if thei had been sent to ani countri so thei had never seen their own but to the case i sai i wa confound at hi discours and knew not what answer to make him he look earnestli at me see me in some disord sir said he i shall be veri sorri if what i have said give you ani offenceno no said i i am offend with nobodi but myself but i am perfectli confound not onli to think that i should never take ani notic of thi befor but with reflect what notic i am abl to take of it now you know sir said i what circumst i am in i am bound to the east indi in a ship freight by merchant and to whom it would be an insuffer piec of injustic to detain their ship here the men ly all thi while at victual and wage upon the owner account it is true i agre to be allow twelv dai here and if i stai more i must pai sterl per diem demurrag nor can i stai upon demurrag abov eight dai more and i have been here thirteen dai alreadi so that i am perfectli unabl to engag in thi work unless i would suffer myself to be left behind here again in which case if thi singl ship should miscarri in ani part of her voyag i should be just in the same condit that i wa left in here at first and from which i have been so wonderfulli deliv he own the case wa veri hard upon me as to my voyag but laid it home upon my conscienc whether the bless of save sevenandthirti soul wa not worth my ventur all i had in the world for i wa not so sensibl of that as he wa and i return upon him thu why sir it is a valuabl thing inde to be an instrument in god hand to convert sevenandthirti heathen to the knowledg of christ but as you ar an ecclesiast and ar given over to that work so that it seem natur to fall into the wai of your profess how is it then that you do not rather offer yourself to undertak it than press me to it upon thi he face about just befor me as he walk along and pull me to a full stop made me a veri low bow i most heartili thank god and you sir sai he for give me so evid a call to so bless a work and if you think yourself discharg from it and desir me to undertak it i will most readili do it and think it a happi reward for all of the hazard and difficulti of such a broken disappoint voyag as i have met with that i have drop at last into so gloriou a work i discov a kind of raptur in hi face while he spoke thi to me hi ey sparkl like fire hi face bow and hi colour came and went as if he had been fall into fit in a word he wa tire with the agoni of be embark in such a work i paus a consider while befor i could tell what to sai to him for i wa realli surpris to find a man of such sincer and zeal and carri out in hi zeal beyond the ordinari rate of men not of hi profess onli but even of ani profess whatsoev but after i had consid it awhil i ask him serious if he wa in earnest and that he would ventur on the singl consider of an attempt on those poor peopl to be lock up in an unplant island for perhap hi life and at last might not know whether he should be abl to do them ani good or not he turn short upon me and ask me what i call a ventur prai sir said he what do you think i consent to go in your ship to the east indi fornai said i that i know not unless it wa to preach to the indiansdoubtless it wa said he and do you think if i can convert these sevenandthirti men to the faith of christ it is not worth my time though i should never be fetch off the island again nai is it not infinit of more worth to save so mani soul than my life is or the life of twenti more of the same profess ye sir sai he i would give christ and the bless virgin thank all my dai if i could be made the least happi instrument of save the soul of these poor men though i wa never to set my foot off thi island or see my nativ countri ani more but sinc you will honour me sai he with put me into thi work for which i will prai for you all the dai of my life i have on humbl petit to you said he besideswhat is that said i why sai he it is that you will leav your man fridai with me to be my interpret to them and to assist me for without some help i cannot speak to them or thei to me i wa sensibl troubl at hi request fridai becaus i could not think of part with him and that for mani reason he had been the companion of my travel he wa not onli faith to me but sincer affection to the last degre and i had resolv to do someth consider for him if he outliv me as it wa probabl he would then i knew that as i had bred fridai up to be a protest it would quit confound him to bring him to embrac anoth profess and he would never while hi ey were open believ that hi old master wa a heret and would be damn and thi might in the end ruin the poor fellow principl and so turn him back again to hi first idolatri howev a sudden thought reliev me in thi strait and it wa thi i told him i could not sai that i wa will to part with fridai on ani account whatev though a work that to him wa of more valu than hi life ought to me to be of much more valu than the keep or part with a servant but on the other hand i wa persuad that fridai would by no mean consent to part with me and then to forc him to it without hi consent would be manifest injustic becaus i had promis i would never put him awai and he had promis and engag to me that he would never leav me unless i put him awai he seem veri much concern at it for he had no ration access to these poor peopl see he did not understand on word of their languag nor thei on word of hi to remov thi difficulti i told him fridai father had learnt spanish which i found he also understood and he should serv him for an interpret so he wa much better satisfi and noth could persuad him but he would stai to endeavour to convert them but provid gave anoth and veri happi turn to all thi i come back now to the first part of hi object when we came to the englishmen i sent for them all togeth and after some account given them of what i had done for them viz what necessari thing i had provid for them and how thei were distribut which thei were sensibl of and veri thank for i began to talk to them of the scandal life thei led and gave them a full account of the notic the clergyman had alreadi taken of it and argu how unchristian and irreligi a life it wa i first ask them if thei were marri men or bachelor thei soon explain their condit to me and shew me that two of them were widow and the other three were singl men or bachelor i ask them with what conscienc thei could take these women and lie with them as thei had done call them their wive and have so mani children by them and not be marri lawfulli to them thei all gave me the answer that i expect viz that there wa nobodi to marri them that thei agre befor the governor to keep them as their wive and to keep them and own them as their wive and thei thought as thing stood with them thei were as legal marri as if thei had been marri by a parson and with all the formal in the world i told them that no doubt thei were marri in the sight of god and were bound in conscienc to keep them as their wive but that the law of men be otherwis thei might pretend thei were not marri and so desert the poor women and children hereaft and that their wive be poor desol women friendless and moneyless would have no wai to help themselv i therefor told them that unless i wa assur of their honest intent i could do noth for them but would take care that what i did should be for the women and children without them and that unless thei would give some assur that thei would marri the women i could not think it wa conveni thei should continu togeth as man and wife for that it wa both scandal to men and offens to god who thei could not think would bless them if thei went on thu all thi pass as i expect and thei told me especi will atkin who seem now to speak for the rest that thei love their wive as well as if thei had been born in their own nativ countri and would not leav them upon ani account whatev and thei did verili believ their wive were as virtuou and as modest and did to the utmost of their skill as much for them and for their children as ani women could possibl do and thei would not part with them on ani account and will atkin for hi own particular ad if ani man would take him awai and offer to carri him home to england and to make him captain of the best man of war in the navi he would not go with him if he might not carri hi wife and children with him and if there wa a clergyman in the ship he would be marri to her now with all hi heart thi wa just as i would have it the priest wa not with me at that moment but wa not far off so to try him farther i told him i had a clergyman with me and if he wa sincer i would have him marri the next morn and bade him consid of it and talk with the rest he said as for himself he need not consid of it at all for he wa veri readi to do it and wa glad i had a minist with me and he believ thei would be all will also i then told him that my friend the minist wa a frenchman and could not speak english but that i would act the clerk between them he never so much as ask me whether he wa a papist or protest which wa inde what i wa afraid of but i sai thei never inquir about it so we part i went back to my clergyman and will atkin went in to talk with hi companion i desir the french gentleman not to sai ani thing to them till the busi wa thorough ripe and i told him what answer the men had given me befor i went from their quarter thei all came to me and told me thei had been consid what i had said that thei were veri glad to hear i had a clergyman in my compani and thei were veri will to give me the satisfact i desir and to be formal marri as soon as i pleas for thei were far from desir to part from their wive and that thei meant noth but what wa veri honest when thei chose them so i appoint them to meet me the next morn and that in the mean time thei should let their wive know the mean of the marriag law and that it wa not onli to prevent ani scandal but also to oblig them that thei should not forsak them whatev might happen the women were easili made sensibl of the mean of the thing and were veri well satisfi with it as inde thei had reason to be so thei fail not to attend all togeth at my apart next morn where i brought out my clergyman and though he had not on a minist gown after the manner of england or the habit of a priest after the manner of franc yet have a black vest someth like a cassock with a sash round it he did not look veri unlik a minist and as for hi languag i wa interpret but the serious of hi behaviour to them and the scrupl he made of marri the women becaus thei were not baptiz and profess christian gave them an exceed rever for hi person and there wa no need after that to inquir whether he wa a clergyman or no inde i wa afraid hi scrupl would have been carri so far as that he would not have marri them at all nai notwithstand all i wa abl to sai to him he resist me though modestli yet veri steadili and at last refus absolut to marri them unless he had first talk with the men and the women too and though at first i wa a littl backward to it yet at last i agre to it with a good will perceiv the sincer of hi design when he came to them he let them know that i had acquaint him with their circumst and with the present design that he wa veri will to perform that part of hi function and marri them as i had desir but that befor he could do it he must take the liberti to talk with them he told them that in the sight of all differ men and in the sens of the law of societi thei had live all thi while in an open adulteri and that it wa true that noth but the consent to marri or effectu separ them from on anoth now could put an end to it but there wa a difficulti in it too with respect to the law of christian matrimoni which he wa not fulli satisfi about viz that of marri on that is a profess christian to a savag an idolat and a heathen on that is not baptiz and yet that he did not see that there wa time left for it to endeavour to persuad the women to be baptiz or to profess the name of christ whom thei had he doubt heard noth of and without which thei could not be baptiz he told me he doubt thei were but indiffer christian themselv that thei had but littl knowledg of god or hi wai and therefor he could not expect that thei had said much to their wive on that head yet but that unless thei would promis him to us their endeavour with their wive to persuad them to becom christian and would as well as thei could instruct them in the knowledg and belief of god that made them and to worship jesu christ that redeem them he could not marri them for he would have no hand in join christian with savag nor wa it consist with the principl of the christian religion and wa inde expressli forbidden in god law thei heard all thi veri attent and i deliv it veri faithfulli to them from hi mouth as near hi own word as i could onli sometim ad someth of my own to convinc them how just it wa and how i wa of hi mind and i alwai veri faithfulli distinguish between what i said from myself and what were the clergyman word thei told me it wa veri true what the gentleman had said that thei were but veri indiffer christian themselv and that thei had never talk to their wive about religionlord sir sai will atkin how should we teach them religion why we know noth ourselv and besid sir said he should we go to talk to them of god and jesu christ and heaven and hell it would be to make them laugh at us and ask us what we believ ourselv and if we should tell them we believ all the thing that we speak of to them such as of good peopl go to heaven and wick peopl to the devil thei would ask us where we intend to go ourselv who believ all thi and yet ar such wick fellow as we inde ar why sir said will ti enough to give them a surfeit of religion at that hear folk must have some religion themselv befor thei pretend to teach other peoplewil atkin said i to him though i am afraid what you sai ha too much truth in it yet can you not tell your wife that she is in the wrong that there is a god and a religion better than her own that her god ar idol that thei can neither hear nor speak that there is a great be that made all thing and that can destroi all that he ha made that he reward the good and punish the bad that we ar to be judg by him at last for all we do here you ar not so ignor but even natur itself will teach you that all thi is true and i am satisfi you know it all to be true and believ it yourself that true sir said atkin but with what face can i sai ani thing to my wife of all thi when she will tell me immedi it cannot be true not true said i what do you mean by thatwhi sir said he she will tell me it cannot be true that thi god i shall tell her of can be just or can punish or reward sinc i am not punish and sent to the devil that have been such a wick creatur as she know i have been even to her and to everi bodi els and that i should be suffer to live that have been alwai act so contrari to what i must tell her is good and to what i ought to have done why truli atkin said i i am afraid thou speakest too much truth and with that i let the clergyman know what atkin had said for he wa impati to know o said the priest tell him there is on thing will make him the best minist in the world to hi wife and that is repent for none teach repent like true penit he want noth but to repent and then he will be so much the better qualifi to instruct hi wife he will then be abl to tell her that there is not onli a god and that he is the just reward of good and evil but that he is a merci be and with infinit good and longsuff forbear to punish those that offend wait to be graciou and will not the death of a sinner but rather that he should return and live that he often suffer wick men to go on a long time and even reserv damnat to the gener dai of retribut that it is a clear evid of god and of a futur state that righteou men receiv not their reward or wick men their punish till thei come into anoth world and thi will lend him to teach hi wife the doctrin of the resurrect and of the last judgment let him but repent for himself he will be an excel preacher of repent to hi wife i repeat all thi to atkin who look veri seriou all the while and who we could easili perceiv wa more than ordinarili affect with it when be eager and hardli suffer me to make an endi know all thi master sai he and a great deal more but i hant the impud to talk thu to my wife when god and my own conscienc know and my wife will be an undeni evid against me that i have live as if i never heard of god or a futur state or ani thing about it and to talk of my repent ala and with that he fetch a deep sigh and i could see that tear stood in hi ey ti past all that with mepast it atkin said i what dost thou mean by thati know well enough what i mean sir sai he i mean ti too late and that is too true i told my clergyman word for word what he said the poor zealou priest i must call him so for be hi opinion what it will he had certainli a most singular affect for the good of other men soul and it would be hard to think he had not the like for hi owni sai thi zealou affection man could not refrain tear also but recov himself he said to me ask him but on question is he easi that it is too late or is he troubl and wish it were not so i put the question fairli to atkin and he answer with a great deal of passion how could ani man be easi in a condit that certainli must end in etern destruct that he wa far from be easi but that on the contrari he believ it would on time or the other ruin him what do you mean by that said iwhi he said he believ he should on time or anoth cut hi own throat to put an end to the terror of it the clergyman shook hi head with a great concern in hi face when i told him all thi but turn quick to me upon it said if that be hi case you mai assur him it is not too late christ will give him repent but prai sai he explain thi to him that as no man is save but by christ and the merit of hi passion procur divin merci for him how can it be too late for ani man to receiv merci doe he think he is abl to sin beyond the power or reach of divin merci prai tell him there mai be a time when provok merci will no longer strive and when god mai refus to hear but that ti never too late for men to ask merci and we that ar christ servant ar command to preach merci at all time in the name of jesu christ to all those that sincer repent so that ti never too late to repent i told atkin all thi and he heard me with great earnest but it seem as if he turn off the discours to the rest for he said to me he would go and have some talk with hi wife so he went out awhil and we talk to the rest i perceiv thei were all stupidli ignor as to matter of religion much as i wa when i went rambl awai from my father and yet that there were none of them backward to hear what had been said and all of them serious promis that thei would talk with their wive about it and do their endeavour to persuad them to turn christian the clergyman smile upon me when i report what answer thei gave but said noth a good while but at last shake hi head we that ar christ servant sai he can go no farther than to exhort and instruct and when men compli submit to the reproof and promis what we ask ti all we can do we ar bound to accept their good word but believ me sir said he whatev you mai have known of the life of that man you call william atkin i believ he is the onli sincer convert among them i take that man to be a true penit i wont despair of the rest but that man is perfectli struck with the sens of hi past life and i doubt not but when he come to talk of religion to hi wife he will talk himself effectu into it for attempt to teach other is sometim the best wai of teach ourselv i knew a man ad he who have noth but a summari notion of religion himself and be wick and proflig to the last degre in hi life made a thorough reform in himself by labour to convert a jew and if that poor atkin begin but onc to talk serious of jesu christ to hi wife my life for it he talk himself into a thorough convert make himself a penit and who know what mai follow upon thi discours howev and their promis as abov to endeavour to persuad their wive to embrac christian he marri the other three coupl but will atkin and hi wife were not yet come in after thi my clergyman wait awhil wa curiou to know where atkin wa gone and turn to me sai he i entreat you sir let us walk out of your labyrinth here and look i dare sai we shall find thi poor man somewher or other talk serious with hi wife and teach her alreadi someth of religion i began to be of the same mind so we went out togeth and i carri him a wai which none knew but myself and where the tree were so thick set as that it wa not easi to see through the thicket of leav and far harder to see in than to see out when come to the edg of the wood i saw atkin and hi tawni savag wife sit under the shade of a bush veri eager in discours i stop short till my clergyman came up to me and then have shew him where thei were we stood and look veri steadili at them a good while we observ him veri earnest with her point up to the sun and to everi quarter of the heaven then down to the earth then out to the sea then to himself then to her to the wood to the tree now sai my clergyman you see my word ar made good the man preach to her mark him now he is tell her that our god ha made him and her and the heaven the earth the sea the wood the tree ci believ he is said i immedi we perceiv will atkin start up upon hi feet fall down upon hi knee and lift up both hi hand we suppos he said someth but we could not hear him it wa too far off for that he did not continu kneel half a minut but come and sit down again by hi wife and talk to her again we perceiv then the woman veri attent but whether she said ani thing or no we could not tell while the poor fellow wa upon hi knee i could see the tear run plentifulli down my clergyman cheek and i could hardli forbear myself but it wa a great afflict to us both that we were not near enough to hear ani thing that pass between them well howev we could come no nearer for fear of disturb them so we resolv to see an end of thi piec of still convers and it spoke loud enough to us without the help of voic he sat down again as i have said close by her and talk again earnestli to her and two or three time we could see him embrac her passion anoth time we saw him take out hi handkerchief and wipe her ey and then kiss her again with a kind of transport veri unusu and after sever of these thing we saw him on a sudden jump up again and lend her hi hand to help her up when immedi lead her by the hand a step or two thei both kneel down togeth and continu so about two minut my friend could bear it no longer but cri out aloud st paul st paul behold he prayethi wa afraid atkin would hear him therefor i entreat him to withhold himself awhil that we might see an end of the scene which to me i must confess wa the most affect and yet the most agreeabl that ever i saw in my life well he strove with himself and contain himself for awhil but wa in such raptur of joi to think that the poor heathen woman wa becom a christian that he wa not abl to contain himself he wept sever time then throw up hi hand and cross hi breast said over sever thing ejaculatori and by wai of give god thank for so miracul a testimoni of the success of our endeavour some he spoke softli and i could not well hear other audibl some in latin some in french then two or three time the tear of joi would interrupt him that he could not speak at all but i beg that he would compos himself and let us more narrowli and fulli observ what wa befor us which he did for a time and the scene wa not end there yet for after the poor man and hi wife were risen again from their knee we observ he stood talk still eagerli to her and we observ by her motion that she wa greatli affect with what he said by her frequent lift up her hand lai her hand to her breast and such other postur as usual express the greatest serious and attent thi continu about half a quarter of an hour and then thei walk awai too so that we could see no more of them in that situat i took thi interv to talk with my clergyman and first i told him i wa glad to see the particular we had both been wit to that though i wa hard enough of belief in such case yet that i began to think it wa all veri sincer here both in the man and hi wife howev ignor thei both might be and i hope such a begin would have yet a more happi end and who know said i but these two mai in time by instruct and exampl work upon some of the otherssom of them said he turn quick upon me ay upon all of them depend upon it if those two savag for he ha been but littl better as you relat it should embrac jesu christ thei will never leav till thei work upon all the rest for true religion is natur commun and he that is onc made a christian will never leav a pagan behind him if he can help it i own it wa a most christian principl to think so and a testimoni of a true zeal as well as a gener heart in him but my friend said i will you give me liberti to start on difficulti here i cannot tell how to object the least thing against that affection concern which you shew for the turn the poor peopl from their pagan to the christian religion but how doe thi comfort you while these peopl ar in your account out of the pale of the cathol church without which you believ there is no salvat so that you esteem these but heret still and for other reason as effectu lost as the pagan themselv to thi he answer with abund of candour and christian chariti thu sir i am a cathol of the roman church and a priest of the order of st benedict and i embrac all the principl of the roman faith but yet if you will believ me and thi i do not speak in compliment to you or in respect to my circumst and your civil i sai nevertheless i do not look upon you who call yourselv reform without some chariti i dare not sai though i know it is our opinion in gener yet i dare not sai that you cannot be save i will by no mean limit the merci of christ so far as to think that he cannot receiv you into the bosom of hi church in a manner to us imperceiv and which it is imposs for us to know and i hope you have the same chariti for us i prai daili for your be all restor to christ church by whatsoev method he who is allwis is pleas to direct in the mean time sure you will allow it to consist with me as a roman to distinguish far between a protest and a pagan between him that call on jesu christ though in a wai which i do not think is accord to the true faith and a savag a barbarian that know no god no christ no redeem at all and if you ar not within the pale of the cathol church we hope you ar nearer be restor to it than those that know noth at all of god or hi church i rejoic therefor when i see thi poor man who you sai ha been a proflig and almost a murder kneel down and prai to jesu christ as we suppos he did though not fulli enlighten believ that god from whom everi such work proce will sensibl touch hi heart and bring him to the further knowledg of the truth in hi own time and if god shall influenc thi poor man to convert and instruct the ignor savag hi wife i can never believ that he shall be cast awai himself and have i not reason then to rejoic the nearer ani ar brought to the knowledg of christ though thei mai not be brought quit home into the bosom of the cathol church just at the time when i mai desir it leav it to the good of christ to perfect hi work in hi own time and hi own wai certainli i would rejoic if all the savag in america were brought like thi poor woman to prai to god though thei were to be all protest at first rather than thei should continu pagan and heathen firmli believ that he who had bestow that first light upon them would farther illumin them with a beam of hi heavenli grace and bring them into the pale of hi church when he should see good i wa astonish at the sincer and temper of thi truli piou papist as much as i wa oppress by the power of hi reason and it present occur to my thought that if such a temper wa univers we might be all cathol christian whatev church or particular profess we were join to or join in that a spirit of chariti would soon work us all up into right principl and in a word as he thought that the like chariti would make us all cathol as i told him i believ had all the member of hi church the like moder thei would soon be all protest and there we left that part for we never disput at all howev i talk to him anoth wai and take him by the hand my friend said i i wish all the clergi of the roman church were bless with such moder and an equal share of your chariti i am entir of your opinion but i must tell you that if you should preach such doctrin in spain or itali thei would put you into the inquisit it mai be so said he i know not what thei might do in spain and itali but i will not sai thei would be the better christian for that sever for i am sure there is no heresi in too much chariti well as will atkin and hi wife were gone our busi there wa over so we went back our own wai and when we came back we found them wait to be call in observ thi i ask my clergyman if we should discov to him that we had seen him under the bush or no and it wa hi opinion we should not but that we should talk to him first and hear what he would sai to us so we call him in alon nobodi be in the place but ourselv and i began with him thu will atkin said i prythe what educ had you what wa your father wa a better man than ever i shall be sir my father wa a clergyman rc what educ did he give you wa he would have taught me well sir but i despis all educ instruct or correct like a beast as i wa rc it is true solomon sai he that despiseth reproof is brutish wa ay sir i wa brutish inde i murder my father for god sake sir talk no more about that sir i murder my poor father priest ha a murder here the priest start for i interpret everi word as he spoke it and look pale it seem he believ that will had realli kill hi own father rc no no sir i do not understand him so will atkin explain yourself you did not kill your father did you with your own hand wa no sir i did not cut hi throat but i cut the thread of all hi comfort and shorten hi dai i broke hi heart by the most ungrat unnatur return for the most tender affection treatment that ever father gave or child could receiv rc well i did not ask you about your father to extort thi confess i prai god give you repent for it and forgiv you that and all your other sin but i ask you becaus i see that though you have not much learn yet you ar not so ignor as some ar in thing that ar good that you have known more of religion a great deal than you have practis wa though you sir did not extort the confess that i make about my father conscienc doe and whenev we come to look back upon our live the sin against our indulg parent ar certainli the first that touch us the wound thei make lie deepest and the weight thei leav will lie heaviest upon the mind of all the sin we can commit rc you talk too feelingli and sensibl for me atkin i cannot bear it wa you bear it master i dare sai you know noth of it rc ye atkin everi shore everi hill nai i mai sai everi tree in thi island is wit to the anguish of my soul for my ingratitud and base usag of a good tender father a father much like your by your descript and i murder my father as well as you will atkin but think for all that my repent is short of your too by a great deal i would have said more if i could have restrain my passion but i thought thi poor man repent wa so much sincer than mine that i wa go to leav off the discours and retir for i wa surpris with what he said and thought that instead of my go about to teach and instruct him the man wa made a teacher and instructor to me in a most surpris and unexpect manner i laid all thi befor the young clergyman who wa greatli affect with it and said to me did i not sai sir that when thi man wa convert he would preach to us all i tell you sir if thi on man be made a true penit here will be no need of me he will make christian of all in the island but have a littl compos myself i renew my discours with will atkin but will said i how come the sens of thi matter to touch you just now wa sir you have set me about a work that ha struck a dart through my veri soul i have been talk about god and religion to my wife in order as you direct me to make a christian of her and she ha preach such a sermon to me as i shall never forget while i live rc no no it is not your wife ha preach to you but when you were move religi argument to her conscienc ha flung them back upon you wa ay sir with such a forc as is not to be resist rc prai will let us know what pass between you and your wife for i know someth of it alreadi wa sir it is imposs to give you a full account of it i am too full to hold it and yet have no tongu to express it but let her have said what she will and though i cannot give you an account of it thi i can tell you of it that i resolv to amend and reform my life rc but tell us some of it how did you begin will for thi ha been an extraordinari case that is certain she ha preach a sermon inde if she ha wrought thi upon you wa why i first told her the natur of our law about marriag and what the reason were that men and women were oblig to enter into such compact as it wa neither in the power of on or other to break that otherwis order and justic could not be maintain and men would run from their wive and abandon their children mix confusedli with on anoth and neither famili be kept entir or inherit be settl by a legal descent rc you talk like a civilian will could you make her understand what you meant by inherit and famili thei know no such thing among the savag but marri ani how without ani regard to relat consanguin or famili brother and sister nai as i have been told even the father and daughter and the son and the mother wa i believ sir you ar misinformedmi wife assur me of the contrari and that thei abhor it perhap for ani further relat thei mai not be so exact as we ar but she tell me thei never touch on anoth in the near relat you speak of rc well what did she sai to what you told her wa she said she like it veri well and it wa much better than in her countri rc but did you tell her what marriag wa wa ay ay there began all our dialogu i ask her if she would be marri to me our wai she ask me what wai that wa i told her marriag wa appoint of god and here we had a strang talk togeth inde as ever man and wife had i believ nb thi dialogu between w atkin and hi wife as i

her in the knowledg of himself by hi spirit and that by some good provid if possibl she might some time or other come to have a bibl that she might read the word of god and be taught by him to know him thi wa the time that we saw him lift her up by the hand and saw him kneel down by her as abov thei had sever other discours it seem after thi too long to set down here and particularli she made him promis that sinc he confess hi own life had been a wick abomin cours of provoc against god he would reform it and not make god angri ani more lest he should make him dead as she call it and then she should be left alon and never be taught to know thi god better and lest he should be miser as he told her wick men should be after death thi wa a strang account and veri affect to us both but particularli the young clergyman he wa inde wonderfulli surpris with it but under the greatest afflict imagin that he could not talk to her that he could not speak english to make her understand him and as she spoke but veri broken english he could not understand her howev he turn himself to me and told me that he believ there must be more to do with thi woman than to marri her i did not understand him at first but at length he explain himself viz that she ought to be baptiz i agre with him in that part readili and wa for go about it present no no hold sir said he though i would have her baptiz by all mean yet i must observ that will atkin her husband ha inde brought her in a wonder manner to be will to embrac a religi life and ha given her just idea of the be of a god of hi power justic and merci yet i desir to know of him if he ha said ani thing to her of jesu christ and of the salvat of sinner of the natur of faith in him and the redempt by him of the holi spirit the resurrect the last judgment and a futur state i call will atkin again and ask him but the poor fellow fell immedi into tear and told us he had said someth to her of all those thing but that he wa himself so wick a creatur and hi own conscienc so reproach him with hi horrid ungodli life that he trembl at the apprehens that her knowledg of him should lessen the attent she should give to those thing and make her rather contemn religion than receiv it but he wa assur he said that her mind wa so dispos to receiv due impress of all those thing that if i would but discours with her she would make it appear to my satisfact that my labour would not be lost upon her accordingli i call her in and place myself as interpret between my religi priest and the woman i entreat him to begin with her but sure such a sermon wa never preach by a popish priest in these latter ag of the world and as i told him i thought he had all the zeal all the knowledg all the sincer of a christian without the error of a roman cathol and that i took him to be such a clergyman as the roman bishop were befor the church of rome assum spiritu sovereignti over the conscienc of men in a word he brought the poor woman to embrac the knowledg of christ and of redempt by him not with wonder and astonish onli as she did the first notion of a god but with joi and faith with an affect and a surpris degre of understand scarc to be imagin much less to be express and at her own request she wa baptiz when he wa prepar to baptiz her i entreat him that he would perform that offic with some caution that the man might not perceiv he wa of the roman church if possibl becaus of other ill consequ which might attend a differ among us in that veri religion which we were instruct the other in he told me that as he had no consecr chapel nor proper thing for the offic i should see he would do it in a manner that i should not know by it that he wa a roman cathol himself it i had not known it befor and so he did for sai onli some word over to himself in latin which i could not understand he pour a whole dishful of water upon the woman head pronounc in french veri loud mari which wa the name her husband desir me to give her for i wa her godfath i baptiz thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holi ghost so that none could know ani thing by it what religion he wa of he gave the benedict afterward in latin but either will atkin did not know but it wa in french or els did not take notic of it at that time as soon as thi wa over he marri them and after the marriag wa over he turn himself to will atkin and in a veri affection manner exhort him not onli to persever in that good disposit he wa in but to support the convict that were upon him by a resolut to reform hi life told him it wa in vain to sai he repent if he did not forsak hi crime repres to him how god had honour him with be the instrument of bring hi wife to the knowledg of the christian religion and that he should be care he did not dishonour the grace of god and that if he did he would see the heathen a better christian than himself the savag convert and the instrument cast awai he said a great mani good thing to them both and then recommend them in a few word to god good gave them the benedict again i repeat everi thing to them in english and thu end the ceremoni i think it wa the most pleasant agreeabl dai to me that ever i pass in my whole life but my clergyman had not done yet hi thought hung continu upon the convers of the thirtyseven savag and fain he would have staid upon the island to have undertaken it but i convinc him first that hi undertak wa impractic in itself and secondli that perhap i could put it into a wai of be done in hi absenc to hi satisfact of which by and by have thu brought the affair of the island to a narrow compass i wa prepar to go on board the ship when the young man whom i had taken out of the famish ship compani came to me and told me he understood i had a clergyman with me and that i had caus the englishmen to be marri to the savag whom thei call wive that he had a match too which he desir might be finish befor i went between two christian which he hope would not be disagre to me i knew thi must be the young woman who wa hi mother servant for there wa no other christian woman on the island so i began to persuad him not to do ani thing of that kind rashli or becaus he found himself in thi solitari circumst i repres that he had some consider substanc in the world and good friend as i understood by himself and by hi maid also that the maid wa not onli poor and a servant but wa unequ to him she be twentysix or twentyseven year old and he not abov seventeen or eighteen that he might veri probabl with my assist make a remov from thi wilder and come into hi own countri again and that then it would be a thousand to on but he would repent hi choic and the dislik of that circumst might be disadvantag to both i wa go to sai more but he interrupt me smile and told me with a great deal of modesti that i mistook in my guess that he had noth of that kind in hi thought hi present circumst be melancholi and disconsol enough and he wa veri glad to hear that i had some thought of put them in a wai to see their own countri again and that noth should have set him upon stai there but that the voyag i wa go wa so exceed long and hazard and would carri him quit out of the reach of all hi friend that he had noth to desir of me but that i would settl him in some littl properti of the island where he wa give him a servant or two and some few necessari and he would settl himself here like a planter wait the good time when if ever i return to england i would redeem him and hope i would not be unmind of him when i came to england that he would give me some letter to hi friend in london to let them know how good i had been to him and what part of the world and what circumst i had left him in and he promis me that whenev i redeem him the plantat and all the improv he had made upon it let the valu be what it would should be wholli mine hi discours wa veri prettili deliv consid hi youth and wa the more agreeabl to me becaus he told me posit the match wa not for himself i gave him all possibl assur that if i live to come safe to england i would deliv hi letter and do hi busi effectu and that he might depend i would never forget the circumst i left him in but still i wa impati to know who wa the person to be marri upon which he told me it wa my jack of all trade and hi maid susan i wa most agreeabl surpris when he name the match for inde i had thought it veri suitabl the charact of that man i have given alreadi and as for the maid she wa a veri honest modest sober and religi young woman had a veri good share of sens wa agreeabl enough in her person spoke veri handsom and to the purpos alwai with decenc and good manner and not backward to speak when ani thing requir it or impertin forward to speak when it wa not her busi veri handi and housewif in ani thing that wa befor her an excel manag and fit inde to have been gover to the whole island she knew veri well how to behav herself to all kind of folk she had about her and to better if she had found ani there the match be propos in thi manner we marri them the same dai and as i wa father at the altar as i mai sai and gave her awai so i gave her a portion for i appoint her and her husband a handsom larg space of ground for their plantat and inde thi match and the propos the young gentleman made to me to give him a small properti in the island put me upon parcel it out among them that thei might not quarrel afterward about their situat thi share out the land to them i left to will atkin who inde wa now grown a most sober grave manag fellow perfectli reform exceed piou and religi and as far as i mai be allow to speak posit in such a case i verili believ wa a true sincer penit he divid thing so justli and so much to everi on satisfact that thei onli desir on gener write under my hand for the whole which i caus to be drawn up and sign and seal to them set out the bound and situat of everi man plantat and testifi that i gave them therebi sever a right to the whole possess and inherit of the respect plantat or farm with their improv to them and their heir reserv all the rest of the island as my own properti and a certain rent for everi particular plantat after eleven year if i or ani on from me or in my name came to demand it produc an attest copi of the same write as to the govern and law among them i told them i wa not capabl of give them better rule than thei were abl to give themselv onli made them promis me to live in love and good neighbourhood with on anoth and so i prepar to leav them on thing i must not omit and that is that be now settl in a kind of commonwealth among themselv and have much busi in hand it wa but odd to have sevenandthirti indian live in a nook of the island independ and inde unemploi for except the provid themselv food which thei had difficulti enough in do sometim thei had no manner of busi or properti to manag i propos therefor to the governor spaniard that he should go to them with fridai father and propos to them to remov and either plant for themselv or take them into their sever famili as servant to be maintain for their labour but without be absolut slave for i would not admit them to make them slave by forc by ani mean becaus thei had their liberti given by capitul and as it were articl of surrend which thei ought not to break thei most willingli embrac the propos and came all veri cheerfulli along with him so we allot them land and plantat which three or four accept of but all the rest chose to be emploi as servant in the sever famili we had settl and thu my coloni wa in a manner settl as follow the spaniard possess my origin habit which wa the capit citi and extend their plantat all along the side of the brook which made the creek that i have so often describ as far as my bower and as thei increas their cultur it went alwai eastward the english live in the northeast part where will atkin and hi comrad began and came on southward and southwest toward the back part of the spaniard and everi plantat had a great addit of land to take in if thei found occas so that thei need not jostl on anoth for want of room all the west end of the island wa left uninhabit that if ani of the savag should come on shore there onli for their usual customari barbar thei might come and go if thei disturb nobodi nobodi would disturb them and no doubt but thei were often ashor and went awai again for i never heard that the planter were ever attack and disturb ani more it now came into my thought that i had hint to my friend the clergyman that the work of convert the savag might perhap be set on foot in hi absenc to hi satisfact and i told him that now i thought it wa put in a fair wai for the savag be thu divid among the christian if thei would but everi on of them do their part with those which came under their hand i hope it might have a veri good effect he agre present in that if said he thei will do their part but how sai he shall we obtain that of them i told him we would call them all togeth and leav it in charg with them or go to them on by on which he thought best so we divid ith to speak to the spaniard who were all papist and i to the english who were all protest and we recommend it earnestli to them and made them promis that thei would never make ani distinct of papist or protest in their exhort the savag to turn christian but teach them the gener knowledg of the true god and of their saviour jesu christ and thei likewis promis us that thei would never have ani differ or disput on with anoth about religion when i came to will atkinss hous i mai call it so for such a hous or such a piec of basketwork i believ wa not stand in the world again i sai when i came thither i found the young woman i have mention abov and william atkinss wife were becom intim and thi prudent and religi young woman had perfect the work will atkin had begun and though it wa not abov four dai after what i have relat yet the newbapt savag woman wa made such a christian as i have seldom heard of ani like her in all my observ or convers in the world it came next into my mind in the morn befor i went to them that among all the need thing i had to leav with them i had not left a bibl in which i shew myself less consid for them than my good friend the widow wa for me when she sent me the cargo of l from lisbon where she pack up three bibl and a prayerbook howev the good woman chariti had a greater extent than ever she imagin for thei were reserv for the comfort and instruct of those that made much better us of them than i had done i took on of the bibl in my pocket and when i came to william atkinss tent or hous i found the young woman and atkinss baptiz wife had been discours of religion togeth for william atkin told it me with a great deal of joi i ask if thei were togeth now and he said ye so i went into the hous and he with me and we found them togeth veri earnest in discours o sir sai william atkin when god ha sinner to reconcil to himself and alien to bring home he never want a messeng my wife ha got a new instructori knew i wa unworthi as i wa incap of that workthat young woman ha been sent hither from heavensh is enough to convert a whole island of savag the young woman blush and rose up to go awai but i desir her to sit still i told her she had a good work upon her hand and i hope god would bless her in it we talk a littl and i did not perceiv thei had ani book among them though i did not ask but i put my hand in my pocket and pull out my bibl here said i to atkin i have brought you an assist that perhap you had not befor the man wa so confound that he wa not abl to speak for some time but recov himself he take it with both hand and turn to hi wife here my dear sai he did not i tell you our god though he live abov could hear what we said here is the book i prai for when you and i kneel down under the bush now god ha heard us and sent it when he had said thu the man fell in such transport of a passion joi that between the joi of have it and give god thank for it the tear ran down hi face like a child that wa cry the woman wa surpris and wa like to have run into a mistak that none of us were awar of for she firmli believ god had sent the book upon her husband petit it is true that providenti it wa so and might be taken so in a consequ sens but i believ it would have been no difficult matter at that time to have persuad the poor woman to have believ that an express messeng came from heaven on purpos to bring that individu book but it wa too seriou a matter to suffer ani delus to take place so i turn to the young woman and told her we did not desir to impos upon the convert in her first and more ignor understand of thing and beg her to explain to her that god mai be veri properli said to answer our petit when in the cours of hi provid such thing ar in a particular manner brought to pass as we petit for but we do not expect return from heaven in a miracul and particular manner and that it is our merci it is not so thi the young woman did afterward effectu so that there wa i assur you no priestcraft us here and i should have thought it on of the most unjustifi fraud in the world to have had it so but the surpris of joi upon will atkin is realli not to be express and there we mai be sure wa no delus sure no man wa ever more thank in the world for ani thing of it kind than he wa for thi bibl and i believ never ani man wa glad of a bibl from a better principl and though he had been a most proflig creatur desper headstrong outrag furiou and wick to a great degre yet thi man is a stand rule to us all for the well instruct children viz that parent should never give over to teach and instruct or ever despair of the success of their endeavour let the children be ever so obstin refractori or to appear insens of instruct for if ever god in hi provid touch the conscienc of such the forc of their educ return upon them and the earli instruct of parent is not lost though it mai have been mani year laid asleep but some time or other thei mai find the benefit of it thu it wa with thi poor man howev ignor he wa or divest of religion and christian knowledg he found he had some to do with now more ignor than himself and that the least part of the instruct of hi good father that could now come to hi mind wa of us to him among the rest it occur to him he said how hi father us to insist much upon the inexpress valu of the bibl the privileg and bless of it to nation famili and person but he never entertain the least notion of the worth of it till now when be to talk to heathen savag and barbarian he want the help of the written oracl for hi assist the young woman wa veri glad of it also for the present occas though she had on and so had the youth on board our ship among the good which were not yet brought on shore and now have said so mani thing of thi young woman i cannot omit tell on stori more of her and myself which ha someth in it veri inform and remark i have relat to what extrem the poor young woman wa reduc how her mistress wa starv to death and did die on board that unhappi ship we met at sea and how the whole ship compani be reduc to the last extrem the gentlewoman and her son and thi maid were first hardli us as to provis and at last total neglect and starv that is to sai brought to the last extrem of hunger on dai be discours with her upon the extrem thei suffer i ask her if she could describ by what she felt what it wa to starv and how it appear she told me she believ she could and she told her tale veri distinctli thu first sir said she we had for some dai fare exceed hard and suffer veri great hunger but now at last we were wholli without food of ani kind except sugar and a littl wine and a littl water the first dai after i had receiv no food at all i found myself toward even first empti and sickish at my stomach and nearer night mightili inclin to yawn and sleepi i lai down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep and slept about three hour and awak a littl refresh have taken a glass of wine when i lai down after be about three hour awak it be about five oclock in the morn i found myself empti and my stomach sickish again and lai down again but could not sleep at all be veri faint and ill and thu i continu all the second dai with a strang varietyfirst hungri then sick again with retch to vomit the second night be oblig to go to bed again without ani food more than a draught of fair water and be asleep i dream i wa at barbado and that the market wa mightili stock with provis that i bought some for my mistress and went and dine veri heartili i thought my stomach wa full after thi as it would have been after or at a good dinner but when i wake i wa exceedingli sunk in my spirit to find myself in the extrem of famin the last glass of wine we had i drank and put sugar into it becaus of it have some spirit to suppli nourish but there be no substanc in the stomach for the digest offic to work upon i found the onli effect of the wine wa to rais disagre fume from the stomach into the head and i lai as thei told me stupid and senseless as on drunk for some time the third dai in the morn after a night of strang and confus inconsist dream and rather doze than sleep i awak raven and furiou with hunger and i question had not my understand return and conquer it i sai i question whether if i had been a mother and had had a littl child with me it life would have been safe or no thi last about three hour dure which time i wa twice rage mad as ani creatur in bedlam as my young master told me and as he can now inform you in on of these fit of lunaci or distract whether by the motion of the ship or some slip of my foot i know not i fell down and struck my face against the corner of a palletb in which my mistress lai and with the blow the blood gush out of my nose and the cabinboi bring me a littl basin i sat down and bled into it a great deal and as the blood ran from me i came to myself and the violenc of the flame or the fever i wa in abat and so did the raven part of the hunger then i grew sick and retch to vomit but could not for i had noth in my stomach to bring up after i had bled some time i swoon and thei all believ i wa dead but i came to myself soon after and then had a most dread pain in my stomach not to be describ not like the colic but a gnaw eager pain for food and toward night it went off with a kind of earnest wish or long for food someth like as i suppos the long of a woman with child i took anoth draught of water with sugar in it but my stomach loath the sugar and brought it all up again then i took a draught of water without sugar and that stai with me and i laid me down upon the bed prai most heartili that it would pleas god to take me awai and compos my mind in hope of it i slumber awhil and then wake thought myself dy be light with vapour from an empti stomach i recommend my soul to god and earnestli wish that somebodi would throw me into the sea all thi while my mistress lai by me just as i thought expir but bore it with much more patienc than i and gave the last bit of bread she had to her child my young master who would not have taken it but she oblig him to eat it and i believ it save hi life toward the morn i slept again and first when i awak i fell into a violent passion of cry and after that had a second fit of violent hunger so that i got up raven and in a most dread condit had my mistress been dead so much as i love her i am certain i should have eaten a piec of her flesh with as much relish and as unconcern as ever i did the flesh of ani creatur appoint for food and onc or twice i wa go to bite my own arm at last i saw the basin in which wa the blood had bled at my nose the dai befor i ran to it and swallow it with such hast and such a greedi appetit as if i had wonder nobodi had taken it befor and afraid it should be taken from me now though after it wa down the thought of it fill me with horror yet it check the fit of hunger and i drank a draught of fair water and wa compos and refresh for some hour after it thi wa the fourth dai and thu i held it till toward night when within the compass of three hour i had all these sever circumst over again on after anoth viz sick sleepi eagerli hungri pain in the stomach then raven again then sick again then lunat then cry then raven again and so everi quarter of an hour and my strength wast exceedingli at night i laid me down have no comfort but in the hope that i should die befor morn all thi night i had no sleep but the hunger wa now turn into a diseas and i had a terribl colic and gripe wind instead of food have found it wai into my bowel and in thi condit i lai till morn when i wa surpris a littl with the cri and lament of my young master who call out to me that hi mother wa dead i lift myself up a littl for i had not strength to rise but found she wa not dead though she wa abl to give veri littl sign of life i had then such convuls in my stomach for want of some susten that i cannot describ them with such frequent throe and pang of appetit that noth but the tortur of death can imit and thi condit i wa in when i heard the seamen abov cry out a sail a sail and halloo and jump about as if thei were distract i wa not abl to get off from the bed and my mistress much less and my master wa so sick that i thought he had been expir so we could not open the cabindoor or get ani account what it wa that occas such a combust nor had we ani convers with the ship compani for two dai thei have told us thei had not a mouth of ani thing to eat in the ship and thei told us afterward thei thought we had been dead it wa thi dread condit we were in when you were sent to save our live and how you found us sir you know as well as i and better too thi wa her own relat and is such a distinct account of starv to death as i confess i never met with and wa exceed entertain to me i am the rather apt to believ it to be a true account becaus the youth gave me an account of a good part of it though i must own not so distinct and so feelingli as hi maid and the rather becaus it seem hi mother fed him at the price of her own life but the poor maid though her constitut be stronger than that of her mistress who wa in year and a weakli woman too she might struggl harder with it i sai the poor maid might be suppos to feel the extrem someth sooner than her mistress who might be allow to keep the last bit someth longer than she part with ani to reliev the maid no question as the case is here relat if our ship or some other had not so providenti met them a few dai more would have end all their live unless thei had prevent it by eat on anoth and even that as their case stood would have serv them but a littl while thei be five hundr leagu from ani land or ani possibl of relief other than in the miracul manner it happenedbut thi is by the wai i return to my disposit of thing among the peopl and first it is to be observ here that for mani reason i did not think fit to let them know ani thing of the sloop i had frame and which i thought of set up among them for i found at least at my first come such seed of divis among them that i saw it plainli had i set up the sloop and left it among them thei would upon veri light disgust have separ and gone awai from on anoth or perhap have turn pirat and so made the island a den of thiev instead of a plantat of sober and religi peopl as i intend it to be nor did i leav the two piec of brass cannon that i had on board or the two quarterdeck gun that my nephew took extraordinari for the same reason i thought thei had enough to qualifi them for a defens war against ani that should invad them but i wa not to set them up for an offens war or to encourag them to go abroad to attack other which in the end would onli bring ruin and destruct upon themselv and all their undertak i reserv the sloop therefor and the gun for their servic anoth wai as i shall observ in it place i have now done with the island i left them all in good circumst and in a flourish condit and went on board my ship again the fifth dai of mai have been five and twenti dai among them and as thei were all resolv to stai upon the island till i came to remov them i promis to send some further relief from the brasil if i could possibl find an opportun and particularli i promis to send them some cattl such as sheep hog and cow for as to the two cow and calv which i brought from england we had been oblig by the length of our voyag to kill them at sea for want of hai to feed them the next dai give them a salut of five gun at part we set sail and arriv at the bai of all saint in the brasil in about twentytwo dai meet noth remark in our passag but thi that about three dai after we sail be becalm and the current set strong to the nne run as it were into a bai or gulf on the land side we were driven someth out of our cours and onc or twice our men cri land to the westward but whether it wa the contin or island we could not tell by ani mean but the third dai toward even the sea smooth and the weather calm we saw the sea as it were cover toward the land with someth veri black not be abl to discov what it wa but after some time our chief mate go up the main shroud a littl wai and look at them with a perspect cri out it wa an armi i could not imagin what he meant by an armi and spoke a littl hastili call the fellow a fool or some such word nai sir sai he dont be angri for it is an armi and a fleet too for i believ there ar a thousand cano and you mai see them paddl along and thei ar come toward us too apac and full of men i wa a littl surpris then inde and so wa my nephew the captain for he had heard such terribl stori of them in the island and have never been in those sea befor that he could not tell what to think of it but said two or three time we should all be devour i must confess consid we were becalm and the current set strong toward the shore i like it the wors howev i bade him not be afraid but bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that we must engag them the weather continu calm and thei came on apac toward us so i gave order to come to an anchor and furl all our sail as for the savag i told them thei had noth to fear from them but fire and therefor thei should get their boat out and fasten them on close by the head and the other by the stern and man them both well and wait the issu in that postur thi i did that the men in the boat might be readi with sheet and bucket to put out ani fire these savag might endeavour to fix upon the outsid of the ship in thi postur we lai by for them and in a littl while thei came up with us but never wa such a horrid sight seen by christian my mate wa much mistaken in hi calcul of their number i mean of a thousand cano the most we could make of them when thei came up be about and a great mani of them too for some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them some more and the least six or seven when thei came nearer to us thei seem to be struck with wonder and astonish as at a sight which thei had doubtless never seen befor nor could thei at first as we afterward understood know what to make of us thei came boldli up howev veri near to us and seem to go about to row round us but we call to our men in the boat not to let them come too near them thi veri order brought us to an engag with them without our design it for five or six of the larg cano came so near our longboat that our men beckon with their hand to keep them back which thei understood veri well and went back but at their retreat about fifti arrow came on board us from those boat and on of our men in the longboat wa veri much wound howev i call to them not to fire by ani mean but we hand down some deal board into the boat and the carpent present set up a kind of fenc like wast board to cover them from the arrow of the savag if thei should shoot again about halfanhour afterward thei all came up in a bodi astern of us and so near that we could easili discern what thei were though we could not tell their design and i easili found thei were some of my old friend the same sort of savag that i had been us to engag with in a short time more thei row a littl farther out to sea till thei came directli broadsid with us and then row down straight upon us till thei came so near that thei could hear us speak upon thi i order all my men to keep close lest thei should shoot ani more arrow and made all our gun readi but be so near as to be within hear i made fridai go out upon the deck and call out aloud to them in hi languag to know what thei meant whether thei understood him or not that i knew not but as soon as he had call to them six of them who were in the foremost or nearest boat to us turn their cano from us and stoop down show us their nake back whether thi wa a defianc or challeng we knew not or whether it wa done in mere contempt or as a signal to the rest but immedi fridai cri out thei were go to shoot and unhappili for him poor fellow thei let fly about three hundr of their arrow and to my inexpress grief kill poor fridai no other man be in their sight the poor fellow wa shot with no less than three arrow and about three more fell veri near him such unlucki marksmen thei were i wa so annoi at the loss of my old trusti servant and companion that i immedi order five gun to be load with small shot and four with great and gave them such a broadsid as thei had never heard in their live befor thei were not abov half a cabl length off when we fire and our gunner took their aim so well that three or four of their cano were overset as we had reason to believ by on shot onli the ill manner of turn up their bare back to us gave us no great offenc neither did i know for certain whether that which would pass for the greatest contempt among us might be understood so by them or not therefor in return i had onli resolv to have fire four or five gun at them with powder onli which i knew would frighten them suffici but when thei shot at us directli with all the furi thei were capabl of and especi as thei had kill my poor fridai whom i so entir love and valu and who inde so well deserv it i thought myself not onli justifi befor god and man but would have been veri glad if i could have overset everi cano there and drown everi on of them i can neither tell how mani we kill nor how mani we wound at thi broadsid but sure such a fright and hurri never were seen among such a multitud there were thirteen or fourteen of their cano split and overset in all and the men all set aswim the rest frighten out of their wit scour awai as fast as thei could take but littl care to save those whose boat were split or spoil with our shot so i suppos that mani of them were lost and our men took up on poor fellow swim for hi life abov an hour after thei were all gone our small shot from our cannon must need kill and wound a great mani but in short we never knew ani thing how it went with them for thei fled so fast that in three hour or thereabout we could not see abov three or four straggl cano nor did we ever see the rest ani more for a breez of wind spring up the same even we weigh and set sail for the brasil we had a prison inde but the creatur wa so sullen that he would neither eat nor speak and we all fanci he would starv himself to death but i took a wai to cure him for i made them take him and turn him into the longboat and make him believ thei would toss him into the sea again and so leav him where thei found him if he would not speak nor would that do but thei realli did throw him into the sea and came awai from him and then he follow them for he swam like a cork and call to them in hi tongu though thei knew not on word of what he said howev at last thei took him in again and then he began to be more tractabl nor did i ever design thei should drown him we were now under sail again but i wa the most disconsol creatur aliv for want of my man fridai and would have been veri glad to have gone back to the island to have taken on of the rest from thenc for my occas but it could not be so we went on we had on prison as i have said and it wa a long while befor we could make him understand ani thing but in time our men taught him some english and he began to be a littl tractabl afterward we inquir what countri he came from but could make noth of what he said for hi speech wa so odd all guttur and spoken in the throat in such a hollow and odd manner that we could never form a word from him and we were all of opinion that thei might speak that languag as well if thei were gag as otherwis nor could we perceiv that thei had ani occas either for teeth tongu lip or palat but form their word just as a huntinghorn form a tune with an open throat he told us howev some time after when we had taught him to speak a littl english that thei were go with their king to fight a great battl when he said king we ask him how mani king he said there were five nation we could not make him understand the plural s and that thei all join to go against two nation we ask him what made them come up to us he said to make te great wonder lookwher it is to be observ that all those nativ as also those of africa when thei learn english thei alwai add two es at the end of the word where we us on and place the accent upon the last of them as make take and the like and we could not break them of it nai i could hardli make fridai leav it off though at last he did and now i name the poor fellow onc more i must take my last leav of him poor honest fridai we buri him with all decenc and solemn possibl by put him into a coffin and throw him into the sea and i caus them to fire eleven gun for him and so end the life of the most grate faith honest and most affection servant that ever man had we now went awai with a fair wind for brasil and in about twelv dai time we made land in the latitud of five degre south of the line be the northeasternmost land of all that part of america we kept on s by e in sight of the shore four dai when we made the cape st augustin and in three dai came to an anchor off the bai of all saint the old place of my deliver from whenc came both my good and evil fate never did a ship come to thi part that had less busi than i had and yet it wa with great difficulti that we were admit to hold the least correspond on shore not my partner himself who wa aliv and made a great figur among them not my two merchant truste nor the fame of my wonder preserv in the island could obtain me that favour but my partner rememb that i had given five hundr moidor to the prior of the monasteri of the augustin and three hundr and seventytwo to the poor went to the monasteri and oblig the prior that then wa to go to the governor and beg leav for me present with the captain and on more besid eight seamen to come on shore and no more and thi upon condit absolut capitul for that we should not offer to land ani good out of the ship or to carri ani person awai without licenc thei were so strict with us as to land ani good that it wa with extrem difficulti that i got on shore three bale of english good such as fine broadcloth stuff and some linen which i had brought for a present to my partner he wa a veri gener broadheart man though like me he came from littl at first and though he knew not that i had the least design of give him ani thing he sent me on board a present of fresh provis wine and sweetmeat worth abov thirti moidor includ some tobacco and three or four fine medal in gold but i wa even with him in my present which as i have said consist of fine broadcloth english stuff lace and fine holland also i deliv him about the valu of l sterl in the same good for other us and i oblig him to set up the sloop which i had brought with me from england as i have said for the us of my coloni in order to send the refresh i intend to my plantat accordingli he got hand and finish the sloop in a veri few dai for she wa alreadi frame and i gave the master of her such instruct as he could not miss the place nor did he miss it as i had an account from my partner afterward i got him soon load with the small cargo i had sent them and on of our seamen that had been on shore with me there offer to go with the sloop and settl there upon my letter to the governor spaniard to allot him a suffici quantiti of land for a plantat and give him some cloth and tool for hi plant work which he said he understood have been an old planter in maryland and a buccan into the bargain i encourag the fellow by grant all he desir and as an addit i gave him the savag which we had taken prison of war to be hi slave and order the governor spaniard to give him hi share of everyth he want with the rest when we came to fit thi man out my old partner told me there wa a certain veri honest fellow a brasil planter of hi acquaint who had fallen into he displeasur of the church i know not what the matter is with him sai he but on my conscienc i think he is a heret in hi heart and he ha been oblig to conceal himself for fear of the inquisit that he would be veri glad of such an opportun to make hi escap with hi wife and two daughter and if i would let them go to the island and allot them a plantat he would give them a small stock to begin with for the offic of the inquisit had seiz all hi effect and estat and he had noth left but a littl household stuff and two slave and add he though i hate hi principl yet i would not have him fall into their hand for he will assuredli be burnt aliv if he doe i grant thi present and join my englishman with them and we conceal the man and hi wife and daughter on board our ship till the sloop put out to go to sea and then have put all their good on board the sloop some time befor we put them on board the sloop after she wa got out of the bai our seaman wa mightili pleas with thi new partner and their stock inde wa much alik rich in tool and in prepar for a farm but noth to begin with but as abov howev thei carri over with them which wa worth all the rest some materi for plant sugarcan with some plant of cane which he i mean the portug man understood veri well among the rest of the suppli sent my tenant in the island i sent them by thi sloop three milchcow and five calv about twentytwo hog among them three sow big with pig two mare and a stonehors for my spaniard accord to my promis i engag three portug women to go and recommend it to them to marri them and us them kindli i could have procur more women but i rememb that the poor persecut man had two daughter and there were but five of the spaniard that want the rest had wive of their own though in anoth countri all thi cargo arriv safe and as you mai easili suppos veri welcom to my old inhabit who were now with thi addit between sixti and seventi peopl besid littl children of which there were a great mani i found letter at london from them all by wai of lisbon when i came back to england be sent back to the brasil by thi sloop of which i shall take some notic in it place i have now done with my island and all manner of discours about it and whoever read the rest of my memorandum would do well to turn hi thought entir from it and expect to read onli of the folli of an old man not warn by hi own harm much less by those of other men to bewar of the like not cool by almost forti year miseri and disappoint not satisfi with prosper beyond expect not made cautiou by afflict and distress beyond irrit i had no more busi to go to the east indi than a man at full liberti and have commit no crime ha to go to the turnkei at newgat and desir him to lock him up among the prison there and starv him had i taken a small vessel from england and gone directli to the island had i load her as i did the other vessel with all the necessari for the plantat and for my peopl took a patent from the govern here to have secur my properti in subject onli to that of england which to be sure i might have obtain had i carri over cannon and ammunit servant and peopl to plant and take possess of the place fortifi and strengthen it in the name of england and increas it with peopl as i might easili have done had i then settl myself there and sent the ship back load with good rice as i might also have done in six month time and order my friend to have fit her out again for our suppli had i done thi and staid there myself i had at least act like a man of common sens but i wa possess with a wander spirit scorn all advantag pleas myself with be the patron of these peopl i had place there and do for them in a kind of haughti majest wai like an old patriarch monarch provid for them as if i had been father of the whole famili as well as of the plantat but i never so much as pretend to plant in the name of ani govern or nation or to acknowledg ani princ or to call my peopl subject to ani on nation more than anoth nai i never so much as gave the place a name but left it as i found it belong to no man and the peopl under no disciplin or govern but my own who though i had an influenc over them as father and benefactor had no author or power to act or command on wai or other farther than voluntari consent move them to compli yet even thi had i staid there would have done well enough but as i rambl from them and came thither no more the last letter i had from ani of them were by my partner mean who afterward sent anoth sloop to the place and who sent me word though i had not the letter till five year after it wa written that thei went on but poorli were malecont with their long stai there that will atkin wa dead that five of the spaniard were come awai and that though thei had not been much molest by the savag yet thei had had some skirmish with them that thei beg of him to write to me to think of the promis i had made to fetch them awai that thei might see their own countri again befor thei di but i wa gone a wildgoos chase inde and thei who will have ani more of me must be content to follow me through a new varieti of folli hardship and wild adventur wherein the justic of provid mai be duli observ and we mai see how easili heaven can gorg us with our own desir make the strongest of our wish to be our afflict and punish us most sever with those veri thing which we think it would be our utmost happi to be allow in let no wise man flatter himself with the strength of hi own judgment as if he wa abl to choos ani particular station of life for himself man is a shortsight creatur see but a veri littl wai befor him and as hi passion ar none of hi best friend so hi particular affect ar gener hi worst counsellor i sai thi with respect to the impetu desir i had from a youth to wander into the world and how evid it now wa that thi principl wa preserv in me for my punish how it came on the manner the circumst and the conclus of it it is easi to give you histor and with it utmost varieti of particular but the secret end of divin provid in thu permit us to be hurri down the stream of our own desir ar onli to be understood of those who can listen to the voic of provid and draw religi consequ from god justic and their own mistak be it had i busi or no busi awai i went it is no time now to enlarg ani farther upon the reason or absurd of my own conduct but to come to the historyi wa embark for the voyag and the voyag i went i shall onli add here that my honest and truli piou clergyman left me here a ship be readi to go to lisbon he ask me leav to go thither be still as he observ bound never to finish ani voyag he began how happi had it been for me if i had gone with him but it wa too late now all thing heaven appoint ar best had i gone with him i had never had so mani thing to be thank for and you had never heard of the second part of the travel and adventur of robinson cruso so i must leav here the fruitless exclaim at myself and go on with my voyag from the brasil we made directli awai over the atlant sea to the cape de bonn esper or as we call it the cape of good hope and had a toler good voyag our cours gener southeast now and then a storm and some contrari wind but my disast at sea were at an end my futur rub and cross event were to befal me on shore that it might appear the land wa as well prepar to be our scourg as the sea when heaven who direct the circumst of thing pleas to appoint it to be so our ship wa on a trade voyag and had a supercargo on board who wa to direct all her motion after she arriv at the cape onli be limit to a certain number of dai for stai by charterparti at the sever port she wa to go to thi wa none of my busi neither did i meddl with it at all my nephew the captain and the supercargo adjust all those thing between them as thei thought fit we made no stai at the cape longer than wa need to take in fresh water but made the best of our wai for the coast of coromandel we were inde inform that a french man of war of fifti gun and two larg merchantship were gone for the indi and as i knew we were at war with franc i had some apprehens of them but thei went their own wai and we heard no more of them i shall not pester my account or the reader with descript of place journal of our voyag variat of the compass latitud meridian distanc tradewind situat of port and the like such as almost all the histori of long navig ar full of and which make the read tiresom enough and ar perfectli unprofit to all that read except onli to those who ar to go to those place themselv it is enough to name the port and place which we touch at and what occur to us upon our pass from on to anoth we touch first at the island of madagascar where though the peopl ar fierc and treacher and in particular veri well arm with lanc and bow which thei us with inconceiv dexter yet we fare veri well with them awhil thei treat us veri civilli and for some trifl which we gave them such as knive scissor c thei brought us eleven good fat bullock middl in size but veri good in flesh which we took in partli for fresh provis for our present spend and the rest to salt for the ship us we were oblig to stai here for some time after we had furnish ourselv with provis and i that wa alwai too curiou to look into everi nook of the world wherev i came wa for go on shore as often as i could it wa on the east side of the island that we went on shore on even and the peopl who by the wai ar veri numer came throng about us and stood gaze at us at a distanc as we had trade freeli with them and had been kindli us we thought ourselv in no danger but when we saw the peopl we cut three bough out of a tree and stuck them up at a distanc from us which it seem is a mark in the countri not onli of truce and friendship but when it is accept the other side set up three pole or bough also which is a signal that thei accept the truce too but then thi is a known condit of the truce that you ar not to pass beyond their three pole toward them nor thei come past your three pole or bough toward you so that you ar perfectli secur within the three pole and all the space between your pole and their is allow like a market for free convers traffic and commerc when you go thither you must not carri your weapon with you and if thei come into that space thei stick up their javelin and lanc all at the first pole and come on unarm but if ani violenc is offer them and the truce therebi broken awai thei run to the pole and lai hold of their weapon and then the truce is at an end it happen on even when we went on shore that a greater number of their peopl came down than usual but all wa veri friendli and civil thei brought with them sever kind of provis for which we satisfi them with such toi as we had their women also brought us milk and root and sever thing veri accept to us and all wa quiet and we made us a littl tent or hut of some bough of tree and lai on shore all that night i know not what wa the occas but i wa not so well satisfi to lie on shore as the rest and the boat ly at an anchor about a stone cast from the land with two men in her to take care of her i made on of them come on shore and get some bough of tree to cover us also in the boat i spread the sail on the bottom of the boat and lai on board under the cover of the branch of the tree all night about two oclock in the morn we heard on of our men make a terribl nois on the shore call out for god sake to bring the boat in and come and help them for thei were all like to be murder at the same time i heard the fire of five musket which wa the number of the gun thei had and that three time over for it seem the nativ here were not so easili fright with gun as the savag were in america where i had to do with them all thi while i knew not what wa the matter but rous immedi from sleep with the nois i caus the boat to be thrust in and resolv with three fusil we had on board to land and assist our men we got the boat soon to the shore but our men were in too much hast for be come to the shore thei plung into the water to get to the boat with all the expedit thei could be pursu by between three and four hundr men our men were but nine in all and onli five of them had fusil with them the rest inde had pistol and sword but thei were of small us to them we took up seven of our men and with difficulti enough too three of them be veri ill wound and that which wa still wors wa that while we stood in the boat to take our men in we were in as much danger as thei were in on shore for thei pour their arrow in upon us so thick that we were fain to barricad the side of the boat up with the bench and two or three loos board which to our great satisfact we had by mere accid or provid rather in the boat and yet had it been daylight thei ar it seem such exact marksmen that if thei could have seen but the least part of ani of us thei would have been sure of us we had by the light of the moon a littl sight of them as thei stood pelt us from the shore with dart and arrow and have got readi our firearm we gave them a vollei and we could hear by the cri of some of them that we had wound sever howev thei stood thu in battl arrai on the shore till break of dai which we suppos wa that thei might see the better to take their aim at us in thi condit we lai and could not tell how to weigh our anchor or set up our sail becaus we must need stand up in the boat and thei were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot we made signal of distress to the ship which though she rode a leagu off yet my nephew the captain hear our fire and by glass perceiv the postur we lai in and that we fire toward the shore pretti well understood us and weigh anchor with all speed he stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship and then sent anoth boat with ten hand in her to assist us but we call to them not to come too near tell them what condit we were in howev thei stood in nearer to us and on of the men take the end of a towlin in hi hand and keep our boat between him and the enemi so that thei could not perfectli see him swam on board us and made the line fast to the boat upon which we slipt our littl cabl and leav our anchor behind thei tow us out of the reach of the arrow we all the while ly close behind the barricad we had made as soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore that she could lai her side to the shore we ran along just by them and we pour in a broadsid among them load with piec of iron and lead small bullet and such stuff besid the great shot which made a terribl havoc among them when we were got on board and out of danger we had time to examin into the occas of thi frai and inde our supercargo who had been often in those part put me upon it for he said he wa sure the inhabit would not have touch us after we had made a truce if we had not done someth to provok them to it at length it came out viz that an old woman who had come to sell us some milk had brought it within our pole with a young woman with her who also brought some root or herb and while the old woman whether she wa mother to the young woman or no thei could not tell wa sell us the milk on of our men offer some rude to the wench that wa with her at which the old woman made a great nois howev the seaman would not quit hi prize but carri her out of the old woman sight among the tree it be almost dark the old woman went awai without her and as we suppos made an outcri among the peopl she came from who upon notic rais thi great armi upon us in three or four hour and it wa great odd but we had been all destroi on of our men wa kill with a lanc that wa thrown at him just at the begin of the attack as he salli out of the tent we had made the rest came off free all but the fellow who wa the occas of all the mischief who paid dear enough for hi black mistress for we could not hear what becam of him a great while we lai upon the shore two dai after though the wind present and made signal for him made our boat sail up shore and down shore sever leagu but in vain so we were oblig to give him over and if he alon had suffer for it the loss had been the less i could not satisfi myself howev without ventur on shore onc more to try if i could learn ani thing of him or them it wa the third night after the action that i had a great mind to learn if i could by ani mean what mischief he had done and how the game stood on the indian side i wa care to do it in the dark lest we should be attack again but i ought inde to have been sure that the men i went with had been under my command befor i engag in a thing so hazard and mischiev as i wa brought into it without my knowledg or desir we took twenti stout fellow with us as ani in the ship besid the supercargo and myself and we land two hour befor midnight at the same place where the indian stood drawn up the even befor i land here becaus my design as i have said wa chiefli to see if thei had quit the field and if thei had left ani mark behind them or of the mischief we had done them and i thought if we could surpris on or two of them perhap we might get our man again by wai of exchang we land without ani nois and divid our men into two compani whereof the boatswain command on and i the other we neither could hear nor see ani bodi stir when we land so we march up on bodi at a distanc from the other to the field of battl at first we could see noth it be veri dark but by and by our boatswain that led the first parti stumbl and fell over a dead bodi thi made them halt there awhil for know by the circumst that thei were at the place where the indian had stood thei wait for my come up here we conclud to halt till the moon began to rise which we knew would be in less than an hour and then we could easili discern the havoc we had made among them we told twoandthirti bodi upon the ground whereof two were not quit dead some had an arm and some a leg shot off and on hi head those that were wound we suppos thei had carri awai when we had made as i thought a full discoveri of all we could come at the knowledg of i wa for go on board again but the boatswain and hi parti often sent me word that thei were resolv to make a visit to the indian town where these dog as thei call them dwelt and desir me to go along with them and if thei could find them as thei still fanci thei should thei did not doubt thei said get a good booti and it might be thei might find thoma jeffri there that wa the man name we had lost had thei sent to ask my leav to go i knew well enough what answer to have given them for i would have command them instantli on board know it wa not a hazard fit for us to run who had a ship and a ship load in our charg and a voyag to make which depend veri much upon the live of the men but as thei sent me word thei were resolv to go and onli ask me and my compani to go along with them i posit refus it and rose up for i wa sit on the ground in order to go to the boat on or two of the men began to importun me to go and when i still refus posit began to grumbl and sai thei were not under my command and thei would go come jack sai on of the men will you go with me i will go for on jack said he would and anoth follow and then anoth and in a word thei all left me but on whom with much difficulti too i persuad to stai so the supercargo and i with on man went back to the boat where i told them we would stai for them and take care to take in as mani of them as should be left for i told them it wa a mad thing thei were go about and suppos most of them would run the fate of thoma jeffri thei told me like seamen thei would warrant it thei would come off again and thei would take care c so awai thei went i entreat them to consid the ship and the voyag that their live were not their own and that thei were entrust with the voyag in some measur that if thei miscarri the ship might be lost for want of their help and that thei could not answer it to god and man i said a great deal more to them on that head but i might as well have talk to the mainmast of the ship thei were mad upon their journei onli thei gave me good word and beg i would not be angri said thei would be veri cautiou and thei did not doubt but thei would be back again in about an hour at farthest for the indian town thei said wa not abov half a mile off though thei found it abov two mile befor thei got to it well thei all went awai as abov and though the attempt wa desper and such as none but madmen would have gone about yet to give them their due thei went about it warili as well as boldli thei were gallantli arm that is true for thei had everi man a fusil or musket a bayonet and everi man a pistol some of them had broad cutlass some of them hanger and the boatswain and two more had poleax besid all which thei had among them thirteen handgrenado bolder fellow and better provid never went about ani wick work in the world when thei went out their chief design wa plunder and thei were in mighti hope of find gold there but a circumst which none of them were awar of set them on fire with reveng and made devil of them all when thei came to the few indian hous which thei thought had been the town which were not abov half a mile off thei were under a great disappoint for there were not abov twelv or thirteen hous and where the town wa or how big thei knew not thei consult therefor what to do and were some time befor thei could resolv for if thei fell upon these thei must cut all their throat and it wa ten to on but some of them might escap it be in the night though the moon wa up and if on escap he would run awai and rais all the town so thei should have a whole armi upon them again on the other hand if thei went awai and left those untouch for the peopl were all asleep thei could not tell which wai to look for the town howev the last wa the best advic so thei resolv to leav those hous and look for the town as well as thei could thei went on a littl wai and found a cow ti to a tree thi thei present conclud would be a good guid to them for thei said the cow certainli belong to the town befor them or the town behind them and if thei unti her thei should see which wai she went if she went back thei had noth to sai to her but if she went forward thei had noth to do but to follow her so thei cut the cord which wa made of twist flag and the cow went on befor them in a word the cow led them directli to the town which as thei report consist of abov two hundr hous or hut and in some of these thei found sever famili live togeth here thei found all silent as profoundli secur as sleep and a countri that had never seen an enemi of that kind could make them upon thi thei call anoth council to consid what thei had to do and in a word thei resolv to divid themselv into three bodi and to set three hous on fire in three part of the town and as the men came out to seiz them and bind them if ani resist thei need not be ask what to do then and so to search the rest of the hous for plunder but resolv to march silent first through the town and see what dimens it wa of and consid if thei might ventur upon it or no thei did so and desper resolv that thei would ventur upon them but while thei were anim on anoth to the work three of them that were a littl befor the rest call out aloud and told them thei had found thoma jeffri thei all ran up to the place and so it wa inde for there thei found the poor fellow hang up nake by on arm and hi throat cut there wa an indian hous just by the tree where thei found sixteen or seventeen of the princip indian who had been concern in the frai with us befor and two or three of them wound with our shot and our men found thei were awak and talk on to anoth in that hous but knew not their number the sight of their poor mangl comrad so enrag them as befor that thei swore to on anoth thei would be reveng and that not an indian who came into their hand should have quarter and to work thei went immedi and yet not so madli as by the rage and furi thei were in might be expect their first care wa to get someth that would soon take fire but after a littl search thei found that would be to no purpos for most of the hous were low and thatch with flag or rush of which the countri is full so thei present made some wildfir as we call it by wet a littl powder in the palm of their hand and in a quarter of an hour thei set the town on fire in four or five place and particularli that hous where the indian were not gone to bed as soon as the fire began to blaze the poor fright creatur began to rush out to save their live but met with their fate in the attempt and especi at the door where thei drove them back the boatswain himself kill on or two with hi poleax the hous be larg and mani in it he did not care to go in but call for an handgrenado and threw it among them which at first fright them but when it burst made such havoc among them that thei cri out in a hideou manner in short most of the indian who were in the open part of the hous were kill or hurt with the grenado except two or three more who press to the door which the boatswain and two more kept with the bayonet in the muzzl of their piec and dispatch all who came that wai but there wa anoth apart in the hous where the princ or king or whatsoev he wa and sever other were and thei kept in till the hous which wa by thi time all of a light flame fell in upon them and thei were smother or burnt togeth all thi while thei fire not a gun becaus thei would not waken the peopl faster than thei could master them but the fire began to waken them fast enough and our fellow were glad to keep a littl togeth in bodi for the fire grew so rage all the hous be made of light combust stuff that thei could hardli bear the street between them and their busi wa to follow the fire for the surer execut as fast as the fire either forc the peopl out of those hous which were burn or fright them out of other our peopl were readi at their door to knock them on the head still call and halloo to on anoth to rememb thoma jeffri while thi wa do i must confess i wa veri uneasi and especi when i saw the flame of the town which it be night seem to be just by me my nephew the captain who wa rous by hi men too see such a fire wa veri uneasi not know what the matter wa or what danger i wa in especi hear the gun too for by thi time thei began to us their firearm a thousand thought oppress hi mind concern me and the supercargo what should becom of us and at last though he could ill spare ani more men yet not know what exig we might be in he take anoth boat and with thirteen men and himself come on shore to me he wa surpris to see me and the supercargo in the boat with no more than two men for on had been left to keep the boat and though he wa glad that we were well yet he wa in the same impati with us to know what wa do for the nois continu and the flame increas i confess it wa next to an imposs for ani men in the world to restrain their curios of know what had happen or their concern for the safeti of the men in a word the captain told me he would go and help hi men let what would come i argu with him as i did befor with the men the safeti of the ship and the danger of the voyag the interest of the owner and merchant c and told him i would go and the two men and onli see if we could at a distanc learn what wa like to be the event and come back and tell him it wa all on to talk to my nephew as it wa to talk to the rest befor he would go he said and he onli wish he had left but ten men in the ship for he could not think of have hi men lost for want of help he had rather he said lose the ship the voyag and hi life and all and so awai went he nor wa i ani more abl to stai behind now than i wa to persuad them not to go befor so in short the captain order two men to row back the pinnac and fetch twelv men more from the ship leav the longboat at an anchor and that when thei came back six men should keep the two boat and six more come after us so that he left onli sixteen men in the ship for the whole ship compani consist of sixtyf men whereof two were lost in the first quarrel which brought thi mischief on be now on the march you mai be sure we felt littl of the ground we trod on and be guid by the fire we kept no path but went directli to the place of the flame if the nois of the gun were surpris to us befor the cri of the poor peopl were now quit of anoth natur and fill us with horror i must confess i never wa at the sack of a citi or at the take of a town by storm i have heard of oliv cromwel take drogheda in ireland and kill man woman and child and i had read of count tilli sack the citi of magdebourg and cut the throat of of both sex but i never had an idea of the thing itself befor nor is it possibl to describ it or the horror which wa upon our mind at hear it howev we went on and at length came to the town though there wa no enter the street of it for the fire the first object we met with wa the ruin of a hut or hous or rather the ash of it for the hous wa consum and just befor it plain now to be seen by the light of the fire lai four men and three women kill and as we thought on or two more lai in the heap among the fire in short these were such instanc of a rage altogeth barbar and of a furi someth beyond what wa human that we thought it imposs our men could be guilti of it or if thei were the author of it we thought that everi on of them ought to be put to the worst of death but thi wa not all we saw the fire increas forward and the cry went on just as the fire went on so that we were in the utmost confus we advanc a littl wai farther and beheld to our astonish three women nake cry in a most dread manner and fly as if thei had inde had wing and after them sixteen or seventeen men nativ in the same terror and constern with three of our english butcher for i can call them no better in the rear who when thei could not overtak them fire in among them and on that wa kill by their shot fell down in our sight when the rest saw us believ us to be their enemi and that we would murder them as well as those that pursu them thei set up a most dread shriek especi the women and two of them fell down as if alreadi dead with the fright my veri soul shrunk within me and my blood ran chill in my vein when i saw thi and i believ had the three english sailor that pursu them come on i had made our men kill them all howev we took some wai to let the poor fly creatur know that we would not hurt them and immedi thei came up to us and kneel down with their hand lift up made piteou lament to us to save them which we let them know we would do where upon thei kept all togeth in a huddl close behind us for protect i left my men drawn up togeth and charg them to hurt nobodi but if possibl to get at some of our peopl and see what devil it wa possess them and what thei intend to do and in a word to command them off assur them that if thei staid till daylight thei would have a hundr thousand men about their ear i sai i left them and went among those fly peopl take onli two of our men with me and there wa inde a piteou spectacl among them some of them had their feet terribl burnt with trampl and run through the fire other their hand burnt on of the women had fallen down in the fire and wa almost burnt to death befor she could get out again two or three of the men had cut in their back and thigh from our men pursu and anoth wa shot through the bodi and di while i wa there i would fain have learnt what the occas of all thi wa but i could not understand on word thei said though by sign i perceiv that some of them knew not what wa the occas themselv i wa so terrifi in my thought at thi outrag attempt that i could not stai there but went back to my own men i told them my resolut and command them to follow me when in the veri moment came four of our men with the boatswain at their head run over the heap of bodi thei had kill all cover with blood and dust as if thei want more peopl to massacr when our men halloo to them as loud as thei could halloo and with much ado on of them made them hear so that thei knew who we were and came up to us as soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a halloo like a shout of triumph for have as he thought more help come and without bear to hear me captain sai he nobl captain i am glad you ar come we have not half done yet villain hellhound dog i will kill as mani of them as poor tom ha hair upon hi head we have sworn to spare none of them we will root out the veri name of them from the earth and thu he ran on out of breath too with action and would not give us leav to speak a word at last rais my voic that i might silenc him a littl barbar dog said i what ar you do i wont have on creatur touch more upon pain of death i charg you upon your life to stop your hand and stand still here or you ar a dead man thi minut why sir sai he do you know what you do or what thei have done if you want a reason for what we have done come hither and with that he shew me the poor fellow hang upon a tree with hi throat cut i confess i wa urg then myself and at anoth time should have been forward enough but i thought thei had carri their rage too far and thought of jacob word to hi son simeon and levi curs be their anger for it wa fierc and their wrath for it wa cruel but i had now a new task upon my hand for when the men i carri with me saw the sight as i had done i had as much to do to restrain them as i should have had with the other nai my nephew himself fell in with them and told me in their hear that he wa onli concern for fear of the men be overpow for as to the peopl he thought not on of them ought to live for thei had all glut themselv with the murder of the poor man and that thei ought to be us like murder upon these word awai ran eight of my men with the boatswain and hi crew to complet their bloodi work and i see it quit out of my power to restrain them came awai pensiv and sad for i could not bear the sight much less the horribl nois and cri of the poor wretch that fell into their hand i got nobodi to come back with me but the supercargo and two men and with these i walk back to the boat it wa a veri great piec of folli in me i confess to ventur back as it were alon for as it began now to be almost dai and the alarm had run over the countri there stood about forti men arm with lanc and bow at the littl place where the twelv or thirteen hous stood mention befor but by accid i miss the place and came directli to the seasid and by that time i got to the seasid it wa broad dai immedi i took the pinnac and went aboard and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen i observ that about the time i came to the boatsid the fire wa pretti well out and the nois abat but in about half an hour after i got on board i heard a vollei of our men firearm and saw a great smoke thi as i understood afterward wa our men fall upon the forti men who as i said stood at the few hous on the wai of whom thei kill sixteen or seventeen and set all those hous on fire but did not meddl with the women or children by the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnac our men began to appear thei came drop in some and some not in two bodi and in form as thei went out but all in heap straggl here and there in such a manner that a small forc of resolut men might have cut them all off but the dread of them wa upon the whole countri the peopl were amaz and surpris and so fright that i believ a hundr of them would have fled at the sight of but five of our men nor in all thi terribl action wa there a man who made ani consider defenc thei were so surpris between the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of our men in the dark that thei knew not which wai to turn themselv for if thei fled on wai thei were met by on parti if back again by anoth so that thei were everi where knock down nor did ani of our men receiv the least hurt except on who strain hi foot and anoth had on of hi hand veri much burnt i wa veri angri with my nephew the captain and inde with all the men in my mind but with him in particular as well for hi act so out of hi duti as command of the ship and have the charg of the voyag upon him as in hi prompt rather than cool the rage of hi men in so bloodi and cruel an enterpris my nephew answer me veri respectfulli but told me that when he saw the bodi of the poor seaman whom thei had murder in such a cruel and barbar manner he wa not master of himself neither could he govern hi passion he own he should not have done so as he wa command of the ship but as he wa a man and natur move him he could not bear it as for the rest of the men thei were not subject to me at all and thei knew it well enough so thei took no notic of my dislik the next dai we set sail so we never heard ani more of it our men differ in the account of the number thei kill some said on thing some anoth but accord to the best of their account put all togeth thei kill or destroi about a hundr and fifti peopl men women and children and left not a hous stand in the town as for the poor fellow thoma jeffri as he wa quit dead for hi throat wa so cut that hi head wa half off it would do him no servic to bring him awai so thei left him where thei found him onli took him down from the tree where he wa hang by on hand howev just our men thought thi action to be i wa against them in it and i alwai after that time told them god would blast the voyag for i look upon the blood thei shed that night to be murder in them for though it is true that thei kill thoma jeffri yet it wa as true that jeffri wa the aggressor had broken the truce and had violat or debauch a young woman of their who came to our camp innoc and on the faith of their capitul the boatswain defend thi quarrel when we were afterward on board he said it wa true that we seem to break the truce but realli had not and that the war wa begun the night befor by the nativ themselv who had shot at us and kill on of our men without ani just provoc so that as we were in a capac to fight them we might also be in a capac to do ourselv justic upon them in an extraordinari manner that though the poor man had taken liberti with a wench he ought not to have been murder and that in such a villan manner and that thei did noth but what wa just and that the law of god allow to be done to murder on would think thi should have been enough to have warn us against go on shore among heathen and barbarian but it is imposs to make mankind wise but at their own experi and their experi seem to be alwai of most us to them when it is dearest bought we were now bound to the gulf of persia and from thenc to the coast of coromandel onli to touch at surat but the chief of the supercargo design lai at the bai of bengal where if he miss of the busi outwardbound he wa to go up to china and return to the coast as he came home the first disast that befel us wa in the gulf of persia where five of our men ventur on shore on the arabian side of the gulf were surround by the arab and either all kill or carri awai into slaveri the rest of the boat crew were not abl to rescu them and had but just time to get off their boat i began to upbraid them with the just retribut of heaven in thi case but the boatswain veri warmli told me he thought i went farther in my censur than i could show ani warrant for in scriptur and refer to the thirteenth of st luke ver where our saviour intim that those men on whom the tower of siloam fell were not sinner abov all the galilean but that which inde put me to silenc in thi case wa that none of these five men who were now lost were of the number of those who went on shore to the massacr of madagascar so i alwai call it though our men could not bear the word massacr with ani patienc and inde thi last circumst as i have said put me to silenc for the present but my frequent preach to them on thi subject had wors consequ than i expect and the boatswain who had been the head of the attempt came up boldli to me on time and told me he found that i continu brought that affair upon the stage that i made unjust reflect upon it and had us the men veri ill on that account and himself in particular that as i wa but a passeng and had no command in the ship or concern in the voyag thei were not oblig to bear it that thei did not know but i might have some ill design in my head and perhap call them to an account for it when thei came to england and that therefor unless i would resolv to have done with it and also not to concern myself farther with him or ani of hi affair he would leav the ship for he did not think it wa safe to sail with me among them i heard him patient enough till he had done and then told him that i did confess i had all along oppos the massacr of madagascar for such i would alwai call it and that i had on all occas spoken my mind freeli about it though not more upon him than ani of the rest that as to my have no command in the ship that wa true nor did i exercis ani author onli took the liberti of speak my mind in thing which publicli concern us all as to what concern i had in the voyag that wa none of hi busi i wa a consider owner of the ship and in that claim i conceiv i had a right to speak even farther than i had yet done and would not be account to him or ani on els and began to be a littl warm with him he made but littl repli to me at that time and i thought that affair had been over we were at thi time in the road to bengal and be will to see the place i went on shore with the supercargo in the ship boat to divert myself and toward even wa prepar to go on board when on of the men came to me and told me he would not have me troubl myself to come down to the boat for thei had order not to carri me on board ani on mai guess what a surpris i wa in at so insol a messag and i ask the man who bade him deliv that errand to me he told me the coxswain i said no more to the fellow but bid him let them know he had deliv hi messag and that i had given him no answer to it i immedi went and round out the supercargo and told him the stori ad what i present foresaw viz that there would certainli be a mutini in the ship and entreat him to go immedi on board the ship in an indian boat and acquaint the captain of it but i might have spare thi intellig for befor i had spoken to him on shore the matter wa effect on board the boatswain the gunner the carpent and in a word all the inferior offic as soon as i wa gone off in the boat came up to the quarterdeck and desir to speak with the captain and there the boatswain make a long harangu for the fellow talk veri well and repeat all he had said to me told the captain in a few word that as i wa now gone peaceabl on shore thei were loath to us ani violenc with me which if i had not gone on shore thei would otherwis have done to oblig me to have gone thei therefor thought fit to tell him that as thei ship themselv to serv in the ship under hi command thei would perform it faithfulli but if i would not quit the ship or the captain oblig me to quit it thei would all leav the ship and sail no farther with him and at that word all he turn hi face about toward the mainmast which wa it seem the signal agre on between them at which all the seamen be got togeth thei cri out on and all on and all my nephew the captain wa a man of spirit and of great presenc of mind and though he wa surpris you mai be sure at the thing yet he told them calmli he would consid of the matter but that he could do noth in it till he had spoken to me about it he us some argument with them to shew them the unreason and injustic of the thing but it wa all in vain thei swore and shook hand round befor hi face that thei would go all on shore unless he would engag to them not to suffer me to come on board the ship thi wa a hard articl upon him who knew hi oblig to me and did not know how i might take it so he began to talk cavalierli to them told them that i wa a veri consider owner of the ship and that in justic he could not put me out of my own hous that thi wa next door to serv me as the famou pirat kid had done who made the mutini in the ship set the captain on shore in an uninhabit island and ran awai with the ship that let them go into what ship thei would if ever thei came to england again it would cost them dear that the ship wa mine and that he would not put me out of it and that he would rather lose the ship and the voyag too than disoblig me so much so thei might do as thei pleas howev he would go on shore and talk with me there and invit the boatswain to go with him and perhap thei might accommod the matter with me but thei all reject the propos and said thei would have noth to do with me ani more neither on board nor on shore and if i came on board thei would go on shore well said the captain if you ar all of thi mind let me go on shore and talk with him so awai he came to me with thi account a littl after the messag had been brought to me from the coxswain i wa veri glad to see my nephew i must confess for i wa not without apprehens that thei would confin him by violenc set sail and run awai with the ship and then i had been strip nake in a remot countri and noth to help myself in short i had been in a wors case than when i wa all alon in the island but thei had not come to that length it seem to my great satisfact and when my nephew told me what thei had said to him and how thei had sworn and shook hand that thei would on and all leav the ship if i wa suffer to come on board i told him he should not be concern at it at all for i would stai onshor i onli desir he would take care and send me all my necessari thing on shore and leav me a suffici sum of monei and i would find my wai to england as well as i could thi wa a heavi piec of new to my nephew but there wa no wai to help it but to compli with it so in short he went on board the ship again and satisfi the men that hi uncl had yield to their importun and had sent for hi good from on board the ship so the matter wa over in a veri few hour the men return to their duti and i begun to consid what cours i should steer i wa now alon in the remotest part of the world as i think i mai call it for i wa near three thousand leagu by sea farther off from england than i wa at my island onli it is true i might travel here by land over the great mogul countri to surat might go from thenc to bassora by sea up the gulf of persia and from thenc might take the wai of the caravan over the desert of arabia to aleppo and scanderoon and from thenc by sea again to itali and so overland into franc and thi put togeth might be at least a full diamet of the globe but if it were to be measur i suppos it would appear to be a great deal more i had anoth wai befor me which wa to wait for some english ship which were come to bengal from achin on the island of sumatra and get passag on board them for england but as i came hither without ani concern with the english east india compani so it would be difficult to go from henc without their licenc unless with great favour of the captain of the ship or of the compani factor and to both i wa an utter stranger here i had the particular pleasur speak by contrarieti to see the ship set sail without me a treatment i think a man in my circumst scarc ever met with except from pirat run awai with a ship and set those that would not agre with their villani on shore inde thi wa the next door to it both wai howev my nephew left me two servant or rather on companion and on servant the first wa clerk to the purser whom he engag to go with me and the other wa hi own servant i took me also a good lodg in the hous of an english woman where sever merchant lodg some french two italian or rather jew and on englishman here i wa handsom enough entertain and that i might not be said to run rashli upon ani thing i stai here abov nine month consid what cours to take and how to manag myself i had some english good with me of valu and a consider sum of monei my nephew furnish me with a thousand piec of eight and a letter of credit for more if i had occas that i might not be straiten whatev might happen i quickli dispos of my good and to advantag too and as i origin intend i bought here some veri good diamond which of all other thing wa the most proper for me in my circumst becaus i might alwai carri my whole estat about me after a long stai here and mani propos made for my return to england but none fall to my mind the english merchant who lodg with me and with whom i had contract an intim acquaint came to me on morn countryman sai he i have a project to commun to you which as it suit with my thought mai for aught i know suit with your also when you shall have thoroughli consid it here we ar post sai he you by accid and i by my own choic in a part of the world veri remot from our own countri but it is in a countri where by us who understand trade and busi a great deal of monei is to be got if you will put a thousand pound to my thousand pound we will hire a ship here the first we can get to our mind you shall be captain ill be merchant and we will go a trade voyag to china for what should we stand still for the whole world is in motion roll round and round all the creatur of god heavenli bodi and earthli ar busi and vibrant why should we be idl there ar no drone sai he live in the world but men why should we be of that number i like thi propos veri well and the more becaus it seem to be express with so much good will and in so friendli a manner i will not sai but that i might by my loos and unhing circumst be the fitter to embrac a propos for trade and inde for ani thing els or otherwis trade wa none of my element howev i might perhap sai with some truth that if trade wa not my element rambl wa and no propos for see ani part of the world which i had never seen befor could possibl come amiss to me it wa howev some time befor we could get a ship to our mind and when we got a vessel it wa not easi to get english sailor that is to sai so mani as were necessari to govern the voyag and manag the sailor which we should pick up there after some time we got a mate a boatswain and a gunner english a dutch carpent and three portugues foremastmen with these we found we could do well enough have indian seamen such as thei ar to make up there ar so mani travel who have written the histori of their voyag and travel thi wai that it would be but veri littl divers to ani bodi to give a long account of the place we went to and the peopl who inhabit there those thing i leav to other and refer the reader to those journal and travel of englishmen mani of which i find ar publish and more promis everi dai it is enough for me to tell you that we made the voyag to achin in the island of sumatra first and from thenc to siam where we exchang some of our ware for opium and for some arrack the first a commod which bear a great price among the chines and which at that time wa veri much want there in a word we went up to susham made a veri great voyag were eight month out and return to bengal and i wa veri well satisfi with my adventur i observ that our peopl in england often admir how the offic which the compani send into india and the merchant which gener stai there get such veri good estat as thei do and sometim come home worth sixti seventi and a hundr thousand pound at a time but it is no wonder or at least we shall see so much farther into it when we consid the innumer port and place where thei have a free commerc that it will then be no wonder and much less will it be so when we consid that at all those place and port where the english ship come there is so much and such constant demand for the growth of all other countri that there is a certain vent for the return as well as a market abroad for the good carri out in short we made a veri good voyag and i got so much monei by the first adventur and such an insight into the method of get more that had i been twenti year younger i should have been tempt to have stai here and sought no farther for make my fortun but what wa all thi to a man on the wrong side of threescor that wa rich enough and came abroad more in obedi to a restless desir of see the world than a covet desir of get in it and inde i think it is with great justic that i now call it a restless desir for it wa so when i wa at home i wa restless to go abroad and now i wa abroad i wa restless to be at home i sai what wa thi gain to me i wa rich enough alreadi nor had i ani uneasi desir about get more monei and therefor the profit of the voyag to me were thing of no great forc to me for the prompt me forward to farther undertak henc i thought that by thi voyag i had made no progress at all becaus i wa come back as i might call it to the place from whenc i came as to a home wherea my ey which like that which solomon speak of wa never satisfi with see wa still more desir of wander and see i wa come into a part of the world which i never wa in befor and that part in particular which i had heard much of and wa resolv to see as much of it as i could and then i thought i might sai i had seen all the world that wa worth see but my fellowtravel and i had differ notion i do not name thi to insist upon my own for i acknowledg hi wa most just and the most suit to the end of a merchant life who when he is abroad upon adventur it is hi wisdom to stick to that as the best thing for him which he is like to get the most monei by my new friend kept himself to the natur of the thing and would have been content to have gone like a carrier hors alwai to the same inn backward and forward provid he could as he call it find hi account in it on the other hand mine as old as i wa wa the notion of a mad rambl boi that never care to see a thing twice over but thi wa not all i had a kind of impati upon me to be nearer home and yet the most unsettl resolut imagin which wai to go in the interv of these consult my friend who wa alwai upon the search for busi propos anoth voyag to me viz among the spice island and to bring home a load of clove from the manilla or thereabout place where inde the dutch do trade but the island belong partli to the spaniard though we went not so far but to some other where thei have not the whole power as thei have at batavia ceylon c we were not long in prepar for thi voyag the chief difficulti wa in bring me to come into it howev at last noth els offer and find that realli stir about and trade the profit be so great and as i mai sai certain had more pleasur in it and more satisfact to the mind than sit still which to me especi wa the unhappiest part of life i resolv on thi voyag too which we made veri successfulli touch at borneo and sever island whose name i do not rememb and came home in about five month we sold our spice which wa chiefli clove and some nutmeg to the persian merchant who carri them awai for the gulf and make near five of on we realli got a great deal of monei my friend when we made up thi account smile at me well now said he with a sort of an agreeabl insult upon my indol temper is not thi better than walk about here like a man of noth to do and spend our time in stare at the nonsens and ignorac of the paganswhi truli said i my friend i think it is and i begin to be a convert to the principl of merchandis but i must tell you said i by the wai you do not know what i am do for if onc i conquer my backward and embark heartili as old as i am i shall harass you up and down the world till i tire you for i shall pursu it so eagerli i shall never let you lie still but to be short with my specul a littl while after thi there came in a dutch ship from batavia she wa a coaster not an european trader and of about two hundr ton burden the men as thei pretend have been so sickli that the captain had not men enough to go to sea with he lai by at bengal and as if have got monei enough or be will for other reason to go for europ he gave public notic that he would sell hi ship thi came to my ear befor my new partner heard of it and i had a great mind to bui it so i went home to him and told him of it he consid awhil for he wa no rash man neither but muse some time he repli she is a littl too big but howev we will have her accordingli we bought the ship and agre with the master we paid for her and took possess when we had done so we resolv to entertain the men if we could to join them with those we had for the pursu our busi but on a sudden thei not have receiv their wage but their share of the monei as we afterward learnt not on of them wa to be found we inquir much about them and at length were told that thei were all gone togeth by land to agra the great citi of the mogul resid and from thenc were to travel to surat and so by sea to the gulf of persia noth had so heartili troubl me a good while as that i miss the opportun of go with them for such a rambl i thought and in such compani as would both have guard me and divert me would have suit mightili with my great design and i should both have seen the world and gone homeward too but i wa much better satisfi a few dai after when i came to know what sort of fellow thei were for in short their histori wa that thi man thei call captain wa the gunner onli not the command that thei had been a trade voyag in which thei were attack on shore by some of the malaccan who had kill the captain and three of hi men and that after the captain wa kill these men eleven in number had resolv to run awai with the ship which thei did and had brought her in at the bai of bengal leav the mate and five men more on shore of whom we shall hear farther well let them come by the ship how thei would we came honestli by her as we thought though we did not i confess examin into thing so exactli as we ought for we never inquir ani thing of the seamen who if we had examin would certainli have falter in their account contradict on anoth and perhap have contradict themselv or on how or other we should have seen reason to have suspect them but the man shew us a bill of sale for the ship to on emanuel clostershoven or some such name for i suppos it wa all a forgeri and call himself by that name and we could not contradict him and be withal a littl too unwari or at least have no suspicion of the thing we went through with our bargain howev we pick up some english seamen here after thi and some dutch and we now resolv for a second voyag to the southeast for clove c that is to sai among the philippin and malacca isl and in short not to fill thi part of my stori with trifl when what is yet to come is so remark i spent from first to last six year in thi countri trade from port to port backward and forward and with veri good success and wa now the last year with my partner go in the ship abovement on a voyag to china but design first to go to siam to bui rice in thi voyag be by contrari wind oblig to beat up and down a great while in the strait of malacca and among the island we were no sooner got clear of those difficult sea but we found our ship had sprung a leak and we were not abl by all our industri to find out where it wa thi forc us to make for some port and my partner who knew the countri better than i did direct the captain to put into the river of cambodia for i had made the english mate on mr thompson captain not be will to take the charg of the ship upon myself thi river li on the north side of the great bai or gulf which goe up to siam while we were here and go often on shore for refresh there come to me on dai an englishman and he wa it seem a gunner mate on board an english east india ship which rode in the same river up at or near the citi of cambodia what brought him hither we knew not but he come up to me and speak english sir sai he you ar a stranger to me and i to you but i have someth to tell you that veri nearli concern you i look stedfastli at him a good while and he thought at first i had known him but i did not if it veri nearli concern me said i and not yourself what move you to tell it mei am move sai he by the immin danger you ar in and for aught i see you have no knowledg of iti know no danger i am in said i but that my ship is leaki and i cannot find it out but i propos to lai her aground tomorrow to see if i can find itbut sir sai he leaki or not leaki find it or not find it you will be wiser than to lai your ship on shore tomorrow when you hear what i have to sai to you do you know sir said he the town of cambodia li about fifteen leagu up thi river and there ar two larg english ship about five leagu on thi side and three dutchwel said i and what is that to mewhi sir sai he is it for a man that is upon such adventur as you ar to come into a port and not examin first what ship there ar there and whether he is abl to deal with them i suppos you do not think you ar a match for them i wa amus veri much at hi discours but not amaz at it for i could not conceiv what he meant and i turn short upon him and said sir i wish you would explain yourself i cannot imagin what reason i have to be afraid of ani of the compani ship or dutch ship i am no interlop what can thei have to sai to me he look like a man half angri half pleas and paus awhil but smile well sir sai he if you think yourself secur you must take your chanc i am sorri your fate should blind you against good advic but assur yourself if you do not put to sea immedi you will the veri next tide be attack by five longboat full of men and perhap if you ar taken you will be hang for a pirat and the particular be examin into afterward i thought sir ad he i should have met with a better recept than thi for do you a piec of servic of such importancei can never be ungrat said i for ani servic or to ani man that offer me ani kind but it is past my comprehens said i what thei should have such a design upon me for howev sinc you sai there is no time to be lost and that there is some villan design in hand against me i will go on board thi minut and put to sea immedi if my men can stop the leak or if we can swim without stop it but sir said i shall i go awai ignor of the reason of all thi can you give me no farther light into it i can tell you but part of the stori sir sai he but i have a dutch seaman here with me and i believ i could persuad him to tell you the rest but there is scarc time for it but the short of the stori is thi the first part of which i suppos you know well enough viz that you were with thi ship at sumatra that there your captain wa murder by the malaccan with three of hi men and that you or some of those that were on board with you ran awai with the ship and ar sinc turn pirat thi is the sum of the stori and you will all be seiz as pirat i can assur you and execut with veri littl ceremoni for you know merchantship shew but littl law to pirat if thei get them in their power now you speak plain english said i and i thank you and though i know noth that we have done like what you talk of but i am sure we came honestli and fairli by the ship yet see such work is ado as you sai and that you seem to mean honestli i will be upon my guardnai sir sai he do not talk of be upon your guard the best defenc is to be out of the danger if you have ani regard to your life and the live of all your men put out to sea without fail at highwat and as you have a whole tide befor you you will be gone too far out befor thei can come down for thei will come awai at high water and as thei have twenti mile to come youll get near two hour of them by the differ of the tide not reckon the length of the wai besid as thei ar onli boat and not ship thei will not ventur to follow you far out to sea especi if it blow well said i you have been veri kind in thi what shall i do for you to make you amendssir sai he you mai not be so will to make me amend becaus you mai not be convinc of the truth of it i will make an offer to you i have nineteen month pai due to me on board the ship which i came out of england in and the dutchman that is with me ha seven month pai due to him if you will make good our pai to us we will go along with you if you find noth more in it we will desir no more but if we do convinc you that we have save your life and the ship and the live of all the men in her we will leav the rest to you i consent to thi readili and went immedi on board and the two men with me as soon as i came to the ship side my partner who wa on board came on the quarterdeck and call to me with a great deal of joi o ho o ho we have stop the leaksai you so said i thank god but weigh the anchor then immediatelyweigh sai he what do you mean by that what is the matter sai he ask no question said i but all hand to work and weigh without lose a minut he wa surpris but howev he call the captain and he immedi order the anchor to be got up and though the tide wa not quit done yet a littl land breez blow we stood out to sea then i call him into the cabin and told him the stori at larg and we call in the men and thei told us the rest of it but as it took us up a great deal of time so befor we had done a seaman come to the cabin door and call out to us that the captain made him tell us we were chase chase said i by whom and by whatbi five sloop or boat said the fellow full of menveri well said i then it is appar there is someth in it in the next place i order all our men to be call up and told them that there wa a design to seiz the ship and to take us for pirat and ask them if thei would stand by us and by on anoth the men answer cheerfulli on and all that thei would live and die with us then i ask the captain what wai he thought best for us to manag a fight with them for resist them i resolv we would and that to the last drop he said readili that the wai wa to keep them off with our great shot as long as we could and then to fire at them with our small arm to keep them from board us but when neither of these would do ani longer we should retir to our close quarter perhap thei had not materi to break open our bulkhead or get in upon us the gunner had in the mean time order to bring two gun to bear fore and aft out of the steerag to clear the deck and load them with musketbullet and small piec of old iron and what next came to hand and thu we made readi for fight but all thi while kept out to sea with wind enough and could see the boat at a distanc be five larg longboat follow us with all the sail thei could make two of these boat which by our glass we could see were english had outsail the rest were near two leagu a head of them and gain upon us consider so that we found thei would come up with us upon which we fire a gun without a shot to intim that thei should bring to and we put out a flag of truce as a signal for parlei but thei kept crowd after us till thei came within shot upon thi we took in our white flag thei have made no answer to it hung out the red flag and fire at them with shot notwithstand thi thei came on till thei were near enough to call to them with a speak trumpet which we had on board so we call to them and bade them keep off at their peril it wa all on thei crowd after us and endeavour to come under our stern so to board us on our quarter upon which see thei were resolut for mischief and depend upon the strength that follow them i order to bring the ship to so that thei lai upon our broadsid when immedi we fire five gun at them on of them had been level so true as to carri awai the stern of the hindermost boat and bring them to the necess of take down their sail and run all to the head of the boat to keep her from sink so she lai by and had enough of it but see the foremost boat still crowd on after us we made readi to fire at her in particular while thi wa do on of the three boat that wa behind be forward than the other two made up to the boat which we had disabl to reliev her and we could afterward see her take out the men we call again to the foremost boat and offer a truce to parlei again and to know what wa her busi with us but had no answer onli she crowd close under our stern upon thi our gunner who wa a veri dexter fellow run out hi two chasegun and fire at her but the shot miss the men in the boat shout wave their cap and came on but the gunner get quickli readi again fire among them a second time on shot of which though it miss the boat itself yet fell in among the men and we could easili see had done a great deal of mischief among them but we take no notic of that wear the ship again and brought our quarter to bear upon them and fire three gun more we found the boat wa split almost to piec in particular her rudder and a piec of her stern were shot quit awai so thei hand their sail immedi and were in great disord but to complet their misfortun our gunner let fly two gun at them again where he hit them we could not tell but we found the boat wa sink and some of the men alreadi in the water upon thi i immedi man out our pinnac which we had kept close by our side with order to pick up some of the men if thei could and save them from drown and immedi to come on board with them becaus we saw the rest of the boat began to come up our men in the pinnac follow their order and took up three men on of which wa just drown and it wa a good while befor we could recov him as soon as thei were on board we crowd all the sail we could make and stood farther out to sea and we found that when the other three boat came up to the first two thei gave over their chase be thu deliv from a danger which though i knew not the reason of it yet seem to be much greater than i apprehend i took care that we should chang our cours and not let ani on imagin whither we were go so we stood out to sea eastward quit out of the cours of all european ship whether thei were bound to china or ani where els within the commerc of the european nation when we were now at sea we began to consult with the two seamen and inquir first what the mean of all thi should be the dutchman let us into the secret of it at onc tell us that the fellow that sold us the ship as we said wa no more than a thief that had run awai with her then he told us how the captain whose name too he mention though i do not rememb it now wa treacher murder by the nativ on the coast of malacca with three of hi men and that he thi dutchman and four more got into the wood where thei wander about a great while till at length he in particular in a miracul manner made hi escap and swam off to a dutch ship which sail near the shore in it wai from china had sent their boat on shore for fresh water that he durst not come to that part of the shore where the boat wa but made shift in the night to take in the water farther off and swim a great while at last the ship boat took him up he then told us that he went to batavia where two of the seamen belong to the ship had arriv have desert the rest in their travel and gave an account that the fellow who had run awai with the ship sold her at bengal to a set of pirat which were gone acruis in her and that thei had alreadi taken an english ship and two dutch ship veri richli laden thi latter part we found to concern us directli and though we knew it to be fals yet as my partner said veri well if we had fallen into their hand and thei had such a prepossess against us beforehand it had been in vain for us to have defend ourselv or to hope for ani good quarter at their hand especi consid that our accus had been our judg and that we could have expect noth from them but what rage would have dictat and ungovern passion have execut and therefor it wa hi opinion we should go directli back to bengal from whenc we came without put in at ani port whatev becaus there we could give an account of ourselv and could prove where we were when the ship put in whom we bought her of and the like and which wa more than all the rest if we were put to the necess of bring it befor the proper judg we should be sure to have some justic and not be hang first and judg afterward i wa some time of my partner opinion but after a littl more seriou think i told him i thought it wa a veri great hazard for us to attempt return to bengal for that we were on the wrong side of the strait of malacca and that if the alarm wa given we should be sure to be waylaid on everi side as well by the dutch of batavia as the english elsewher that if we should be taken as it were run awai we should even condemn ourselv and there would want no more evid to destroi us i also ask the english sailor opinion who said he wa of my mind and that we should certainli be taken thi danger a littl startl my partner and all the ship compani and we immedi resolv to go awai to the coast of tonquin and so on to china and from thenc pursu the first design as to trade find some wai or other to dispos of the ship and come back in some of the vessel of the countri such as we could get thi wa approv of as the best method for our secur and accordingli we steer awai nne keep abov fifti leagu off from the usual cours to the eastward thi howev put us to some inconveni for first the wind when we came to that distanc from the shore seem to be more steadili against us blow almost trade as we call it from the e and en so that we were a long while upon our voyag and we were but ill provid with victual for so long a run and which wa still wors there wa some danger that those english and dutch ship whose boat pursu us whereof some were bound that wai might be got in befor us and if not some other ship bound to china might have inform of us from them and pursu us with the same vigour i must confess i wa now veri uneasi and thought myself includ the last escap from the long boat to have been in the most danger condit that ever i wa in through all my past life for whatev ill circumst i had been in i wa never pursu for a thief befor nor had i ever done ani thing that merit the name of dishonest or fraudul much less thievish i had chiefli been mine own enemi or as i mai rightli sai i had been nobodi enemi but my own but now i wa embarrass in the worst condit imagin for though i wa perfectli innoc i wa in no condit to make that innoc appear and if i had been taken it had been under a suppos guilt of the worst kind at least a crime esteem so among the peopl i had to do with thi made me veri anxiou to make an escap though which wai to do it i knew not or what port or place we should go to my partner see me thu deject though he wa the most concern at first began to encourag me and describ to me the sever port of the coast told me he would put in on the coast of cochinchina or the bai of tonquin intend to go afterward to macao a town onc in the possess or the portugues and where still a great mani european famili resid and particularli the missionari priest usual went thither in order to their go forward to china hither we then resolv to go and accordingli though after a tediou and irregular cours and veri much straiten for provis we came within sight of the coast veri earli in the morn and upon reflect upon the past circumst we were in and the danger if we had not escap we resolv to put into a small river which howev had depth enough of water for us and to see if we could either overland or by the ship pinnac come to know what ship were in ani port thereabout thi happi step wa inde our deliver for though we did not immedi see ani european ship in the bai of tonquin yet the next morn there came into the bai two dutch ship and a third without ani colour spread out but which we believ to be a dutchman pass by at about two leagu distanc steer for the coast of china and in the afternoon went by two english ship steer the same cours and thu we thought we saw ourselv beset with enemi both on wai and the other the place we were in wa wild and barbar the peopl thiev even by occup or profess and though it is true we had not much to seek of them and except get a few provis care not how littl we had to do with them yet it wa with much difficulti that we kept ourselv from be insult by them sever wai we were in a small river of thi countri within a few leagu of it utmost limit northward and by our boat we coast northeast to the point of land which open to the great bai of tonquin and it wa in thi beat up along the shore that we discov as abov that in a word we were surround with enemi the peopl we were among were the most barbar of all the inhabit of the coast have no correspond with ani other nation and deal onli in fish and oil and such gross commod and it mai be particularli seen that thei ar as i said the most barbar of ani of the inhabit viz that among other custom thei have thi on that if ani vessel had the misfortun to be shipwreck upon their coast thei present make the men all prison that is to sai slave and it wa not long befor we found a spice of their kind thi wai on the occas follow i have observ abov that our ship sprung a leak at sea and that we could not find it out and howev it happen that as i have said it wa stop unexpectedli in the happi minut of our be to be seiz by the dutch and english ship near the bai of siam yet as we did not find the ship so perfectli tight and sound as we desir we resolv while we were in thi place to lai her on shore take out what heavi thing we had on board which were not mani and to wash and clean her bottom and if possibl to find out where the leak were accordingli have lighten the ship and brought all our gun and other moveabl thing to on side we tri to bring her down that we might come at her bottom for on second thought we did not care to lai her dry aground neither could we find out a proper place for it the inhabit who had never been acquaint with such a sight came wonder down to the shore to look at us and see the ship lie down on on side in such a manner and heel toward the shore and not see our men who were at work on her bottom with stage and with their boat on the off side thei present conclud that the ship wa cast awai and lai so veri fast on the ground on thi supposit thei came all about us in two or three hour time with ten or twelv larg boat have some of them eight some ten men in a boat intend no doubt to have come on board and plunder the ship and if thei had found us there to have carri us awai for slave to their king or whatev thei call him for we knew not who wa their governor when thei came up to the ship and began to row round her thei discov us all hard at work on the outsid of the ship bottom and side wash and grave and stop as everi seafar man know how thei stood for awhil gaze at us and we who were a littl surpris could not imagin what their design wa but be will to be sure we took thi opportun to get some of us into the ship and other to hand down arm and ammunit to those that were at work to defend themselv with if there should be occas and it wa no more than need for in less than a quarter of an hour consult thei agre it seem that the ship wa realli a wreck that we were all at work endeavour to save her or to save our live by the help of our boat and when we hand our arm into the boat thei conclud by that motion that we were endeavour to save some of our good upon thi thei took it for grant thei all belong to them and awai thei came directli upon our men as if it had been in a line of battl our men see so mani of them began to be fright for we lai but in an ill postur to fight and cri out to us to know what thei should do i immedi call to the men who work upon the stage to slip them down and get up the side into the ship and bade those in the boat to row round and come on board and those few of us who were on board work with all the strength and hand we had to bring the ship to right but howev neither the men upon the stage nor those in the boat could do as thei were order befor the cochinchines were upon them and with two of their boat board our longboat and began to lai hold of the men as their prison the first man thei laid hold of wa an english seaman a stout strong fellow who have a musket in hi hand never offer to fire it but laid it down in the boat like a fool as i thought but he understood hi busi better than i could teach him for he grappl the pagan and drag him by main forc out of their own boat into our where take him by the two ear he beat hi head so against the boat gunnel that the fellow di instantli in hi hand and in the mean time a dutchman who stood next took up the musket and with the butend of it so laid about him that he knock down five of them who attempt to enter the boat but thi wa littl toward resist thirti or forti men who fearless becaus ignor of their danger began to throw themselv into the longboat where we had but five men to defend it but on accid gave our men a complet victori which deserv our laughter rather than ani thing els and that wa thi our carpent be prepar to grave the outsid of the ship as well as to pai the seam where he had caulk her to stop the leak had got two kettl just let down into the boat on fill with boil pitch and the other with rosin tallow and oil and such stuff as the shipwright us for that work and the man that tend the carpent had a great iron ladl in hi hand with which he suppli the men that were at work with that hot stuff two of the enemi men enter the boat just where thi fellow stood be in the foresheet he immedi saint them with a ladl of the stuff boil hot which so burnt and scald them be half nake that thei roar out like two bull and enrag with the fire leap both into the sea the carpent saw it and cri out well done jack give them some more of it when step forward himself he take on of their mop and dip it in the pitchpot he and hi man threw it among them so plentifulli that in short of all the men in three boat there wa not on that wa not scald and burnt with it in a most fright piti manner and made such a howl and cry that i never heard a wors nois and inde noth like it for it wa worth observ that though pain natur make all peopl cry out yet everi nation have a particular wai of exclam and make nois as differ from on anoth as their speech i cannot give the nois these creatur made a better name than howl nor a name more proper to the tone of it for i never heard ani thing more like the nois of the wolv which as i have said i heard howl in the forest on the frontier of languedoc i wa never pleas with a victori better in my life not onli as it wa a perfect surpris to me and that our danger wa immin befor but as we got thi victori without ani bloodsh except of that man the fellow kill with hi nake hand and which i wa veri much concern at for i wa sick of kill such poor savag wretch even though it wa in my own defenc know thei came on errand which thei thought just and knew no better and that though it mai be a just thing becaus necessari for there is no necessari wicked in natur yet i thought it wa a sad life when we must be alwai oblig to be kill our fellowcreatur to preserv ourselv and inde i think so still and i would even now suffer a great deal rather than i would take awai the life even of the worst person injur me i believ also all consid peopl who know the valu of life would be of my opinion if thei enter serious into the consider of it but to return to my stori all the while thi wa do my partner and i who manag the rest of the men on board had with great dexter brought the ship almost to right and have gotten the gun into their place again the gunner call to me to bid our boat get out of the wai for he would let fly among them i call back again to him and bid him not offer to fire for the carpent would do the work without him but bade him heat anoth pitchkettl which our cook who wa on board took care of but the enemi wa so terrifi with what thei met with in their first attack that thei would not come on again and some of them that were farthest off see the ship swim as it were upright began as we suppos to see their mistak and gave over the enterpris find it wa not as thei expect thu we got clear of thi merri fight and have gotten some rice and some root and bread with about sixteen good big hog on board two dai befor we resolv to stai here no longer but go forward whatev came of it for we made no doubt but we should be surround the next dai with rogu enough perhap more than our pitchkettl would dispos of for us we therefor got all our thing on board the same even and the next morn were readi to sail in the meantim ly at an anchor some distanc from the shore we were not so much concern be now in a light postur as well as in a sail postur if ani enemi had present the next dai have finish our work within board and find our ship wa perfectli heal of all her leak we set sail we would have gone into the bai of tonquin for we want to inform ourselv of what wa to be known concern the dutch ship that had been there but we durst not stand in there becaus we had seen sever ship go in as we suppos but a littl befor so we kept on ne toward the isl of formosa as much afraid of be seen by a dutch or english merchantship as a dutch or english merchantship in the mediterranean is of an algerin man of war when we were thu got to sea we kept on ne as if we would go to the manilla or the philippin island and thi we did that we might not fall into the wai of ani of the european ship and then we steer north again till we came to the latitud of degre minut by which mean we made the island of formosa directli where we came to an anchor in order to get water and fresh provis which the peopl there who ar veri courteou and civil in their manner suppli us with willingli and dealt veri fairli and punctual with us in all their agreement and bargain which is what we did not find among other peopl and mai be ow to the remain of christian which wa onc plant here by a dutch mission of protest and is a testimoni of what i have often observ viz that the christian religion alwai civil the peopl and reform their manner where it is receiv whether it work save effect upon them or not from henc we sail still north keep the coast of china at an equal distanc till we knew we were beyond all the port of china where our european ship usual come but be resolv if possibl not to fall into ani of their hand especi in thi countri where as our circumst were we could not fail of be entir ruin nai so great wa my fear in particular as to my be taken by them that i believ firmli i would much rather have chosen to fall into the hand of the spanish inquisit be now come to the latitud of degre we resolv to put into the first trade port we should come at and stand in for the shore a boat came off two leagu to us with an old portugues pilot on board who know us to be an european ship came to offer hi servic which inde we were veri glad of and took him on board upon which without ask us whither we would go he dismiss the boat he came in and sent it back i thought it wa now so much in our choic to make the old man carri us whither we would that i began to talk with him about carri us to the gulf of nanquin which is the most northern part of the coast of china the old man said he knew the gulf of nanquin veri well but smile ask us what we would do there i told him we would sell our cargo and purchas china ware calico raw silk tea wrought silk c and so would return by the same cours we came he told us our best port had been to have put in at macao where we could not fail of a market for our opium to our satisfact and might for our monei have purchas all sort of china good as cheap as we could at nanquin not be abl to put the old man out of hi talk of which he wa veri opinion or conceit i told him we were gentlemen as well as merchant and that we had a mind to go and see the great citi of pekin and the famou court of the monarch of china why then sai the old man you should go to ningpo where by the river that run into the sea there you mai go up within five leagu of the great canal thi canal is a navig made stream which goe through the heart of all that vast empir of china cross all the river pass some consider hill by the help of sluic and gate and goe up to the citi of pekin be in length near two hundr and seventi leagu well said i seignior portugues but that is not our busi now the great question is if you can carri us up to the citi of nanquin from whenc we can travel to pekin afterward ye he said he could do so veri well and there wa a great dutch ship gone up that wai just befor thi gave me a littl shock a dutch ship wa now our terror and we had much rather have met the devil at least if he had not come in too fright a figur we depend upon it that a dutch ship would be our destruct for we were in no condit to fight them all the ship thei trade with in those part be of great burden and of much greater forc than we were the old man found me a littl confus and under some concern when he name a dutch ship and said to me sir you need be under no apprehens of the dutch i suppos thei ar not now at war with your nationno said i that true but i know not what liberti men mai take when thei ar out of the reach of the law of their countrywhi said he you ar no pirat what need you fear thei will not meddl with peaceabl merchant sure if i had ani blood in my bodi that did not fly up into my face at that word it wa hinder by some stop in the vessel appoint by natur to circul it for it put me into the greatest disord and confus imagin nor wa it possibl for me to conceal it so but that the old man easili perceiv it sir said he i find you ar in some disord in your thought at my talk prai be pleas to go which wai you think fit and depend upon it ill do you all the servic i canwhi seignior said i it is true i am a littl unsettl in my resolut at thi time whither to go in particular and i am someth more so for what you said about pirat i hope there ar no pirat in these sea we ar but in an ill condit to meet with them for you see we have but a small forc and but veri weakli man o sir said he do not be concern i do not know that there have been ani pirat in these sea these fifteen year except on which wa seen as i hear in the bai of siam about a month sinc but you mai be assur she is gone to the southward nor wa she a ship of ani great forc or fit for the work she wa not built for a privat but wa run awai with by a reprob crew that were on board after the captain and some of hi men had been murder by the malaccan at or near the island of sumatra what said i seem to know noth of the matter did thei murder the captainno said he i do not understand that thei murder him but as thei afterward ran awai with the ship it is gener believ thei betrai him into the hand of the malaccan who did murder him and perhap thei procur them to do itwhi then said i thei deserv death as much as if thei had done it themselvesnai said the old man thei do deserv it and thei will certainli have it if thei light upon ani english or dutch ship for thei have all agre togeth that if thei meet that rogu thei will give him no quarter but said i to him you sai the pirat is gone out of these sea how can thei meet with him thenwhi that is true said he thei do sai so but he wa as i tell you in the bai of siam in the river cambodia and wa discov there by some dutchmen who belong to the ship and who were left on shore when thei ran awai with her and some english and dutch trader be in the river thei were within a littl of take him nai said he if the foremost boat had been well second by the rest thei had certainli taken him but he find onli two boat within reach of him tack about and fire at these two and disabl them befor the other came up and then stand off to sea the other were not abl to follow him and so he got awai but thei have all so exact a descript of the ship that thei will be sure to know him and whereev thei find him thei have vow to give no quarter to either the captain or the seamen but to hang them all up at the yardarm what said i will thei execut them right or wrong hang them first and judg them afterwardso sir said the old pilot there is no need to make a formal busi of it with such rogu as those let them tie them back to back and set them adiv it is no more than thei rightli deserv i knew i had my old man fast aboard and that he could do me no harm so i turn short upon him well seignior said i and thi is the veri reason why i would have you carri us to nanquin and not to put back to macao or to ani other part of the countri where the english or dutch ship came for be it known to you seignior those captain of the english and dutch ship ar a parcel of rash proud insol fellow that neither know what belong to justic or how to behav themselv as the law of god and natur direct but be proud of their offic and not understand their power thei would get the murder to punish robber would take upon them to insult men fals accus and determin them guilti without due inquiri and perhap i mai live to call some of them to an account of it where thei mai be taught how justic is to be execut and that no man ought to be treat as a crimin till some evid mai be had of the crime and that he is the man with thi i told him that thi wa the veri ship thei had attack and gave him a full account of the skirmish we had with their boat and how foolishli and cowardlik thei had behav i told him all the stori of our bui the ship and how the dutchmen serv us i told him the reason i had to believ that thi stori of kill the master by the malaccan wa not true as also the run awai with the ship but that it wa all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men were turn pirat and thei ought to have been sure it wa so befor thei had ventur to attack us by surpris and oblig us so resist them ad that thei would have the blood of those men who were kill there in our just defenc to answer for the old man wa amaz at thi relat and told us we were veri much in the right to go awai to the north and that if he might advis us it should be to sell the ship in china which we might veri well do and bui or build anoth in the countri and said he though you will not get so good a ship yet you mai get on abl enough to carri you and all your good back again to bengal or ani where els i told him i would take hi advic when i came to ani port where i could find a ship for my turn or get ani custom to bui thi he repli i should meet with custom enough for the ship at nanquin and that a chines junk would serv me veri well to go back again and that he would procur me peopl both to bui on and sell the other well but seignior sai i as you sai thei know the ship so well i mai perhap if i follow your measur be instrument to bring some honest innoc men into a terribl broil and perhap be murder in cold blood for wherev thei find the ship thei will prove the guilt upon the men by prove thi wa the ship and so innoc men mai probabl be overpow and murderedwhi said the old man ill find out a wai to prevent that also for as i know all those command you speak of veri well and shall see them all as thei pass by i will be sure to set them to right in the thing and let them know that thei had been so much in the wrong that though the peopl who were on board at first might run awai with the ship yet it wa not true that thei had turn pirat and that in particular those were not the men that first went off with the ship but innoc bought her for their trade and i am persuad thei will so far believ me as at least to act more cautious for the time to comewel said i and will you deliv on messag to them from mey i will sai he if you will give it under your hand in write that i mai be abl to prove it came from you and not out of my own head i answer that i would readili give it him under my hand so i took a pen and ink and paper and wrote at larg the stori of assault me with the longboat c the pretend reason of it and the unjust cruel design of it and conclud to the command that thei had done what thei not onli should have been asham or but also that if ever thei came to england and i live to see them there thei should all pai dearli for it if the law of my countri were not grown out of us befor i arriv there my old pilot read thi over and over again and ask me sever time if i would stand to it i answer i would stand to it as long as i had ani thing left in the world be sensibl that i should on time or other find an opportun to put it home to them but we had no occas ever to let the pilot carri thi letter for he never went back again while those thing were pass between us by wai of discours we went forward directli for nanquin and in about thirteen dai sail came to anchor at the southwest point of the great gulf of nanquin where by the wai i came by accid to understand that the two dutch ship were gone that length befor me and that i should certainli fall into their hand i consult my partner again in thi exig and he wa as much at a loss as i wa and would veri gladli have been safe on shore almost ani where howev i wa not in such perplex neither but i ask the old pilot if there wa no creek or harbour which i might put into and pursu my busi with the chines privat and be in no danger of the enemi he told me if i would sail to the southward about twoandforti leagu there wa a littl port call quinchang where the father of the mission usual land from macao on their progress to teach the christian religion to the chines and where no european ship ever put in and if i thought proper to put in there i might consid what farther cours to take when i wa on shore he confess he said it wa not a place for merchant except that at some certain time thei had a kind of a fair there when the merchant from japan came over thither to bui the chines merchandis we all agre to go back to thi place the name of the port as he call it i mai perhap spell wrong for i do not particularli rememb it have lost thi togeth with the name of mani other place set down in a littl pocketbook which wa spoil by the water on an accid which i shall relat in it order but thi i rememb that the chines or japanes merchant we correspond with call it by a differ name from that which our portugues pilot gave it and pronounc it as abov quinchang as we were unanim in our resolut to go to thi place we weigh the next dai have onli gone twice on shore where we were to get fresh water on both which occas the peopl of the countri were veri civil to us and brought us abund of thing to sell to us i mean of provis plant root tea rice and some fowl but noth without monei we came to the other port the wind be contrari not till five dai but it wa veri much to our satisfact and i wa joy and i mai sai thank when i set my foot safe on shore resolv and my partner too that if it wa possibl to dispos of ourselv and effect ani other wai though not everi wai to our satisfact we would never set on foot on board that unhappi vessel again and inde i must acknowledg that of all the circumst of life that ever i had ani experi of noth make mankind so complet miser as that of be in constant fear well doe the scriptur sai the fear of man bring a snare it is a life of death and the mind is so entir suppress by it that it is capabl of no relief the anim spirit sink and all the vigour of natur which usual support men under other afflict and is present to them in the greatest exig fail them here nor did it fail of it usual oper upon the fanci by heighten everi danger repres the english and dutch captain to be men incap of hear reason or distinguish between honest men and rogu or between a stori calcul for our own turn made out of noth on purpos to deceiv and a true genuin account of our whole voyag progress and design for we might mani wai have convinc ani reason creatur that we were not pirat the good we had on board the cours we steer our frankli shew ourselv and enter into such and such port even our veri manner the forc we had the number of men the few arm littl ammunit and short provis all these would have serv to convinc ani man that we were no pirat the opium and other good we had on board would make it appear the ship had been at bengal the dutchmen who it wa said had the name of all the men that were in the ship might easili see that we were a mixtur of english portugues and indian and but two dutchmen on board these and mani other particular circumst might have made it evid to the understand of ani command whose hand we might fall into that we were no pirat but fear that blind useless passion work anoth wai and threw us into the vapour it bewild our understand and set the imagin at work to form a thousand terribl thing that perhap might never happen we first suppos as inde everi bodi had relat to us that the seamen on board the english and dutch ship but especi the dutch were so enrag at the name of a pirat and especi at our beat off their boat and escap that thei would not give themselv leav to inquir whether we were pirat or no but would execut us offhand as we call it without give us ani room for a defenc we reflect that there wa realli so much appar evid befor them that thei would scarc inquir after ani more as first that the ship wa certainli the same and that some of the seamen among them knew her and had been on board her and secondli that when we had intellig at the river cambodia that thei were come down to examin us we fought their boat and fled so that we made no doubt but thei were as fulli satisfi of our be pirat as we were satisfi of the contrari and i often said i knew not but i should have been apt to have taken the like circumst for evid if the tabl were turn and my case wa their and have made no scrupl of cut all the crew to piec without believ or perhap consid what thei might have to offer in their defenc but let that be how it will those were our apprehens and both my partner and i too scarc slept a night without dream of halter and yardarm that is to sai gibbet of fight and be taken of kill and be kill and on night i wa in such a furi in my dream fanci the dutchmen had board us and i wa knock on of their seamen down that i struck my doubl fist against the side of the cabin i lai in with such a forc as wound my hand most gievous broke my knuckl and cut and bruis the flesh so that it not onli wake me out of my sleep but i wa onc afraid i should have lost two of my finger anoth apprehens i had wa of the cruel usag we should meet with from them if we fell into their hand then the stori of amboyna came into my head and how the dutch might perhap tortur us as thei did our countrymen there and make some of our men by extrem of tortur confess those crime thei never were guilti of own themselv and all of us to be pirat and so thei would put us to death with a formal appear of justic and that thei might be tempt to do thi for the gain of our ship and cargo which wa worth four or five thousand pound put all togeth these thing torment me and my partner too night and dai nor did we consid that the captain of ship have no author to act thu and if we had surrend prison to them thei could not answer the destroi us or tortur us but would be account for it when thei came into their own countri thi i sai gave me no satisfact for if thei will act thu with us what advantag would it be to us that thei would be call to an account for it or if we were first to be murder what satisfact would it be to us to have them punish when thei came home i cannot refrain take notic here what reflect i now had upon the past varieti of my particular circumst how hard i thought it wa that i who had spent forti year in a life of continu difficulti and wa at last come as it were at the port or haven which all men drive at viz to have rest and plenti should be a volunt in new sorrow by my own unhappi choic and that i who had escap so mani danger in my youth should now come to be hang in my old ag and in so remot a place for a crime i wa not in the least inclin to much less guilti of and in a place and circumst where innoc wa not like to be ani protect at all to me after these thought someth of religion would come in and i would be consid that thi seem to me to be a disposit of immedi provid and i ought to look upon it and submit to it as such that although i wa innoc as to men i wa far from be innoc as to my maker and i ought to look in and examin what other crime in my life were most obviou to me and for which provid might justli inflict thi punish as a retribut and that i ought to submit to thi just as i would to a shipwreck if it had pleas god to have brought such a disast upon me in it turn natur courag would sometim take it place and then i would be talk myself up to vigor resolut that i would not be taken to be barbar us by a parcel of merciless wretch in cold blood that it wa much better to have fallen into the hand of the savag who were meneat and who i wa sure would feast upon me when thei had taken me than by those who would perhap glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortur and barbar that in the case of the savag i alwai resolv to die fight to the last gasp and why should i not do so now see it wa much more dread to me at least to think of fall into these men hand than ever it wa to think of be eaten by men for the savag give them their due would not eat a man till he wa dead and kill him first as we do a bullock but that these men had mani art beyond the cruelti of death whenev these thought prevail i wa sure to put myself into a kind of fever with the agit of a suppos fight my blood would boil and my ey sparkl as if i wa engag and i alwai resolv that i would take no quarter at their hand but even at last if i could resist no longer i would blow up the ship and all that wa in her and leav them but littl booti to boast of but by how much the greater weight the anxieti and perplex of those thing were to our thought while we were at sea by so much the greater wa our satisfact when we saw ourselv on shore and my partner told me he dream that he had a veri heavi load upon hi back which he wa to carri up a hill and found that he wa not abl to stand long under it but the portugues pilot came and took it off hi back and the hill disappear the ground befor him shew all smooth and plain and truli it wa so we were all like men who had a load taken off their back for my part i had a weight taken off from my heart that i wa not abl ani longer to bear and as i said abov we resolv to go no more to sea in that ship when we came on shore the old pilot who wa now our friend got us a lodg and a warehous for our good which by the wai wa much the same it wa a littl hous or hut with a larg hous join to it all built with cane and palisado round with larg cane to keep out pilfer thiev of which it seem there were not a few in the countri howev the magistr allow us all a littl guard and we had a soldier with a kind of halbert or halfpik who stood sentinel at our door to whom we allow a pint of rice and a littl piec of monei about the valu of threepenc per dai so that our good were kept veri safe the fair or mart usual kept in thi place had been over some time howev we found that there were three or four junk in the river and two japann i mean ship from japan with good which thei had bought in china and were not gone awai have japanes merchant on shore the first thing our old portugues pilot did for us wa to bring us acquaint with three missionari romish priest who were in the town and who had been there some time convert the peopl to christian but we thought thei made but poor work of it and made them but sorri christian when thei had done howev that wa not our busi on of these wa a frenchman whom thei call father simon he wa a jolli wellcondit man veri free in hi convers not seem so seriou and grave as the other two did on of whom wa a portugues and the other a genoes but father simon wa courteou easi in hi manner and veri agreeabl compani the other two were more reserv seem rigid and auster and appli serious to the work thei came about viz to talk with and insinu themselv among the inhabit wherev thei had opportun we often at and drank with those men and though i must confess the convers as thei call it of the chines to christian is so far from the true convers requir to bring heathen peopl to the faith of christ that it seem to amount to littl more than let them know the name of christ sai some prayer to the virgin mari and her son in a tongu which thei understand not and to cross themselv and the like yet it must be confess that these religi whom we call missionari have a firm belief that these peopl should be save and that thei ar the instrument of it and on thi account thei undergo not onli the fatigu of the voyag and hazard of live in such place but oftentim death itself with the most violent tortur for the sake of thi work and it would be a great want of chariti in us whatev opinion we have of the work itself and the manner of their do it if we should not have a good opinion of their zeal who undertak it with so mani hazard and who have no prospect of the least tempor advantag to themselv but to return to my stori thi french priest father simon wa appoint it seem by order of the chief of the mission to go up to pekin the royal seat of the chines emperor and wait onli for anoth priest who wa order to come to him from macao to go along with him and we scarc ever met togeth but he wa invit me to go that journei with him tell me how he would shew me all the gloriou thing of that mighti empir and among the rest the greatest citi in the world a citi said he that your london and our pari put togeth cannot be equal to thi wa the citi of pekin which i confess is veri great and infinit full of peopl but as i look on those thing with differ ey from other men so i shall give my opinion of them in few word when i come in the cours of my travel to speak more particularli of them but first i come to my friar or missionari dine with him on dai and be veri merri togeth i show some littl inclin to go with him and he press me and my partner veri hard and with a great mani persuas to consent why father simon sai my partner why should you desir our compani so much you know we ar heret and you do not love us nor can keep us compani with ani pleasureo sai he you mai perhap be good cathol in time my busi here is to convert heathen and who know but i mai convert you tooveri well father said i so you will preach to us all the wayi wont be troublesom to you said he our religion doe not divest us of good manner besid said he we ar all here like countrymen and so we ar compar to the place we ar in and if you ar hugonot and i a cathol we mai be all christian at last at least said he we ar all gentlemen and we mai convers so without be uneasi to on anoth i like that part of hi discours veri well and it began to put me in mind of my priest that i had left in the brasil but thi father simon did not come up to hi charact by a great deal for though father simon had no appear of a crimin leviti in him neither yet he had not that fund of christian zeal strict pieti and sincer affect to religion that my other good ecclesiast had of whom i have said so much but to leav him a littl though he never left us nor solicit us to go with him but we had someth els befor us at that time for we had all thi while our ship and our merchandis to dispos of and we began to be veri doubt what we should do for we were now in a place of veri littl busi and onc i wa about to ventur to sail for the river of kilam and the citi of nanquin but provid seem now more visibl as i thought than ever to concern itself in our affair and i wa encourag from thi veri time to think i should on wai or other get out of thi entangl circumst and be brought home to my own countri again though i had not the least view of the manner and when i began sometim to think of it could not imagin by what method it wa to be done provid i sai began here to clear up our wai a littl and the first thing that offer wa that our old portugues pilot brought a japan merchant to us who began to inquir what good we had and in the first place he bought all our opium and gave us a veri good price for it pai us in gold by weight some in small piec of their own coin and some in small wedg of about ten or eleven ounc each while we were deal with him for our opium it came into my head that he might perhap deal with us for the ship too and i order the interpret to propos it to him he shrunk up hi shoulder at it when it wa first propos to him but in a few dai after he came to me with on of the missionari priest for hi interpret and told me he had a propos to make to me and that wa thi he had bought a great quantiti of good of us when he had no thought or propos made to him of bui the ship and that therefor he had not monei enough to pai for the ship but if i would let the same men who were in the ship navig her he would hire the ship to go to japan and would send them from thenc to the philippin island with anoth load which he would pai the freight of befor thei went from japan and that at their return he would bui the ship i began to listen to thi propos and so eager did my head still run upon rambl that i could not but begin to entertain a notion myself of go with him and so to sail from the philippin island awai to the south sea and accordingli i ask the japanes merchant if he would not hire us to the philippin island and discharg us there he said no he could not do that for then he could not have the return of hi cargo but he would discharg us in japan he said at the ship return well still i wa for take him at that propos and go myself but my partner wiser than myself persuad me from it repres the danger as well of the sea as of the japanes who ar a fals cruel treacher peopl and then of the spaniard at the philippin more fals more cruel more treacher than thei but to bring thi long turn of our affair to a conclus the first thing we had to do wa to consult with the captain of the ship and with the men and know if thei were will to go to japan and while i wa do thi the young man whom as i said my nephew had left with me as my companion for my travel came to me and told me that he thought that voyag promis veri fair and that there wa a great prospect of advantag and he would be veri glad if i undertook it but that if i would not and would give him leav he would go as a merchant or how i pleas to order him and if ever he came to england and i wa there and aliv he would render me a faith account of hi success and it should be as much mine as i pleas i wa realli loath to part with him but consid the prospect of advantag which wa realli consider and that he wa a young fellow as like to do well in it as ani i knew i inclin to let him go but first i told him i would consult my partner and give him an answer the next dai my partner and i discours about it and my partner made a most gener offer he told me you know it ha been an unlucki ship and we both resolv not to go to sea in it again if your steward so he call my man will ventur the voyag ill leav my share of the vessel to him and let him make the best of it and if we live to meet in england and he meet with success abroad he shall account for on half of the profit of the ship freight to us the other shall be hi own if my partner who wa no wai concern with my young man made him such an offer i could do no less than offer him the same and all the ship compani be will to go with him we made over half the ship to him in properti and took a write from him oblig him to account for the other and awai he went to japan the japan merchant prove a veri punctual honest man to him protect him at japan and got him a licenc to come on shore which the european in gener have not late obtain paid him hi freight veri punctual sent him to the philippin load him with japan and china ware and a supercargo of their own who traffick with the spaniard brought back european good again and a great quantiti of clove and other spice and there he wa not onli paid hi freight veri well and at a veri good price but be not will to sell the ship then the merchant furnish him with good on hi own account that for some monei and some spice of hi own which he brought with him he went back to the manilla to the spaniard where he sold hi cargo veri well here have gotten a good acquaint at manilla he got hi ship made a free ship and the governor of manilla hire him to go to acapulco in america on the coast of mexico and gave him a licenc to land there and travel to mexico and to pass in ani spanish ship to europ with all hi men he made the voyag to acapulco veri happili and there he sold hi ship and have there also obtain allow to travel by land to porto bello he found mean some how or other to go to jamaica with all hi treasur and about eight year after came to england exceed rich of which i shall take notic in it place in the mean time i return to our particular affair be now to part with the ship and ship compani it came befor us of cours to consid what recompens we should give to the two men that gave us such time notic of the design against us in the river of cambodia the truth wa thei had done us a consider servic and deserv well at our hand though by the wai thei were a coupl of rogu too for as thei believ the stori of our be pirat and that we had realli run awai with the ship thei came down to us not onli to betrai the design that wa form against us but to go to sea with us as pirat and on of them confess afterward that noth els but the hope of go arogu brought him to do it howev the servic thei did us wa not the less and therefor as i had promis to be grate to them i first order the monei to be paid to them which thei said wa due to them on board their respect ship that is to sai the englishman nineteen month pai and to the dutchman seven and over and abov that i gave each of them a small sum of monei in gold which content them veri well then i made the englishman gunner of the ship the gunner be now made second mate and purser the dutchman i made boatswain so thei were both veri well pleas and prove veri servic be both abl seamen and veri stout fellow we were now on shore in china if i thought myself banish and remot from my own countri at bengal where i had mani wai to get home for my monei what could i think of myself now when i wa gotten about a thousand leagu farther off from home and perfectli destitut of all manner of prospect of return all we had for it wa thi that in about four month time there wa to be anoth fair at that place where we were and then we might be abl to purchas all sort of the manufactur of the countri and withal might possibl find some chines junk or vessel from nanquin that would be to be sold and would carri us and our good whither we pleas thi i like veri well and resolv to wait besid as our particular person were not obnoxi so if ani english or dutch ship came thither perhap we might have an opportun to load our good and get passag to some other place in india nearer home upon these hope we resolv to continu here but to divert ourselv we took two or three journi into the countri first we went ten dai journei to see the citi of nanquin a citi well worth see inde thei sai it ha a million of peopl in it which howev i do not believ it is regularli built the street all exactli straight and cross on anoth in direct line which give the figur of it great advantag but when i came to compar the miser peopl of these countri with our their fabric their manner of live their govern their religion their wealth and their glori as some call it i must confess i do not so much as think it worth name or worth my while to write of or ani that shall come after me to read it is veri observ that we wonder at the grandeur the rich the pomp the ceremoni the govern the manufactur the commerc and the conduct of these peopl not that thei ar to be wonder at or inde in the least to be regard but becaus have first a notion of the barbar of those countri the rude and the ignor that prevail there we do not expect to find ani such thing so far off otherwis what ar their build to the palac and royal build of europ what their trade to the univers commerc of england holland franc and spain what their citi to our for wealth strength gaieti of apparel rich furnitur and an infinit varieti what ar their port suppli with a few junk and bark to our navig our merchant fleet our larg and power navi our citi of london ha more trade than all their mighti empir on english or dutch or french man of war of eighti gun would fight with and destroi all the ship of china but the great of their wealth their trade the power of their govern and strength of their armi ar surpris to us becaus as i have said consid them as a barbar nation of pagan littl better than savag we did not expect such thing among them and thi inde is the advantag with which all their great and power is repres to us otherwis it is in itself noth at all for as i have said of their ship so it mai be said of their armi and troop all the forc of their empir though thei were to bring two million of men into the field togeth would be abl to do noth but ruin the countri and starv themselv if thei were to besieg a strong town in flander or to fight a disciplin armi on line of german cuirassi or of french cavalri would overthrow all the hors of china a million of their foot could not stand befor on embattl bodi of our infantri post so as not to be surround though thei were not to be on to twenti in number nai i do not boast if i sai that german or english foot and french hors would fairli beat all the forc of china and so of our fortifi town and of the art of our engin in assault and defend town there is not a fortifi town in china could hold out on month against the batteri and attack of an european armi and at the same time all the armi of china could never take such a town as dunkirk provid it wa not starv no not in ten year sieg thei have firearm it is true but thei ar awkward clumsi and uncertain in go off thei have powder but it is of no strength thei have neither disciplin in the field exercis in their arm skill to attack nor temper to retreat and therefor i must confess it seem strang to me when i came home and heard our peopl sai such fine thing of the power rich glori magnific and trade of the chines becaus i saw and knew that thei were a contempt herd or crowd of ignor sordid slave subject to a govern qualifi onli to rule such a peopl and in a word for i am now launch quit besid my design i sai in a word were not it distanc inconceiv great from muscovi and were not the muscovit empir almost as rude impot and illgovern a crowd of slave as thei the czar of muscovi might with much eas drive them all out of their countri and conquer them in on campaign and had the czar who i sinc hear is a grow princ and begin to appear formid in the world fallen thi wai instead of attack the warlik swede in which attempt none of the power of europ would have envi or interrupt him he might by thi time have been emperor of china instead of be beaten by the king of sweden at narva when the latter wa not on to six in number as their strength and their grandeur so their navig commerc and husbandri ar imperfect and impot compar to the same thing in europ also in their knowledg their learn their skill in the scienc thei have globe and sphere and a smatch of the knowledg of the mathemat but when you come to inquir into their knowledg how shortsight ar the wisest of their student thei know noth of the motion of the heavenli bodi and so grossli absurdli ignor that when the sun is eclips thei think it is a great dragon ha assault and run awai with it and thei fall aclutt with all the drum and kettl in the countri to fright the monster awai just as we do to hive a swarm of bee as thi is the onli excurs of thi kind which i have made in all the account i have given of my travel so i shall make no more descript of countri and peopl it is none of my busi or ani part of my design but give an account of my own adventur through a life of infinit wander and a long varieti of chang which perhap few have heard the like of i shall sai noth of the mighti place desert countri and numer peopl i have yet to pass through more than relat to my own stori and which my concern among them will make necessari i wa now as near as i can comput in the heart of china about the latitud of thirti degre north of the line for we were return from nanquin i had inde a mind to see the citi of pekin which i had heard so much of and father simon importun me daili to do it at length hi time of go awai be set and the other missionari who wa to go with him be arriv from macao it wa necessari that we should resolv either to go or not to go so i refer him to my partner and left it wholli to hi choic who at length resolv it in the affirm and we prepar for our journei we set out with veri good advantag as to find the wai for we got leav to travel in the retinu of on of their mandarin a kind of viceroi or princip magistr in the provinc where thei resid and who take great state upon them travel with great attend and with great homag from the peopl who ar sometim greatli impoverish by them becaus all the countri thei pass through ar oblig to furnish provis for them and all their attend that which i particularli observ as to our travel with hi baggag wa thi that though we receiv suffici provis both for ourselv and our hors from the countri as belong to the mandarin yet we were oblig to pai for everi thing we had after the marketpric of the countri and the mandarin steward or commissari of the provis collect it duli from us so that our travel in the retinu of the mandarin though it wa a veri great kind to us wa not such a mighti favour in him but wa inde a great advantag to him consid there were about thirti other peopl travel in the same manner besid us under the protect of hi retinu or as we mai call it under hi convoi thi i sai wa a great advantag to him for the countri furnish all the provis for noth and he took all our monei for them we were fiveandtwenti dai travel to pekin through a countri infinit popul but miser cultiv the husbandri economi and the wai of live all veri miser though thei boast so much of the industri of the peopl i sai miser and so it is if we who understand how to live were to endur it or to compar it with our own but not so to these poor wretch who know no other the pride of these peopl is infinit great and exceed by noth but their poverti which add to that which i call their miseri i must need think the nake savag of america live much more happi becaus as thei have noth so thei desir noth wherea these ar proud and insol and in the main ar mere beggar and drudg their ostent is inexpress and is chiefli shew in their cloth and build and in the keep multitud of servant or slave and which is to the last degre ridicul their contempt of all the world but themselv i must confess i travel more pleasantli afterward in the desert and vast wilder of grand tartari than here and yet the road here ar well pave and well kept and veri conveni for travel but noth wa more awkward to me than to see such a haughti imperi insol peopl in the midst of the grossest simplic and ignor for all their fame ingenu is no more my friend father simon and i us to be veri merri upon these occas to see the beggarli pride of those peopl for exampl come by the hous of a countrygentleman as father simon call him about ten leagu off from the citi of nanquin we had first of all the honour to ride with the master of the hous about two mile the state he rode in wa a perfect don quixot be a mixtur of pomp and poverti the habit of thi greasi don wa veri proper for a scaramouch or merryandrew be a dirti calico with all the tawdri trap of a fool coat such as hang sleev taffeti and cut and slash almost on everi side it cover a rich taffeti vest as greasi as a butcher and which testifi that hi honour must need be a most exquisit sloven hi hors wa a poor lean starv hobbl creatur such as in england might sell for about thirti or forti shill and he had two slave follow him on foot to drive the poor creatur along he had a whip in hi hand and he belabour the beast as fast about the head as hi slave did about the tail and thu he rode by us with about ten or twelv servant and we were told he wa go from the citi to hi countryseat about half a leagu befor us we travel on gentli but thi figur of a gentleman rode awai befor us and as we stop at a villag about an hour to refresh us when we came by the countryseat of thi great man we saw him in a littl place befor hi door eat hi repast it wa a kind of a garden but he wa easi to be seen and we were given to understand that the more we look on him the better he would be pleas he sat under a tree someth like the palmettotre which effectu shade him over the head and on the south side but under the tree also wa place a larg umbrella which made that part look well enough he sat loll back in a great elbowchair be a heavi corpul man and hi meat be brought him by two womenslav he had two more whose offic i think few gentlemen in europ would accept of their servic in viz on fed the squir with a spoon and the other held the dish with on hand and scrape off what he let fall upon hi worship beard and taffeti vest with the other while the great fat brute thought it below him to emploi hi own hand in ani of those familiar offic which king and monarch would rather do than be troubl with the clumsi finger of their servant i took thi time to think what pain men pride put them to and how troublesom a haughti temper thu illmanag must be to a man of common sens and leav the poor wretch to pleas himself with our look at him as if we admir hi pomp wherea we realli piti and contemn him we pursu our journei onli father simon had the curios to stai to inform himself what dainti the countri justic had to feed on in all hi state which he said he had the honour to tast of and which wa i think a dose that an english hound would scarc have eaten if it had been offer him viz a mess of boil rice with a great piec of garlick in it and a littl bag fill with green pepper and anoth plant which thei have there someth like our ginger but smell like musk and tast like mustard all thi wa put togeth and a small lump or piec of lean mutton boil in it and thi wa hi worship repast four or five servant more attend at a distanc if he fed them meaner than he wa fed himself the spice except thei must fare veri coars inde as for our mandarin with whom we travel he wa respect like a king surround alwai with hi gentlemen and attend in all hi appear with such pomp that i saw littl of him but at a distanc but thi i observ that there wa not a hors in hi retinu but that our carrier packhors in england seem to me to look much better but thei were so cover with equipag mantl trap and suchlik trumperi that you cannot see whether thei ar fat or lean in a word we could scarc see ani thing but their feet and their head i wa now lightheart and all my troubl and perplex that i had given an account of be over i had no anxiou thought about me which made thi journei much the pleasant to me nor had i ani ill accid attend me onli in the pass or ford a small river my hors fell and made me free of the countri as thei call it that is to sai threw me in the place wa not deep but it wet me all over i mention it becaus it spoil my pocketbook wherein i had set down the name of sever peopl and place which i had occas to rememb and which not take due care of the leav rot and the word were never after to be read to my great loss as to the name of some place which i touch at in thi voyag at length we arriv at pekin i had nobodi with me but the youth whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend me as a servant and who prove veri trusti and dilig and my partner had nobodi with him but on servant who wa a kinsman as for the portugues pilot he be desir to see the court we gave him hi passag that is to sai bore hi charg for hi compani and to us him as an interpret for he understood the languag of the countri and spoke good french and a littl english and inde thi old man wa a most us implement to us everi where for we had not been abov a week at pekin when he came laugh ah seignior ingles said he i have someth to tell you will make your heart gladmi heart glad said i what can that be i dont know ani thing in thi countri can either give me joi or grief to ani great degreey ye said the old man in broken english make you glad me sorrow sorri he would have said thi made me more inquisit why said i will it make you sorrybecaus said he you have brought me here twentyf dai journei and will leav me to go back alon and which wai shall i get to my port afterward without a ship without a hors without pecun so he call monei be hi broken latin of which he had abund to make us merri with in short he told us there wa a great caravan of muscovi and polish merchant in the citi and that thei were prepar to set out on their journei by land to muscovi within four or five week and he wa sure we would take the opportun to go with them and leav him behind to go back alon i confess i wa surpris with thi new a secret joi spread itself over my whole soul which i cannot describ and never felt befor or sinc and i had no power for a good while to speak a word to the old man but at last i turn to him how do you know thi said i ar you sure it is truey he said i met thi morn in the street an old acquaint of mine an armenian or on you call a grecian who is among them he came last from astracan and wa design to go to tonquin where i formerli knew him but ha alter hi mind and is now resolv to go back with the caravan to moscow and so down the river of wolga to astracanwel seignior said i do not be uneasi about be left to go back alon if thi be a method for my return to england it shall be your fault if you go back to macao at all we then went to consult togeth what wa to be done and i ask my partner what he thought of the pilot new and whether it would suit with hi affair he told me he would do just as i would for he had settl all hi affair so well at bengal and left hi effect in such good hand that as we made a good voyag here if he could vest it in china silk wrought and raw such as might be worth the carriag he would be content to go to england and then make hi voyag back to bengal by the compani ship have resolv upon thi we agre that if our portugues pilot would go with us we would bear hi charg to moscow or to england if he pleas nor inde were we to be esteem overgener in that part neither if we had not reward him farther for the servic he had done us wa realli worth all that and more for he had not onli been a pilot to us at sea but he had been also like a broker for us on shore and hi procur for us the japan merchant wa some hundr of pound in our pocket so we consult togeth about it and be will to gratifi him which wa inde but do him justic and veri will also to have him with us besid for he wa a most necessari man on all occas we agre to give him a quantiti of coin gold which as i comput it came to about on hundr and seventyf pound sterl between us and to bear hi charg both for himself and hors except onli a hors to carri hi good have settl thi among ourselv we call him to let him know what we had resolv i told him he had complain of our be like to let him go back alon and i wa now to tell him we were resolv he should not go back at all that as we had resolv to go to europ with the caravan we resolv also he should go with us and that we call him to know hi mind he shook hi head and said it wa a long journei and he had no pecun to carri him thither nor to subsist himself when he came thither we told him we believ it wa so and therefor we had resolv to do someth for him that would let him see how sensibl we were of the servic he had done us and also how agreeabl he wa to us and then i told him what we had resolv to give him here which he might lai out as we would do our own and that as for hi charg if he would go with us we would set him safe ashor life and casualti except either in muscovi or in england which he would at our own charg except onli the carriag of hi good he receiv the propos like a man transport and told us he would go with us over the whole world and so in short we all prepar ourselv for the journei howev as it wa with us so it wa with the other merchant thei had mani thing to do and instead of be readi in five week it wa four month and some odd dai befor all thing were got togeth it wa the begin of februari our style when we set out from pekin my partner and the old pilot had gone express back to the port where we had first put in to dispos of some good which he had left there and i with a chines merchant whom i had some knowledg of at nanquin and who came to pekin on hi own affair went to nanquin where i bought nineti piec of fine damask with about two hundr piec of other veri fine silk of sever sort some mix with gold and had all these brought to pekin against my partner return besid thi we bought a veri larg quantiti of raw silk and some other good our cargo amount in these good onli to about three thousand five hundr pound sterl which togeth with tea and some fine calico and three camelload of nutmeg and clove load in all eighteen camel for our share besid those we rode upon which with two or three spare hors and two hors load with provis made us in short twentysix camel and hors in our retinu the compani wa veri great and as near as i can rememb made between three and four hundr hors and camel and upward of a hundr and twenti men veri well arm and provid for all event for as the eastern caravan ar subject to be attack by the arab so ar these by the tartar but thei ar not altogeth so danger as the arab nor so barbar when thei prevail the compani consist of peopl of sever nation such as muscovit chiefli for there were about sixti of them who were merchant or inhabit of moscow though of them some were livonian and to our particular satisfact five of them were scot who appear also to be men of great experi in busi and veri good substanc when we had travel on dai journei the guid who were five in number call all the gentlemen and merchant that is to sai all the passeng except the servant to a great council as thei term it at thi great council everi on deposit a certain quantiti of monei to a common stock for the necessari expens of bui forag on the wai where it wa not otherwis to be had and for satisfi the guid get hors and the like and here thei constitut the journei as thei call it viz thei name captain and offic to draw us all up and give the command in case of an attack and give everi on their turn of command nor wa thi form us into order ani more than what we found need upon the wai as shall be observ in it place the road all on thi side of the countri is veri popul and is full of potter and earth maker that is to sai peopl that temper the earth for the china ware and as i wa go along our portugues pilot who had alwai someth or other to sai to make us merri came sneer to me and told me he would shew the greatest rariti in all the countri and that i should have thi to sai of china after all the ill humour thing i had said of it that i had seen on thing which wa not to be seen in all the world besid i wa veri importun to know what it wa at last he told me it wa a gentleman hous built all with china ware well said i ar not the materi of their build the product of their own countri and so it is all china ware is it notno no sai he i mean it is a hous all made of china ware such as you call so in england or as it is call in our countri porcelainwel said i such a thing mai be how big is it can we carri it in a box upon a camel if we can we will bui itupon a camel said the old pilot hold up both hi hand why there is a famili of thirti peopl live in it i wa then curiou inde to see it and when i came to see it it wa noth but thi it wa a timber hous or a hous built as we call it in england with lath and plaster but all the plaster wa realli china ware that is to sai it wa plaster with the earth that make china ware the outsid which the sun shone hot upon wa glaze and look veri well perfectli white and paint with blue figur as the larg china ware in england is paint and hard as if it had been burnt as to the insid all the wall instead of wainscot were line with harden and paint tile like the littl squar tile we call galli tile in england all made of the finest china and the figur exceed fine inde with extraordinari varieti of colour mix with gold mani tile make but on figur but join so artifici with mortar be made of the same earth that it wa veri hard to see where the tile met the floor of the room were of the same composit and as hard as the earthen floor we have in us in sever part of england especi lincolnshir nottinghamshir leicestershir c as hard as stone and smooth but not burnt and paint except some smaller room like closet which were all as it were pave with the same tile the ceil and in a word all the plaster work in the whole hous were of the same earth and after all the roof wa cover with tile of the same but of a deep shine black thi wa a china warehous inde truli and lite ralli to be call so and had i not been upon the journei i could have staid some dai to see and examin the particular of it thei told me there were fountain and fishpond in the garden all pave at the bottom and side with the same and fine statu set up in row on the walk entir form of the porcelain earth and burnt whole as thi is on of the singular of china so thei mai be allow to excel in it but i am veri sure thei excel in their account of it for thei told me such incred thing of their perform in crockerywar for such it is that i care not to relat as know it could not be trueon told me in particular of a workman that made a ship with all it tackl and mast and sail in earthenwar big enough to carri fifti men if he had told me he launch it and made a voyag to japan in it i might have said someth to it inde but as it wa i knew the whole stori which wa in short ask pardon for the word that the fellow li so i smile and said noth to it thi odd sight kept me two hour behind the caravan for which the leader of it for the dai fine me about the valu of three shill and told me if it had been three dai journei without the wall as it wa three dai within he must have fine me four time as much and made me ask pardon the next councildai so i promis to be more orderli for inde i found afterward the order made for keep all togeth were absolut necessari for our common safeti in two dai more we pass the great china wall made for a fortif against the tartar and a veri great work it is go over hill and mountain in an endless track where the rock ar impass and the precipic such as no enemi could possibl enter or inde climb up or where if thei did no wall could hinder them thei tell us it length is near a thousand english mile but that the countri is five hundr in a straight measur line which the wall bound without measur the wind and turn it take ti about four fathom high and as mani thick in some place i stood still an hour or thereabout without trespass on our order for so long the caravan wa in pass the gate i sai i stood still an hour to look at it on everi side near and far off i mean what wa within my view and the guid of our caravan who had been extol it for the wonder of the world wa mighti eager to hear my opinion of it i told him it wa a most excel thing to keep off the tartar which he happen not to understand as i meant it and so took it for a compliment but the old pilot laugh o seignior ingles said he you speak in coloursin colour said i what do you mean by thatwhi you speak what look white thi wai and black that wai gai on wai and dull anoth wai you tell him it is a good wall to keep out tartar you tell me by that it is good for noth but to keep out tartar or will keep out none but tartar i understand you seignior ingles i understand you said he joke but seignior chines understand you hi own wai well said i seignior do you think it would stand out an armi of our countrypeopl with a good train of artilleri or our engin with two compani of miner would thei not batter it down in ten dai that an armi might enter in battalia or blow it up in the air foundat and all that there should be no sign of it leftai ay said he i know that the chines want mightili to know what i said and i gave him leav to tell him a few dai after for we were then almost out of their countri and he wa to leav us in a littl time afterward but when he knew what i had said he wa dumb all the rest of the wai and we heard no more of hi fine stori of the chines power and great while he staid after we had pass thi mighti noth call a wall someth like the pict wall so famou in northumberland and built by the roman we began to find the countri thinli inhabit and the peopl rather confin to live in fortifi town and citi as be subject to the inroad and depred of the tartar who rob in great armi and therefor ar not to be resist by the nake inhabit of an open countri and here i began to find the necess of keep togeth in a caravan as we travel for we saw sever troop of tartar rove about but when i came to see them distinctli i wonder how that the chines empir could be conquer by such contempt fellow for thei ar a mere herd or crowd of wild fellow keep no order and understand no disciplin or manner of fight their hors ar poor lean starv creatur taught noth and ar fit for noth and thi we found the first dai we saw them which wa after we enter the wilder part of the countri our leader for the dai gave leav for about sixteen of us to go a hunt as thei call it and what wa thi but hunt of sheep howev it mai be call hunt too for the creatur ar the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever i saw of their kind onli thei will not run a great wai and you ar sure of sport when you begin the chase for thei appear gener by thirti or forti in a flock and like true sheep alwai keep togeth when thei fly in pursuit of thi odd sort of game it wa our hap to meet with about forti tartar whether thei were hunt mutton as we were or whether thei look for anoth kind of prei i know not but as soon as thei saw us on of them blew a kind of horn veri loud but with a barbar sound that i had never heard befor and by the wai never care to hear again we all suppos thi wa to call their friend about them and so it wa for in less than half a quarter of an hour a troop of forti or fifti more appear at about a mile distanc but our work wa over first as it happen on of the scot merchant of moscow happen to be amongst us and as soon as he heard the horn he told us in short that we had noth to do but to charg them immedi without loss of time and draw us up in a line he ask if we were resolv we told him we were readi to follow him so he rode directli up to them thei stood gaze at us like a mere crowd drawn up in no order nor shew the face of ani order at all but as soon as thei saw us advanc thei let fly their arrow which howev miss us veri happili it seem thei mistook not their aim but their distanc for their arrow all fell a littl short of us but with so true an aim that had we been about twenti yard nearer we must have had sever men wound if not kill immedi we halt and though it wa at a great distanc we fire and sent them leaden bullet for wooden arrow follow our shot full gallop resolv to fall in among them sword in hand for so our bold scot that led us direct he wa inde but a merchant but he behav with that vigour and braveri on thi occas and yet with such a cool courag too that i never saw ani man in action fitter for command as soon as we came up to them we fire our pistol in their face and then drew but thei fled in the greatest confus imagin the onli stand ani of them made wa on our right where three of them stood and by sign call the rest to come back to them have a kind of scimitar in their hand and their bow hang at their back our brave command without ask ani bodi to follow him gallop up close to them and with hi fusil knock on of them off hi hors kill the second with hi pistol and the third ran awai and thu end our fight but we had thi misfortun attend it viz that all our mutton that we had in chase got awai we had not a man kill or hurt but as for the tartar there were about five of them kill how mani were wound we knew not but thi we knew that the other parti wa so fright with the nois of our gun that thei fled and never made ani attempt upon us we were all thi while in the chines dominion and therefor the tartar were not so bold as afterward but in about five dai we enter a vast great wild desert which held us three dai and night march and we were oblig to carri our water with us in great leather bottl and to encamp all night just as i have heard thei do in the desert of arabia i ask our guid whose dominion thi wa in and thei told me thi wa a kind of border that might be call no man land be part of the great karakathi or grand tartari but that howev it wa reckon to china that there wa no care taken here to preserv it from the inroad of thiev and therefor it wa reckon the worst desert in the whole march though we were to go over some much larger in pass thi wilder which i confess wa at the first view veri fright to me we saw two or three time littl parti of the tartar but thei seem to be upon their own affair and to have no design upon us and so like the man who met the devil if thei had noth to sai to us we had noth to sai to them we let them go onc howev a parti of them came so near as to stand and gaze at us whether it wa to consid what thei should do viz to attack us or not attack us we knew not but when we were pass at some distanc by them we made a rear guard of forti men and stood readi for them let the caravan pass half a mile or thereabout befor us after a while thei march off onli we found thei assault us with five arrow at their part on of which wound a hors so that it disabl him and we left him the next dai poor creatur in great need of a good farrier we suppos thei might shoot more arrow which might fall short of us but we saw no more arrow or tartar at that time we travel near a month after thi the wai be not so good as at first though still in the dominion of the emperor of china but lai for the most part in villag some of which were fortifi becaus of the incurs of the tartar when we came to on of these town it wa about two dai and a half journei befor we were to come to the citi of naum i want to bui a camel of which there ar plenti to be sold all the wai upon that road and of hors also such as thei ar becaus so mani caravan come that wai thei ar veri often want the person that i spoke to to get me a camel would have gone and fetch it for me but i like a fool must be offici and go myself along with him the place wa about two mile out of the villag where it seem thei kept the camel and hors feed under a guard i walk it on foot with my old pilot in compani and a chines be desir forsooth of a littl varieti when we came to thi place it wa a low marshi ground wall round with a stone wall pile up dry without mortar or earth among it like a park with a littl guard of chines soldier at the door have bought a camel and agre for the price i came awai and the chines man that went with me led the camel when on a sudden came up five tartar on horseback two of them seiz the fellow and took the camel from him while the other three step up to me and my old pilot see us as it were unarm for i had no weapon about me but my sword which could but ill defend me against three horsemen the first that came up stop short upon my draw my sword for thei ar arrant coward but a second come upon my left gave me a blow on the head which i never felt till afterward and wonder when i came to myself what wa the matter with me and where i wa for he laid me flat on the ground but my neverfail old pilot the portugues so provid unlook for direct deliver from danger which to us ar unforeseen had a pistol in hi pocket which i knew noth of nor the tartar neither if thei had i suppos thei would not have attack us but coward ar alwai boldest when there is no danger the old man see me down with a bold heart step up to the fellow that had struck me and lai hold of hi arm with on hand and pull him down by main forc a littl toward him with the other he shot him into the head and laid him dead on the spot he then immedi step up to him who had stop us as i said and befor he could come forward again for it wa all done as it were in a moment made a blow at him with a scimitar which he alwai wore but miss the man cut hi hors into the side of hi head cut on of hi ear off by the root and a great slice down the side of hi face the poor beast enrag with the wound wa no more to be govern by hi rider though the fellow sat well enough too but awai he flew and carri him quit out of the pilot reach and at some distanc rise upon hi hind leg threw down the tartar and fell upon him in thi interv the poor chines came in who had lost the camel but he had no weapon howev see the tartar down and hi hors fallen upon him he run to him and seiz upon an ugli illfavour weapon he had by hi side someth like a poleax but not a poleax either he wrench it from him and made shift to knock hi tartarian brain out with it but my old man had the third tartar to deal with still and see he did not fly as he expect nor come on to fight him as he apprehend but stood stock still the old man stood still too and fall to work with hi tackl to charg hi pistol again but as soon as the tartar saw the pistol whether he suppos it to be the same or anoth i know not but awai he scour and left my pilot my champion i call him afterward a complet victori by thi time i wa a littl awak for i thought when i first began to awak that i had been in a sweet sleep but as i said abov i wonder where i wa how i came upon the ground and what wa the matter in a word a few minut after as sens return i felt pain though i did not know where i clap my hand to my head and took it awai bloodi then i felt my head ach and then in anoth moment memori return and everi thing wa present to me again i jump up upon my feet instantli and got hold of my sword but no enemi in view i found a tartar lie dead and hi hors stand veri quietli by him and look farther i saw my champion and deliver who had been to see what the chines had done come back with hi hanger in hi hand the old man see me on my feet came run to me and embrac me with a great deal of joi be afraid befor that i had been kill and see me bloodi would see how i wa hurt but it wa not much onli what we call a broken head neither did i afterward find ani great inconveni from the blow other than the place which wa hurt and which wa well again in two or three dai we made no great gain howev by thi victori for we lost a camel and gain a hors but that which wa remark when we came back to the villag the man demand to be paid for the camel i disput it and it wa brought to a hear befor the chines judg of the place that is to sai in english we went befor a justic of the peac give him hi due he act with a great deal of prudenc and imparti and have heard both side he grave ask the chines man that went with me to bui the camel whose servant he wa i am no servant said he but went with the strangerat whose request said the justic at the stranger request said he why then said the justic you were the stranger servant for the time and the camel be deliv to hi servant it wa deliv to him and he must pai for it i confess the thing wa so clear that i had not a word to sai but admir to see such just reason upon the consequ and so accur state the case i paid willingli for the camel and sent for anoth but you mai observ i sent for it i did not go to fetch it myself ani more i had had enough of that the citi of naum is a frontier of the chines empir thei call it fortifi and so it is as fortif go there for thi i will ventur to affirm that all the tartar in karakathi which i believ ar some million could not batter down the wall with their bow and arrow but to call it strong if it were attack with cannon would be to make those who understand it laugh at you we want as i have said about two dai journei of thi citi when messeng were sent express to everi part of the road to tell all travel and caravan to halt till thei had a guard sent to them for that an unusu bodi of tartar make ten thousand in all had appear in the wai about thirti mile beyond the citi thi wa veri bad new to travel howev it wa carefulli done of the governor and we were veri glad to hear we should have a guard accordingli two dai after we had two hundr soldier sent us from a garrison of the chines on our left and three hundr more from the citi of naum and with those we advanc boldli the three hundr soldier from naum march in our front the two hundr in our rear and our men on each side of our camel with our baggag and the whole caravan in the centr in thi order and well prepar for battl we thought ourselv a match for the whole ten thousand mogul tartar if thei had appear but the next dai when thei did appear it wa quit anoth thing it wa earli in the morn when march from a littl wellsitu town call changu we had a river to pass where we were oblig to ferri and had the tartar had ani intellig then had been the time to have attack us when the caravan be over the rearguard wa behind but thei did not appear there about three hour after when we were enter upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen mile over behold by a cloud of dust thei rais we saw an enemi wa at hand and thei were at hand inde for thei came on upon the spur the chines our guard on the front who had talk so big the dai befor began to stagger and the soldier frequent look behind them which is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just readi to run awai my old pilot wa of my mind and be near me he call out seignior ingles said he those fellow must be encourag or thei will ruin us all for if the tartar come on thei will never stand iti am of your mind said i but what cours must be donedon said he let fifti of our men advanc and flank them on each wing and encourag them and thei will fight like brave fellow in brave compani but without it thei will everi man turn hi back immedi i rode up to our leader and told him who wa exactli of our mind and accordingli fifti of us march to the right wing and fifti to the left and the rest made a line of reserv for so we march leav the last two hundr men to make anoth bodi to themselv and to guard the camel onli that if need were thei should send a hundr men to assist the last fifti in a word the tartar came on and an innumer compani thei were how mani we could not tell but ten thousand we thought wa the least a parti of them came on first and view our postur travers the ground in the front of our line and as we found them within gunshot our leader order the two wing to advanc swiftli and give them a salvo on each wing with their shot which wa done but thei went off and i suppos went back to give an account of the recept thei were like to meet with and inde that salut clog their stomach for thei immedi halt stood awhil to consid of it and wheel off to the left thei gave over the design and said no more to us for that time which wa veri agreeabl to our circumst which were but veri indiffer for a battl with such a number two dai after thi we came to the citi of naum or naunm we thank the governor for hi care for us and collect to the valu of on hundr crown or thereabout which we gave to the soldier sent to guard us and here we rest on dai thi is a garrison inde and there were nine hundr soldier kept here but the reason of it wa that formerli the muscovit frontier lai nearer to them than thei do now the muscovit have abandon that part of the countri which li from the citi west for about two hundr mile as desol and unfit for us and more especi be so veri remot and so difficult to send troop hither for it defenc for we had yet abov two thousand mile to muscovi properli so call after thi we pass sever great river and two dread desert on of which we were sixteen dai pass over and which as i said wa to be call no man land and on the th of april we came to the frontier of the muscovit dominion i think the first citi or town or fortress whatev it might be call that belong to the czar of muscovi wa call argun be on the west side of the river argun i could not but discov an infinit satisfact that i wa now arriv in as i call it a christian countri or at least in a countri govern by christian for though the muscovit do in my opinion but just deserv the name of christian yet such thei pretend to be and ar veri devout in their wai it would certainli occur to ani man who travel the world as i have done and who had ani power of reflect i sai it would occur to him to reflect what a bless it is to be brought into the world where the name of god and of a redeem is known worship and adoredand not where the peopl given up by heaven to strong delus worship the devil and prostrat themselv to stock and stone worship monster element horribleshap anim and statu or imag of monster not a town or citi we pass through but had their pagod their idol and their templ and ignor peopl worship even the work of their own hand now we came where at least a face of the christian worship appear where the knee wa bow to jesu and whether ignorantli or not yet the christian religion wa own and the name of the true god wa call upon and ador and it made the veri recess of my soul rejoic to see it i salut the brave scotch merchant i mention abov with my first acknowledg of thi and take him by the hand i said to him bless be god we ar onc again come among christian he smile and answer do not rejoic too soon countryman these muscovit ar but an odd sort of christian and but for the name of it you mai see veri littl of the substanc for some month farther of our journei well said i but still it is better than pagan and worship of devilswhi ill tell you said he except the russian soldier in garrison and a few of the inhabit of the citi upon the road all the rest of thi countri for abov a thousand mile farther is inhabit by the worst and most ignor of pagan and so inde we found it we were now launch into the greatest piec of solid earth if i understand ani thing of the surfac of the globe that is to be found in ani part of the world we had at least twelv hundr mile to the sea eastward we had at least two thousand to the bottom of the baltic sea westward and almost three thousand mile if we left that sea and went on west to the british and french channel we had full five thousand mile to the indian or persian sea south and about eight hundr mile to the frozen sea north nai if some peopl mai be believ there might be no sea northeast till we came round the pole and consequ into the northwest and so had a contin of land into america no mortal know where though i could give some reason why i believ that to be a mistak too as we enter into the muscovit dominion a good while befor we came to ani consider town we had noth to observ there but thi first that all the river run to the east as i understood by the chart which some of our caravan had with them it wa plain that all those river ran into the great river yamour or gammour thi river by the natur cours of it must run into the east sea or chines ocean the stori thei tell us that the mouth of thi river is choke up with bulrush of a monstrou growth viz three feet about and twenti or thirti feet high i must be allow to sai i believ noth of but as it navig is of no us becaus there is no trade that wai the tartar to whom alon it belong deal in noth but cattl so nobodi that ever i heard or ha been curiou enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boat or to come up from the mouth of it in ship but thi is certain that thi river run due east in the latitud of sixti degre carri a vast concours of river along with it and find an ocean to empti itself in that latitud so we ar sure of sea there some leagu to the north of thi river there ar sever consider river whose stream run as due north as the yamour run east and these ar all found to join their water with the great river tartaru name so from the northernmost nation of the mogul tartar who the chines sai were the first tartar in the world and who as our geograph alleg ar the gog and magog mention in sacr stori these river run all northward as well as all the other river i am yet to speak of made it evid that the northern ocean bound the land also on that side so that it doe not seem ration in the least to think that the land can extend itself to join with america on that side or that there is not a commun between the northern and the eastern ocean but of thi i shall sai no more it wa my observ at that time and therefor i take notic of it in thi place we now advanc from the river arguna by easi and moder journi and were veri visibl oblig to the care the czar of muscovi ha taken to have citi and town built in as mani place as ar possibl to place them where hi soldier keep garrison someth like the stationari soldier place by the roman in the remotest countri of their empir some of which i had read were particularli place in britain for the secur of commerc and for the lodg of travel and thu it wa here though wherev we came at these town and station the garrison and governor were russian and profess mere pagan sacrif to idol and worship the sun moon and star or all the host of heaven and not onli so but were of all the heathen and pagan that ever i met with the most barbar except onli that thei did not eat man flesh as our savag of america did some instanc of thi we met with in the countri between arguna where we enter the muscovit dominion and a citi of tartar and russian togeth call nertzinskai in which space is a continu desert or forest which cost us twenti dai to travel over it in a villag near the last of those place i had the curios to go and see their wai of live which is most brutish and unsuffer thei had i suppos a great sacrific that dai for there stood out upon an old stump of a tree an idol made of wood fright as the devil at least as ani thing we can think of to repres the devil that can be made it had a head certainli not so much as resembl ani creatur that the world ever saw ear as big as goat horn and as high ey as big as a crownpiec and a nose like a crook ram horn and a mouth extend fourcorn like that of a lion with horribl teeth hook like a parrot under bill it wa dress up in the filthiest manner that you can suppos it upper garment wa of sheepskin with the wool outward a great tartar bonnet on the head with two horn grow through it it wa about eight feet high yet had no feet or leg or ani other proport of part thi scarecrow wa set up at the outsid of the villag and when i came near to it there were sixteen or seventeen creatur whether men or women i could not tell for thei make no distinct by their habit either of bodi or head these lai all flat on the ground round thi formid block of shapeless wood i saw no motion among them ani more than if thei had been log of wood like their idol at first i realli thought thei had been so but when i came a littl nearer thei start up upon their feet and rais a howl cry as if it had been so mani deepmouth hound and walk awai as if thei were displeas at our disturb them a littl wai off from thi monster and at the door of a tent or hut made all of sheepskin and cowskin dri stood three butcher i thought thei were such for when i came nearer to them i found thei had long knive in their hand and in the middl of the tent appear three sheep kill and on young bullock or steer these it seem were sacrific to that senseless log of an idol and these three men priest belong to it and the seventeen prostrat wretch were the peopl who brought the offer and were make their prayer to that stock i confess i wa more move at their stupid and thi brutish worship of a hobgoblin than ever i wa at ani thing in my life to see god most gloriou and best creatur to whom he had grant so mani advantag even by creation abov the rest of the work of hi hand vest with a reason soul and that soul adorn with faculti and capac adapt both to honour hi maker and be honour by him i sai to see it sunk and degener to a degre so more than stupid as to prostrat itself to a fright noth a mere imaginari object dress up by themselv and made terribl to themselv by their own contriv adorn onli with clout and rag and that thi should be the effect of mere ignor wrought up into hellish devot by the devil himself who envi hi maker the homag and ador of hi creatur had delud them into such gross surfeit sordid and brutish thing as on would think should shock natur itself but what signifi all the astonish and reflect of thought thu it wa and i saw it befor my ey and there wa no room to wonder at it or think it imposs all my admir turn to rage and i rode up to the imag or monster call it what you will and with my sword cut the bonnet that wa on it head in two in the middl so that it hung down by on of the horn and on of our men that wa with me took hold of the sheep skin that cover it and pull at it when behold a most hideou outcri and howl ran through the villag and two or three hundr peopl came about my ear so that i wa glad to scour for it for we saw some had bow and arrow but i resolv from that moment to visit them again our caravan rest three night at the town which wa about four mile off in order to provid some hors which thei want sever of the hors have been lame and jade with the bad of the wai and our long march over the last desert so we had some leisur here to put my design in execut i commun my project to the scot merchant of moscow of whose courag i had had a suffici testimoni as abov i told him what i had seen and with what indign i had sinc thought that human natur could be so degener i told him i wa resolv if i could get but four or five men well arm to go with me to go and destroi that vile abomin idol to let them see that it had no power to help itself and consequ could not be an object of worship or to be prai to much less help them that offer sacrific to it he laugh at me said he your zeal mai be good but what do you propos to yourself by itpropos said i to vindic the honour of god which is insult by thi devilworshipbut how will it vindic the honour of god said he while the peopl will not be abl to know what you mean by it unless you could speak to them too and tell them so and then thei will fight you too i will assur you for thei ar desper fellow and that especi in defenc of their idolatrycan we not said i do it in the night and then leav them the reason in write in their own languagewrit said he why there is not in five nation of them on man that know ani thing of a letter or how to read a word in ani languag or in their ownwretch ignor said i to him howev i have a great mind to do it perhap natur mai draw infer from it to them to let them see how brutish thei ar to worship such horrid thingslook you sir said he if your zeal prompt you to it so warmli you must do it but in the next place i would have you consid these wild nation of peopl ar subject by forc to the czar of muscovi dominion and if you do thi it is ten to on but thei will come by thousand to the governor of nertzinskai and complain and demand satisfact and if he cannot give them satisfact it is ten to on but thei revolt and it will occas a new war with all the tartar in the countri thi i confess put new thought into my head for a while but i harp upon the same string still and all that dai i wa uneasi to put my project in execut toward the even the scot merchant met me by accid in our walk about the town and desir to speak with me i believ said he i have put you off your good design i have been a littl concern about it sinc for i abhor the idol and idolatri as much as you can dotruli said i you have put it off a littl as to the execut of it but you have not put it all out of my thought and i believ i shall do it still befor i quit thi place though i were to be deliv up to them for satisfactionno no said he god forbid thei should deliv you up to such a crew of monster thei shall not do that neither that would be murder you indeedwhi said i how would thei us meus you said he ill tell you how thei serv a poor russian who affront them in their worship just as you did and whom thei took prison after thei had lame him with an arrow that he could not run awai thei took him and strip him stark nake and set him upon the top of the idol monster and stood all round him and shot as mani arrow into him as would stick over hi whole bodi and then thei burnt him and all the arrow stick in him as a sacrific to the idoland wa thi the same idol said iy said he the veri samewel said i i will tell you a stori so i relat the stori of our men at madagascar and how thei burnt and sack the villag there and kill man woman and child for their murder on of our men just as it is relat befor and when i had done i ad that i thought we ought to do so to thi villag he listen veri attent to the stori but when i talk of do so to that villag said he you mistak veri much it wa not thi villag it wa almost a hundr mile from thi place but it wa the same idol for thei carri him about in process all over the countrywel said i then that idol ought to be punish for it and it shall said i if i live thi night out in a word find me resolut he like the design and told me i should not go alon but he would go with me but he would go first and bring a stout fellow on of hi countrymen to go also with us and on said he as famou for hi zeal as you can desir ani on to be against such devilish thing as these in a word he brought me hi comrad a scotsman whom he call captain richardson and i gave him a full account of what i had seen and also what i intend and he told me readili he would go with me if it cost him hi life so we agre to go onli we three i had inde propos it to my partner but he declin it he said he wa readi to assist me to the utmost and upon all occas for my defenc but that thi wa an adventur quit out of hi wai so i sai we resolv upon our work onli we three and my manserv and to put it in execut that night about midnight with all the secresi imagin howev upon second thought we were will to delai it till the next night becaus the caravan be to set forward in the morn we suppos the governor could not pretend to give them ani satisfact upon us when we were out of hi power the scot merchant as steadi in hi resolut to enterpris it as bold in execut brought me a tartar robe or gown of sheepskin and a bonnet with a bow and arrow and had provid the same for himself and hi countryman that the peopl if thei saw us should not be abl to determin who we were all the first night we spent in mix up some combust matter with aquavita gunpowd and such other materi as we could get and have a good quantiti of tar in a littl pot about an hour after night we set out upon our expedit we came to the place about eleven oclock at night and found that the peopl had not the least jealousi of danger attend their idol the night wa cloudi yet the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the same postur and place that it did befor the peopl seem to be all at their rest onli that in the great hut or tent as we call it where we saw the three priest whom we mistook for butcher we saw a light and go up close to the door we heard peopl talk as if there were five or six of them we conclud therefor that if we set wildfir to the idol these men would come out immedi and run up to the place to rescu it from the destruct that we intend for it and what to do with them we knew not onc we thought of carri it awai and set fire to it at a distanc but when we came to handl it we found it too bulki for our carriag so we were at a loss again the second scotsman wa for set fire to the tent or hut and knock the creatur that were there on the head when thei came out but i could not join with that i wa against kill them if it wa possibl to be avoid well then said the scot merchant i will tell you what we will do we will try to make them prison tie their hand and make them stand and see their idol destroi as it happen we had twine or packthread enough about us which we us to tie our firework togeth with so we resolv to attack these peopl first and with as littl nois as we could the first thing we did we knock at the door when on of the priest come to it we immedi seiz upon him stop hi mouth and ti hi hand behind him and led him to the idol where we gag him that he might not make a nois ti hi feet also togeth and left him on the ground two of us then wait at the door expect that anoth would come out to see what the matter wa but we wait so long till the third man came back to us and then nobodi come out we knock again gentli and immedi out came two more and we serv them just in the same manner but were oblig to go all with them and lai them down by the idol some distanc from on anoth when go back we found two more were come out to the door and a third stood behind them within the door we seiz the two and immedi ti them when the third step back and cry out my scot merchant went in after him and take out a composit we had made that would onli smoke and stink he set fire to it and threw it in among them by that time the other scotsman and my man take charg of the two men alreadi bound and ti togeth also by the arm led them awai to the idol and left them there to see if their idol would reliev them make hast back to us when the furz we had thrown in had fill the hut with so much smoke that thei were almost suffoc we then threw in a small leather bag of anoth kind which flame like a candl and follow it in we found there were but four peopl left who it seem were two men and two women and as we suppos had been about some of their diabol sacrific thei appear in short fright to death at least so as to sit trembl and stupid and not abl to speak neither for the smoke in a word we took them bound them as we had the other and all without ani nois i should have said we brought them out of the hous or hut first for inde we were not abl to bear the smoke ani more than thei were when we had done thi we carri them all togeth to the idol when we came there we fell to work with him and first we daub him all over and hi robe also with tar and such other stuff as we had which wa tallow mix with brimston then we stop hi ey and ear and mouth full of gunpowd then we wrap up a great piec of wildfir in hi bonnet and then stick all the combust we had brought with us upon him we look about to see if we could find ani thing els to help to burn him when my scotsman rememb that by the tent or hut where the men were there lai a heap of dry forag whether straw or rush i do not rememb awai he and the other scotsman ran and fetch their arm full of that when we had done thi we took all our prison and brought them have unti their feet and ungag their mouth and made them stand up and set them all befor their monstrou idol and then set fire to the whole we stai by it a quarter of an hour or thereabout til the powder in the ey and mouth and ear of the idol blew up and as we could perceiv had split and deform the shape of it and in a word till we saw it burnt into a mere block or log of wood and then ignit the dry forag to it we found it would be soon quit consum so we began to think of go awai but the scotsman said no we must not go for these poor delud wretch will all throw themselv into the fire and burn themselv with the idol so we resolv to stai till the forag wa burnt down too and then we came awai and left them in the morn we appear among our fellowtravel exceed busi in get readi for our journei nor could ani man suggest that we had been ani where but in our bed as travel might be suppos to be to fit themselv for the fatigu of that dai journei but it did not end so for the next dai came a great multitud of the countri peopl not onli of thi villag but of a hundr more for aught i know to the towngat and in a most outrag manner demand satisfact of the russian governor for the insult their priest and burn their great chamchithaungu such a hard name thei gave the monstrou creatur thei worship the peopl of nertzinskai were at first in a great constern for thei said the tartar were no less than thirti thousand and that in a few dai more thei would be on hundr thousand stronger the russian governor sent out messeng to appeas them and gave them all the good word imagin he assur them he knew noth of it and that there had not a soul of hi garrison been abroad that it could not be from ani bodi there and if thei would let him know who it wa he should be exemplarili punish thei return haughtili that all the countri reverenc the great chamchithaungu who dwelt in the son and no mortal would have dare to offer violenc to hi imag but some christian miscreant so thei call them it seem and thei therefor denounc war against him and all the russian who thei said were miscreant and christian the governor still patient and unwil to make a breach or to have ani caus of war alleg to be given by him the czar have straitli charg him to treat the conquer countri with gentl and civil gave them still all the good word he could at last he told them there wa a caravan gone toward russia that morn and perhap it wa some of them who had done them thi injuri and that if thei would be satisfi with that he would send after them to inquir into it thi seem to appeas them a littl and accordingli the governor sent after us and gave us a particular account how the thing wa intim withal that if ani in our caravan had done it thei should make their escap but that whether thei had done it or no we should make all the hast forward that wa possibl and that in the meantim he would keep them in plai as long as he could thi wa veri friendli in the governor howev when it came to the caravan there wa nobodi knew ani thing of the matter and as for us that were guilti we were the least of all suspect none so much as ask us the question howev the captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that the governor gave us and we march or travel two dai and two night without ani consider stop and then we lai at a villag call plothu nor did we make ani long stop here but hasten on toward jarawena anoth of the czar of muscovi coloni and where we expect we should be safe but it is to be observ that here we began for two or three dai march to enter upon a vast nameless desert of which i shall sai more in it place and which if we had now been upon it it is more than probabl we had been all destroi it wa the second dai march from plothu that by the cloud of dust behind us at a great distanc some of our peopl began to be sensibl we were pursu we had enter the desert and had pass by a great lake call schank osier when we perceiv a veri great bodi of hors appear on the other side of the lake to the north we travel west we observ thei went awai west as we did but had suppos we should have taken that side of the lake wherea we veri happili took the south side and in two dai more we saw them not for thei believ we were still befor them push on till thei came to the river udda thi is a veri great river when it pass farther north but when we came to it we found it narrow and fordabl the third dai thei either found their mistak or had intellig of us and came pour in upon us toward the dusk of the even we had to our great satisfact just pitch upon a place for our camp which wa veri conveni for the night for as we were upon a desert though but at the begin of it that wa abov five hundr mile over we had no town to lodg at and inde expect none but the citi of jarawena which we had yet two dai march to the desert howev had some few wood in it on thi side and littl river which ran all into the great river udda it wa in a narrow strait between two small but veri thick wood that we pitch our littl camp for that night expect to be attack in the night nobodi knew but ourselv what we were pursu for but as it wa usual for the mogul tartar to go about in troop in that desert so the caravan alwai fortifi themselv everi night against them as against armi of robber and it wa therefor no new thing to be pursu but we had thi night of all the night of our travel a most advantag camp for we lai between two wood with a littl rivulet run just befor our front so that we could not be surround or attack ani wai but in our front or rear we took care also to make our front as strong as we could by place our pack with our camel and hors all in a line on the side of the river and we fell some tree in our rear in thi postur we encamp for the night but the enemi wa upon us befor we had finish our situat thei did not come on us like thiev as we expect but sent three messeng to us to demand the men to be deliv to them that had abus their priest and burnt their god chamchithaungu that thei might burn them with fire and upon thi thei said thei would go awai and do us no farther harm otherwis thei would burn us all with fire our men look veri blank at thi messag and began to stare at on anoth to see who look with most guilt in their face but nobodi wa the word nobodi did it the leader of the caravan sent word he wa well assur it wa not done by ani of our camp that we were peaceabl merchant travel on our busi that we had done no harm to them or to ani on els and therefor thei must look farther for their enemi who had injur them for we were not the peopl so desir them not to disturb us for if thei did we should defend ourselv thei were far from be satisfi with thi for an answer and a great crowd of them came down in the morn by break of dai to our camp but see us in such an advantag situat thei durst come no farther than the brook in our front where thei stood and shew us such a number as inde terrifi us veri much for those that spoke least of them spoke of ten thousand here thei stood and look at us awhil and then set up a great howl thei let fly a cloud of arrow among us but we were well enough fortifi for that for we were shelter under our baggag and i do not rememb that on man of us wa hurt some time after thi we saw them move a littl to our right and expect them on the rear when a cun fellow a cossack as thei call them of jarawena in the pai of the muscovit call to the leader of the caravan said to him i will send all these peopl awai to sibeilka thi wa a citi four or five dai journei at least to the south and rather behind us so he take hi bow and arrow and get on horseback he ride awai from our rear directli as it were back to nertzinskai after thi he take a great circuit about and come to the armi of the tartar as if he had been sent express to tell them a long stori that the peopl who had burnt their chamchithaungu were gone to sibeilka with a caravan of miscreant as he call them that is to sai christian and that thei were resolv to burn the god seal isarg belong to the tongus as thi fellow wa a mere tartar and perfectli spoke their languag he counterfeit so well that thei all took it from him and awai thei drove in a most violent hurri to sibeilka which it seem wa five dai journei to the south and in less than three hour thei were entir out of our sight and we never heard ani more of them nor ever knew whether thei went to that other place call sibeilka or no so we pass safe on to the citi of jarawena where there wa a garrison of muscovit and there we rest five dai the caravan be exceedingli fatigu with the last dai march and with want of rest in the night from thi citi we had a fright desert which held us threeandtwenti dai march we furnish ourselv with some tent here for the better accommod ourselv in the night and the leader of the caravan procur sixteen carriag or waggon of the countri for carri our water and provis and these carriag were our defenc everi night round our littl camp so that had the tartar appear unless thei had been veri numer inde thei would not have been abl to hurt us we mai well be suppos to want rest again after thi long journei for in thi desert we saw neither hous or tree or scarc a bush we saw inde abund of the sablehunt as thei call them these ar all tartar of the mogul tartari of which thi countri is a part and thei frequent attack small caravan but we saw no number of them togeth i wa curiou to see the sabl skin thei catch but i could never speak with ani of them for thei durst not come near us neither durst we straggl from our compani to go near them after we had pass thi desert we came into a countri pretti well inhabit that is to sai we found town and castl settl by the czar of muscovi with garrison of stationari soldier to protect the caravan and defend the countri against the tartar who would otherwis make it veri danger travel and hi czarish majesti ha given such strict order for the well guard the caravan and merchant that if there ar ani tartar heard of in the countri detach of the garrison ar alwai sent to see travel safe from station to station and thu the governor of adinskoi whom i had an opportun to make a visit to by mean of the scot merchant who wa acquaint with him offer us a guard of fifti men if we thought there wa ani danger to the next station i thought long befor thi that as we came nearer to europ we should find the countri better peopl and the peopl more civil but i found myself mistaken in both for we had yet the nation of the tongus to pass through where we saw the same token of pagan and barbar or wors than befor onli as thei were conquer by the muscovit and entir reduc thei were not so danger but for the rude of manner idolatri and polyth no peopl in the world ever went beyond them thei ar cloth all in skin of beast and their hous ar built of the same you know not a man from a woman neither by the rugged of their counten or their cloth and in the winter when the ground is cover with snow thei live under ground in hous like vault which have caviti or cave go from on to anoth if the tartar had their chamchithaungu for a whole villag or countri these had idol in everi hut and everi cave besid thei worship the star the sun the water the snow and in a word everi thing that thei do not understand and thei understand but veri littl so that almost everi element everi uncommon thing set them asacrif but i am no more to describ peopl than countri ani farther than my own stori come to be concern in them i met with noth peculiar to myself in all thi countri which i reckon wa from the desert which i spoke of last at least four hundr mile half of it be anoth desert which took us up twelv dai sever travel without hous tree or bush but we were oblig again to carri our own provis as well water as bread after we were out of thi desert and had travel two dai we came to janezai a muscovit citi or station on the great river janezai thi river thei told us part europ from asia though our mapmak as i am told do not agre to it howev it is certainli the eastern boundari of the ancient siberia which now make a provinc onli of the vast muscovit empir but is itself equal in big to the whole empir of germani and yet here i observ ignor and pagan still prevail except in the muscovit garrison all the countri between the river obi and the river janezai is as entir pagan and the peopl as barbar as the remotest of the tartar nai as ani nation for aught i know in asia or america i also found which i observ to the muscovit governor whom i had opportun to convers with that the pagan ar not much the wiser or the nearer christian for be under the muscovit govern which thei acknowledg wa true enough but thei said it wa none of their busi that if the czar expect to convert hi siberian or tongues or tartar subject it should be done by send clergymen among them not soldier and thei ad with more sincer than i expect that thei found it wa not so much the concern of their monarch to make the peopl christian as it wa to make them subject from thi river to the great river obi we cross a wild uncultiv countri i cannot sai ti a barbar soil ti onli barren of peopl and want good manag otherwis it is in itself a most pleasant fruit and agreeabl countri what inhabit we found in it ar all pagan except such as ar sent among them from russia for thi is the countri i mean on both side the river obi whither the muscovit crimin that ar not put to death ar banish and from whenc it is next to imposs thei should ever come awai i have noth materi to sai of my particular affair till i came to tobolski the capit of siberia where i continu some time on the follow occas we had been now almost seven month on our journei and winter began to come on apac whereupon my partner and i call a council about our particular affair in which we found it proper consid that we were bound for england and not for moscow to consid how to dispos of ourselv thei told us of sledg and reindeer to carri us over the snow in the wintertim and inde thei have such thing as it would be incred to relat the particular of by which mean the russian travel more in the winter than thei can in summer becaus in these sledg thei ar abl to run night and dai the snow be frozen is on univers cover to natur by which the hill the vale the river the lake ar all smooth and hard as a stone and thei run upon the surfac without ani regard to what is underneath but i had no occas to push at a winter journei of thi kind i wa bound to england not to moscow and my rout lai two wai either i must go on as the caravan went till i came to jarislaw and then go off west for narva and the gulf of finland and so either by sea or land to dantzic where i might possibl sell my china cargo to good advantag or i must leav the caravan at a littl town on the dwina from whenc i had but six dai by water to archangel and from thenc might be sure of ship either to england holland or hamburgh now to go ani of these journi in the winter would have been preposter for as to dantzic the baltic would be frozen up and i could not get passag and to go by land in those countri wa far less safe than among the mogul tartar likewis to archangel in octob all the ship would be gone from thenc and even the merchant who dwell there in summer retir south to moscow in the winter when the ship ar gone so that i should have noth but extrem of cold to encount with a scarciti of provis and must lie there in an empti town all the winter so that upon the whole i thought it much my better wai to let the caravan go and to make provis to winter where i wa viz at tobolski in siberia in the latitud of sixti degre where i wa sure of three thing to wear out a cold winter with viz plenti of provis such as the countri afford a warm hous with fuel enough and excel compani of all which i shall give a full account in it place i wa now in a quit differ climat from my belov island where i never felt cold except when i had my agu on the contrari i had much to do to bear my cloth on my back and never made ani fire but without door for my necess in dress my food c now i made me three good vest with larg robe or gown over them to hang down to the feet and button close to the wrist and all these line with fur to make them suffici warm as to a warm hous i must confess i greatli dislik our wai in england of make fire in everi room in the hous in open chimni which when the fire wa out alwai kept the air in the room cold as the climat but take an apart in a good hous in the town i order a chimnei to be built like a furnac in the centr of six sever room like a stove the funnel to carri the smoke went up on wai the door to come at the fire went in anoth and all the room were kept equal warm but no fire seen like as thei heat the bagnio in england by thi mean we had alwai the same climat in all the room and an equal heat wa preserv and how cold soever it wa without it wa alwai warm within and yet we saw no fire nor were ever incommod with ani smoke the most wonder thing of all wa that it should be possibl to meet with good compani here in a countri so barbar as that of the most northerli part of europ near the frozen ocean and within but a veri few degre of nova zembla but thi be the countri where the state crimin of muscovi as i observ befor ar all banish thi citi wa full of noblemen princ gentlemen colonel and in short all degre of the nobil gentri soldieri and courtier of muscovi here were the famou princ galilfken or galoffken and hi son the old gener robostiski and sever other person of note and some ladi by mean of my scot merchant whom nevertheless i part with here i made an acquaint with sever of these gentlemen and some of them of the first rank and from these in the long winter night in which i staid here i receiv sever agreeabl visit it wa talk on night with a certain princ on of the banish minist of state belong to the czar of muscovi that my talk of my particular case began he had been tell me abund of fine thing of the great the magnific and dominion and the absolut power of the emperor of the russian i interrupt him and told him i wa a greater and more power princ than ever the czar of muscovi wa though my dominion were not so larg or my peopl so mani the russian grande look a littl surpris and fix hi ey steadili upon me began to wonder what i meant i told him hi wonder would ceas when i had explain myself first i told him i had the absolut dispos of the live and fortun of all my subject that notwithstand my absolut power i had not on person disaffect to my govern or to my person in all my dominion he shook hi head at that and said there inde i outdid the czar of muscovi i told him that all the land in my kingdom were my own and all my subject were not onli my tenant but tenant at will that thei would all fight for me to the last drop and that never tyrant for such i acknowledg myself to be wa ever so univers belov and yet so horribl fear by hi subject after amus them with these riddl in govern for awhil i open the case and told them the stori at larg of my live in the island and how i manag both myself and the peopl there that were under me just as i have sinc minut it down thei were exceedingli taken with the stori and especi the princ who told me with a sigh that the true great of life wa to be master of ourselv that he would not have chang such a state of life as mine to have been czar of muscovi and that he found more felic in the retir he seem to be banish to there than ever he found in the highest author he enjoi in the court of hi master the czar that the height of human wisdom wa to bring our temper down to our circumst and to make a calm within under the weight of the greatest storm without when he came first hither he said he us to tear the hair from hi head and the cloth from hi back as other had done befor him but a littl time and consider had made him look into himself as well as round himself to thing without that he found the mind of man if it wa but onc brought to reflect upon the state of univers life and how littl thi world wa concern in it true felic wa perfectli capabl of make a felic for itself fulli satisfi to itself and suitabl to it own best end and desir with but veri littl assist from the world that air to breath in food to sustain life cloth for warmth and liberti for exercis in order to health complet in hi opinion all that the world could do for us and though the great the author the rich and the pleasur which some enjoi in the world and which he had enjoi hi share of had much in them that wa agreeabl to us yet he observ that all those thing chiefli gratifi the coarsest of our affect such as our ambit our particular pride our avaric our vaniti and our sensual all which were inde the mere product of the worst part of man were in themselv crime and had in them the seed of all manner of crime but neither were relat to or concern with ani of those virtu that constitut us wise men or of those grace which distinguish us as christian that be now depriv of all the fanci felic which he enjoi in the full exercis of all those vice he said he wa at leisur to look upon the dark side of them where he found all manner of deform and wa now convinc that virtu onli make a man truli wise rich and great and preserv him in the wai to a superior happi in a futur state and in thi he said thei were more happi in their banish than all their enemi were who had the full possess of all the wealth and power that thei the banish had left behind them nor sir said he do i bring my mind to thi polit by the necess of my circumst which some call miser but if i know ani thing of myself i would not go back no not though my master the czar should call me and offer to reinstat me in all my former grandeur i sai i would no more go back to it than i believ my soul when it shall be deliv from thi prison of the bodi and ha had a tast of the gloriou state beyond life would come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is now enclos in and leav heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of human affair he spake thi with so much warmth in hi temper so much earnest and motion of hi spirit which were appar in hi counten that it wa evid it wa the true sens of hi soul and inde there wa no room to doubt hi sincer i told him i onc thought myself a kind of a monarch in my old station of which i had given him an account but that i thought he wa not a monarch onli but a great conqueror for that he that ha got a victori over hi own exorbit desir and ha the absolut dominion over himself and whose reason entir govern hi will is certainli greater than he that conquer a citi but my lord said i shall i take the liberti to ask you a questionwith all my heart said he if the door of your liberti wa open said i would not you take hold of it to deliv yourself from thi exil hold said he your question is subtl and requir some seriou just distinct to give it a sincer answer and ill give it you from the bottom of my heart noth that i know of in thi world would move me to deliv myself from the state of banish except these two first the enjoy of my relat and secondli a littl warmer climat but i protest to you that to go back to the pomp of the court the glori the power the hurri of a minist of state the wealth the gaieti and the pleasur that is to sai folli of a courtier if my master should send me word thi moment that he restor me to all he banish me from i protest if i know myself at all i would not leav thi wilder these desert and these frozen lake for the palac of moscow but my lord said i perhap you not onli ar banish from the pleasur of the court and from the power and author and wealth you enjoi befor but you mai be absent too from some of the conveni of life your estat perhap confisc and your effect plunder and the suppli left you here mai not be suitabl to the ordinari demand of life ay said he that is as you suppos me to be a lord or a princ c so inde i am but you ar now to consid me onli as a man a human creatur not at all distinguish from anoth and so i can suffer no want unless i should be visit with sick and distemp howev to put the question out of disput you see our manner we ar in thi place five person of rank we live perfectli retir as suit to a state of banish we have someth rescu from the shipwreck of our fortun which keep us from the mere necess of hunt for our food but the poor soldier who ar here without that help live in as much plenti as we thei go into the wood and catch sabl and fox the labour of a month will maintain them a year and as the wai of live is not expens so it is not hard to get suffici to ourselv so that object is out of door i have no room to give a full account of the most agreeabl convers i had with thi truli great man in all which he shew that hi mind wa so inspir with a superior knowledg of thing so support by religion as well as by a vast share of wisdom that hi contempt of the world wa realli as much as he had express and that he wa alwai the same to the last as will appear in the stori i am go to tell i had been here eight month and a dark dread winter i thought it to be the cold wa so intens that i could not so much as look abroad without be wrapt in fur and a mask of fur befor my face or rather a hood with onli a hole for breath and two for sight the littl daylight we had as we reckon for three month not abov five hour a dai or six at most onli that the snow ly on the ground continu and the weather be clear it wa never quit dark our hors were kept or rather starv under ground and as for our servant for we hire servant here to look after our hors and ourselv we had everi now and then their finger and toe to thaw and take care of lest thei should mortifi and fall off it is true within door we were warm the hous be close the wall thick the light small and the glass all doubl our food wa chiefli the flesh of deer dri and cure in the season good bread enough but bake as biscuit dri fish of sever sort and some flesh of mutton and of buffalo which is pretti good beef all the store of provis for the winter ar laid up in the summer and well cure our drink wa water mix with aqua vita instead of brandi and for a treat mead instead of wine which howev thei have excel good the hunter who ventur abroad all weather frequent brought us in fresh venison veri fat and good and sometim bear flesh but we did not much care for the last we had a good stock of tea with which we treat our friend as abov and in a word we live veri cheerfulli and well all thing consid it wa now march and the dai grown consider longer and the weather at least toler so other travel began to prepar sledg to carri them over the snow and to get thing readi to be go but my measur be fix as i have said for archangel and not for muscovi or the baltic i made no motion know veri well that the ship from the south do not set out for that part of the world till mai or june and that if i wa there at the begin of august it would be as soon as ani ship would be readi to go awai and therefor i sai i made no hast to be gone as other did in a word i saw a great mani peopl nai all the travel go awai befor me it seem everi year thei go from thenc to moscow for trade viz to carri fur and bui necessari with them which thei bring back to furnish their shop also other went on the same errand to archangel but then thei also be to come back again abov eight hundr mile went all out befor me in short about the latter end of mai i began to make all readi to pack up and as i wa do thi it occur to me that see all these peopl were banish by the czar of muscovi to siberia and yet when thei came there were at liberti to go whither thei would why did thei not then go awai to ani part of the world wherev thei thought fit and i began to examin what should hinder them from make such an attempt but my wonder wa over when i entreat upon that subject with the person i have mention who answer me thu consid first said he the place where we ar and secondli the condit we ar in especi said he the gener of the peopl who ar banish hither we ar surround said he with stronger thing than bar and bolt on the north side is an unnavig ocean where ship never sail and boat never swam neither if we had both could we know whither to go with them everi other wai said he we have abov a thousand mile to pass through the czar own dominion and by wai utterli impass except by the road made by the govern and through the town garrison by it troop so that we could neither pass undiscov by the road or subsist ani other wai so that it is in vain to attempt it i wa silenc inde at onc and found that thei were in a prison everi jot as secur as if thei had been lock up in the castl of moscow howev it came into my thought that i might certainli be made an instrument to procur the escap of thi excel person and that it wa veri easi for me to carri him awai there be no guard over him in the countri and as i wa not go to moscow but to archangel and that i went in the natur of a caravan by which i wa not oblig to lie in the stationari town in the desert but could encamp everi night where i would might easili pass uninterrupt to archangel where i could immedi secur him on board an english or dutch ship and carri him off safe along with me and as to hi subsist and other particular that should be my care till he should better suppli himself he heard me veri attent and look earnestli on me all the while i spoke nai i could see in hi veri face that what i said put hi spirit into an exceed ferment hi colour frequent chang hi ey look red and hi heart flutter that it might be even perceiv in hi counten nor could he immedi answer me when i had done and as it were expect what he would sai to it and after he had paus a littl he embrac me and said how unhappi ar we unguid creatur as we ar that even our greatest act of friendship ar made snare to us and we ar made tempter of on anoth my dear friend said he your offer is so sincer ha such kind in it is so disinterest in itself and is so calcul for my advantag that i must have veri littl knowledg of the world if i did not both wonder at it and acknowledg the oblig i have upon me to you for it but did you believ i wa sincer in what i have so often said to you of my contempt of the world did you believ i spoke my veri soul to you and that i had realli maintain that degre of felic here that had place me abov all that the world could give me or do for me did you believ i wa sincer when i told you i would not go back if i wa recal even to be all that onc i wa in the court and with the favour of the czar my master did you believ me my friend to be an honest man or did you think me to be a boast hypocrit here he stop as if he would hear what i would sai but inde i soon after perceiv that he stop becaus hi spirit were in motion hi heart wa full of struggl and he could not go on i wa i confess astonish at the thing as well as at the man and i us some argument with him to urg him to set himself free that he ought to look upon thi as a door open by heaven for hi deliver and a summon by provid who ha the care and good disposit of all event to do himself good and to render himself us in the world he had by thi time recov himself how do you know sir said he warmli but that instead of a summon from heaven it mai be a feint of anoth instrument repres in all the allur colour to me the show of felic as a deliver which mai in itself be my snare and tend directli to my ruin here i am free from the temptat of return to my former miser great there i am not sure but that all the seed of pride ambit avaric and luxuri which i know remain in my natur mai reviv and take root and in a word again overwhelm me and then the happi prison whom you see now master of hi soul liberti shall be the miser slave of hi own sens in the full possess of all person liberti dear sir let me remain in thi bless confin banish from the crime of life rather than purchas a show of freedom at the expens of the liberti of my reason and at the expens of the futur happi which now i have in my view but shall then i fear quickli lose sight of for i am but flesh a man a mere man have passion and affect as like to possess and overthrow me as ani man o be not my friend and my tempter both togeth if i wa surpris befor i wa quit dumb now and stood silent look at him and inde admir what i saw the struggl in hi soul wa so great that though the weather wa extrem cold it put him into a most violent sweat and i found he want to give vent to hi mind so i said a word or two that i would leav him to consid of it and wait on him again and then i withdrew to my own apart about two hour after i heard somebodi at or near the door of the room and i wa go to open the door but he had open it and come in my dear friend said he you had almost overset me but i am recov do not take it ill that i do not close with your offer i assur you it is not for want of a sens of the kind of it in you and i come to make the most sincer acknowledg of it to you but i hope i have got the victori over myself my lord said i i hope you ar fulli satisfi that you did not resist the call of heavensir said he if it had been from heaven the same power would have influenc me to accept it but i hope and am fulli satisfi that it is from heaven that i declin it and i have an infinit satisfact in the part that you shall leav me an honest man still though not a free man i had noth to do but to acquiesc and make profess to him of my have no end in it but a sincer desir to serv him he embrac me veri passion and assur me he wa sensibl of that and should alwai acknowledg it and with that he offer me a veri fine present of sabl too much inde for me to accept from a man in hi circumst and i would have avoid them but he would not be refus the next morn i sent my servant to hi lordship with a small present of tea two piec of china damask and four littl wedg of japan gold which did not all weigh abov six ounc or thereabout but were far short of the valu of hi sabl which inde when i came to england i found worth near two hundr pound he accept the tea and on piec of the damask and on of the piec of gold which had a fine stamp upon it of the japan coinag which i found he took for the rariti of it but would not take ani more and sent word by my servant that he desir to speak with me when i came to him he told me i knew what had pass between us and hope i would not move him ani more in that affair but that sinc i made such a gener offer to him he ask me if i had kind enough to offer the same to anoth person that he would name to me in whom he had a great share of concern i told him that i could not sai i inclin to do so much for ani on but himself for whom i had a particular valu and should have been glad to have been the instrument of hi deliver howev if he would pleas to name the person to me i would give him my answer and hope he would not be displeas with me if he wa with my answer he told me it wa onli hi son who though i had not seen yet wa in the same condit with himself and abov two hundr mile from him on the other side the obi but that if i consent he would send for him i made no hesit but told him i would do it i made some ceremoni in let him understand that it wa wholli on hi account and that see i could not prevail on him i would shew my respect to him by my concern for hi son but these thing ar too tediou to repeat here he sent awai the next dai for hi son and in about twenti dai he came back with the messeng bring six or seven hors load with veri rich fur and which in the whole amount to a veri great valu hi servant brought the hors into the town but left the young lord at a distanc till night when he came incognito into our apart and hi father present him to me and in short we concert there the manner of our travel and everi thing proper for the journei i had bought a consider quantiti of sabl black foxskin fine ermin and such other fur that ar veri rich i sai i had bought them in that citi for exchang for some of the good brought from china in particular for the clove and nutmeg of which i sold the greatest part here and the rest afterward at archangel for a much better price than i could have done at louden and my partner who wa sensibl of the profit and whose busi more particularli than mine wa merchandis wa mightili pleas with our stai on account of the traffic we made here it wa in the begin of june when i left thi remot place a citi i believ littl heard of in the world and inde it is so far out of the road of commerc that i know not how it should be much talk of we were now come to a veri small caravan be onli thirtytwo hors and camel in all and all of them pass for mine though my new guest wa proprietor of eleven of them it wa most natur also that i should take more servant with me than i had befor and the young lord pass for my steward what great man i pass for myself i know not neither did it concern me to inquir we had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in all the journei inde i call it the worst becaus the wai wa veri deep in some place and veri uneven in other the best we had to sai for it wa that we thought we had no troop of tartar and robber to fear and that thei never came on thi side the river obi or at least but veri seldom but we found it otherwis my young lord had with him a faith muscovit servant or rather a siberian servant who wa perfectli acquaint with the countri and who led us by privat road that we avoid come into the princip town and citi upon the great road such as tumen soloi kamaskoi and sever other becaus the muscovit garrison which ar kept there ar veri curiou and strict in their observ upon travel and search lest ani of the banish person of note should make their escap that wai into muscovi but by thi mean as we were kept out of the citi so our whole journei wa a desert and we were oblig to encamp and lie in our tent when we might have had good accommod in the citi on the wai thi the young lord wa so sensibl of that he would not allow us to lie abroad when we came to sever citi on the wai but lai abroad himself with hi servant in the wood and met us alwai at the appoint place we were just enter europ have pass the river kama which in these part is the boundari between europ and asia and the first citi on the european side wa call soloi kamaskoi which is as much as to sai the great citi on the river kama and here we thought to have seen some evid alter in the peopl their manner their habit their religion and their busi but we were mistaken for as we had a vast desert to pass which by relat is near seven hundr mile long in some place but not abov two hundr mile over where we pass it so till we came past that horribl place we found veri littl differ between that countri and the mogul tartari the peopl mostli pagan and littl better than the savag of america their hous and town full of idol and their wai of live wholli barbar except in the citi as abov and the villag near them where thei ar christian as thei call themselv of the greek church but even these have their religion mingl with so mani relic of superstit that it is scarc to be known in some place from mere sorceri and witchcraft in pass thi forest i thought inde we must after all our danger were in our imagin escap as befor have been plunder and rob and perhap murder by a troop of thiev of what countri thei were whether the rove band of the ostiachi a kind of tartar or wild peopl on the bank of the obi had rang thu far or whether thei were the sablehunt of siberia i am yet at a loss to know but thei were all on horseback carri bow and arrow and were at first about fiveandforti in number thei came so near to us as within about two musket shot and ask no question thei surround us with their hors and look veri earnestli upon us twice at length thei place themselv just in our wai upon which we drew up in a littl line befor our camel be not abov sixteen men in all and be drawn up thu we halt and sent out the siberian servant who attend hi lord to see who thei were hi master wa the more will to let him go becaus he wa not a littl apprehens that thei were a siberian troop sent out after him the man came up near them with a flag of truce and call to them but though he spoke sever of their languag or dialect of languag rather he could not understand a word thei said howev after some sign to him not to come nearer to them at hi peril so he said he understood them to mean offer to shoot at him if he advanc the fellow came back no wiser than he went onli that by their dress he said he believ them to be some tartar of kalmuck or of the circassian hord and that there must be more of them on the great desert though he never heard that ever ani of them were seen so far north befor thi wa small comfort to us howev we had no remedi there wa on our left hand at about a quarter of a mile distanc a littl grove or clump of tree which stood close togeth and veri near the road i immedi resolv we should advanc to those tree and fortifi ourselv as well as we could there for first i consid that the tree would in a great measur cover us from their arrow and in the next place thei could not come to charg us in a bodi it wa inde my old portugues pilot who propos it and who had thi excel attend him name that he wa alwai readiest and most apt to direct and encourag us in case of the most danger we advanc immedi with what speed we could and gain that littl wood the tartar or thiev for we knew not what to call them keep their stand and not attempt to hinder us when we came thither we found to our great satisfact that it wa a swampi springi piec of ground and on the other side a great spring of water which run out in a littl rill or brook wa a littl farther join by anoth of the like big and wa in short the head or sourc of a consider river call afterward the wirtska the tree which grew about thi spring were not in all abov two hundr but were veri larg and stood pretti thick so that as soon as we got in we saw ourselv perfectli safe from the enemi unless thei alight and attack us on foot but to make thi more difficult our portugues with indefatig applic cut down great arm of the tree and laid them hang not cut quit off from on tree to anoth so that he made a continu fenc almost round us we staid here wait the motion of the enemi some hour without perceiv thei made ani offer to stir when about two hour befor night thei came down directli upon us and though we had not perceiv it we found thei had been join by some more of the same so that thei were near fourscor hors whereof howev we fanci some were women thei came in till thei were within half a shot of our littl wood when we fire on musket without ball and call to them in the russian tongu to know what thei want and bid them keep off but as if thei knew noth of what we said thei came on with a doubl furi directli to the woodsid not imagin we were so barricad that thei could not break in our old pilot wa our captain as well as he had been our engin and desir of us not to fire upon them till thei came within pistol shot that we might be sure to kill and that when we did fire we should be sure to take good aim we bade him give the word of command which he delai so long that thei were some of them within two pike length of us when we fire we aim so true or provid direct our shot so sure that we kill fourteen of them at the first vollei and wound sever other as also sever of their hors for we had all of us load our piec with two or three bullet apiec at least thei were terribl surpris with our fire and retreat immedi about on hundr rod from us in which time we load our piec again and see them keep that distanc we salli out and caught four or five of their hors whose rider we suppos were kill and come up to the dead we could easili perceiv thei were tartar but knew not from what countri or how thei came to make an excurs such an unusu length about an hour after thei made a motion to attack us again and rode round our littl wood to see where els thei might break in but find us alwai readi to face them thei went off again and we resolv not to stir from the place for that night we slept but littl you mai be sure but spent the most part of the night in strengthen our situat and barricad the entranc into the wood and keep a strict watch we wait for daylight and when it came it gave us a veri unwelcom discoveri inde for the enemi who we thought were discourag with the recept thei had met with were now increas to no less than three hundr and had set up eleven or twelv hut and

hi ruin and he would rather die than be starv and he wa for fight to the last drop the young lord as gallant as ever flesh shew itself wa for fight to the last also and my old pilot wa of the opinion

were abroad in sever parti for prei the first had sent out scout to call for help and to acquaint them of their booti and we did not know but by the morn thei might still be a greater number so i began to inquir of those peopl we had brought from tobolski if there were no other or more privat wai by which we might avoid them in the night and perhap either retreat to some town or get help to guard us over the desert the siberian who wa servant to the young lord told us if we design to avoid them and not fight he would engag to carri us off in the night to a wai that went north toward the river petraz by which he made no doubt but we might get awai and the tartar never the wiser but he said hi lord had told him he would not return but would rather choos to fight i told him he mistook hi lord for that he wa too wise a man to love fight for the sake of it that i knew hi lord wa brave enough by what he had shew alreadi but that hi lord knew better than to desir to have seventeen or eighteen men fight five hundr unless an unavoid necess forc them to it and that if he thought it possibl for us to escap in the night we had noth els to do but to attempt it he answer if hi lord gave him such order he would lose hi life if he did not perform it we soon brought hi lord to give that order though privat and we immedi prepar for the put it in practic and first as soon as it began to
