heaven is impregn to vice it will unavoid happen that in proport as thei surmount the first difficulti of emigr which bound them togeth in a common caus thei will begin to relax in their duti and attach to each other and thi remiss will point out the necess of establish some form of govern to suppli the defect of moral virtu some conveni tree will afford them a statehous under the branch of which the whole coloni mai assembl to deliber on public matter it is more than probabl that their first law will have the titl onli of regul and be enforc by no other penalti than public disesteem in thi first parliament everi man by natur right will have a seat but as the coloni increas the public concern will increas likewis and the distanc at which the member mai be separ will render it too inconveni for all of them to meet on everi occas as at first when their number wa small their habit near and the public concern few and trifl thi will point out the conveni of their consent to leav the legisl part to be manag by a select number chosen from the whole bodi who ar suppos to have the same concern at stake which those who appoint them and who will act in the same manner as the whole bodi would act were thei present if the coloni continu increas it will becom necessari to augment the number of the repres and that the interest of everi part of the coloni mai be attend to it will be

name of king depend the strength of govern and the happi of the govern here then is the origin and rise of govern name a mode render necessari by the inabl of moral virtu to govern the world here too is the design and end of govern viz freedom and secur and howev our ey mai be dazzl with show or our ear deceiv by sound howev prejudic mai warp our will or interest darken our understand the simpl voic of natur and of reason will sai it is right i draw my idea of the form of govern from a principl in natur which no art can overturn viz that the more simpl ani thing is the less liabl it is to be disord and the easier repair when disord and with thi maxim in view i offer a few remark on the so much boast constitut of england that it wa nobl for the dark and slavish time in which it wa erect is grant when the world wa over run with tyranni the least remov therefrom wa a gloriou rescu but that it is imperfect subject to convuls and incap of produc what it seem to promis is easili demonstr absolut govern tho the disgrac of human natur have thi advantag with them that thei ar simpl if the peopl suffer thei know the head from which their suffer spring know likewis the remedi and ar not bewild by a varieti of caus and cure but the constitut of england is so exceedingli complex that the nation mai suffer for year togeth without be abl to discov in which part the fault li some will sai in on and some in anoth and everi polit physician will advis a differ medicin i know it is difficult to get over local or long stand prejudic yet if we will suffer ourselv to examin the compon part of the english constitut we shall find them to be the base remain of two ancient tyranni compound with some new republican materi firstth remain of monarch tyranni in the person of the king secondlyth remain of aristocrat tyranni in the person of the peer thirdlyth new republican materi in the person of the common on whose virtu depend the freedom of england the two first by be hereditari ar independ of the peopl wherefor in a constitut sens thei contribut noth toward the freedom of the state to sai that the constitut of england is a union of three power reciproc check each other is farcic either the word have no mean or thei ar flat contradict to sai that the common is a check upon the king presuppos two thing firstthat the king is not to be trust without be look after or in other word that a thirst for absolut power is the natur diseas of monarchi secondlythat the common by be appoint for that purpos ar either wiser or more worthi of confid than the crown but as the same constitut which give the common a power to check the king by withhold the suppli give afterward the king a power to check the common by empow him to reject their other bill it again suppos that the king is wiser than those whom it ha alreadi suppos to be wiser than him a mere absurd there is someth exceedingli ridicul in the composit of monarchi it first exclud a man from the mean of inform yet empow him to act in case where the highest judgment is requir the state of a king shut him from the world yet the busi of a king requir him to know it thoroughli wherefor the differ part by unnatur oppos and destroi each other prove the whole charact to be absurd and useless some writer have explain the english constitut thu the king sai thei is on the peopl anoth the peer ar an hous in behalf of the king the common in behalf of the peopl but thi hath all the distinct of a hous divid against itself and though the express be pleasantli arrang yet when examin thei appear idl and ambigu and it will alwai happen that the nicest construct that word ar capabl of when appli to the descript of some thing which either cannot exist or is too incomprehens to be within the compass of descript will be word of sound onli and though thei mai amus the ear thei cannot inform the mind for thi explan includ a previou question viz how came the king by a power which the peopl ar afraid to trust and alwai oblig to check such a power could not be the gift of a wise peopl neither can ani power which need check be from god yet the provis which the constitut make suppos such a power to exist but the provis is unequ to the task the mean either cannot or will not accomplish the end and the whole affair is a felo de se for as the greater weight will alwai carri up the less and as all the wheel of a machin ar put in motion by on it onli remain to know which power in the constitut ha the most weight for that will govern and though the other or a part of them mai clog or as the phrase is check the rapid of it motion yet so long as thei cannot stop it their endeavor will be ineffectu the first move power will at last have it wai and what it want in speed is suppli by time that the crown is thi overbear part in the english constitut need not be mention and that it deriv it whole consequ mere from be the giver of place and pension is selfevid wherefor though we have been wise enough to shut and lock a door against absolut monarchi we at the same time have been foolish enough to put the crown in possess of the kei the prejudic of englishmen in favour of their own govern by king lord and common aris as much or more from nation pride than reason individu ar undoubtedli safer in england than in some other countri but the will of the king is as much the law of the land in britain as in franc with thi differ that instead of proceed directli from hi mouth it is hand to the peopl under the more formid shape of an act of parliament for the fate of charl the first hath onli made king more subtlenot more just wherefor lai asid all nation pride and prejudic in favour of mode and form the plain truth is that it is wholli ow to the constitut of the peopl and not to the constitut of the govern that the crown is not as oppress in england as in turkei an inquiri into the constitut error in the english form of govern is at thi time highli necessari for as we ar never in a proper condit of do justic to other while we continu under the influenc of some lead partial so neither ar we capabl of do it to ourselv while we remain fetter by ani obstin prejudic and as a man who is attach to a prostitut is unfit to choos or judg of a wife so ani prepossess in favour of a rotten constitut of govern will disabl us from discern a good on of monarchi and hereditari success mankind be origin equal in the order of creation the equal could onli be destroi by some subsequ circumst the distinct of rich and poor mai in a great measur be account for and that without have recours to the harsh ill sound name of oppress and avaric oppress is often the consequ but seldom or never the mean of rich and though avaric will preserv a man from be necessit poor it gener make him too timor to be wealthi but there is anoth and greater distinct for which no truli natur or religi reason can be assign and that is the distinct of men into king and subject male and femal ar the distinct of natur good and bad the distinct of heaven but how a race of men came into the world so exalt abov the rest and distinguish like some new speci is worth enquir into and whether thei ar the mean of happi or of miseri to mankind in the earli ag of the world accord to the scriptur chronolog there were no king the consequ of which wa there were no war it is the pride of king which throw mankind into confus holland without a king hath enjoi more peac for thi last centuri than ani of the monarchi govern in europ antiqu favor the same remark for the quiet and rural live of the first patriarch hath a happi someth in them which vanish awai when we come to the histori of jewish royalti govern by king wa first introduc into the world by the heathen from whom the children of israel copi the custom it wa the most prosper invent the devil ever set on foot for the promot of idolatri the heathen paid divin honor to their deceas king and the christian world hath improv on the plan by do the same to their live on how impiou is the titl of sacr majesti appli to a worm who in the midst of hi splendor is crumbl into dust as the exalt on man so greatli abov the rest cannot be justifi on the equal right of natur so neither can it be defend on the author of scriptur for the will of the almighti as declar by gideon and the prophet samuel expressli disapprov of govern by king all antimonarch part of scriptur have been veri smoothli gloss over in monarch govern but thei undoubtedli merit the attent of countri which have their govern yet to form render unto c sar the thing which ar c sar is the scriptur doctrin of court yet it is no support of monarch govern for the jew at that time were without a king and in a state of vassalag to the roman near three thousand year pass awai from the mosaic account of the creation till the jew under a nation delus request a king till then their form of govern except in extraordinari case where the almighti interpos wa a kind of republ administr by a judg and the elder of the tribe king thei had none and it wa held sin to acknowledg ani be under that titl but the lord of host and when a man serious reflect on the idolatr homag which is paid to the person of king he need not wonder that the almighti ever jealou of hi honor should disapprov of a form of govern which so impious invad the prerog of heaven monarchi is rank in scriptur as on of the sin of the jew for which a curs in reserv is denounc against them the histori of that transact is worth attend to the children of israel be oppress by the midianit gideon march against them with a small armi and victori thro the divin interposit decid in hi favour the jew elat with success and attribut it to the generalship of gideon propos make him a king sai rule thou over us thou and thy son and thy son son here wa temptat in it fullest extent not a kingdom onli but an hereditari on but gideon in the pieti of hi soul repli i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you word need not be more explicit gideon doth not declin the honor but denieth their right to give it neither doth he compliment them with invent declar of hi thank but in the posit stile of a prophet charg them with disaffect to their proper sovereign the king of heaven about on hundr and thirti year after thi thei fell again into the same error the hanker which the jew had for the idolatr custom of the heathen is someth exceedingli unaccount but so it wa that lai hold of the misconduct of samuel two son who were entrust with some secular concern thei came in an abrupt and clamor manner to samuel sai behold thou art old and thy son walk not in thy wai now make us a king to judg us like all other nation and here we cannot but observ that their motiv were bad viz that thei might be like unto other nation ie the heathen wherea their true glori laid in be as much unlik them as possibl but the thing displeas samuel when thei said give us a king to judg us and samuel prai unto the lord and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voic of the peopl in all that thei sai unto thee for thei have not reject thee but thei have reject me that i should not reign over them accord to all the work which thei have done sinc the dai that i brought them up out of egypt even unto thi dai wherewith thei have forsaken me and serv other god so do thei also unto thee now therefor hearken unto their voic howbeit protest solemnli unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them ie not of ani particular king but the gener manner of the king of the earth whom israel wa so eagerli copi after and notwithstand the great distanc of time and differ of manner the charact is still in fashion and samuel told all the word of the lord unto the peopl that ask of him a king and he said thi shall be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your son and appoint them for himself for hi chariot and to be hi horsemen and some shall run befor hi chariot thi descript agre with the present mode of impress men and he will appoint him captain over thousand and captain over fifti and will set them to ear hi ground and to reap hi harvest and to make hi instrument of war and instrument of hi chariot and he will take your daughter to be confectionari and to be cook and to be baker thi describ the expenc and luxuri as well as the oppress of king and he will take your field and your oliv yard even the best of them and give them to hi servant and he will take the tenth of your feed and of your vineyard and give them to hi offic and to hi servant by which we see that briberi corrupt and favorit ar the stand vice of king and he will take the tenth of your men servant and your maid servant and your goodliest young men and your ass and put them to hi work and he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be hi servant and ye shall cry out in that dai becaus of your king which ye shall have chosen and the lord will not hear you in that dai thi account for the continu of monarchi neither do the charact of the few good king which have live sinc either sanctifi the titl or blot out the sin of the origin the high encomium given of david take no notic of him offici as a king but onli as a man after god own heart nevertheless the peopl refus to obei the voic of samuel and thei said nai but we will have a king over us that we mai be like all the nation and that our king mai judg us and go out befor us and fight our battl samuel continu to reason with them but to no purpos he set befor them their ingratitud but all would not avail and see them fulli bent on their folli he cri out i will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain which then wa a punish be in the time of wheat harvest that ye mai perceiv and see that your wicked is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in ask you a king so samuel call unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that dai and all the peopl greatli fear the lord and samuel and all the peopl said unto samuel prai for thy servant unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have ad unto our sin thi evil to ask a king these portion of scriptur ar direct and posit thei admit of no equivoc construct that the almighti hath here enter hi protest against monarch govern is true or the scriptur is fals and a man hath good reason to believ that there is as much of kingcraft as priestcraft in withhold the scriptur from the public in popish countri for monarchi in everi instanc is the poperi of govern to the evil of monarchi we have ad that of hereditari success and as the first is a degrad and lessen of ourselv so the second claim as a matter of right is an insult and an imposit on poster for all men be origin equal no on by birth could have a right to set up hi own famili in perpetu prefer to all other for ever and though himself might deserv some decent degre of honor of hi cotemporari yet hi descend might be far too unworthi to inherit them on of the strongest natur proof of the folli of hereditari right in king is that natur disapprov it otherwis she would not so frequent turn it into ridicul by give mankind an ass for a lion secondli as no man at first could possess ani other public honor than were bestow upon him so the giver of those honor could have no power to give awai the right of poster and though thei might sai we choos you for our head thei could not without manifest injustic to their children sai that your children and your children children shall reign over our for ever becaus such an unwis unjust unnatur compact might perhap in the next success put them under the govern of a rogu or a fool most wise men in their privat sentiment have ever treat hereditari right with contempt yet it is on of those evil which when onc establish is not easili remov mani submit from fear other from superstit and the more power part share with the king the plunder of the rest thi is suppos the present race of king in the world to have had an honor origin wherea it is more than probabl that could we take off the dark cover of antiqu and trace them to their first rise that we should find the first of them noth better than the princip ruffian of some restless gang whose savag manner or preemin in subtil obtain him the titl of chief among plunder and who by increas in power and extend hi depred overaw the quiet and defenceless to purchas their safeti by frequent contribut yet hi elector could have no idea of give hereditari right to hi descend becaus such a perpetu exclus of themselv wa incompat with the free and unrestrain principl thei profess to live by wherefor hereditari success in the earli ag of monarchi could not take place as a matter of claim but as someth casual or compliment but as few or no record were extant in those dai and tradit histori stuf with fabl it wa veri easi after the laps of a few gener to trump up some superstiti tale conveni time mahomet like to cram hereditari right down the throat of the vulgar perhap the disord which threaten or seem to threaten on the deceas of a leader and the choic of a new on for elect among ruffian could not be veri orderli induc mani at first to favor hereditari pretens by which mean it happen as it hath happen sinc that what at first wa submit to as a conveni wa afterward claim as a right england sinc the conquest hath known some few good monarch but groan beneath a much larger number of bad on yet no man in hi sens can sai that their claim under william the conqueror is a veri honor on a french bastard land with an arm banditti and establish himself king of england against the consent of the nativ is in plain term a veri paltri rascal originalit certainli hath no divin in it howev it is needless to spend much time in expos the folli of hereditari right if there ar ani so weak as to believ it let them promiscu worship the ass and lion and welcom i shall neither copi their humil nor disturb their devot yet i should be glad to ask how thei suppos king came at first the question admit but of three answer viz either by lot by elect or by usurp if the first king wa taken by lot it establish a preced for the next which exclud hereditari success saul wa by lot yet the success wa not hereditari neither doe it appear from that transact there wa ani intent it ever should if the first king of ani countri wa by elect that likewis establish a preced for the next for to sai that the right of all futur gener is taken awai by the act of the first elector in their choic not onli of a king but of a famili of king for ever hath no parrallel in or out of scriptur but the doctrin of origin sin which suppos the free will of all men lost in adam and from such comparison and it will admit of no other hereditari success can deriv no glori for as in adam all sin and as in the first elector all men obei as in the on all mankind were subject to satan and in the other to sovereignti as our innoc wa lost in the first and our author in the last and as both disabl us from reassum some former state and privileg it unanswer follow that origin sin and hereditari success ar parellel dishonor rank inglori connexion yet the most subtil sophist cannot produc a juster simil as to usurp no man will be so hardi as to defend it and that william the conqueror wa an usurp is a fact not to be contradict the plain truth is that the antiqu of english monarchi will not bear look into but it is not so much the absurd as the evil of hereditari success which concern mankind did it ensur a race of good and wise men it would have the seal of divin author but as it open a door to the foolish the wick and the improp it hath in it the natur of oppress men who look upon themselv born to reign and other to obei soon grow insol select from the rest of mankind their mind ar earli poison by import and the world thei act in differ so materi from the world at larg that thei have but littl opportun of know it true interest and when thei succe to the govern ar frequent the most ignor and unfit of ani throughout the dominion anoth evil which attend hereditari success is that the throne is subject to be possess by a minor at ani ag all which time the regenc act under the cover of a king have everi opportun and induc to betrai their trust the same nation misfortun happen when a king worn out with ag and infirm enter the last stage of human weak in both these case the public becom a prei to everi miscreant who can tamper successfulli with the folli either of ag or infanc the most plausibl plea which hath ever been offer in favour of hereditari success is that it preserv a nation from civil war and were thi true it would be weighti wherea it is the most barefac falsiti ever impos upon mankind the whole histori of england disown the fact thirti king and two minor have reign in that distract kingdom sinc the conquest in which time there have been includ the revolut no less than eight civil war and nineteen rebellion wherefor instead of make for peac it make against it and destroi the veri foundat it seem to stand on the contest for monarchi and success between the hous of york and lancast laid england in a scene of blood for mani year twelv pitch battl besid skirmish and sieg were fought between henri and edward twice wa henri prison to edward who in hi turn wa prison to henri and so uncertain is the fate of war and the temper of a nation when noth but person matter ar the ground of a quarrel that henri wa taken in triumph from a prison to a palac and edward oblig to fly from a palac to a foreign land yet as sudden transit of temper ar seldom last henri in hi turn wa driven from the throne and edward recal to succe him the parliament alwai follow the strongest side thi contest began in the reign of henri the sixth and wa not entir extinguish till henri the seventh in whom the famili were unit includ a period of year viz from to in short monarchi and success have laid not thi or that kingdom onli but the world in blood and ash ti a form of govern which the word of god bear testimoni against and blood will attend it if we inquir into the busi of a king we shall find that in some countri thei have none and after saunter awai their live without pleasur to themselv or advantag to the nation withdraw from the scene and leav their successor to

befor us and fight our battl but in countri where he is neither a judg nor a gener as in england a man would be puzzl to know what is hi busi the nearer ani govern approach to a republ the less busi there is for a king it is somewhat difficult to find a proper name for the govern of england sir william meredith call it a republ but in it present state it is unworthi of the name becaus the corrupt influenc of the crown by have all the place in it dispos hath so effectu swallow up the power and eaten out the virtu of the hous of common the republican part in the constitut that the govern of

glori in viz the liberti of choos a hous of common from out of their own bodyand it is easi to see that when republican virtu fail slaveri ensu why is the constitut of england sickli but becaus monarchi hath poison the republ the crown hath engross the common in england a king hath littl more to do than to make war and give awai place which in plain term is to impoverish the nation and set

she did not protect us from our enemi on our account but from her enemi on her own account from those who had no quarrel with us on ani other account and who will alwai be our enemi on the same account let britain wave her pretens to the contin or the contin throw off the depend and we should be at peac with franc and spain were thei at war with britain the miseri of hanov last war ought to warn us against connexion it ha late been assert in parliament that the coloni have no relat to each other but through the parent countri ie that pennsylvania and the jersei and so on for the rest ar sister coloni by the wai of england thi is certainli a veri roundabout wai of prove relationship but it is the nearest and onli true wai of prove enemyship if i mai so call it franc and spain never were nor perhap ever will be our enemi as american but as our be the subject of greatbritain but britain is the parent countri sai some then the more shame upon her conduct even brute do not devour their young nor savag make war upon their famili wherefor the assert if true turn to her reproach but it happen not to be true or onli partli so and the phrase parent or mother countri hath been jesuit adopt by the king and hi parasit with a low papist design of gain an unfair bia on the credul weak of our mind europ and not england is the parent countri of america thi new world hath been the asylum for the persecut lover of civil and religi liberti from everi part of europ hither have thei fled not from the tender embrac of the mother but from the cruelti of the monster and it is so far true of england that the same tyranni which drove the first emigr from home pursu their descend still in thi extens quarter of the globe we forget the narrow limit of three hundr and sixti mile the extent of england and carri our friendship on a larger scale we claim brotherhood with everi european christian and triumph in the generos of the sentiment it is pleasant to observ by what regular gradat we surmount the forc of local prejudic as we enlarg our acquaint with the world a man born in ani town in england divid into parish will natur associ most with hi fellow parishion becaus their interest in mani case will be common and distinguish him by the name of neighbour if he meet him but a few mile from home he drop the narrow idea of a street and salut him by the name of townsman if he travel out of the counti and meet him in ani other he forget the minor divis of street and town and call him countryman ie countyman but if in their foreign excurs thei should associ in franc or ani other part of europ their local remembr would be enlarg into that of englishmen and by a just pariti of reason all european meet in america or ani other quarter of the globe ar countrymen for england holland germani or sweden when compar with the whole stand in the same place on the larger scale which the divis of street town and counti do on the smaller on distinct too limit for continent mind not on third of the inhabit even of thi provinc ar of english descent wherefor i reprob the phrase of parent or mother countri appli to england onli as be fals selfish narrow and ungener but admit that we were all of english descent what doe it amount to noth britain be now an open enemi extinguish everi other name and titl and to sai that reconcili is our duti is truli farcic the first king of england of the present line william the conqueror wa a frenchman and half the peer of england ar descend from the same countri therefor by the same method of reason england ought to be govern by franc much hath been said of the unit strength of britain and the coloni that in conjunct thei might bid defianc to the world but thi is mere presumpt the fate of war is uncertain neither do the express mean ani thing for thi contin would never suffer itself to be drain of inhabit to support the british arm in either asia africa or europ besid what have we to do with set the world at defianc our plan is commerc and that well attend to will secur us the peac and friendship of all europ becaus it is the interest of all europ to have america a free port her trade will alwai be a protect and her barren of gold and silver secur her from invad i challeng the warmest advoc for reconcili to shew a singl advantag that thi contin can reap by be connect with great britain i repeat the challeng not a singl advantag is deriv our corn will fetch it price in ani market in europ and our import good must be paid for bui them where we will but the injuri and disadvantag we sustain by that connect ar without number and our duti to mankind at larg as well as to ourselv instruct us to renounc the allianc becaus ani submiss to or depend on greatbritain tend directli to involv thi contin in european war and quarrel and set us at varianc with nation who would otherwis seek our friendship and against whom we have neither anger nor complaint as europ is our market for trade we ought to form no partial connect with ani part of it it is the true interest of america to steer clear of european content which she never can do while by her depend on britain she is made the makeweight in the scale of british polit europ is too thickli plant with kingdom to be long at peac and whenev a war break out between england and ani foreign power the trade of america goe to ruin becaus of her connect with britain the next war mai not turn out like the last and should it not the advoc for reconcili now will be wish for separ then becaus neutral in that case would be a safer convoi than a man of war everi thing that is right or natur plead for separ the blood of the slain the weep voic of natur cri ti time to part even the distanc at which the almighti hath place england and america is a strong and natur proof that the author of the on over the other wa never the design of heaven the time likewis at which the contin wa discov add weight to the argument and the manner in which it wa peopl encreas the forc of it the reform wa preced by the discoveri of america as if the almighti gracious meant to open a sanctuari to the persecut in futur year when home should afford neither friendship nor safeti the author of greatbritain over thi contin is a form of govern which sooner or later must have an end and a seriou mind can draw no true pleasur by look forward under the pain and posit convict that what he call the present constitut is mere temporari as parent we can have no joi know that thi govern is not suffici last to ensur ani thing which we mai bequeath to poster and by a plain method of argument as we ar run the next gener into debt we ought to do the work of it otherwis we us them meanli and pitifulli in order to discov the line of our duti rightli we should take our children in our hand and fix our station a few year farther into life that emin will present a prospect which a few present fear and prejudic conceal from our sight though i would carefulli avoid give unnecessari offenc yet i am inclin to believ that all those who espous the doctrin of reconcili mai be includ within the follow descript interest men who ar not to be trust weak men who cannot see prejud men who will not see and a certain set of moder men who think better of the european world than it deserv and thi last class by an illjudg deliber will be the caus of more calam to thi contin than all the other three it is the good fortun of mani to live distant from the scene of sorrow the evil is not suffici brought to their door to make them feel the precari with which all american properti is possess but let our imagin transport us for a few moment to boston that seat of wretched will teach us wisdom and instruct us for ever to renounc a power in whom we can have no trust the inhabit of that unfortun citi who but a few month ago were in eas and affluenc have now no other altern than to stai and starv or turn out to beg endang by the fire of their friend if thei continu within the citi and plunder by the soldieri if thei leav it in their present condit thei ar prison without the hope of redempt and in a gener attack for their relief thei would be expos to the furi of both armi men of passiv temper look somewhat lightli over the offenc of britain and still hope for the best ar apt to call out come come we shall be friend again for all thi but examin the passion and feel of mankind bring the doctrin of reconcili to the touchston of natur and then tell me whether you can hereaft love honour and faithfulli serv the power that hath carri fire and sword into your land if you cannot do all these then ar you onli deceiv yourselv and by your delai bring ruin upon poster your futur connect with britain whom you can neither love nor honour will be forc

justifi and without which we should be incap of discharg the social duti of life or enjoi the felic of it i mean not to exhibit horror for the purpos of provok reveng but to awaken us from fatal and unmanli slumber that we mai pursu determin some fix object it is not in the power of britain or of europ to conquer america if she do not conquer herself by delai and timid the present winter is worth an ag if rightli emploi but if lost or neglect the whole contin will partak of the misfortun and there is no punish which that man will not deserv be he who or what or where he will that mai be the mean of sacrif a season so preciou and us it is repugn to reason to the univers order of thing to all exampl from former ag to suppos that thi contin can longer remain subject to ani extern power the most sanguin in britain doe not think so the utmost stretch of human wisdom cannot at thi time compass a plan short of separ which can promis the contin even a year secur reconcili is now a fallaci dream natur hath desert the connexion and art cannot suppli her place for as milton wise express never can true reconcil grow where wound of deadli hate have pierc so deep everi quiet method for peac hath been ineffectu our prayer have been reject with disdain and onli tend to convinc us that noth flatter vaniti or confirm obstinaci in king more than repeat petitioningand noth hath contribut more than that veri measur to make the king of europ absolut wit denmark and sweden wherefor sinc noth but blow will do for god sake let us come to a final separ and not leav the next gener to be cut throat under the violat unmean name of parent and child to sai thei will never attempt it again is idl and visionari we thought so at the repeal of the stampact yet a year or two undeceiv us as well mai we suppos that nation which have been onc defeat will never renew the quarrel as to govern matter it is not in the power of britain to do thi contin justic the busi of it will soon be too weighti and intric to be manag with ani toler degre of conveni by a power so distant from us and so veri ignor of us for if thei cannot conquer us thei cannot govern us to be alwai run three or four thousand mile with a tale or a petit wait four or five month for an answer which when obtain requir five or six more to explain it in will in a few year be look upon as folli and childishnessther wa a time when it wa proper and there is a proper time for it to ceas small island not capabl of protect themselv ar the proper object for kingdom to take under their care but there is someth veri absurd in suppos a contin to be perpetu govern by an island in no instanc hath natur made the satellit larger than it primari planet and as england and america with respect to each other revers the common order of natur it is evid thei belong to differ system england to europ america to itself i am not induc by motiv of pride parti or resent to espous the doctrin of separ and independ i am clearli posit and conscienti persuad that it is the true interest of thi contin to be so that everi thing short of that is mere patchwork that it can afford no last felicitythat it is leav the sword to our children and shrink back at a time when a littl more a littl farther would have render thi contin the glori of the earth as britain hath not manifest the least inclin toward a compromis we mai be assur that no term can be obtain worthi the accept of the contin or ani wai equal to the expenc of blood and treasur we have been alreadi put to the object contend for ought alwai to bear some just proport to the expenc the remov of north or the whole detest junto is a matter unworthi the million we have expend a temporari stoppag of trade wa an inconveni which would have suffici ballanc the repeal of all the act complain of had such repeal been obtain but if the whole contin must take up arm if everi man must be a soldier it is scarc worth our while to fight against a contempt ministri onli dearli dearli do we pai for the repeal of the act if that is all we fight for for in a just estim it is as great a folli to pai a bunkerhil price for law as for land as i have alwai consid the independ of thi contin as an event which sooner or later must arriv so from the late rapid progress of the contin to matur the event could not be far off wherefor on the break out of hostil it wa not worth the while to have disput a matter which time would have final redress unless we meant to be in earnest otherwis it is like wast an estat on a suit at law to regul the trespass of a tenant whose leas is just expir no man wa a warmer wisher for reconcili than myself befor the fatal nineteenth of april but the moment the event of that dai wa made known i reject the harden sullen temper pharaoh of england for ever and disdain the wretch that with the pretend titl of father of hi peopl can unfeelingli hear of their slaughter and composedli sleep with their blood upon hi soul but admit that matter were now made up what would be the event i answer the ruin of the contin and that for sever reason first the power of govern still remain in the hand of the king he will have a neg over the whole legisl of thi contin and as he hath shewn himself such an inveter enemi to liberti and discov such a thirst for arbitrari power is he or is he not a proper man to sai to these coloni you shall make no law but what i pleas and is there ani inhabit in america so ignor as not to know that accord to what is call the present constitut that thi contin can make no law but what the king give leav to and is there ani man so unwis as not to see that consid what ha happen he will suffer no law to be made here but such as suit hi purpos we mai be as effectu enslav by the want of law in america as by submit to law made for us in england after matter ar made up as it is call can there be ani doubt but the whole power of the crown will be exert to keep thi contin as low and humbl as possibl instead of go forward we shall go backward or be perpetu quarrel or ridicul petitioningw ar alreadi greater than the king wish us to be and will he not hereaft endeavour to make us less to bring the matter to on point is the power who is jealou of our prosper a proper power to govern us whoever sai no to thi question is an independ for independ mean no more than whether we shall make our own law or whether the king the greatest enemi thi contin hath or can have shall tell us there shall be no law but such as i like but the king you will sai ha a neg in england the peopl there can make no law without hi consent in point of right and good order there is someth veri ridicul that a youth of twentyon which hath often happen shall sai to sever million of peopl older and wiser than himself i forbid thi or that act of your to be law but in thi place i declin thi sort of repli though i will never ceas to expos the absurd of it and onli answer that england be the king resid and america not so make quit anoth case the king neg here is ten time more danger and fatal than it can be in england for there he will scarc refus hi consent to a bill for put england into as strong a state of defenc as possibl and in america he would never suffer such a bill to be pass america is onli a secondari object in the system of british polit england consult the good of thi countri no farther than it answer her own purpos wherefor her own interest lead her to suppress the growth of our in everi case which doth not promot her advantag or in the least interfer with it a pretti state we should soon be in under such a secondhand govern consid what ha happen men do not chang from enemi to friend by the alter of a name and in order to shew that reconcili now is a danger doctrin i affirm that it would be polici in the king at thi time to repeal the act for the sake of reinstat himself in the govern of the provinc in order that he mai accomplish by craft and subtilti in the long run what he cannot do by forc and violenc in the short on reconcili and ruin ar nearli relat secondli that as even the best term which we can expect to obtain can amount to no more than a temporari expedi or a kind of govern by guardianship which can last no longer than till the coloni come of ag so the gener face and state of thing in the interim will be unsettl and unpromis emigr of properti will not choos to come to a countri whose form of govern hang but by a thread and who is everi dai totter on the brink of commot and disturb and number of the present inhabit would lai hold of the interv to dispens of their effect and quit the contin but the most power of all argument is that noth but independ ie a continent form of govern can keep the peac of the contin and preserv it inviol from civil war i dread the event of a reconcili with britain now as it is more than probabl that it will be follow by a revolt somewher or other the consequ of which mai be far more fatal than all the malic of britain thousand ar alreadi ruin by british barbar thousand more will probabl suffer the same fate those men have other feel than us who have noth suffer all thei now possess is liberti what thei befor enjoi is sacrif to it servic and have noth more to lose thei disdain submiss besid the gener temper of the coloni toward a british govern will be like that of a youth who is nearli out of hi time thei will care veri littl about her and a govern which cannot preserv the peac is no govern at all and in that case we pai our monei for noth and prai what is it that britain can do whose power will be wholli on paper should a civil tumult break out the veri dai after reconcili i have heard some men sai mani of whom i believ spoke without think that thei dread an independ fear that it would produc civil war it is but seldom that our first thought ar truli correct and that is the case here for there ar ten time more to dread from a patch up connexion than from independ i make the suffer case my own and i protest that were i driven from hous and home my properti destroi and my circumst ruin that as man sensibl of injuri i could never relish the doctrin of reconcili or consid myself bound therebi the coloni have manifest such a spirit of good order and obedi to continent govern as is suffici to make everi reason person easi and happi on that head no man can assign the least pretenc for hi fear on ani other ground than such as ar truli childish and ridicul viz that on coloni will be strive for superior over anoth where there ar no distinct there can be no superior perfect equal afford no temptat the republ of europ ar all and we mai sai alwai in peac holland and swisserland ar without war foreign or domest monarch govern it is true ar never long at rest the crown itself is a temptat to enterpr ruffian at home and that degre of pride and insol ever attend on regal author swell into a ruptur with foreign power in instanc where a republican govern by be form on more natur principl would negoci the mistak if there is ani true caus of fear respect independ it is becaus no plan is yet laid down men do not see their wai out wherefor as an open into that busi i offer the follow hint at the same time modestli affirm that i have no other opinion of them myself than that thei mai be the mean of give rise to someth better could the straggl thought of individu be collect thei would frequent form materi for wise and abl men to improv into us matter let the assembl be annual with a presid onli the represent more equal their busi wholli domest and subject to the author of a

in congress will be at least each congress to sit and to choos a presid by the follow method when the deleg ar met let a coloni be taken from the whole thirteen coloni by lot after which let the whole congress choos by ballot a presid from out of the deleg of that provinc in the next congress let a coloni be taken by lot from twelv onli omit that coloni from which the presid wa taken in the former congress and so proceed on till the whole thirteen shall have had their proper rotat and in order that noth mai pass into a law but what is satisfactorili just not less than three fifth of the congress to be call a majorityh that will promot discord under a govern so equal form as thi would have join lucif in hi revolt but as there is a peculiar delicaci from whom or in what manner thi busi

of america with some miscellan reflexion i have never met with a man either in england or america who hath not confess hi opinion that a separ between the countri would take place on time or other and there is no instanc in which we have shewn less judgment than in endeavour to describ what we call the ripe or fit of the contin for independ as all men allow the measur and vari onli in their opinion of the time let us in order to remov mistak take a gener survei of thing and endeavour if possibl to find out the veri time but we need not go far the inquiri ceas at onc for the time hath found us the gener concurr the gloriou union of all thing prove the fact it is not in number but in uniti that our great strength li yet our present number ar suffici to repel the forc of all the world the contin hath at thi time the largest bodi of arm and disciplin men of ani power under heaven and is just arriv at that pitch of strength in which no singl coloni is abl to support itself and the whole when unit can accomplish the matter and either more or less than thi might be fatal in it effect our land forc is alreadi suffici and as to naval affair we cannot be insens that britain would never suffer an american man of war to be built while the contin remain in her hand wherefor we should be no forward an hundr year henc in that branch than we ar now but the truth is we should be less so becaus the timber of the countri is everi dai diminish and that which will remain at last will be far off and difficult to procur were the contin crowd with inhabit her suffer under the present circumst would be intoler the more sea port town we had the more should we have both to defend and to lose our present number ar so happili proport to our want that no man need be idl the diminut of

nation debt is a nation bond and when it bear no interest is in no case a grievanc britain is oppress with a debt of upward of on hundr and forti million sterl for which she pai upward of four million interest and as a compens for her debt she ha a larg navi america is without a debt and without a navi yet for the twentieth part of the english nation debt could have a navi as larg again the navi of

emerg none at all wherefor if we must hereaft protect ourselv why not do it for ourselv why do it for anoth the english list of ship of war is long and formid but not a tenth part of them ar at ani on time fit for servic number of them not in be yet their name ar pompous continu in the list if onli a plank be left of the ship and not a fifth part of such as ar fit for servic can be spare on ani on station at on time the east and west indi mediterranean africa and other part over which britain extend her claim make larg demand upon her navi from a mixtur of prejudic and inattent we have contract a fals notion respect the navi of england and have talk as if we should have the whole of it to encount at onc and for that reason suppos that we must have on as larg which not be instantli practic have been made us of by a set of disguis tori to discourag our begin thereon noth can be farther from truth than thi for if america had onli a twentieth part of the naval forc of britain she would be by far an over match for her becaus as we neither have nor claim ani foreign dominion our whole forc would be emploi on our own coast where we should in the long run have two to on the advantag of those who had three or four thousand mile to sail over befor thei could attack us and the same distanc to return in order to refit and recruit and although britain by her fleet hath a check over our trade to europ we have as larg a on over her trade to the west indi which by lai in the neighbourhood of the contin is entir at it merci some method might be fallen on to keep up a naval forc in time of peac if we should not judg it necessari to support a constant navi if premium were to be given to merchant to build and emploi in their servic ship mount with twenti thirti forti or fifti gun the premium to be in proport to the loss of bulk to the merchant fifti or sixti of those ship with a few guardship on constant duti would keep up a suffici navi and that without burden ourselv with the

favour of independ we ar suffici numer and were we more so we might be less unit it is a matter worthi of observ that the more a countri is peopl the smaller their armi ar in militari number the

form in misfortun ar of all other the most last and unalter our present union is mark with both these charact we ar young and we have been distress but our concord hath withstood our troubl and fix a memor area for poster to glori in the present time likewis is that peculiar time which never happen to a nation but onc viz the time of form itself into a govern most nation have let slip the opportun and by that mean have been compel to receiv law from their conqueror instead of make law for themselv first thei had a king and then a form of govern wherea the articl or charter of govern should be form first and men deleg to execut them afterward but from the error of other nation let us learn wisdom and lai hold of the present opportunityto begin govern at the right end when william the conqueror subdu england he gave them law at the point of the sword and until we consent that the seat of govern in america be legal and authorit occupi we shall be in danger of have it fill by some fortun ruffian who mai treat us in the same manner and then where will be our freedom where our properti as to religion i hold it to be the indispens duti of all govern to protect all conscienti professor thereof and i know of no other busi which govern hath to do therewith let a man throw asid that narrow of soul that selfish of principl which the niggard of all profess ar so unwil to part

thi liber principl i look on the variou denomin among us to be like children of the same famili differ onli in what is call their christian name in page forti i threw out a few thought on the

mention the necess of a larg and equal represent and there is no polit matter which more deserv our attent a small number of elector or a small number of repres ar equal danger but if the number of the repres be not onli small but unequ the danger is increas as an instanc of thi i mention the follow when the associ petit wa befor the hous of assembl of pennsylvania twentyeight member onli were

shall never be without a congress everi well wisher to good order must own that the mode for choos member of that bodi deserv consider and i put it as a question to those who make a studi of mankind whether represent and elect is not too great a power for on and the same bodi of men to possess when we ar plan for poster we ought to rememb that virtu is not hereditari it is from our enemi that we often gain excel maxim and ar frequent surpris into reason by their mistak mr cornwal on of the lord of the treasuri treat the petit of the new york assembl with contempt becaus that hous he said consist but of twentysix member which trifl number he argu could not with decenc be put for the whole we thank him for hi involuntari honesti those who would fulli understand of what great consequ a larg and equal represent is to a state should read burgh polit disquisit to conclud howev strang it mai appear to some or howev unwil thei mai be to think so matter not but mani strong and strike reason mai be given to shew that noth can settl our affair so expediti as an open and determin declar for independ some of which ar firstit is the custom of nation when ani two ar at war for some other power not engag in the quarrel to step in as mediat and bring about the preliminari of a peac but while america call herself the subject of greatbritain no power howev well dispos she mai be can offer her mediat wherefor in our present state we mai quarrel on for ever secondlyit is unreason to suppos that franc or spain will give us ani kind of assist if we mean onli to make us of that assist for the purpos of repair the breach and strengthen the connect between britain and america becaus those power would be suffer by the consequ thirdlywhil we profess ourselv the subject of britain we must in the ey of foreign nation be consid as rebel the preced is somewhat danger to their peac for men to be in arm under the name of subject we on the spot can solv the paradox but to unit resist and subject requir an idea much too refin for common understand fourthlywer a manifesto to be publish and despatch to foreign court set forth the miseri we have endur and the peaceabl method we have ineffectu us for redress declar at the same time that not be abl ani longer to live happili or safe under the cruel disposit of the british court we had been driven to the necess of break off all connect with her at the same time assur all such court of our peaceabl disposit toward them and of our desir of enter into trade with them such a memori would produc more good effect to thi contin than if a ship were freight with petit to britain under our present denomin of british subject we can neither be receiv nor heard abroad the custom of all court is against us and will be so until by an independ we take rank with other nation these proceed mai at first appear strang and difficult but like all other step which we have alreadi pass over will in a littl time becom familiar and agreeabl and until an independ is declar the contin will feel itself like a man who continu put off some unpleas busi from dai to dai yet know it must be done hate to set about it wish it over and is continu haunt with the thought of it necess appendix sinc the public of the first edit of thi pamphlet or rather on the same dai on which it came out the king speech made it appear in thi citi had the spirit of propheci direct the birth of thi product it could not have brought it forth at a more season junctur or a more necessari time the bloodi minded of the on shew the necess of pursu the doctrin of the other men read by wai of reveng and the speech instead of terrifi prepar a wai for the manli principl of independ ceremoni and even silenc from whatev motiv thei mai aris have a hurt tendenc when thei give the least degre of counten to base and wick perform wherefor if thi maxim be admit it natur follow that the king speech as be a piec of finish villaini deserv and still deserv a gener execr both by the congress and the peopl yet as the domest tranquil of a nation depend greatli on the chastiti of what mai properli be call nation manner it is often better to pass some thing over in silent disdain than to make us of such new method of dislik as might introduc the least innov on that guardian of our peac and safeti and perhap it is chiefli ow to thi prudent delicaci that the king speech hath not befor now suffer a public execut the speech if it mai be call on is noth better than a wil audaci libel against the truth the common good and the exist of mankind and is a formal and pompou method of offer up human sacrific to the pride of tyrant but thi gener massacr of mankind is on of the privileg and the certain consequ of king for as natur know them not thei know not her and although thei ar be of our own creat thei know not us and ar becom the god of their creator the speech hath on good qualiti which is that it is not calcul to deceiv neither can we even if we would be deceiv by it brutal and tyranni appear on the face of it it leav us at no loss and everi line convinc even in the moment of read that he who hunt the wood for prei the nake and untutor indian is less a savag than the king of britain sir john dalrympl the put father of a whine jesuit piec fallaci call the address of the peopl of england to the inhabit of america hath perhap from a vain supposit that the peopl here were to be frighten at the pomp and descript of a king given though veri unwis on hi part the real charact of the present on but sai thi writer if you ar inclin to pai compliment to an administr which we do not complain of mean the marqui of rockingham at the repeal of the stamp act it is veri unfair in you to withhold them from that princ by whose nod alon thei were permit to do ani thing thi is toryism with a wit here is idolatri even without a mask and he who can calmli hear and digest such doctrin hath forfeit hi claim to rationalityan apost from the order of manhood and ought to be considereda on who hath not onli given up the proper digniti of man but sunk himself beneath the rank of anim and contempt crawl through the world like a worm howev it matter veri littl now what the king of england either sai or doe he hath wickedli broken through everi moral and human oblig trampl natur and conscienc beneath hi feet and by a steadi and constitut spirit of insol and cruelti procur for himself an univers hatr it is now the interest of america to provid for herself she hath alreadi a larg and young famili whom it is more her duti to take care of than to be grant awai her properti to support a power who is becom a reproach to the name of men and christiansy whose offic it is to watch over the moral of a nation of whatsoev sect or denomin ye ar of as well as ye who ar more immedi the guardian of the public liberti if ye wish to preserv your nativ countri uncontamin by european corrupt ye must in secret wish a separationbut leav the moral part to privat reflect i shall chiefli confin my farther remark to the follow head first that it is the interest of america to be separ from britain secondli which is the easiest and most practic plan reconcili or independ with some occasion remark in support of the first i could if i judg it proper produc the opinion of some of the ablest and most experienc men on thi contin and whose sentiment on that head ar not yet publicli known it is in realiti a selfevid posit for no nation in a state of foreign depend limit in it commerc and cramp and fetter in it legisl power can ever arriv at ani materi emin america doth not yet know what opul is and although the progress which she hath made stand unparallel in the histori of other nation it is but childhood compar with what she would be capabl of arriv at had she as she ought to have the legisl power in her own hand england is at thi time proudli covet what would do her no good were she to accomplish it and the contin hesit on a matter which will be her final ruin if neglect it is the commerc and not the conquest of america by which england is to be benefit and that would in a great measur continu were the countri as independ of each other as franc and spain becaus in mani articl neither can go to a better market but it is the independ of thi countri of britain or ani other which is now the main and onli object worthi of content and which like all other truth discov by necess will appear clearer and stronger everi dai first becaus it will come to that on time or other secondli becaus the longer it is delai the harder it will be to accomplish i have frequent amus myself both in public and privat compani with silent remark the speciou error of those who speak without reflect and among the mani which i have heard the follow seem the most gener viz that had thi ruptur happen forti or fifti year henc instead of now the contin would have been more abl to have shaken off the depend to which i repli that our militari abil at thi time aris from the experi gain in the last war and which in forti or fifti year time would have been total extinct the contin would not by that time have had a gener or even a militari offic left and we or those who mai succe us would have been as ignor of martial matter as the ancient indian and thi singl posit close attend to will unanswer prove that the present time is prefer to all other the argument turn thu at the conclus of the last war we had experi but want number and forti or fifti year henc we should have number without experi wherefor the proper point of time must be some particular point between the two extrem in which a suffici of the former remain and a proper increas of the latter is obtain and that point of time is the present time the reader will pardon thi digress as it doe not properli come under the head i first set out with and to which i again return by the follow posit viz should affair be patch up with britain and she to remain the govern and sovereign power of america which as matter ar now circumstanc is give up the point intir we shall depriv ourselv of the veri mean of sink the debt we have or mai contract the valu of the back land which some of the provinc ar clandestin depriv of by the unjust extent of the limit of canada valu onli at five pound sterl per hundr acr amount to upward of twentyf million pennsylvania currenc and the quitrent at on penni sterl per acr to two million yearli it is by the sale of those land that the debt mai be sunk without burthen to ani and the quitrent reserv thereon will alwai lessen and in time will wholli support the yearli expenc of govern it matter not how long the debt is in pai so that the land when sold be appli to the discharg of it and for the execut of which the congress for the time be will be the continent truste i proce now to the second head viz which is the easiest and most practic plan reconcili or independ with some occasion remark he who take natur for hi guid is not easili beaten out of hi argument and on that ground i answer generallythat independ be a singl simpl line contain within ourselv and reconcili a matter exceedingli perplex and complic and in which a treacher caprici court is to interfer give the answer without a doubt the present state of america is truli alarm to everi man who is capabl of reflexion without law without govern without ani other mode of power than what is found on and grant by courtesi held togeth by an unexampl concurr of sentiment which is nevertheless subject to chang and which everi secret enemi is endeavour to dissolv our present condit is legisl without law wisdom without a plan constitut without a name and what is strang astonish perfect independ contend for depend the instanc is without a preced the case never exist befor and who can tell what mai be the event the properti of no man is secur in the present unbrac system of thing the mind of the multitud is left at random and see no fix object befor them thei pursu such as fanci or opinion start noth is crimin there is no such thing as treason wherefor everi on think himself at liberti to act as he pleas the tori dare not have assembl offens had thei known that their live by that act were forfeit to the law of the state a line of distinct should be drawn between english soldier taken in battl and inhabit of america taken in arm the first ar prison but the latter traitor the on forfeit hi liberti the other hi head notwithstand our wisdom there is a visibl feebl in some of our proceed which give encourag to dissens the continent belt is too loos buckl and if someth is not done in time it will be too late to do ani thing and we shall fall into a state in which neither reconcili nor independ will be practic the king and hi worthless adher ar got at their old game of divid the contin and there ar not want among us printer who will be busi in spread speciou falsehood the art and hypocrit letter which appear a few month ago in two of the newyork paper and likewis in two other is an evid that there ar men who want either judgment or honesti it is easi get into hole and corner and talk of reconcili but do such men serious consid how difficult the task is and how danger it mai prove should the contin divid thereon do thei take within their view all the variou order of men whose situat and circumst as well as their own ar to be consid therein do thei put themselv in the place of the suffer whose all is alreadi gone and of the soldier who hath quit all for the defenc of hi countri if their ill judg moder be suit to their own privat situat onli regardless of other the event will convinc them that thei ar reckon without their host put us sai some on the foot we were on in sixtythre to which i answer the request is not now in the power of britain to compli with neither will she propos it but if it were and even should be grant i ask as a reason question by what mean is such a corrupt and faithless court to be kept to it engag anoth parliament nai even the present mai hereaft repeal the oblig on the pretenc of it be violent obtain or unwis grant and in that case where is our redressno go to law with nation cannon ar the barrist of crown and the sword not of justic but of war decid the suit to be on the foot of sixtythre it is not suffici that the law onli be put on the same state but that our circumst likewis be put on the same state our burnt and destroi town repair or built up our privat loss made good our public debt contract for defenc discharg otherwis we shall be million wors than we were at that enviabl period such a request had it been compli with a year ago would have won the heart and soul of the contin but now it is too late the rubicon is pass besid the take up arm mere to enforc the repeal of a pecuniari law seem as unwarrant by the divin law and as repugn to human feel as the take up arm to enforc obedi thereto the object on either side doth not justifi the mean for the live of men ar too valuabl to be cast awai on such trifl it is the violenc which is done and threaten to our person the destruct of our properti by an arm forc the invas of our countri by fire and sword which conscienti qualifi the us of arm and the instant in which such a mode of defenc becam necessari all subject to britain ought to have ceas and the independ of america should have been consid as date it ra from and publish by the first musket that wa fire against her thi line is a line of consist neither drawn by capric nor extend by ambit but produc by a chain of event of which the coloni were not the author i shall conclud these remark with the follow time and well intend hint we ought to reflect that there ar three differ wai by which an independ mai hereaft be effect and that on of those three will on dai or other be the fate of america viz by the legal voic of the peopl in congress by a militari power or by a mob it mai not alwai happen that our soldier ar citizen and the multitud a bodi of reason men virtu as i have alreadi remark is not hereditari neither is it perpetu should an independ be brought about by the first of those mean we have everi opportun and everi encourag befor us to form the noblest purest constitut on the face of the earth we have it in our power to begin the world over again a situat similar to the present hath not happen sinc the dai of noah until now the birthdai of a new world is at hand and a race of men perhap as numer as all europ contain ar to receiv their portion of freedom from the event of a few month the reflexion is awfuland in thi point of view how trifl how ridicul do the littl paltri cavel of a few weak or interest men appear when weigh against the busi of a world should we neglect the present favor and invit period and an independ be hereaft effect by ani other mean we must charg the consequ to ourselv or to those rather whose narrow and prejud soul ar habitu oppos the measur without either inquir or reflect there ar reason to be given in support of independ which men should rather privat think of than be publicli told of we ought not now to be debat whether we shall be independ or not but anxiou to accomplish it on a firm secur and honor basi and uneasi rather that it is not yet began upon everi dai convinc us of it necess even the tori if such be yet remain among us should of all men be the most solicit to promot it for as the appoint of committe at first protect them from popular rage so a wise and well establish form of govern will be the onli certain mean of continu it secur to them wherefor if thei have not virtu enough to be whig thei ought to have prudenc enough to wish for independ in short independ is the onli bond that can tye and keep us togeth we shall then see our object and our ear will be legal shut against the scheme of an intrigu as well as a cruel enemi we shall then too be on a proper foot to treat with britain for there is reason to conclud that the pride of that court will be less hurt by treat with the american state for term of peac than with those whom she denomin rebelli subject for term of accommod it is our delai it that encourag her to hope for conquest and our backward tend onli to prolong the war as we have without ani good effect therefrom withheld our trade to obtain a redress of our grievanc let us now try the altern by independantli redress them ourselv and then offer to open the trade the mercantil and reason part in england will be still with us becaus peac with trade is prefer to war without it and if thi offer be not accept other court mai be appli to on these ground i rest the matter and as no offer hath yet been made to refut the doctrin contain in the former edit of thi pamphlet it is a neg proof that either the doctrin cannot be refut or that the parti in favour of it ar too numer to be oppos wherefor instead of gaze at each other with suspici or doubt curios let each of us hold out to hi neighbour the hearti hand of friendship and unit in draw a line which like an act of oblivion shall buri in forget everi former dissens let the name of whig and tori be extinct and let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen an open

and honesti under the govern which god is pleas to set over us if these ar realli your principl why do ye not abid by them why do ye not leav that which ye call god work to be manag by himself these veri principl instruct you to wait with patienc and humil for the event of all public measur and to receiv that event as the divin will toward you wherefor what occas is there for your polit testimoni if you fulli believ what it contain and the veri publish it prove that either ye do not believ what ye profess or have not virtu enough to practis what ye believ the principl of quaker have a direct tendenc to make a man the quiet and inoffens subject of ani and everi govern which is set over him and if the set up and put down of king and govern is god peculiar prerog he most certainli will not be rob thereof by us wherefor the principl itself lead you to approv of everi thing which ever happen or mai happen to king as be hi work oliv cromwel thank you charl then di not by the hand of man and should the present proud imit of him come to the same untim end the writer and publish of the testimoni ar bound by the doctrin it contain to applaud the fact king ar not taken awai by miracl neither ar chang in govern brought about by ani other mean than such as ar common and human and such as we ar now us even the dispers of the jew though foretold by our saviour wa effect by arm wherefor as ye refus to be the mean on on side ye ought not to be meddler on the other but to wait the issu in silenc and unless ye can produc divin author to prove that the almighti who hath creat and place thi new world at the greatest distanc it could possibl stand east and west from everi part of the old doth nevertheless disapprov of it be independ of the corrupt and abandon court of britain unless i sai ye can shew thi how can ye on the ground of your principl justifi the excit and stir up the peopl firmli to unit in the abhorr of all such write and measur as evid a desir and design to break off the happi connexion we have hitherto enjoi with the kingdom of greatbritain and our just and necessari subordin to the king and those who ar lawfulli place in author under him what a slap of the face is here the men who in the veri paragraph befor have quietli and passiv resign up the order alter and dispos of king and govern into the hand of god ar now recal their principl and put in for a share of the busi is it possibl that the conclus which is here justli quot can ani wai follow from the doctrin laid down the inconsist is too glare not to be seen the absurd too great not to be laugh at and such as could onli have been made by those whose understand were darken by the narrow and crabbi spirit of a despair polit parti for ye ar not to be consid as the whole bodi of the quaker but onli as a faction and fraction part thereof here end the examin of your testimoni which i call upon no man to abhor as ye have done but onli to read and judg of fairli to which i subjoin the follow remark that the set up and put down of king most certainli mean the make him a king who is yet not so and the make him no king who is alreadi on and prai what hath thi to do in the present case we neither mean to set up nor to put down neither to make nor to unmak but to have noth to do with them wherefor your testimoni in whatev light it is view serv onli to dishonor your judgement and for mani other reason had better have been let alon than publish first becaus it tend to the decreas and reproach of all religion whatev and is of the utmost danger to societi to make it a parti in polit disput secondli becaus it exhibit a bodi of men number of whom disavow the publish polit testimoni as be concern therein and approv thereof thirdli becaus it hath a tendenc to undo that continent harmoni and friendship which yourselv by your late liber and charit donat hath lent a hand to establish and the preserv of which is of the utmost consequ to us all and here without anger or resent i bid you farewel sincer wish that as men and christian ye mai alwai fulli and uninterruptedli enjoi everi civil and religi right and be in your turn the mean of secur it to other but that the
