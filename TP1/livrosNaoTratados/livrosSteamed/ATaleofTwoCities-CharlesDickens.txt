had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal hous by the wineshop in the suburb of saint antoin in pari i wonder said mr lorri paus in hi look about that he keep that remind of hi suffer about him and why wonder at that wa the abrupt inquiri that made him start it proceed from miss pross the wild red woman strong of hand whose acquaint he had first made at the royal georg hotel at dover and had sinc improv i should have thought mr lorri began pooh you d have thought said miss pross and mr lorri left off how do you do inquir that ladi thensharpli and yet as if to express that she bore him no malic i am pretti well i thank you answer mr lorri with meek how ar you noth to boast of said miss pross inde ah inde said miss pross i am veri much put out about my ladybird inde for graciou sake sai someth els besid inde or you ll fidget me to death said miss pross whose charact dissoci from statur wa short realli then said mr lorri as an amend realli is bad enough return miss pross but better ye i am veri much put out mai i ask the caus i don t want dozen of peopl who ar not at all worthi of ladybird to come here look after her said miss pross do dozen come for that purpos hundr said miss

of i have live with the darlingor the darl ha live with me and paid me for it which she certainli should never have done you mai take your affidavit if i could have afford to keep either myself or her for nothingsinc she wa ten year old and it s realli veri hard said miss pross not see with precis what wa veri hard mr lorri shook hi head us that import part of himself as a sort of fairi cloak that would fit anyth all sort of peopl who ar not in the least degre worthi of the pet ar alwai turn up said miss pross when you began it i began it miss pross didn t you who brought her father to life oh if that wa begin it said mr lorri it wasn t end it i suppos i sai when you began it it wa hard enough not that i have ani fault to find with doctor manett except that he is not worthi of such a daughter which is no imput on him for it wa not to be expect that anybodi should be under ani circumst but it realli is doubli and trebli hard to have crowd and multitud of peopl turn up after him i could have forgiven him to take ladybird s affect awai from me mr lorri knew miss pross to be veri jealou but he also knew her by thi time to be beneath the servic of her eccentr on of those unselfish creaturesfound onli among womenwho will for pure love and admir bind themselv will slave to youth when thei have lost it to beauti that thei never had to accomplish that thei were never fortun enough to gain to bright hope that never shone upon their own sombr live he knew enough of the world to know that there is noth in it better than the faith servic of the heart so render and so free from ani mercenari taint he had such an exalt respect for it that in the retribut arrang made by hi own mindw all make such arrang more or lessh station miss pross much nearer to the lower angel than mani ladi immeasur better got up both by natur and art who had balanc at tellson s there never wa nor will be but on man worthi of ladybird said miss pross and that wa my brother solomon if he hadn t made a mistak in life here again mr lorri s inquiri into miss pross s person histori had establish the fact that her brother solomon wa a heartless scoundrel who had strip her of everyth she possess as a stake to specul with and had abandon her in her poverti for evermor with no touch of compunct miss pross s fidel of belief in solomon deduct a mere trifl for thi slight mistak wa quit a seriou matter with mr lorri and had it weight in hi good opinion of her as we happen to be alon for the moment and ar both peopl of busi he said when thei had got back to the drawingroom and had sat down there in friendli relat let me ask youdo the doctor in talk with luci never refer to the shoemak time yet never and yet keep that bench and those tool besid him ah return miss pross shake her head but i don t sai he don t refer to it within himself do you believ that he think of it much i do said miss pross do you imagin mr lorri had begun when miss pross took him up short with never imagin anyth have no imagin at all i stand correct do you supposey go so far as to suppos sometim now and then said miss pross do you suppos mr lorri went on with a laugh twinkl in hi bright ey as it look kindli at her that doctor manett ha ani theori of hi own preserv through all those year rel to the caus of hi be so oppress perhap even to the name of hi oppressor i don t suppos anyth about it but what ladybird tell me and that is that she think he ha now don t be angri at my ask all these question becaus i am a mere dull man of busi and you ar a woman of busi dull miss pross inquir with placid rather wish hi modest adject awai mr lorri repli no no no sure not to return to businessi it not remark that doctor manett unquestion innoc of ani crime as we ar all well assur he is should never touch upon that question i will not sai with me though he had busi relat with me mani year ago and we ar now intim i will sai with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedli attach and who is so devotedli attach to him believ me miss pross i don t approach the topic with you out of curios but out of zealou interest well to the best of my understand and bad s the best you ll tell me said miss pross soften by the tone of the apolog he is afraid of the whole subject afraid it s plain enough i should think why he mai be it s a dread remembr besid that hi loss of himself grew out of it not know how he lost himself or how he recov himself he mai never feel certain of not lose himself again that alon wouldn t make the subject pleasant i should think it wa a profound remark than mr lorri had look for true said he and fear to reflect upon yet a doubt lurk in my mind miss pross whether it is good for doctor manett to have that suppress alwai shut up within him inde it is thi doubt and the uneasi it sometim caus me that ha led me to our present confid can t be help said miss pross shake her head touch that string and he instantli chang for the wors better leav it alon in short must leav it alon

and she find it best not to hint at it to him in silenc thei go walk up and down togeth walk up and down togeth till her love and compani have brought him to himself notwithstand miss pross s denial of her own imagin there wa a percept of the pain of be monoton haunt by on sad idea in her repetit of the phrase walk up and down which testifi to her possess such a thing the corner ha been mention as a wonder corner for echo it had begun to echo so resoundingli to the tread of come feet that it seem as though the veri mention of that weari pace to and fro had set it go here thei ar said miss pross rise to break up the confer and now we shall have hundr of peopl pretti soon it wa such a curiou corner in it acoust properti such a peculiar ear of a place that as mr lorri stood at the open window look for the father and daughter whose step he heard he fanci thei would never approach not onli would the echo die awai as though the step had gone but echo of other step that never came would be heard in their stead and would die awai for good when thei seem close at hand howev father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross wa readi at the street door to receiv them miss pross wa a

sign within their rang that the chang of which he had so strong an impress had actual happen it wa but the inquiri of hi first confus and astonish the answer be obviou if the impress were not produc by a real correspond and suffici caus how came he jarvi lorri there how came he to have fallen asleep in hi cloth on the sofa in doctor manett s consultingroom and to be debat these point outsid the doctor s bedroom door in the earli morn within a few minut miss pross stood whisper at hi side if he had had ani particl of doubt left her talk would of necess have resolv it but he wa by that time

had taken place yesterdai an incident allus purpos thrown out to the dai of the week and the dai of the month set him think and count and evid made him uneasi in all other respect howev he wa so composedli himself that mr lorri determin to have the aid he sought and that aid wa hi own therefor when the breakfast wa done and clear awai and he and the doctor were left togeth mr lorri said feelingli my dear manett i am anxiou to have your opinion in confid on a veri curiou case in which i am deepli interest that is to sai it is veri curiou to me perhap to your better inform it mai be less so glanc at hi hand which were discolour by hi late work the doctor look troubl and listen attent he had alreadi glanc at hi hand more than onc doctor manett said mr lorri touch him affection on the arm the case is the case of a particularli dear friend of mine prai give your mind to it and advis me well for hi sakeand abov all for hi daughter shi daughter s my dear manett if i understand said the doctor in a subdu tone some mental shock ye be explicit said the doctor spare no detail mr lorri saw that thei understood on anoth and proceed my dear manett it is the case of an old and a prolong shock of great acut and sever to the affect the feel thethea you express itth mind the mind it is the case of a shock under which the suffer wa born down on cannot sai for how long becaus i believ he cannot calcul the time himself and there ar no other mean of get at it it is the case of a shock from which the suffer recov by a process that he cannot trace himselfa i onc heard him publicli relat in a strike manner it is the case of a shock from which he ha recov so complet as to be a highli intellig man capabl of close applic of mind and great exert of bodi and of constantli make fresh addit to hi stock of knowledg which wa alreadi veri larg but unfortun there ha been he paus and took a deep breath a slight relaps the doctor in a low voic ask of how long durat nine dai and night how did it show itself i infer glanc at hi hand again in the resumpt of some old pursuit connect with the shock that is the fact now did you ever see him ask the doctor distinctli and collectedli though in the same low voic engag in that pursuit origin onc and when the relaps fell on him wa he in most respectsor in all respectsa he wa then i think in all respect you spoke of hi daughter doe hi daughter know of the relaps no it ha been kept from her and i hope will alwai be kept from her it is known onli to myself and to on other who mai be trust the doctor grasp hi hand and murmur that wa veri kind that wa veri thought mr lorri grasp hi hand in return and neither of the two spoke for a littl while now my dear manett said mr lorri at length in hi most consider and most affection wai i am a mere man of busi and unfit to cope with such intric and difficult matter i do not possess the kind of inform necessari i do not possess the kind of intellig i want guid there is no man in thi world on whom i could so reli for right guidanc as on you tell me how doe thi relaps come about is there danger of anoth could a repetit of it be prevent how should a repetit of it be treat how doe it come about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been more desir in hi heart to serv a friend than i am to serv mine if i knew how but i don t know how to origin in such a case if your sagac knowledg and experi could put me on the right track i might be abl to do so much unenlighten and undirect i can do so littl prai discuss it with me prai enabl me to see it a littl more clearli and teach me how to be a littl more us doctor manett sat medit after these earnest word were spoken and mr lorri did not press him i think it probabl said the doctor break silenc with an effort that the relaps you have describ my dear friend wa not quit unforeseen by it subject wa it dread by him mr lorri ventur to ask veri much he said it with an involuntari shudder you have no idea how such an apprehens weigh on the suffer s mind and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is for him to forc himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppress him would he ask mr lorri be sensibl reliev if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brood to ani on when it is on him i think so but it is as i have told you next to imposs i even believ itin some casesto be quit imposs now said mr lorri gentli lai hi hand on the doctor s arm again after a short silenc on both side to what would you refer thi attack i believ return doctor manett that there had been a strong and extraordinari reviv of the train of thought and remembr that wa the first caus of the maladi some intens associ of a most distress natur were vividli recal i think it is probabl that there had long been a dread lurk in hi mind that those associ would be recalledsai under certain circumstancessai on a particular occas he tri to prepar himself in vain perhap the effort to prepar himself made him less abl to bear it would he rememb what took place in the relaps ask mr lorri with natur hesit the doctor look desol round the room shook hi head and answer in a low voic not at all now as to the futur hint mr lorri as to the futur said the doctor recov firm i should have great hope as it pleas heaven in it merci to restor him so soon i should have great hope he yield under the pressur of a complic someth long dread and long vagu foreseen and contend against and recov after the cloud had burst and pass i should hope that the worst wa over well well that s good comfort i am thank said mr lorri i am thank repeat the doctor bend hi head with rever there ar two other point said mr lorri on which i am anxiou to be instruct i mai go on you cannot do your friend a better servic the doctor gave him hi hand to the first then he is of a studiou habit and unusu energet he appli himself with great ardour to the acquisit of profession knowledg to the conduct of experi to mani thing now doe he do too much i think not it mai be the charact of hi mind to be alwai in singular need of occup that mai be in part natur to it in part the result of afflict the less it wa occupi with healthi thing the more it would be in danger of turn in the unhealthi direct he mai have observ himself and made the discoveri you ar sure that he is not under too great a strain i think i am quit sure of it my dear manett if he were overwork now my dear lorri i doubt if that could easili be there ha been a violent stress in on direct and it need a counterweight excus me as a persist man of busi assum for a moment that he wa overwork it would show itself in some renew of thi disord i do not think so i do not think said doctor manett with the firm of selfconvict that anyth but the on train of associ would renew it i think that henceforth noth but some extraordinari jar of that chord could renew it after what ha happen and after hi recoveri i find it difficult to imagin ani such violent sound of that string again i trust and i almost believ that the circumst like to renew it ar exhaust he spoke with the diffid of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delic organis of the mind and yet with the confid of a man who had slowli won hi assur out of person endur and distress it wa not for hi friend to abat that confid he profess himself more reliev and encourag than he realli wa and approach hi second and last point he felt it to be the most difficult of all but rememb hi old sundai morn convers with miss pross and rememb what he had seen in the last nine dai he knew that he must face it the occup resum under the influenc of thi pass afflict so happili recov from said mr lorri clear hi throat we will callblacksmith s work blacksmith s work we will sai to put a case and for the sake of illustr that he had been us in hi bad time to work at a littl forg we will sai that he wa unexpectedli found at hi forg again is it not a piti that he should keep it by him the doctor shade hi forehead with hi hand and beat hi foot nervous on the ground he ha alwai kept it by him said mr lorri with an anxiou look at hi friend now would it not be better that he should let it go still the doctor with shade forehead beat hi foot nervous on the ground you do not find it easi to advis me said mr lorri i quit understand it to be a nice question and yet i think and there he shook hi head and stop you see said doctor manett turn to him after an uneasi paus it is veri hard to explain consist the innermost work of thi poor man s mind he onc yearn so frightfulli for that occup and it wa so welcom when it came no doubt it reliev hi pain so much by substitut the perplex of the finger for the perplex of the brain and by substitut as he becam more practis the ingenu of the hand for the ingenu of the mental tortur that he ha never been abl to bear the thought of put it quit out of hi reach even now when i believ he is more hope of himself than he ha ever been and even speak of himself with a kind of confid the idea that he might need that old employ and not find it give him a sudden sens of terror like that which on mai fanci strike to the heart of a lost child he look like hi illustr as he rais hi ey to mr lorri s face but mai notmind i ask for inform as a plod man of busi who onli deal with such materi object as guinea shill and banknotesmai not the retent of the thing involv the retent of the idea if the thing were gone my dear manett might not the fear go with it in short is it not a concess to the misgiv to keep the forg there wa anoth silenc you see too said the doctor tremul it is such an old companion i would not keep it said mr lorri shake hi head for he gain in firm as he saw the doctor disquiet i would recommend him to sacrific it i onli want your author i am sure it doe no good come give me your author like a dear good man for hi daughter s sake my dear manett veri strang to see what a struggl there wa within him in her name then let it be done i sanction it but i would not take it awai while he wa present let it be remov when he is not there let him miss hi old companion after an absenc mr lorri readili engag for that and the confer wa end thei pass the dai in the countri and the doctor wa quit restor on the three follow dai he remain perfectli well and on the fourteenth dai he went awai to join luci and her husband the precaut that had been taken to account for hi silenc mr lorri had previous explain to him and he had written to luci in accord with it and she had no suspicion on the night of the dai on which he left the hous mr
