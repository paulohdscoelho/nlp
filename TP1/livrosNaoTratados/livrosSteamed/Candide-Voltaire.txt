i have a great mani pictur but i prize them veri littl while thei were wait for dinner pococurant order a concert candid found the music delici thi nois said the senat mai amus on for half an hour but if it were to last longer it would grow tiresom to everybodi though thei durst not own it music todai is onli the art of execut difficult thing and that which is onli difficult cannot pleas long perhap i should be fonder of the opera if thei had not found the secret of make of it a monster which shock me let who will go to see bad tragedi set to music where the scene ar contriv for no other end than to introduc two or three song ridicul out of place to show off an actresss voic let who will or who can die awai with pleasur at the sight of an eunuch quaver the r le of c sar or of cato and strut awkwardli upon the stage for my part i have long sinc renounc those paltri entertain which constitut the glori of modern itali and ar purchas so dearli by sovereign candid disput the point a littl but with discret martin wa entir of the senat opinion thei sat down to tabl and after an excel dinner thei went into the librari candid see a homer magnific bound commend the virtuoso on hi good tast there said he is a book that wa onc the delight of the great pangloss the best philosoph in germani it is not mine answer pococurant coolli thei us at on time to make me believ that i took a pleasur in read him but that continu repetit of battl so extrem like on anoth those god that ar alwai activ without do anyth decis that helen who is the caus of the war and who yet scarc appear in the piec that troi so long besieg without be taken all these togeth caus me great weari i have sometim ask learn men whether thei were not as weari as i of that work those who were sincer have own to me that the poem made them fall asleep yet it wa necessari to have it in their librari as a monument of antiqu or like those rusti medal which ar no longer of us in commerc but your excel doe not think thu of virgil said candid i grant said the senat that the second fourth and sixth book of hi neid ar excel but as for hi piou nea hi strong cloanthu hi friend achat hi littl ascaniu hi silli king latinu hi bourgeoi amata hi insipid lavinia i think there can be noth more flat and disagre i prefer tasso a good deal or even the soporif tale of ariosto mai i presum to ask you sir said candid whether you do not receiv a great deal of pleasur from read horac there ar maxim in thi writer answer pococurant from which a man of the world mai reap great benefit and be written in energet vers thei ar more easili impress upon the memori but i care littl for hi journei to brundusium and hi account of a bad dinner or of hi low quarrel between on rupiliu whose word he sai were full of poison filth and anoth whose languag wa imbu with vinegar i have read with much distast hi indel vers against old women and witch nor do i see ani merit in tell hi friend m cena that if he will but rank him in the choir of lyric poet hi lofti head shall touch the star fool admir everyth in an author of reput for my part i read onli to pleas myself i like onli that which serv my purpos candid have been educ never to judg for himself wa much surpris at what he heard martin found there wa a good deal of reason in pococurant remark oh here is cicero said candid here is the great man whom i fanci you ar never tire of read i never read him repli the venetian what is it to me whether he plead for rabiriu or cluentiu i try caus enough myself hi philosoph work seem to me better but when i found that he doubt of everyth i conclud that i knew as much as he and that i had no need of a guid to learn ignor ha here ar fourscor volum of the academi of scienc cri martin perhap there is someth valuabl in thi collect there might be said pococurant if onli on of those raker of rubbish had shown how to make pin but in all these volum there is noth but chimer system and not a singl us thing and what dramat work i see here said candid in italian spanish and french ye repli the senat there ar three thousand and not three dozen of them good for anyth as to those collect of sermon which altogeth ar not worth a singl page of seneca and those huge volum of theologi you mai well imagin that neither i nor ani on els ever open them martin saw some shelv fill with english book i have a notion said he that a republican must be greatli pleas with most of these book which ar written with a spirit of freedom ye answer pococurant it is nobl to write as on think thi is the privileg of human in all our itali we write onli what we do not think those who inhabit the countri of the c sar and the antoninus dare not acquir a singl idea without the permiss of a dominican friar i should be pleas with the liberti which inspir the english geniu if passion and parti spirit did not corrupt all that is estim in thi preciou liberti candid observ a milton ask whether he did not look upon thi author as a great man who said pococurant that barbarian who write a long commentari in ten book of harsh vers on the first chapter of genesi that coars imit of the greek who disfigur the creation and who while mose repres the etern produc the world by a word make the messiah take a great pair of compass from the armouri of heaven to circumscrib hi work how can i have ani esteem for a writer who ha spoil tasso hell and the devil who transform lucif sometim into a toad and other time into a pigmi who make him repeat the same thing a hundr time who make him disput on theologi who by a seriou imit of ariosto comic invent of firearm repres the devil cannonad in heaven neither i nor ani man in itali could take pleasur in those melancholi extravag and the marriag of sin and death and the snake brought forth by sin ar enough to turn the stomach of ani on with the least tast and hi long descript of a pesthous is good onli for a gravedigg thi obscur whimsic and disagre poem wa despis upon it first public and i onli treat it now as it wa treat in it own countri by contemporari for the matter of that i sai what i think and i care veri littl whether other think as i do candid wa griev at thi speech for he had a respect for homer and wa fond of milton ala said he softli to martin i am afraid that thi man hold our german poet in veri great contempt there would not be much harm in that said martin oh what a

and two monk from corfu who told us similar adventur happen daili the baron maintain that he had suffer greater injustic than i and i insist that it wa far more innoc to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman bosom than to be found stark nake with an ichoglan we were continu disput and receiv twenti lash with a bull pizzl when the concaten of univers event brought you to our gallei and you were good enough to ransom us well my dear pangloss said candid to him when you had been hang dissect whip and were tug at the oar did you alwai think that everyth happen for the best i am still of my first opinion answer pangloss for i am a philosoph and i cannot retract especi as leibnitz could never be wrong and besid the preestablish harmoni is the finest thing in the world and so is hi plenum and materia subtili xxix how candid found cunegond and the old woman again while candid the baron pangloss martin and cacambo were relat their sever adventur were reason on the conting or nonconting event of the univers disput on effect and caus on moral and physic evil on liberti and necess and on the consol a slave mai feel even on a turkish gallei thei arriv at the hous of the transylvanian princ on the bank of the proponti the first object which met their sight were cunegond and the old woman hang towel out to dry the baron pale at thi sight the tender love candid see hi beauti cunegond

the gallei i have paid thy ransom and thy sister also she wa a scullion and is veri ugli yet i am so condescend as to marri her and dost thou pretend to oppos the match i should kill thee again were i onli to consult my anger thou mayest kill me again said the baron but thou shalt not marri my sister at least whilst i am live xxx the conclus at the bottom of hi heart candid had no wish to marri cunegond but the extrem impertin of the baron determin him to conclud the match and cunegond press him so strongli that he could not go from hi word he consult pangloss martin and the faith cacambo pangloss drew up an excel memori wherein he prove that the baron had no right over hi sister and that accord to all the law of the empir she might marri candid with her left hand martin wa for throw the baron into the sea cacambo decid that it would be better to deliv him up again to the captain of the gallei after which thei thought to send him back to the gener father of the order at rome by the first ship thi advic wa well receiv the old woman approv it thei said not a word to hi sister the thing wa execut for a littl monei and thei had the doubl pleasur of entrap a jesuit and punish the

pasha and effendi come to suppli the place of the exil and afterward exil in their turn thei saw head decent impal for present to the sublim port such spectacl as these increas the number of their dissert and when thei did not disput time hung so heavili upon their hand that on dai the old woman ventur to sai to them i want to know which is wors to be ravish a hundr time by negro pirat to have a buttock cut off to run the gauntlet among the bulgarian to be whip and hang at an autodaf to be dissect to row in the galleysin short to go through all the miseri we have undergon or to stai here and have noth to do it is a great question said candid thi discours gave rise to new reflect and martin especi conclud that man wa born to live either in a state of distract inquietud or of letharg disgust candid did not quit agre to that but he affirm noth pangloss own that he had alwai suffer horribl but as he had onc assert that everyth went wonderfulli well he assert it still though he no
