what manner it oper in some particular manufactur it is commonli suppos to be carri furthest in some veri trifl on not perhap that it realli is carri further in them than in other of more import but in those trifl manufactur which ar destin to suppli the small want of but a small number of peopl the whole number of workmen must necessarili be small and those emploi in everi differ branch of the work can often be collect into the same workhous and place at onc under the view of the spectat in those great manufactur on the contrari which ar destin to suppli the great want of the great bodi of the peopl everi differ branch of the work emploi so great a number of workmen that it is imposs to collect them all into the same workhous we can seldom see more at on time than those emploi in on singl branch though in such manufactur therefor the work mai realli be divid into a much greater number of part than in those of a more trifl natur the divis is not near so obviou and ha accordingli been much less observ to take an exampl therefor from a veri trifl manufactur but on in which the divis of labour ha been veri often taken notic of the trade of a pinmak a workman not educ to thi busi which the divis of labour ha render a distinct trade nor acquaint with the us of the machineri emploi in it to the invent of which the same divis of labour ha probabl given occas could scarc perhap with hi utmost industri make on pin in a dai and certainli could not make twenti but in the wai in which thi busi is now carri on not onli the whole work is a peculiar trade but it is divid into a

the head requir two or three distinct oper to put it on is a peculiar busi to whiten the pin is anoth it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper and the import busi of make a pin is in thi manner divid into about eighteen distinct oper which in some manufactori ar all perform by distinct hand though in other the same man will sometim perform two or three of them i have seen a small manufactori of thi kind where ten men onli were emploi and where some of them consequ perform two or three distinct oper but though thei were veri poor and therefor but indiffer accommod with the necessari machineri thei could when thei exert themselv make among them about twelv pound of pin in a dai there ar in a pound upward of four thousand pin of a middl size those ten person therefor could make among them upward of fortyeight thousand pin in a dai each person therefor make a tenth part of fortyeight thousand pin might be consid as make four thousand eight hundr pin in a dai but if thei had all wrought separ and independ and without ani of them have been educ to thi peculiar busi thei certainli could not each of them have made twenti perhap not on pin in a dai that is certainli not the two hundr and fortieth perhap not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what thei ar at present capabl of perform in consequ of a proper divis and combin of their differ oper in everi other art and manufactur the effect of the divis of labour ar similar to what thei ar in thi veri trifl on though in mani of them the labour can neither be so much subdivid nor reduc to so great a simplic of oper the divis of labour howev so far as it can be introduc occas in everi art a proportion increas of the product power of labour the separ of differ trade and employ from on anoth seem to have taken place in consequ of thi advantag thi separ too is gener carri furthest in those countri which enjoi the highest degre of industri and improv what is the work of on man in a rude state of societi be gener that of sever in an improv on in everi improv societi the farmer is gener noth but a farmer the manufactur noth but a manufactur the labour too which is necessari to produc ani on complet manufactur is almost alwai divid among a great number of hand how mani differ trade ar emploi in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactur from the grower of the flax and the wool to the bleacher and smoother of the linen or to the dyer and dresser of the cloth the natur of agricultur inde doe not admit of so mani subdivis of labour nor of so complet a separ of on busi from anoth as manufactur it is imposs to separ so entir the busi of the grazier from that of the cornfarm as the trade of the carpent is commonli separ from that of the smith the spinner is almost alwai a distinct person from the weaver but the ploughman the harrow the sower of the seed and the reaper of the corn ar often the same the occas for those differ sort of labour return with the differ season of the year it is imposs that on man should be constantli emploi in ani on of them thi imposs of make so complet and entir a separ of all the differ branch of labour emploi in agricultur is perhap the reason why the improv of the product power of labour in thi art doe not alwai keep pace with their improv in manufactur the most opul nation inde gener excel all their neighbour in agricultur as well as in manufactur but thei ar commonli more distinguish by their superior in the latter than in the former their land ar in gener better cultiv and have more labour and expens bestow upon them produc more in proport to the extent and natur fertil of the ground but thi superior of produc is seldom much more than in proport to the superior of labour and expens in agricultur the labour of the rich countri is not alwai much more product than that of the poor or at least it is never so much more product as it commonli is in manufactur the corn of the rich countri therefor will not alwai in the same degre of good come cheaper to market than that of the poor the corn of poland in the same degre of good is as cheap as that of franc notwithstand the superior opul and improv of the latter countri the corn of franc is in the cornprovinc fulli as good and in most year nearli about the same price with the corn of england though in opul and improv franc is perhap inferior to england the cornland of england howev ar better cultiv than those of franc and the cornland of franc ar said to be much better cultiv than those of poland but though the poor countri notwithstand the inferior of it cultiv can in some measur rival the rich in the cheap and good of it corn it can pretend to no such competit in it manufactur at least if those manufactur suit the soil climat and situat of the rich countri the silk of franc ar better and cheaper than those of england becaus the silk manufactur at least under the present high duti upon the import of raw silk doe not so well suit the climat of england as that of franc but the hardwar and the coars woollen of england ar beyond all comparison superior to those of franc and much cheaper too in the same degre of good in poland there ar said to be scarc ani manufactur of ani kind a few of those coarser household manufactur except without which no countri can well subsist thi great increas in the quantiti of work which in consequ of the divis of labour the same number of peopl ar capabl of perform is ow to three differ circumst first to the increas of dexter in everi particular workman secondli to the save of the time which is commonli lost in pass

all of them much more simpl and the dexter of the person of whose life it ha been the sole busi to perform them is usual much greater the rapid with which some of the oper of those manufactur ar perform exce what the human hand could by those who had never seen them be suppos capabl of acquir secondli the advantag which is gain by save the time commonli lost in pass from on sort of work to anoth is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagin it it is imposs to pass veri quickli from on kind of work to anoth that is carri on in a differ place and with quit differ tool a countri weaver who cultiv a small farm must loos a good deal of time in pass from hi loom to the field and from the field to hi loom when the two trade can be carri on in the same workhous the loss of

mani differ commod it is probabl were success both thought of and emploi for thi purpos in the rude ag of societi cattl ar said to have been the common instrument of commerc and though thei must have

what he wa to give for it could seldom be divid without loss and if he had a mind to bui more he must for the same reason have been oblig to bui doubl or tripl the quantiti the valu to wit of two or

bar therefor perform at thi time the function of monei the us of metal in thi rude state wa attend with two veri consider inconveni first with the troubl of weigh and secondli with that of assai them in the preciou metal where a small differ in the quantiti make a great differ in the valu even the busi of weigh with proper exact requir at least veri accur weight and scale the weigh of gold in particular is an oper of some niceti in the coarser metal inde where a small error would be of littl consequ less accuraci would no doubt be necessari yet we should find it excess troublesom if everi time a poor man had occas either to bui or sell a farth worth of good he wa oblig to weigh the farth the oper of assai is still more difficult still more tediou and unless a part of the metal is fairli melt in the crucibl with proper dissolv ani conclus that can be drawn from it is extrem uncertain befor the institut of coin monei howev unless thei went through thi tediou and difficult oper peopl must alwai have been liabl to the grossest fraud and imposit and instead of a pound weight of pure silver or pure copper might receiv in exchang for their good an adulter composit of the coarsest and cheapest materi which had howev in their outward appear been made to resembl those metal to prevent such abus to facilit exchang and therebi to encourag all sort of industri and commerc it ha been found necessari in all countri that have made ani consider advanc toward improv to affix a public stamp upon certain quantiti of such particular metal as were in those countri commonli made

ar equal meant to ascertain by mean of a public stamp the quantiti and uniform good of those differ commod when brought to market the first public stamp of thi kind that were affix to the current metal seem in mani case to have been intend to ascertain what it wa both most difficult and most import to ascertain the good or fine of the metal and to have resembl the sterl mark which is at

becom in all civil nation the univers instrument of commerc by the intervent of which good of all kind ar bought and sold or exchang for on anoth what ar the rule which men natur observ in exchang them either for monei or for on anoth i shall now proce to examin these rule determin what mai be call the rel or exchang valu of good the word valu it is to be observ ha two differ mean and sometim

but it will purchas scarc ani thing scarc ani thing can be had in exchang for it a diamond on the contrari ha scarc ani valu in us but a veri great quantiti of other good mai frequent be had in exchang for it in order to investig the principl which regul the exchang valu of commod i shall endeavour to shew first what is the real measur of thi exchang valu or wherein consist the real price of all commod secondli what ar the differ part of which thi real price is compos or made up and lastli what ar the differ circumst which sometim rais some or all of these differ part of price abov and sometim sink them below their natur or ordinari rate or what ar the caus which sometim hinder the market price that is the actual price of commod from coincid exactli with what mai be call their natur price i shall endeavour to explain as fulli and distinctli as i can those three subject in the three follow chapter for which i must veri earnestli entreat both the patienc and attent of the reader hi patienc in order to examin a detail which mai perhap in some place appear unnecessarili tediou and hi attent in order to understand what mai perhap after the fullest explic which i am capabl of give it appear still in some degre obscur i am alwai will to run some hazard of be tediou in order to be sure that i am perspicu and after take the utmost pain that i can to be perspicu some obscur mai still appear to remain upon a subject in it own natur extrem abstract chapter v of the real and nomin price of commod or of their price in labour and their price in monei everi man is rich or poor accord to the degre in which he can afford to enjoi the necessari conveni and amus of human life but after the divis of labour ha onc thoroughli taken place it is but a veri small part of these with which a man own labour can suppli him the far greater part of them he must deriv from the labour of other peopl and he must be rich or poor accord to the quantiti of that labour which he can command or which he can afford to purchas the valu of ani commod therefor to the person who possess it and who mean not to us or consum it himself but to exchang it for other commod is equal to the quantiti of labour which it enabl him to purchas or command labour therefor is the real measur of the exchang valu of all commod the real price of everi thing what everi thing realli cost to the man who want to acquir it is the toil and troubl of acquir it what everi thing is realli worth to the man who ha acquir it and who want to dispos of it or exchang it for someth els is the toil and troubl which it can save to himself and which it can impos upon other peopl what is bought with monei or with good is purchas by labour as much as what we acquir by the toil of our own bodi that monei or those good inde save us thi toil thei contain the valu of a certain quantiti of labour which we exchang for what is suppos at the time to contain the valu of an equal quantiti labour wa the first price the origin purchas monei that wa paid for all thing it wa not by gold or by silver but by labour that all the wealth of the world wa origin purchas and it valu to those who possess it and who want to exchang it for some new product is precis equal to the quantiti of labour which it can enabl them to purchas or command wealth as mr hobb sai is power but the person who either acquir or succe to a great fortun doe not necessarili acquir or succe to ani polit power either civil or militari hi fortun mai perhap afford him the mean of acquir both but the mere possess of that fortun doe not necessarili convei to him either the power which that possess immedi and directli convei to him is the power of purchas a certain command over all the labour or over all the produc of labour which is then in the market hi fortun is greater or less precis in proport to the extent of thi power or to the quantiti either of other men labour or what is the same thing of the produc of other men labour which it enabl him to purchas or command the exchang valu of everi thing must alwai be precis equal to the extent of thi power which it convei to it owner but though labour be the real measur of the exchang valu of all commod it is not that by which their valu is commonli estim it is often difficult to ascertain the proport between two differ quantiti of labour the time spent in two differ sort of work will not alwai alon determin thi proport the differ degre of hardship endur and of ingenu exercis must likewis be taken into account there mai be more labour in an hour hard work than in two hour easi busi or in an hour applic to a trade which it cost ten year labour to learn than in a month industri at an ordinari and obviou employ but it is not easi to find ani accur measur either of hardship or ingenu in exchang inde the differ product of differ sort of labour for on anoth some allow is commonli made for both it is adjust howev not by ani accur measur but by the higgl and bargain of the market accord to that sort of rough equal which though not exact is suffici for carri on the busi of common life everi commod besid is more frequent exchang for and therebi compar with other commod than with labour it is more natur therefor to estim it exchang valu by the quantiti of some other commod than by that of the labour which it can produc the greater part of peopl too understand better what is meant by a quantiti of a particular commod than by a quantiti of labour the on is a plain palpabl object the other an abstract notion which though it can be made suffici intellig is not altogeth so natur and obviou but when barter ceas and monei ha becom the common instrument of commerc everi particular commod is more frequent exchang for monei than for ani other commod the butcher seldom carri hi beef or hi mutton to the baker or the brewer in order to exchang them for bread or for beer but he carri them to the market where he exchang them for monei and afterward exchang that monei for bread and for beer the quantiti of monei which he get for them regul too the quantiti of bread and beer which he can afterward purchas it is more natur and obviou to him therefor to estim their valu by the quantiti of monei the commod for which he immedi exchang them than by that of bread and beer the commod for which he can exchang them onli by the intervent of anoth commod and rather to sai that hi butcher meat is worth threepenc or fourpenc apound than that it is worth three or four pound of bread or three or four quart of small beer henc it come to pass that the exchang valu of everi commod is more frequent estim by the quantiti of monei than by the quantiti either of labour or of ani other commod which can be had in exchang for it gold and silver howev like everi other commod vari in their valu ar sometim cheaper and sometim dearer sometim of easier and sometim of more difficult purchas the quantiti of labour which ani particular quantiti of them can purchas or command or the quantiti of other good which it will exchang for depend alwai upon the fertil or barren of the mine which happen to be known about the time when such exchang ar made the discoveri of the abund mine of america reduc in the sixteenth centuri the valu of gold and silver in europ to about a third of what it had been befor as it cost less labour to bring those metal from the mine to the market so when thei were brought thither thei could purchas or command less labour and thi revolut in their valu though perhap the greatest is by no mean the onli on of which histori give some account but as a measur of quantiti such as the natur foot fathom or hand which is continu vari in it own quantiti can never be an accur measur of the quantiti of other thing so a commod which is itself continu vari in it own valu can never be an accur measur of the valu of other commod equal quantiti of labour at all time and place mai be said to be of equal valu to the labour in hi ordinari state of health strength and spirit in the ordinari degre of hi skill and dexter he must alwai lai down the same portion of hi eas hi liberti and hi happi the price which he pai must alwai be the same whatev mai be the quantiti of good which he receiv in return for it of these inde it mai sometim purchas a greater and sometim a smaller quantiti but it is their valu which vari not that of the labour which purchas them at all time and place that is dear which it is difficult to come at or which it cost much labour to acquir and that cheap which is to be had easili or with veri littl labour labour alon therefor never vari in it own valu is alon the ultim and real standard by which the valu of all commod can at all time and place be estim and compar it is their real price monei is their nomin price onli but though equal quantiti of labour ar alwai of equal valu to the labour yet to the person who emploi him thei appear sometim to be of greater and sometim of smaller valu he purchas them sometim with a greater and sometim with a smaller quantiti of good and to him the price of labour seem to vari like that of all other thing it appear to him dear in the on case and cheap in the other in realiti howev it is the good which ar cheap in the on case and dear in the other in thi popular sens therefor labour like commod mai be said to have a real and a nomin price it real price mai be said to consist in the quantiti of the necessari and conveni of life which ar given for it it nomin price in the quantiti of monei the labour is rich or poor is well or ill reward in proport to the real not to the nomin price of hi labour the distinct between the real and the nomin price of commod and labour is not a matter of mere specul but mai sometim be of consider us in practic the same real price is alwai of the same valu but on account of the variat in the valu of gold and silver the same nomin price is sometim of veri differ valu when a land estat therefor is sold with a reserv of a perpetu rent if it is intend that thi rent should alwai be of the same valu it is of import to the famili in whose favour it is reserv that it should not consist in a particular sum of monei it valu would in thi case be liabl to variat of two differ kind first to those which aris from the differ quantiti of gold and silver which ar contain at differ time in coin of the same denomin and secondli to those which aris from the differ valu of equal quantiti of gold and silver at differ time princ and sovereign state have frequent fanci that thei had a temporari interest to diminish the quantiti of pure metal contain in their coin but thei seldom have fanci that thei had ani to augment it the quantiti of metal contain in the coin i believ of all nation ha accordingli been almost continu diminish and hardli ever augment such variat therefor tend almost alwai to diminish the valu of a monei rent the discoveri of the mine of america diminish the valu of gold and silver in europ thi diminut it is commonli suppos though i apprehend without ani certain proof is still go on gradual and is like to continu to do so for a long time upon thi supposit therefor such variat ar more like to diminish than to augment the valu of a monei rent even though it should be stipul to be paid not in such a quantiti of coin monei of such a denomin in so mani pound sterl for exampl but in so mani ounc either of pure silver or of silver of a certain standard the rent which have been reserv in corn have preserv their valu much better than those which have been reserv in monei even where the denomin of the coin ha not been alter by the th of elizabeth it wa enact that a third of the rent of all colleg leas should be reserv in corn to be paid either in kind or accord to the current price at the nearest public market the monei aris from thi corn rent though origin but a third of the whole is in the present time accord to dr blackston commonli near doubl of what aris from the other twothird the old monei rent of colleg must accord to thi account have sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient valu or ar worth littl more than a fourth part of the corn which thei were formerli worth but sinc the reign of philip and mari the denomin of the english coin ha undergon littl or no alter and the same number of pound shill and penc have contain veri nearli the same quantiti of pure silver thi degrad therefor in the valu of the monei rent of colleg ha arisen altogeth from the degrad in the price of silver when the degrad in the valu of silver is combin with the diminut of the quantiti of it contain in the coin of the same denomin the loss is frequent still greater in scotland where the denomin of the coin ha undergon much greater alter than it ever did in england and in franc where it ha undergon still greater than it ever did in scotland some ancient rent origin of consider valu have in thi manner been reduc almost to noth equal quantiti of labour will at distant time be purchas more nearli with equal quantiti of corn the subsist of the labour than with equal quantiti of gold and silver or perhap of ani other commod equal quantiti of corn therefor will at distant time be more nearli of the same real valu or enabl the possessor to purchas or command more nearli the same quantiti of the labour of other peopl thei will do thi i sai more nearli than equal quantiti of almost ani other commod for even equal quantiti of corn will not do it exactli the subsist of the labour or the real price of labour as i shall endeavour to shew hereaft is veri differ upon differ occas more liber in a societi advanc to opul than in on that is stand still and in on that is stand still than in on that is go backward everi other commod howev will at ani particular time purchas a greater or smaller quantiti of labour in proport to the quantiti of subsist which it can purchas at that time a rent therefor reserv in corn is liabl onli to the variat in the quantiti of labour which a certain quantiti of corn can purchas but a rent reserv in ani other commod is liabl not onli to the variat in the quantiti of labour which ani particular quantiti of corn can purchas but to the variat in the quantiti of corn which can be purchas by ani particular quantiti of that commod though the real valu of a corn rent it is to be observ howev vari much less from centuri to centuri than that of a monei rent it vari much more from year to year the monei price of labour as i shall endeavour to shew hereaft doe not fluctuat from year to year with the monei price of corn but seem to be everywher accommod not to the temporari or occasion but to the averag or ordinari price of that necessari of life the averag or ordinari price of corn again is regul as i shall likewis endeavour to shew hereaft by the valu of silver by the rich or barren of the mine which suppli the market with that metal or by the quantiti of labour which must be emploi and consequ of corn which must be consum in order to bring ani particular quantiti of silver from the mine to the market but the valu of silver though it sometim vari greatli from centuri to centuri seldom vari much from year to year but frequent continu the same or veri nearli the same for half a centuri or a centuri togeth the ordinari or averag monei price of corn therefor mai dure so long a period continu the same or veri nearli the same too and along with it the monei price of labour provid at least the societi continu in other respect in the same or nearli in the same condit in the mean time the temporari and occasion price of corn mai frequent be doubl on year of what it had been the year befor or fluctuat for exampl from fiveandtwenti to fifti shill the quarter but when corn is at the latter price not onli the nomin but the real valu of a corn rent will be doubl of what it is when at the former or will command doubl the quantiti either of labour or of the greater part of other commod the monei price of labour and along with it that of most other thing continu the same dure all these fluctuat labour therefor it appear evid is the onli univers as well as the onli accur measur of valu or the onli standard by which we can compar the valu of differ commod at all time and at all place we cannot estim it is allow the real valu of differ commod from centuri to centuri by the quantiti of silver which were given for them we cannot estim it from year to year by the quantiti of corn by the quantiti of labour we can with the greatest accuraci estim it both from centuri to centuri and from year to year from centuri to centuri corn is a better measur than silver becaus from centuri to centuri equal quantiti of corn will command the same quantiti of labour more nearli than equal quantiti of silver from year to year on the contrari silver is a better measur than corn becaus equal quantiti of it will more nearli command the same quantiti of labour but though in establish perpetu rent or even in let veri long leas it mai be of us to distinguish between real and nomin price it is of none in bui and sell the more common and ordinari transact of human life at the same time and place the real and the nomin price of all commod ar exactli in proport to on anoth the more or less monei you get for ani commod in the london market for exampl the more or less labour it will at that time and place enabl you to purchas or command at the same time and place therefor monei is the exact measur of the real exchang valu of all commod it is so howev at the same time and place onli though at distant place there is no regular proport between the real and the monei price of commod yet the merchant who carri good from the on to the other ha noth to consid but the monei price or the differ between the quantiti of silver for which he bui them and that for which he is like to sell them half an ounc of silver at canton in china mai command a greater quantiti both of labour and of the necessari and conveni of life than an ounc at london a commod therefor which sell for half an ounc of silver at canton mai there be realli dearer of more real import to the man who possess it there than a commod which sell for an ounc at london is to the man who possess it at london if a london merchant howev can bui at canton for half an ounc of silver a commod which he can afterward sell at london for an ounc he gain a hundr per cent by the bargain just as much as if an ounc of silver wa at london exactli of the same valu as at canton it is of no import to him that half an ounc of silver at canton would have given him the command of more labour and of a greater quantiti of the necessari and conveni of life than an ounc can do at london an ounc at london will alwai give him the command of doubl the quantiti of all these which half an ounc could have done there and thi is precis what he want as it is the nomin or monei price of good therefor which final determin the prudenc or imprud of all purchas and sale and therebi regul almost the whole busi of common life in which price is concern we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more attend to than the real price in such a work as thi howev it mai sometim be of us to compar the differ real valu of a particular commod at differ time and place or the differ degre of power over the labour of other peopl which it mai upon differ occas have given to those who possess it we must in thi case compar not so much the differ quantiti of silver for which it wa commonli sold as the differ quantiti or labour which those differ quantiti of silver could have purchas but the current price of labour at distant time and place can scarc ever be known with ani degre of exact those of corn though thei have in few place been regularli record ar in gener better known and have been more frequent taken notic of by historian and other writer we must gener therefor content ourselv with them not as be alwai exactli in the same proport as the current price of labour but as be the nearest approxim which can commonli be had to that proport i shall hereaft have occas to make sever comparison of thi kind in the progress of industri commerci nation have found it conveni to coin sever differ metal into monei gold for larger payment silver for purchas of moder valu and copper or some other coars metal for those of still smaller consider thei have alwai howev consid on of those metal as more peculiarli the measur of valu than ani of the other two and thi prefer seem gener to have been given to the metal which thei happen first to make us of as the instrument of commerc have onc begun to us it as their standard which thei must have done when thei had no other monei thei have gener continu to do so even when the necess wa not the same the roman ar said to have had noth but copper monei till within five year befor the first punic war plini lib xxxiii cap when thei first began to coin silver copper therefor appear to have continu alwai the measur of valu in that republ at rome all account appear to have been kept and the valu of all estat to have been comput either in ass or in sestertii the as wa alwai the denomin of a copper coin the word sestertiu signifi two ass and a half though the sestertiu therefor wa origin a silver coin it valu wa estim in copper at rome on who ow a great deal of monei wa said to have a great deal of other peopl copper the northern nation who establish themselv upon the ruin of the roman empir seem to have had silver monei from the first begin of their settlement and not to have known either gold or copper coin for sever ag thereaft there were silver coin in england in the time of the saxon but there wa littl gold coin till the time of edward iii nor ani copper till that of jame i of great britain in england therefor and for the same reason i believ in all other modern nation of europ all account ar kept and the valu of all good and of all estat is gener comput in silver and when we mean to express the amount of a person fortun we seldom mention the number of guinea but the number of pound sterl which we suppos would be given for it origin in all countri i believ a legal tender of payment could be made onli in the coin of that metal which wa peculiarli consid as the standard or measur of valu in england gold wa not consid as a legal tender for a long time after it wa coin into monei the proport between the valu of gold and silver monei wa not fix by ani public law or proclam but wa left to be settl by the market if a debtor offer payment in gold the creditor might either reject such payment altogeth or accept of it at such a valuat of the gold as he and hi debtor could agre upon copper is not at present a legal tender except in the chang of the smaller silver coin in thi state of thing the distinct between the metal which wa the standard and that which wa not the standard wa someth more than a nomin distinct in process of time and as peopl becam gradual more familiar with the us of the differ metal in coin and consequ better acquaint with the proport between their respect valu it ha in most countri i believ been found conveni to ascertain thi proport and to declar by a public law that a guinea for exampl of such a weight and fine should exchang for oneandtwenti shill or be a legal tender for a debt of that amount in thi state of thing and dure the continu of ani on regul proport of thi kind the distinct between the metal which is the standard and that which is not the standard becom littl more than a nomin distinct in

but would requir veri differ quantiti of gold monei a greater in the on case and a smaller in the other silver would appear to be more invari in it valu than gold silver would appear to measur the valu of gold and gold would not appear to measur the valu of silver the valu of gold would seem to depend upon the quantiti of silver which it would exchang for and the valu of silver would not seem

gold would appear to measur the valu of silver and silver would not appear to measur the valu of gold if the custom of keep account and of express promissorynot and other oblig for monei in thi manner

coin is seldom worth sevenp in silver but as by the regul twelv such penc ar order to exchang for a shill thei ar in the market consid as worth a shill and a shill can at ani time be had for them even befor the late reform of the gold coin of great britain the gold that part of it at least which circul in london and it neighbourhood wa in gener less degrad below it standard weight than the greater part of the silver oneandtwenti worn and defac shill howev were consid as equival to a guinea which perhap inde wa worn and defac too but seldom so much so the late regul have brought the gold coin as near perhap to it standard weight as it is possibl to bring the current coin of ani nation and the order to receiv no gold at the public offic but by weight is like to preserv it so as long as that order is enforc the silver coin still continu in the same worn and degrad state as befor the reform of the cold coin in the market howev oneandtwenti shill of thi degrad silver coin ar still consid as worth a guinea of thi excel gold coin the reform of the gold coin ha evid rais the valu of the silver coin which can be exchang for it in the english mint a pound weight of gold is coin into fortyfour guinea and a half which at oneandtwenti shill the guinea is equal to fortysix pound fourteen shill and sixpenc an ounc of such gold coin therefor is worth in silver in england no duti or seignorag is paid upon the coinag and he who carri a pound weight or an ounc weight of standard gold bullion to the mint get back a pound weight or an ounc weight of gold in coin without ani deduct three pound seventeen shill and tenpenc halfpenni an ounc therefor is said to be the mint price of gold in england or the quantiti of gold coin which the mint give in return for standard gold bullion befor the reform of the gold coin the price of standard gold bullion in the market had for mani year been upward of s sometim s and veri frequent an ounc that sum it is probabl in the worn and degrad gold coin seldom contain more than an ounc of standard gold sinc the reform of the gold coin the market price of standard gold bullion seldom exce an ounc befor the reform of the gold coin the market price wa alwai more or less abov the mint price sinc that reform the market price ha been constantli below the mint price but that market price is the same whether it is paid in gold or in silver coin the late reform of the gold coin therefor ha rais not onli the valu of the gold coin but likewis that of the silver coin in proport to gold bullion and probabl too in proport to all other commod though the price of the greater part of other commod be influenc by so mani other caus the rise in the valu of either gold or silver coin in proport to them mai not be so distinct and sensibl in the english mint a pound weight of standard silver bullion is coin into sixtytwo shill contain in the same manner a pound weight of standard silver five shill and twopenc an ounc therefor is said to be the mint price of silver in england or the quantiti of silver coin which the mint give in return for standard silver bullion befor the reform of the gold coin the market price of standard silver bullion wa upon differ occas five shill and fourpenc five shill and fivep five shill and sixpenc five shill and sevenp and veri often five shill and eightpenc an ounc five shill and sevenp howev seem to have been the most common price sinc the reform of the gold coin the market price of standard silver bullion ha fallen occasion to five shill and threepenc five shill and fourpenc and five shill and fivep an ounc which last price it ha scarc ever exceed though the market price of silver bullion ha fallen consider sinc the reform of the gold coin it ha not fallen so low as the mint price in the proport between the differ metal in the english coin as copper is rate veri much abov it real valu so silver is rate somewhat below it in the market of europ in the french coin and in the dutch coin an ounc of fine gold exchang for about fourteen ounc of fine silver in the english coin it exchang for about fifteen ounc that is for more silver than it is worth accord to the common estim of europ but as the price of copper in bar is not even in england rais by the high price of copper in english coin so the price of silver in bullion is not sunk by the low rate of silver in english coin silver in bullion still preserv it proper proport to gold for the same reason that copper in bar preserv it proper proport to silver upon the reform of the silver coin in the reign of william iii the price of silver bullion still continu to be somewhat abov the mint price mr lock imput thi high price to the permiss of export silver bullion and to the prohibit of export silver coin thi permiss of export he said render the demand for silver bullion greater than the demand for silver coin but the number of peopl who want silver coin for the common us of bui and sell at home is sure much greater than that of those who want silver bullion either for the us of export or for ani other us there subsist at present a like permiss of export gold bullion and a like prohibit of export gold coin and yet the price of gold bullion ha fallen below the mint price but in the english coin silver wa then in the same manner as now underr in proport to gold and the gold coin which at that time too wa not suppos to requir ani reform regul then as well as now the real valu of the whole coin as the reform of the silver coin did not then reduc the price of silver bullion to the mint price it is not veri probabl that a like reform will do so now were the silver coin brought back as near to it standard weight as the gold a guinea it is probabl would accord to the present proport exchang for more silver in coin than it would purchas in bullion the silver coin contain it full standard weight there would in thi case be a profit in melt it down in order first to sell the bullion for gold coin and afterward to exchang thi gold coin for silver coin to be melt down in the same manner some alter in the present proport seem to be the onli method of prevent thi inconveni the inconveni perhap would be less if silver wa rate in the coin as much abov it proper proport to gold as it is at present rate below it provid it wa at the same time enact that silver should not be a legal tender for more than the chang of a guinea in the same manner as copper is not a legal tender for more than the chang of a shill no creditor could in thi case be cheat in consequ of the high valuat of silver in coin as no creditor can at present be cheat in consequ of the high valuat of copper the banker onli would suffer by thi regul when a run come upon them thei sometim endeavour to gain time by pai in sixpenc and thei would be preclud by thi regul from thi discredit method of evad immedi payment thei would be oblig in consequ to keep at all time in their coffer a greater quantiti of cash than at present and though thi might no doubt be a consider inconveni to them it would at the same time be a consider secur to their creditor three pound seventeen shill and tenpenc halfpenni the mint price of gold certainli doe not contain even in our present excel gold coin more than an ounc of standard gold and it mai be thought therefor should not purchas more standard bullion but gold in coin is more conveni than gold in bullion and though in england the coinag is free yet the gold which is carri in bullion to the mint can seldom be return in coin to the owner till after a delai of sever week in the present hurri of the mint it could not be return till after a delai of sever month thi delai is equival to a small duti and render gold in coin somewhat more valuabl than an equal quantiti of gold in bullion if in the english coin silver wa rate accord to it proper proport to gold the price of silver bullion would probabl fall below the mint price even without ani reform of the silver coin the valu even of the present worn and defac silver coin be regul by the valu of the excel gold coin for which it can be chang a small seignorag or duti upon the coinag of both gold and silver would probabl increas still more the superior of those metal in coin abov an equal quantiti of either of them in bullion the coinag would in thi case increas the valu of the metal coin in proport to the extent of thi small duti for the same reason that the fashion increas the valu of plate in proport to the price of that fashion the superior of coin abov bullion would prevent the melt down of the coin and would discourag it export if upon ani public exig it should becom necessari to export the coin the greater part of it would soon return again of it own accord abroad it could sell onli for it weight in bullion at home it would bui more than that weight there would be a profit therefor in bring it home again in franc a seignorag of about eight per cent is impos upon the coinag and the french coin when export is said to return home again of it own accord the occasion fluctuat in the market price of gold and silver bullion aris from the same caus as the like fluctuat in that of all other commod the frequent loss of those metal from variou accid by sea and by land the continu wast of them in gild and plate in lace and embroideri in the wear and tear of coin and in that of plate requir in all countri which possess no mine of their own a continu import in order to repair thi loss and thi wast the merchant import like all other merchant we mai believ endeavour as well as thei can to suit their occasion import to what thei judg is like to be the immedi demand with all their attent howev thei sometim overdo the busi and sometim underdo it when thei import more bullion than is want rather than incur the risk and troubl of export it again thei ar sometim will to sell a part of it for someth less than the ordinari or averag price when on the other hand thei import less than is want thei get someth more than thi price but when under all those occasion fluctuat the market price either of gold or silver bullion continu for sever year togeth steadili and constantli either more or less abov or more or less below the mint price we mai be assur that thi steadi and constant either superior or inferior of price is the effect of someth in the state of the coin which at that time render a certain quantiti of coin either of more valu or of less valu than the precis quantiti of bullion which it ought to contain the constanc and steadi of the effect suppos a proportion constanc and steadi in the caus the monei of ani particular countri is at ani particular time and place more or less an accur measur or valu accord as the current coin is more or less exactli agreeabl to it standard or contain more or less exactli the precis quantiti of pure gold or pure silver which it ought to contain if in england for exampl fortyfour guinea and a half contain exactli a pound weight of standard gold or eleven ounc of fine gold and on ounc of alloi the gold coin of england would be as accur a measur of the actual valu of good at ani particular time and place as the natur of the thing would admit but if by rub and wear fortyfour guinea and a half gener contain less than a pound weight of standard gold the diminut howev be greater in some piec than in other the measur of valu come to be liabl to the same sort of uncertainti to which all other weight and measur ar commonli expos as it rare happen that these ar exactli agreeabl to their standard the merchant adjust the price of hi good as well as he can not to what those weight and measur ought to be but to what upon an averag he find by experi thei actual ar in consequ of a like disord in the coin the price of good come in the same manner to be adjust not to the quantiti of pure gold or silver which the coin ought to contain but to that which upon an averag it is found by experi it actual doe contain by the monei price of good it is to be observ i understand alwai the quantiti of pure gold or silver for which thei ar sold without ani regard to the denomin of the coin six shill and eight penc for exampl in the time of edward i i consid as the same monei price with a pound sterl in the present time becaus it contain as nearli as we can judg the same quantiti of pure silver chapter vi of the compon part of the price of commod in that earli and rude state of societi which preced both the accumul of stock and the appropri of land the proport between the quantiti of labour necessari for acquir differ object seem to be the onli circumst which can afford ani rule for exchang them for on anoth if among a nation of hunter for exampl it usual cost twice the labour to kill a beaver which it doe to kill a deer on beaver should natur exchang for or be worth two deer it is natur that what is usual the produc of two dai or two hour labour should be worth doubl of what is usual the produc of on dai or on hour labour if the on speci of labour should be more sever than the other some allow will natur be made for thi superior hardship and the produc of on hour labour in the on wai mai frequent exchang for that of two hour labour in the other or if the on speci of labour requir an uncommon degre of dexter and ingenu the esteem which men have for such talent will natur give a valu to their produc superior to what would be due to

which must be spent in acquir them in the advanc state of societi allow of thi kind for superior hardship and superior skill ar commonli made in the wage of labour and someth of the same kind must probabl have taken place in it earliest and rudest period in thi state of thing the whole produc of labour belong to the labour and the quantiti of labour commonli emploi in acquir or produc ani

what wa suffici to replac hi stock to him and he could have no interest to emploi a great stock rather than a small on unless hi profit were to bear some proport to the extent of hi stock the profit

bear no proport to the quantiti the hardship or the ingenu of thi suppos labour of inspect and direct thei ar regul altogeth by the valu of the stock emploi and ar greater or smaller in proport to the

workmen ar emploi at the rate of fifteen pound a year each or at the expens of three hundr ayear in each manufactori let us suppos too that the coars materi annual wrought up in the on cost onli seven hundr pound while the finer materi in the other cost seven thousand the capit annual emploi in the on will in thi case amount onli to on thousand pound wherea that emploi in the other will amount to seven thousand three hundr pound at the rate of ten per cent therefor the undertak of the on will expect a yearli profit of about on hundr pound onli while that of the other will expect about seven hundr and thirti pound but though their profit ar so veri differ their labour of inspect and direct mai be either altogeth or veri nearli the same in mani great work almost the whole labour of thi

that hi profit should bear a regular proport to hi capit in the price of commod therefor the profit of stock constitut a compon part altogeth differ from the wage of labour and regul by quit differ

whole price of corn a fourth part it mai perhap be thought is necessari for replac the stock of the farmer or for compens the wear and tear of hi labour cattl and other instrument of husbandri but it must be consid that the price of ani instrument of husbandri such as a labour hors is itself made up of the same time part the rent of the land upon which he is rear the labour of tend and rear him and the profit of the farmer who advanc both the rent of thi land and the wage of thi labour though the price of the corn therefor mai pai the price as well as the mainten of the hors the whole price still resolv itself either immedi or ultim into the same three part of rent labour and profit in the price of flour or meal we must add to the price of the corn the profit of the miller and the wage of hi servant in the price of bread the profit of the baker and the wage of hi servant and in the price of both the labour of transport the corn from the hous of the farmer to that of the miller and from that of the miller to that of the baker togeth with the profit of those who advanc the wage of that labour the price of flax resolv itself into the same three part as that of corn in the price of linen we must add to thi price the wage of the flaxdress of the spinner of the weaver of the bleacher etc togeth with the profit of their respect employ as ani particular commod come to be more manufactur that part of the price which resolv itself into wage and profit come to be greater in proport to that which resolv itself into rent in the progress of the manufactur not onli the number of

which emploi the spinner becaus it not onli replac that capit with it profit but pai besid the wage of the weaver and the profit must alwai bear some proport to the capit in the most improv societi howev there ar alwai a few commod of which the price resolv itself into two part onli the wage of labour and the profit of stock and a still smaller number in which it consist altogeth in the wage of labour in the price of seafish for exampl on part pai the labour of the fisherman and the other the profit of the capit emploi in the fisheri rent veri seldom make ani part of it though it doe sometim

the price which is paid to them by the stonecutt is altogeth the wage of their labour neither rent nor profit make an part of it but the whole price of ani commod must still final resolv itself into

necessarili be profit to somebodi as the price or exchang valu of everi particular commod taken separ resolv itself into some on or other or all of those three part so that of all the commod which compos the whole annual produc of the labour of everi countri taken complexli must resolv itself into the same three part and be parcel out among differ inhabit of the countri either as the wage of

some on or other of these whoever deriv hi revenu from a fund which is hi own must draw it either from hi labour from hi stock or from hi land the revenu deriv from labour is call wage that deriv from stock by the person who manag or emploi it is call profit that deriv from it by the person who doe not emploi it himself but lend it to anoth is call the interest or the us of monei it is the compens which the borrow pai to the lender for the profit which he ha an opportun of make by the us of the monei part of that profit natur belong to the borrow who run the risk and take the troubl of emploi

be paid from some other sourc of revenu unless perhap the borrow is a spendthrift who contract a second debt in order to pai the interest of the first the revenu which proce altogeth from land is call rent and belong to the landlord the revenu of the farmer is deriv partli from hi labour and partli from hi stock to him land is onli the instrument which enabl him to earn the wage of thi labour and to make the profit of thi stock all tax and all the revenu which is found upon them all salari pension and annuiti of everi kind ar ultim deriv from some on or other of those three origin sourc of revenu and ar paid either immedi or mediat from the wage of labour the profit of stock or the rent of land when those three differ sort of revenu belong to differ person thei ar readili distinguish but when thei belong to the same thei ar sometim confound with on anoth at least in common languag a gentleman who farm a part of hi own estat after pai the expens of cultiv should gain both the rent of the landlord and the profit of the farmer he is apt to denomin howev hi whole gain profit and thu confound rent with profit at least in common languag the greater part of our north american and west indian planter ar in thi situat thei farm the greater part of them their own estat and accordingli we seldom hear of the rent of a plantat but frequent of it profit common farmer seldom emploi ani overs to direct the gener oper of the farm thei gener too work a good deal with their own hand as ploughmen harrow etc what remain of the crop after pai the rent therefor should not onli replac to them their stock emploi in cultiv togeth with it ordinari profit but pai them the wage which ar due to them both as labour and overs whatev remain howev after pai the rent and keep up the stock is call profit but wage evid make a part of it the farmer by save these wage must necessarili gain them wage therefor ar in thi case confound with profit an independ manufactur who ha stock enough both to purchas materi and to maintain himself till he can carri hi work to market should gain both the wage of a journeyman who work under a master and the profit which that master make by the sale of that journeyman work hi whole gain howev ar commonli call profit and wage ar in thi case too confound with profit a garden who cultiv hi own garden with hi own hand unit in hi own person the three differ charact of landlord farmer and labour hi produc therefor should pai him the rent of the first the profit of the second and the wage of the third the whole howev is commonli consid as the earn of hi labour both rent and profit ar in thi case confound with wage as in a civil countri there ar but few commod of which the exchang valu aris from labour onli rent and profit contribut larg to that of the far greater part of them so the annual produc of it labour will alwai be suffici to purchas or command a much greater quantiti of labour than what wa emploi in rais prepar and bring that produc to market if the societi were annual to emploi all the labour which it can annual purchas as the quantiti of labour would increas greatli everi year so the produc of everi succeed year would be of vastli greater valu than that of the forego but there is no countri in which the whole annual produc is emploi in maintain the industri the idl everywher consum a great part of it and accord to the differ proport in which it is annual divid between those two differ order of peopl it ordinari or averag valu must either annual increas or diminish or continu the same from on year to anoth chapter vii of the natur and market price of commod there is in everi societi or neighbourhood an ordinari or averag rate both of wage and profit in everi differ employ of labour and stock thi rate is natur regul as i shall shew hereaft partli by the gener circumst of the societi their rich or poverti their advanc stationari or declin condit and partli by the particular natur of each employ there is likewis in everi societi or neighbourhood an ordinari or averag rate of rent which is regul too as i shall shew hereaft partli by the gener circumst of the societi or neighbourhood in which the land is situat and partli by the natur or improv fertil of the land these ordinari or averag rate mai be call the natur rate of wage profit and rent at the time and place in which thei commonli prevail when the price of ani commod is neither more nor less than what is suffici to pai the rent of the land the wage of the labour and the profit of the stock emploi in rais prepar and bring it to market accord to their natur rate the commod is then sold for what mai be call it natur price the commod is then sold precis for what it is worth or for what it realli cost the person who bring it to market for though in common languag what is call the prime cost of ani commod doe not comprehend the profit of the person who is to sell it again yet if he sell it at a price which doe not allow him the ordinari rate of profit in hi neighbourhood he is evid a loser by the trade sinc by emploi hi stock in some other wai he might have made that profit hi profit besid is hi revenu the proper fund of hi subsist as while he is prepar and bring the good to market he advanc to hi workmen their wage or their subsist so he advanc to himself in the same manner hi own subsist which is gener suitabl to the profit which he mai reason expect from the sale of hi good unless thei yield him thi profit therefor thei do not repai him what thei mai veri properli be said to have realli cost him though the price therefor which leav him thi profit is not alwai the lowest at which a dealer mai sometim sell hi good it is the lowest at which he is like to sell them for ani consider time at least where there is perfect liberti or where he mai chang hi trade as often as he pleas the actual price at which ani commod is commonli sold is call it market price it mai either be abov or below or exactli the same with it natur price the market price of everi particular commod is regul by the proport between the quantiti which is actual brought to market and the demand of those who ar will to pai the natur price of the commod or the whole valu of the rent labour and profit which must be paid in order to bring it thither such peopl mai be call the effectu demand and their demand the effectu demand sinc it mayb suffici to effectu the bring of the commod to market it is differ from the absolut demand a veri poor man mai be said in some sens to have a demand for a coach and six he might like to have it but hi demand is not an effectu demand as the commod can never be brought to market in order to satisfi it when the quantiti of ani commod which is brought to market fall short of the effectu demand all those who ar will to pai the whole valu of the rent wage and profit which must be paid in order to bring it thither cannot be suppli with the quantiti which thei want rather than want it altogeth some of them will be will to give more a competit will immedi begin among them and the market price will rise more or less abov the natur price accord as either the great of the defici or the wealth and wanton luxuri of the competitor happen to anim more or less the eager of the competit among competitor of equal wealth and luxuri the same defici will gener occas a more or less eager competit accord as the acquisit of the commod happen to be of more or less import to them henc the exorbit price of the necessari of life dure the blockad of a town or in a famin when the quantiti brought to market exce the effectu demand it cannot be all sold to those who ar will to pai the whole valu of the rent wage and profit which must be paid in order to bring it thither some part must be sold to those who ar will to pai less and the low price which thei give for it must reduc the price of the whole the market price will sink more or less below the natur price accord as the great of the excess increas more or less the competit of the seller or accord as it happen to be more or less import to them to get immedi rid of the commod the same excess in the import of perish will occas a much greater competit than in that of durabl commod in the import of orang for exampl than in that of old iron when the quantiti brought to market is just suffici to suppli the effectu demand and no more the market price natur come to be either exactli or as nearli as can be judg of the same with the natur price the whole quantiti upon hand can be dispos of for thi price and can not be dispos of for more the competit of the differ dealer oblig them all to accept of thi price but doe not oblig them to accept of less the quantiti of everi commod brought to market natur suit itself to the effectu demand it is the interest of all those who emploi their land labour or stock in bring ani commod to market that the quantiti never should exce the effectu demand and it is the interest of all other peopl that it never should fall short of that demand if at ani time it exce the effectu demand some of the compon part of it price must be paid below their natur rate if it is rent the interest of the landlord will immedi prompt them to withdraw a part of their land and if it is wage or profit the interest of the labour in the on case and of their employ in the other will prompt them to withdraw a part of their labour or stock from thi employ the quantiti brought to market will soon be no more than suffici to suppli the effectu demand all the differ part of it price will rise to their natur rate and the whole price to it natur price if on the contrari the quantiti brought to market should at ani time fall short of the effectu demand some of the compon part of it price must rise abov their natur rate if it is rent the interest of all other landlord will natur prompt them to prepar more land for the rais of thi commod if it is wage or profit the interest of all other labour and dealer will soon prompt them to emploi more labour and stock in prepar and bring it to market the quantiti brought thither will soon be suffici to suppli the effectu demand all the differ part of it price will soon sink to their natur rate and the whole price to it natur price the natur price therefor is as it were the central price to which the price of all commod ar continu gravit differ accid mai sometim keep them suspend a good deal abov it and sometim forc them down even somewhat below it but whatev mai be the obstacl which hinder them from settl in thi centr of repos and continu thei ar constantli tend toward it the whole quantiti of industri annual emploi in order to bring ani commod to market natur suit itself in thi manner to the effectu demand it natur aim at bring alwai that precis quantiti thither which mai be suffici to suppli and no more than suppli that demand but in some employ the same quantiti of industri will in differ year produc veri differ quantiti of commod while in other it will produc alwai the same or veri nearli the same the same number of labour in husbandri will in differ year produc veri differ quantiti of corn wine oil hop etc but the same number of spinner or weaver will everi year produc the same or veri nearli the same quantiti of linen and woollen cloth it is onli the averag produc of the on speci of industri which can be suit in ani respect to the effectu demand and as it actual produc is frequent much greater and frequent much less than it averag produc the quantiti of the commod brought to market will sometim exce a good deal and sometim fall short a good deal of the effectu demand even though that demand therefor should continu alwai the same their market price will be liabl to great fluctuat will sometim fall a good deal below and sometim rise a good deal abov their natur price in the other speci of industri the produc of equal quantiti of labour be alwai the same or veri nearli the same it can be more exactli suit to the effectu demand while that demand continu the same therefor the market price of the commod is like to do so too and to be either altogeth or as nearli as can be judg of the same with the natur price that the price of linen and woollen cloth is liabl neither to such frequent nor to such great variat as the price of corn everi man experi will inform him the price of the on speci of commod vari onli with the variat in the demand that of the other vari not onli with the variat in the demand but with the much greater and more frequent variat in the quantiti of what is brought to market in order to suppli that demand the occasion and temporari fluctuat in the market price of ani commod fall chiefli upon those part of it price which resolv themselv into wage and profit that part which resolv itself into rent is less affect by them a rent certain in monei is not in the least affect by them either in it rate or in it valu a rent which consist either in a certain proport or in a certain quantiti of the rude produc is no doubt affect in it yearli valu by all the occasion and temporari fluctuat in the market price of that rude produc but it is seldom affect by them in it yearli rate in settl the term of the leas the landlord and farmer endeavour accord to their best judgment to adjust that rate not to the temporari and occasion but to the averag and ordinari price of the produc such fluctuat affect both the valu and the rate either of wage or of profit accord as the market happen to be either overstock or understock with commod or with labour with work done or with work to be done a public mourn rais the price of black cloth with which the market is almost alwai understock upon such occas and augment the profit of the merchant who possess ani consider quantiti of it it ha no effect upon the wage of the weaver the market is understock with commod not with labour with work done not with work to be done it rais the wage of journeymen tailor the market is here understock with labour there is an effectu demand for more labour for more work to be done than can be had it sink the price of colour silk and cloth and therebi reduc the profit of the merchant who have ani consider quantiti of them upon hand it sink too the wage of the workmen emploi in prepar such commod for which all demand is stop for six month perhap for a twelvemonth the market is here overstock both with commod and with labour but though the market price of everi particular commod is in thi manner continu gravit if on mai sai so toward the natur price yet sometim particular accid sometim natur caus and sometim particular regul of polici mai in mani commod keep up the market price for a long time togeth a good deal abov the natur price when by an increas in the effectu demand the market price of some particular commod happen to rise a good deal abov the natur price those who emploi their stock in suppli that market ar gener care to conceal thi chang if it wa commonli known their great profit would tempt so mani new rival to emploi their stock in the same wai that the effectu demand be fulli suppli the market price would soon be reduc to the natur price and perhap for some time even below it if the market is at a great distanc from the resid of those who suppli it thei mai sometim be abl to keep the secret for sever year togeth and mai so long enjoi their extraordinari profit without ani new rival secret of thi kind howev it must be acknowledg can seldom be long kept and the extraordinari profit can last veri littl longer than thei ar kept secret in manufactur ar capabl of be longer kept than secret in trade a dyer who ha found the mean of produc a particular colour with materi which cost onli half the price of those commonli made us of mai with good manag enjoi the advantag of hi discoveri as long as he live and even leav it as a legaci to hi poster hi extraordinari gain aris from the high price which is paid for hi privat labour thei properli consist in the high wage of that labour but as thei ar repeat upon everi part of hi stock and as their whole amount bear upon that account a regular proport to it thei ar commonli consid as extraordinari profit of stock such enhanc of the market price ar evid the effect of particular accid of which howev the oper mai sometim last for mani year togeth some natur product requir such a singular of soil and situat that all the land in a great countri which is fit for produc them mai not be suffici to suppli the effectu demand the whole quantiti brought to market therefor mai be dispos of to those who ar will to give more than what is suffici to pai the rent of the land which produc them togeth with the wage of the labour and the profit of the stock which were emploi in prepar and bring them to market accord to their natur rate such commod mai continu for whole centuri togeth to be sold at thi high price and that part of it which resolv itself into the rent of land is in thi case the part which is gener paid abov it natur rate the rent of the land which afford such singular and esteem product like the rent of some vineyard in franc of a peculiarli happi soil and situat bear no regular proport to the rent of other equal fertil and equal well cultiv land in it neighbourhood the wage of the labour and the profit of the stock emploi in bring such commod to market on the contrari ar seldom out of their natur proport to those of the other employ of labour and stock in their neighbourhood such enhanc of the market price ar evid the effect of natur caus which mai hinder the effectu demand from ever be fulli suppli and which mai continu therefor to oper for ever a monopoli grant either to an individu or to a trade compani ha the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactur the monopolist by keep the market constantli understock by never fulli suppli the effectu demand sell their commod much abov the natur price and rais their emolu whether thei consist in

particular employ the competit to a smaller number than might otherwis go into them have the same tendenc though in a less degre thei ar a sort of enlarg monopoli and mai frequent for ag togeth and in whole class of employ keep up the market price of particular commod abov the natur price and maintain both the wage of the labour and the profit of the stock emploi about them somewhat abov their natur rate such enhanc of the market price mai last as long as the regul of polici which give occas to them the market price of ani particular commod though it mai continu long abov can seldom continu long below it natur price whatev part of it wa paid below the natur rate the person whose interest it affect would immedi feel the loss and would immedi withdraw either so much land or no much labour or so much stock from be emploi about it that the quantiti brought to market would soon be no more than suffici to suppli the effectu demand it market price therefor would soon rise to the natur price thi at least would be the case where there wa perfect liberti the same statut of apprenticeship and other corpor law inde which when a manufactur is in prosper enabl the workman to rais hi wage a good deal abov their natur rate sometim oblig him when it decai to let them down a good deal below it as in the on case thei exclud mani peopl from hi employ so in the other thei exclud him from mani employ the effect of such regul howev is not near so durabl in sink the workman wage below as in rais them abov their natur rate their oper in the on wai mai endur for mani centuri but in the other it can last no longer than the live of some of the workmen who were bred to the busi in the time of it prosper when thei ar gone the number of those who ar afterward educ to the trade will natur suit itself to the effectu demand the polici must be as violent as that of indostan or ancient egypt where everi man wa bound by a principl of religion to follow the occup of hi father and wa suppos to commit the most horrid sacrileg if he chang it for anoth which can in ani particular employ and for sever gener togeth sink either the wage of labour or the profit of stock below their natur rate thi is all that i think necessari to be observ at present concern the deviat whether occasion or perman of the market price of commod from the natur price the natur price itself vari with the natur rate of each of it compon part of wage profit and rent and in everi societi thi rate vari accord to their circumst accord to their rich or poverti their advanc stationari or declin condit i shall in the four follow chapter endeavour to explain as fulli and distinctli as i can the caus of those differ variat first i shall endeavour to explain what ar the circumst which natur determin the rate of wage and in what manner those circumst ar affect by the rich or poverti by the advanc stationari or declin state of the societi secondli i shall endeavour to shew what ar the circumst which natur determin the rate of profit and in what manner too those circumst ar affect by the like variat in the state of the societi though pecuniari wage and profit ar veri differ in the differ employ of labour and stock yet a certain proport seem commonli to take place between both the pecuniari wage in all the differ employ of labour and the pecuniari profit in all the differ employ of stock thi proport it will appear hereaft depend partli upon the natur of the differ employ and partli upon the differ law and polici of the societi in which thei ar carri on but though in mani respect depend upon the law and polici thi proport seem to be littl affect by the rich or poverti of that societi by it advanc stationari or declin condit but to remain the same or veri nearli the same in all those differ state i shall in the third place endeavour to explain all the differ circumst which regul thi proport in the fourth and last place i shall endeavour to shew what ar the circumst which regul the rent of land and which either rais or lower the real price of all the differ substanc which it produc chapter viii of the wage of labour the produc of labour constitut the natur recomp or wage of labour in that origin state of thing which preced both the appropri of land and the accumul of stock the whole produc of labour belong to the labour he ha neither landlord nor master to share with him had thi state continu the wage of labour would have augment with all those improv in it product power to which the divis of labour give occas all thing would gradual have becom cheaper thei would have been produc by a smaller quantiti of labour and as the commod produc by equal quantiti of labour would natur in thi state of thing be exchang for on anoth thei would have been purchas likewis with the produc of a smaller quantiti but though all thing would have becom cheaper in realiti in appear mani thing might have becom dearer than befor or have been exchang for a greater quantiti of other good let us suppos for exampl that in the greater part of employ the product power of labour had been improv to tenfold or that a dai labour could produc ten time the quantiti of work which it had done origin but that in a particular employ thei had been improv onli to doubl or that a dai labour could produc onli twice the quantiti of work which it had done befor in exchang the produc of a dai labour in the greater part of employ for that of a dai labour in thi particular on ten time the origin quantiti of work in them would purchas onli twice the origin quantiti in it ani particular quantiti in it therefor a pound weight for exampl would appear to be five time dearer than befor in realiti howev it would be twice as cheap though it requir five time the quantiti of other good to purchas it it would requir onli half the quantiti of labour either to purchas or to produc it the acquisit therefor would be twice as easi as befor but thi origin state of thing in which the labour enjoi the whole produc of hi own labour could not last beyond the first introduct of the appropri of land and the accumul of stock it wa at an end therefor long befor the most consider improv were made in the product power of labour and it would be to no purpos to trace further what might have been it effect upon the recomp or wage of labour as soon as land becom privat properti the landlord demand a share of almost all the produc which the labour can either rais or collect from it hi rent make the first deduct from the produc of the labour which is emploi upon land it seldom happen that the person who till the ground ha wherewith to maintain himself till he reap the harvest hi mainten is gener advanc to him from the stock of a master the farmer who emploi him and who would have no interest to emploi him unless he wa to share in the produc of hi labour or unless hi stock wa to be replac to him with a profit thi profit make a second deduct from the produc of the labour which is emploi upon land the produc of almost all other labour is liabl to the like deduct of profit in all art and manufactur the greater part of the workmen stand in need of a master to advanc them the materi of their work and their wage and mainten till it be complet he share in the produc of their labour or in the valu which it add to the materi upon which it is bestow and in thi share consist hi profit it sometim happen inde that a singl independ workman ha stock suffici both to purchas the materi of hi work and to maintain himself till it be complet he is both master and workman and enjoi the whole produc of hi own labour or the whole valu which it add to the materi upon which it is bestow it includ what ar usual two distinct revenu belong to two distinct person the profit of stock and the wage of labour such case howev ar not veri frequent and in everi part of europ twenti workmen serv under a master for on that is independ and the wage of labour ar everywher understood to be what thei usual ar when the labour is on person and the owner of the stock which emploi him anoth what ar the common wage of labour depend everywher upon the contract usual made between those two parti whose interest ar by no mean the same the workmen desir to get as much the master to give as littl as possibl the former ar dispos to combin in order to rais the latter in order to lower the wage of labour it is not howev difficult to forese which of the two parti must upon all ordinari occas have the advantag in the disput and forc the other into a complianc with their term the master be fewer in number can combin much more easili and the law besid authoris or at least doe not prohibit their combin while it prohibit those of the workmen we have no act of parliament against combin to lower the price of work but mani against combin to rais it in all such disput the master can hold out much longer a landlord a farmer a master manufactur or merchant though thei did not emploi a singl workman could gener live a year or two upon the stock which thei have alreadi acquir mani workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarc ani a year without employ in the long run the workman mai be as necessari to hi master as hi master is to him but the necess is not so immedi we rare hear it ha been said of the combin of master though frequent of those of workmen but whoever imagin upon thi account that master rare combin is as ignor of the world as of the subject master ar alwai and everywher in a sort of tacit but constant and uniform combin not to rais the wage of labour abov their actual rate to violat thi combin is everywher a most unpopular action and a sort of reproach to a master among hi neighbour and equal we seldom inde hear of thi combin becaus it is the usual and on mai sai the natur state of thing which nobodi ever hear of master too sometim enter into particular combin to sink the wage of labour even below thi rate these ar alwai conduct with the utmost silenc and secreci till the moment of execut and when the workmen yield as thei sometim do without resist though sever felt by them thei ar never heard of by other peopl such combin howev ar frequent resist by a contrari defens combin of the workmen who sometim too without ani provoc of thi kind combin of their own accord to rais the price of their labour their usual pretenc ar sometim the high price of provis sometim the great profit which their master make by their work but whether their combin be offens or defens thei ar alwai abundantli heard of in order to bring the point to a speedi decis thei have alwai recours to the loudest clamour and sometim to the most shock violenc and outrag thei ar desper and act with the folli and extravag of desper men who must either starv or frighten their master into an immedi complianc with their demand the master upon these occas ar just as clamor upon the other side and never ceas to call aloud for the assist of the civil magistr and the rigor execut of those law which have been enact with so much sever against the combin of servant labour and journeymen the workmen accordingli veri seldom deriv ani advantag from the violenc of those tumultu combin which partli from the interposit of the civil magistr partli from the superior steadi of the master partli from the necess which the greater part of the workmen ar under of submit for the sake of present subsist gener end in noth but the punish or ruin of the ringlead but though in disput with their workmen master must gener have the advantag there is howev a certain rate below which it seem imposs to reduc for ani consider time the ordinari wage even of the lowest speci of labour a man must alwai live by hi work and hi wage must at least be suffici to maintain him thei must even upon most occas be somewhat more otherwis it would be imposs for him to bring up a famili and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first gener mr cantillon seem upon thi account to suppos that the lowest speci of common labour must everywher earn at least doubl their own mainten in order that on with anoth thei mai be enabl to bring up two children the labour of the wife on account of her necessari attend on the children be suppos no more than suffici to provid for herself but on half the children born it is comput die befor the ag of manhood the poorest labour therefor accord to thi account must on with anoth attempt to rear at least four children in order that two mai have an equal chanc of live to that ag but the necessari mainten of four children it is suppos mai be nearli equal to that of on man the labour of an ablebodi slave the same author add is comput to be worth doubl hi mainten and that of the meanest labour he think cannot be worth less than that of an ablebodi slave thu far at least seem certain that in order to bring up a famili the labour of the husband and wife togeth must even in the lowest speci of common labour be abl to earn someth more than what is precis necessari for their own mainten but in what proport whether in that abovement or mani other i shall not take upon me to determin there ar certain circumst howev which sometim give the labour an advantag and enabl them to rais their wage consider abov thi rate evid the lowest which is consist with common human when in ani countri the demand for those who live by wage labour journeymen servant of everi kind is continu increas when everi year furnish employ for a greater number than had been emploi the year befor the workmen have no occas to combin in order to rais their wage the scarciti of hand occas a competit among master who bid against on anoth in order to get workmen and thu voluntarili break through the natur combin of master not to rais wage the demand for those who live by wage it is evid cannot increas but in proport to the increas of the fund which ar destin to the payment of wage these fund ar of two kind first the revenu which is over and abov what

seek it in the lowest the lowest class be not onli overstock with it own workmen but with the overflow of all the other class the competit for employ would be so great in it as to reduc the wage of labour to the most miser and scanti subsist of the labour mani would not be abl to find employ even upon these hard term but would either starv or be driven to seek a subsist either by beg or by the

three or four hundr thousand peopl die of hunger in on year we mayb assur that the fund destin for the mainten of the labour poor ar fast decai the differ between the geniu of the british constitut which protect and govern north america and that of the mercantil compani which oppress and domin in the east indi cannot perhap be better illustr than by the differ state of those countri the liber reward of labour therefor as it is the necessari effect so it is the natur symptom of increas nation wealth the scanti mainten of the labour poor on the other hand is the natur symptom that thing ar at a stand and their starv condit that thei ar go fast backward in great britain the wage of labour seem in the present time to be evid more than what is precis necessari to enabl the labour to bring up a famili in order to satisfi ourselv upon thi point it will not be necessari to enter into ani tediou or doubt calcul of what mai be the lowest sum upon winch it is possibl to do thi there ar mani plain symptom that the wage of labour ar nowher in thi countri regul by thi lowest rate which is consist with common human first in almost everi part of great britain there is a distinct even in the lowest speci of labour between summer and winter wage summer wage ar alwai highest but on account of the extraordinari expens of fuel the mainten of a famili is most expens in winter wage therefor be highest when thi expens is lowest it seem evid that thei ar not regul by what is necessari for thi expens but by the quantiti and suppos valu of the work a labour it mai be said inde ought to save part of hi summer wage in order to defrai hi winter expens and that through the whole year thei do not exce what is necessari to maintain hi famili through the whole year a slave howev or on absolut depend on us for immedi subsist would not be treat in thi manner hi daili subsist would be proport to hi daili necess secondli the wage of labour do not in great britain fluctuat with the price of provis these vari everywher from year to year frequent from month to month but in mani place the monei price of labour remain uniformli the same sometim for half a centuri togeth if in these place therefor the labour poor can maintain their famili in dear year thei must be at their eas in time of moder plenti and in affluenc in those of extraordinari cheap the high price of provis dure these ten year past ha not in mani part of the kingdom been accompani with ani sensibl rise in the monei price of labour it ha inde in some ow probabl more to the increas of the demand for labour than to that of the price of provis thirdli as the price of provis vari more from year to year than the wage of labour so on the other hand the wage of labour vari more from place to place than the price of provis the price of bread and butcher meat ar gener the same or veri nearli the same through the greater part of the unit kingdom these and most other thing which ar sold by retail the wai in which the labour poor bui all thing ar gener fulli as cheap or cheaper in great town than in the remot part of the countri for reason which i shall have occas to explain hereaft but the wage of labour in a great town and it neighbourhood ar frequent a fourth or a fifth part twenti or fiveandtwenti per cent higher than at a few mile distanc eighteen penc a dai mai be reckon the common price of labour in london and it neighbourhood at a few mile distanc it fall to fourteen and fifteen penc tenpenc mai be reckon it price in edinburgh and it neighbourhood at a few mile distanc it fall to eightpenc the usual price of common labour through the greater part of the low countri of scotland where it vari a good deal less than in england such a differ of price which it seem is not alwai suffici to transport a man from on parish to anoth would necessarili occas so great a transport of the most bulki commod not onli from on parish to anoth but from on end of the kingdom almost from on end of the world to the other as would soon reduc them more nearli to a level after all that ha been said of the leviti and inconst of human natur it appear evid from experi that man is of all sort of luggag the most difficult to be transport if the labour poor therefor can maintain their famili in those part of the kingdom where the price of labour is lowest thei must be in affluenc where it is highest fourthli the variat in the price of labour not onli do not correspond either in place or time with those in the price of provis but thei ar frequent quit opposit grain the food of the common peopl is dearer in scotland than in england whenc scotland receiv almost everi year veri larg suppli but english corn must be sold dearer in scotland the countri to which it is brought than in england the countri from which it come and in proport to it qualiti it cannot be sold dearer in scotland than the scotch corn that come to the same market in competit with it the qualiti of grain depend chiefli upon the quantiti of flour or meal which it yield at the mill and in thi respect english grain is so much superior to the scotch that though often dearer in appear or in proport to the measur of it bulk it is gener cheaper in realiti or in proport to it qualiti or even to the measur of it weight the price of labour on the contrari is dearer in england than in scotland if the labour poor therefor can maintain their famili in the on part of the unit kingdom thei must be in affluenc in the other oatmeal inde suppli the common peopl in scotland with the greatest and the best part of their food which is in gener much inferior to that of their neighbour of the same rank in england thi differ howev in the mode of their subsist is not the caus but the effect of the differ in their wage though by a strang misapprehens i have frequent heard it repres as the caus it is not becaus on man keep a coach while hi neighbour walk afoot that the on is rich and the other poor but becaus the on is rich he keep a coach and becaus the other is poor he walk afoot dure the cours of the last centuri take on year with anoth grain wa dearer in both part of the unit kingdom than dure that of the present thi is a matter of fact which cannot now admit of ani reason doubt and the proof of it is if possibl still more decis with regard to scotland than with regard to england it is in scotland support by the evid of the public fiar annual valuat made upon oath accord to the actual state of the market of all the differ sort of grain in everi differ counti of scotland if such direct proof could requir ani collater evid to confirm it i would observ that thi ha likewis been the case in franc and probabl in most other part of europ with regard to franc there is the clearest proof but though it is certain that in both part of the unit kingdom grain wa somewhat dearer in the last centuri than in the present it is equal certain that labour wa much cheaper if the labour poor therefor could bring up their famili then thei must be much more at their eas now in the last centuri the most usual daywag of common labour through the greater part of scotland were sixpenc in summer and fivep in winter three

ordinari variat of the price of provis those two opposit caus seem to counterbal on anoth which is probabl in part the reason why the wage of labour ar everywher so much more steadi and perman than the price of provis the increas in the wage of labour necessarili increas the price of mani commod by increas that part of it which resolv itself into wage and so far tend to diminish their consumpt

when the stock of mani rich merchant ar turn into the same trade their mutual competit natur tend to lower it profit and when there is a like increas of stock in all the differ trade carri on in the

and in the cours of their progress their pace seem rather to have been gradual acceler than retard thei seem not onli to have been go on but to have been go on faster and faster the wage of labour

ani sort of trade in a great town than in a countri villag the great stock emploi in everi branch of trade and the number of rich competitor gener reduc the rate of profit in the former below what it is in the latter but the wage of labour ar gener higher in a great town than in a countri villag in a thrive town the peopl who have great stock to emploi frequent cannot get the number of workmen thei want and therefor bid against on anoth in order to get as mani as thei can which rais the wage of labour and lower the profit of stock in the remot part of the countri there is frequent not stock suffici to emploi all the peopl who therefor bid against on anoth in order to get employ which lower the wage of labour and rais the profit of stock in scotland though the legal rate of interest is the same as in england the market rate is rather higher peopl of the best credit there seldom borrow under five per cent even privat banker in edinburgh give four per cent upon their promissorynot of which payment either in whole or in part mai be demand at pleasur privat banker in london give no interest for the monei which is deposit with them there ar few trade which cannot be carri on with a smaller stock in scotland than in england the common rate of profit therefor must be somewhat greater the wage of labour it ha alreadi been observ ar lower in scotland than in england the countri too is not onli much poorer but the step by which it advanc to a better condit for it is evid advanc seem to be much slower and more tardi the legal rate of interest in franc ha not dure the cours of the

a purpos which ha sometim been execut franc is perhap in the present time not so rich a countri as england and though the legal rate of interest ha in franc frequent been lower than in england the market rate ha gener been higher for there as in other countri thei have sever veri safe and easi method of evad the law the profit of trade i have been assur by british merchant who had trade in both countri ar higher in franc than in england and it is no doubt upon thi account that mani british subject chuse rather to emploi their capit in a countri where trade is in disgrac than in on where it is highli respect the wage of labour ar lower in franc than in england when you go from scotland to england the differ which you mai remark between the dress and counten of the common peopl in the on countri and in the other suffici indic the differ in their condit the contrast is still greater when you return from franc franc though no doubt a richer countri than scotland seem not to be go forward so fast it is a common and even a popular opinion in the countri that it is go backward an opinion which i apprehend is illfound even with regard to franc but which nobodi can possibl entertain with regard to scotland who see the countri now and who saw it twenti or thirti year ago the provinc of holland on the other hand in proport to the extent of it territori and the number of it peopl is a richer countri than england the govern there borrow at two per cent and privat peopl of good credit at three the wage of labour ar said to be higher in holland than in england and the dutch it is well known trade upon lower profit than ani peopl in europ the trade of holland it ha been pretend by some peopl is decai and it mai perhap be true that some particular branch of it ar so but these symptom seem to indic suffici that there is no gener decai when profit diminish merchant ar veri apt to complain that trade decai though the diminut of profit is the natur effect of it prosper or of a greater stock be emploi in it than befor dure the late war the dutch gain the whole carri trade of franc of which thei still retain a veri larg share the great properti which thei possess both in french and english fund about forti million it is said in the latter in which i suspect howev there is a consider exagger the great sum which thei lend to privat peopl in countri where the rate of interest is higher than in their own ar circumst which no doubt demonstr the redund of their stock or that it ha increas beyond what thei can emploi with toler profit in the proper busi of their own countri but thei do not demonstr that that busi ha decreas as the capit of a privat man though acquir by a particular trade mai increas beyond what he can emploi in it and yet that trade continu to increas too so mai likewis the capit of a great nation in our north american and west indian coloni not onli the wage of labour but the interest of monei and consequ the profit of stock ar higher than in england in the differ coloni both the legal and the market rate of interest run from six to eight percent high wage of labour and high profit of stock howev ar thing perhap which scarc ever go togeth except in the peculiar circumst of new coloni a new coloni must alwai for some time be more understock in proport to the extent of it territori and more underpeopl in proport to the extent of it stock than the greater part of other countri thei have more land than thei have stock to cultiv what thei have therefor is appli to the cultiv onli of what is most fertil and most favour situat the land near the seashor and along the bank of navig river such land too is frequent purchas at a price below the valu even of it natur produc stock emploi in the purchas and improv of such land must yield a veri larg profit and consequ afford to pai a veri larg interest it rapid accumul in so profit an employ enabl the planter to increas the number of hi hand faster than he can find them in a new settlement those whom he can find therefor ar veri liber reward as the coloni increas the profit of stock gradual diminish when the most fertil and best situat land have been all occupi less profit can be made by the cultiv of what is inferior both in soil and situat and less interest can be afford for the stock which is so emploi in the greater part of our coloni accordingli both the legal and the market rate of interest have been consider reduc dure the cours of the present centuri as rich improv and popul have increas interest ha declin the wage of labour do not sink with the profit of stock the demand for labour increas with the increas of stock whatev be it profit and after these ar diminish stock mai not onli continu to increas but to increas much faster than befor it is with industri nation who ar advanc in the acquisit of rich as with industri individu a great stock though with small profit gener increas faster than a small stock with great profit monei sai the proverb make monei when you have got a littl it is often easi to get more the great difficulti is to get that littl the connect between the increas of stock and that of industri or of the demand for us labour ha partli been explain alreadi but will be explain more fulli hereaft in treat of the accumul of stock the acquisit of new territori or of new branch of trade mai sometim rais the profit of stock and with them the interest of monei even in a countri which is fast advanc in the acquisit of rich the stock of the countri not be suffici for the whole access of busi which such acquisit present to the differ peopl among whom it is divid is appli to those particular branch onli which afford the greatest profit part of what had befor been emploi in other trade is necessarili withdrawn from them and turn into some of the new and more profit on in all those old trade therefor the competit come to be jess than befor the market come to be less fulli suppli with mani differ sort of good their price necessarili rise more or less and yield a greater profit to those who deal in them who can therefor afford to borrow at a higher interest for some time after the conclus of the late war not onli privat peopl of the best credit but some of the greatest compani in london commonli borrow at five per cent who befor that had not been us to pai more than four and four and a half per cent the great access both of territori and trade by our acquisit in north america and the west indi will suffici account for thi without suppos ani diminut in the capit stock of the societi so great an access of new busi to be carri on by the old stock must necessarili have diminish the quantiti emploi in a great number of particular branch in which the competit be less the profit must have been greater i shall hereaft have occas to mention the reason which dispos me to believ that the capit stock of great britain wa not diminish even by the enorm expens of the late war the diminut of the capit stock of the societi or of the fund destin for the mainten of industri howev as it lower the wage of labour so it rais the profit of stock and consequ the interest of monei by the wage of labour be lower the owner of what stock remain in the societi can bring their good at less expens to market than befor and less stock be emploi in suppli the market than befor thei can sell them dearer their good cost them less and thei get more for them their profit therefor be augment at both end can well afford a larg interest the great fortun so suddenli and so easili acquir in bengal and the other british settlement in the east indi mai satisfi us that as the wage of labour ar veri low so the profit of stock ar veri high in those ruin countri the interest of monei is proportion so in bengal monei is frequent lent to the farmer at forti fifti and sixti per cent and the succeed crop is mortgag for the payment as the profit which can afford such an interest must eat up almost the whole rent of the landlord so such enorm usuri must in it turn eat up the greater part of those profit befor the fall of the roman republ a usuri of the same kind seem to have been common in the provinc under the ruinou administr of their proconsul the virtuou brutu lent monei in cypru at eightandforti per cent as we learn from the letter of cicero in a countri which had acquir that full complement of rich which the natur of it soil and climat and it situat with respect to other countri allow it to acquir which could therefor advanc no further and which wa not go backward both the wage of labour and the profit of stock would probabl be veri low in a countri fulli peopl in proport to what either it territori could maintain or it stock emploi the competit for employ would necessarili be so great as to reduc the wage of labour to what wa bare suffici to keep up the number of labour and the countri be alreadi fulli peopl that number could never be augment in a countri fulli stock in proport to all the busi it had to transact as great a quantiti of stock would be emploi in everi particular branch as the natur and extent of the trade would admit the competit therefor would everywher be as great and consequ the ordinari profit as low as possibl but perhap no countri ha ever yet arriv at thi degre of opul china seem to have been long stationari and had probabl long ago acquir that full complement of rich which is consist with the natur of it law and institut but thi complement mai be much inferior to what with other law and institut the natur of it soil climat and situat might admit of a countri which neglect or despis foreign commerc and which admit the vessel of foreign nation into on or two of it port onli cannot transact the same quantiti of busi which it might do with differ law and institut in a countri too where though the rich or the owner of larg capit enjoi a good deal of secur the poor or the owner of small capit enjoi scarc ani but ar liabl under the pretenc of justic to be pillag and plunder at ani time by the inferior mandarin the quantiti of stock emploi in all the differ branch of busi transact within it can never be equal to what the natur and extent of that busi might admit in everi differ branch the oppress of the poor must establish the monopoli of the rich who by engross the whole trade to themselv will be abl to make veri larg profit twelv per cent accordingli is said to be the common interest of monei in china and the ordinari profit of stock must be suffici to afford thi larg interest a defect in the law mai sometim rais the rate of interest consider abov what the condit of the countri as to wealth or poverti would requir when the law doe not enforc the perform of contract it put all borrow nearli upon the same foot with bankrupt or peopl of doubt credit in better regul countri the uncertainti of recov hi monei make the lender exact the same usuri interest which is usual requir from bankrupt among the barbar nation who overran the western provinc of the roman empir the perform of contract wa left for mani ag to the faith of the contract parti the court of justic of their king seldom intermeddl in it the high rate of interest which took place in those ancient time mai perhap be partli account for from thi caus when the law prohibit interest altogeth it doe not prevent it mani peopl must borrow and nobodi will lend without such a consider for the us of their monei as is suitabl not onli to what can be made by the us of it but to the difficulti and danger of evad the law the high rate of interest among all mahometan nation is account for by m montesquieu not from their poverti but partli from thi and partli from the difficulti of recov the monei the lowest ordinari rate of profit must alwai be someth more than what is suffici to compens the occasion loss to which everi employ of stock is expos it is thi surplu onli which is neat or clear profit what is call gross profit comprehend frequent not onli thi surplu but what is retain for compens such extraordinari loss the interest which the borrow can afford to pai is in proport to the clear profit onli the lowest ordinari rate of interest must in the same manner be someth more than suffici to compens the occasion loss to which lend even with toler prudenc is expos were it not mere chariti or friendship could be the onli motiv for lend in a countri which had acquir it full complement of rich where in everi particular branch of busi there wa the greatest quantiti of stock that could be emploi in it as the ordinari rate of clear profit would be veri small so the usual market rate of interest which could be afford out of it would be so low as to render it imposs for ani but the veri wealthiest peopl to live upon the interest of their monei all peopl of small or middl fortun would be oblig to superintend themselv the employ of their own stock it would be necessari that almost everi man should be a man of busi or engag in some sort

there so doe an idl man among men of busi the highest ordinari rate of profit mai be such as in the price of the greater part of commod eat up the whole of what should go to the rent of the land and leav onli what is suffici to pai the labour of prepar and bring them to market accord to the lowest rate at which labour can anywher be paid the bare subsist of the labour the workman must alwai have been fed in some wai or other while he wa about the work but the landlord mai not alwai have been paid the profit of the trade which the servant of the east india compani carri on in bengal mai not perhap be veri far from thi rate the proport which the usual market rate of interest ought to bear to the ordinari rate of clear profit necessarili vari as profit rise or fall doubl interest is in great britain reckon what the merchant call a good moder reason profit term which i apprehend mean no more than a common and usual profit in a countri where the ordinari rate of clear profit is eight or ten per cent it mai be reason that on half of it should go to interest wherev busi is carri on with borrow monei the stock is at the risk of the borrow who as it were insur it to the lender and four or five per cent mai in the greater part of trade be both a suffici profit upon the risk of thi insur and a suffici recomp for the troubl of emploi the stock but the proport between interest and clear profit might not be the same in countri where the ordinari rate of profit wa either a good deal lower or a good deal higher if it were a good deal lower on half of it perhap could not be afford for interest and more might be afford if it were a good deal higher in countri which ar fast advanc to rich the low rate of profit mai in the price of mani commod compens the high wage of labour and enabl those countri to sell as cheap as their less thrive neighbour among whom the wage of labour mai be lower in realiti high profit tend much more to rais the price of work than high wage if in the

of pecuniari gain all thing consid thei ar gener underrecompens as i shall endeavour to shew by and by disgrac ha the contrari effect the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odiou busi but it is in most place more profit than the greater part of common trade the most detest of all employ that of public execution is in proport to the quantiti of work done better paid than ani common trade whatev

diminish more peopl would appli to them and the competit would quickli reduc the price of their labour such talent though far from be common ar by no mean so rare as imagin mani peopl possess them in great perfect who disdain to make thi us of them and mani more ar capabl of acquir them if ani thing could be made honour by them the overween conceit which the greater part of men have of their own abil is an ancient evil remark by the philosoph and moralist of all ag their absurd presumpt in their own good fortun ha been less taken notic of it is howev if possibl still more univers there is no man live who when in toler health and spirit ha not some share of it the chanc of gain is by everi man more or less overvalu and the chanc of loss is by most men undervalu and by scarc ani man who is in toler health and spirit valu more than it is worth that the chanc of gain is natur overvalu we mai learn from the univers success of lotteri the world neither ever saw nor ever will see a perfectli fair lotteri or on in which the whole gain compens the whole loss becaus the undertak could make noth by it in the state lotteri the ticket ar realli not worth the price which is paid by the origin subscrib and yet commonli sell in the market for twenti thirti and sometim forti per cent advanc the vain hope of gain some of the great prize is the sole caus of thi demand the soberest peopl scarc look upon it as a folli to pai a small sum for the chanc of gain ten or twenti thousand pound though thei know that even that small sum is perhap twenti or thirti per cent more than the chanc is worth in a lotteri in which no prize exceed twenti pound though in other respect it approach much nearer to a perfectli fair on than the common state lotteri there would not be the same demand for ticket in order to have a better chanc for some of the great prize some peopl purchas sever ticket and other small share in a still greater number there is not howev a more certain proposit in mathemat than that the more ticket you adventur upon the more like you ar to be a loser adventur upon all the ticket in the lotteri and you lose for certain and the greater the number of your ticket the nearer you approach to thi certainti that the chanc of loss is frequent undervalu and scarc ever valu more than it is worth we mai learn from the veri moder profit of insur in order to make insur either from fire or searisk a trade at all the common premium must be suffici to compens the common loss to pai the expens of manag and to afford such a profit as might have been drawn from an equal capit emploi in ani common trade the person who pai no more than thi evid pai no more than the real valu of the risk or the lowest price at which he can reason expect to insur it but though mani peopl have made a littl monei by insur veri few have made a great fortun and from thi consider alon it seem evid enough that the ordinari balanc of profit and loss is not more advantag in thi than in other common trade by which so mani peopl make fortun moder howev as the premium of insur commonli is mani peopl despis the risk too much to care to pai it take the whole kingdom at an averag nineteen hous in twenti or rather perhap ninetynin in a hundr ar not insur from fire searisk is more alarm to the greater part of peopl and the proport of ship insur to those not insur is much greater mani sail howev at all season and even in time of war without ani insur thi mai sometim perhap be done without ani imprud when a great compani or even a great merchant ha twenti or thirti ship at sea thei mai as it were insur on anoth the premium save up on them all mai more than compens such loss as thei ar like to meet with in the common cours of chanc the neglect of insur upon ship howev in the same manner as upon hous is in most case the effect of no such nice calcul but of mere thoughtless rash and presumptu contempt of the risk the contempt of risk and the presumptu hope of success ar in no period of life more activ than at the ag at which young peopl choos their profess how littl the fear of misfortun is then capabl of balanc the hope of good luck appear still more evid in the readi of the common peopl to enlist as soldier or to go to sea than in the eager of those of better fashion to enter into what ar call the liber profess what a common soldier mai lose is obviou enough without regard the danger howev young volunt never enlist so readili as at the begin of a new war and though thei have scarc ani chanc of prefer thei figur to themselv in their youth fanci a thousand occas of acquir honour and distinct which never occur these romant hope make the whole price of their blood their pai is less than that of common labour and in actual servic their fatigu ar much greater the lotteri of the sea is not altogeth so disadvantag as that of the armi the son of a credit labour or artific mai frequent go to sea with hi father consent but if he enlist as a soldier it is alwai without it other peopl see some chanc of hi make someth by the on trade nobodi but himself see ani of hi make ani thing by the other the great admir is less the object of public admir than the great gener and the highest success in the sea servic promis a less brilliant fortun and reput than equal success in the land the same differ run through all the inferior degre of prefer in both by the rule of preced a captain in the navi rank with a colonel in the armi but he doe not rank with him in the common estim as the great prize in the lotteri ar less the smaller on must be more numer common sailor therefor more frequent get some fortun and prefer than common soldier and the hope of those prize is what princip recommend the trade though their skill and dexter ar much superior to that of almost ani artific and though their whole life is on continu scene of hardship and danger yet for all thi dexter and skill for all those hardship and danger while thei remain in the condit of common sailor thei receiv scarc ani other recomp but the pleasur of exercis the on and of surmount the other their wage ar not greater than those of common labour at the port which regul the rate of seamen wage as

the rate of the port to and from which the greatest number sail that is the port of london regul that of all the rest at london the wage of the greater part of the differ class of workmen ar about doubl those of the same class at edinburgh but the sailor who sail from the port of london seldom earn abov three or four shill a month more than those who sail from the port of leith and the differ is frequent not so great in time of peac and in the merchantservic the london price is from a guinea to about sevenandtwenti shill the calendar month a common labour in london at the rate of nine or ten shill a week mai earn in the calendar month from forti to fiveandforti shill the sailor inde over and abov hi pai is suppli with provis their valu howev mai not perhap alwai exce the differ between hi pai and that of the common labour and though it sometim should the excess will not be clear gain to the sailor becaus he cannot share it with hi wife and famili whom he must maintain out of hi wage at home the danger and hairbreadth escap of a life of adventur instead of dishearten young peopl seem frequent to recommend a trade to them a tender mother among the inferior rank of peopl is often afraid to send her son to school at a seaport town lest the sight of the ship and the convers and adventur of the sailor should entic him to go to sea the distant prospect of hazard from which we can hope to extric ourselv by courag and address is not disagre to us and doe not rais the wage of labour in ani employ it is otherwis with those in which courag and address can be of no avail in

differ employ of stock the ordinari rate of profit vari more or less with the certainti or uncertainti of the return these ar in gener less uncertain in the inland than in the foreign trade and in some branch of foreign trade than in other in the trade to north america for exampl than in that to jamaica the ordinari rate of profit alwai rise more or less with the risk it doe not howev seem to rise in proport to it or so as to compens it complet bankruptci ar most frequent in the most hazard trade the most hazard of all trade that of a smuggler though when the adventur succe it is likewis the most profit is the infal road to bankruptci the presumptu hope of success seem to act here as upon all other occas and to entic so mani adventur into those hazard trade that their competit reduc the profit below what is suffici to compens the risk to compens it complet the common return ought over and abov the ordinari profit of stock not onli to make up for all occasion loss but to afford a surplu profit to the adventur of the same natur with the profit of insur but if the common return were suffici for all thi bankruptci would not be more frequent in these than in other trade of the

disagre there is littl or no differ in the far greater part of the differ employ of stock but a great deal in those of labour and the ordinari profit of stock though it rise with the risk doe not alwai seem to rise in proport to it it should follow from all thi that in the same societi or neighbourhood the averag and ordinari rate of profit in the differ employ of stock should be more nearli upon a level than the pecuniari wage of the differ sort of labour thei ar so accordingli the differ between the earn of a common labour and those of a well emploi lawyer or physician is evid much greater than that between the ordinari profit in ani two differ branch of trade the appar differ besid in the profit of differ trade is gener a decept aris from our not alwai distinguish what ought to be consid as wage from what ought to be consid as profit apothecari profit is becom a byeword denot someth uncommonli extravag thi great appar profit howev is frequent no more than the reason wage of labour the skill of an apothecari is a much nicer and more delic matter than that of ani artific whatev and the trust which is repos in him is of much greater import he is the physician of the poor in

same place will scarc make eight or ten per cent upon a stock of ten thousand the trade of the grocer mai be necessari for the conveni of the inhabit and the narrow of the market mai not admit the

necessari for a great merchant which noth hinder him from becom but the want of a suffici capit thirti or forti pound a year cannot be consid as too great a recomp for the labour of a person so accomplish deduct thi from the seemingli great profit of hi capit and littl more will remain perhap than the ordinari profit of stock the greater part of the appar profit is in thi case too real wage the differ between the appar profit of the retail and that of the wholesal trade is much less in the capit than in small town and countri villag where ten thousand pound can be emploi in the groceri trade the wage of the grocer labour must be a veri trifl addit to the real profit of so great a stock the appar profit of the wealthi retail therefor ar there more nearli upon a level with those of the wholesal merchant it is upon thi account that good sold by retail ar gener as cheap and frequent much cheaper in the capit than in small town and countri villag groceri good for exampl ar gener much cheaper bread and butcher meat frequent as cheap it cost no more to bring groceri good to the great town than to the countri villag but it cost a great deal more to bring corn and cattl as the greater part of them must be brought from a much greater distanc the prime cost of groceri good therefor be the same in both place thei ar cheapest where the least profit is charg upon them the prime cost of bread and butcher meat is greater in the great town than in the countri villag and though the profit is less therefor thei ar not alwai cheaper there but often equal cheap in such articl as bread and butcher meat the same caus which diminish appar profit increas prime cost the extent of the market by give employ to greater stock diminish appar profit but by requir suppli from a greater distanc it increas prime cost thi diminut of the on and increas of the other seem in most case nearli to counterbal on anoth which is probabl the reason that though the price of corn and cattl ar commonli veri differ in differ part of the kingdom those of bread and butcher meat ar gener veri nearli the same through the greater part of it though the profit of stock both in the wholesal and retail trade ar gener less in the capit than in small town and countri villag yet great fortun ar frequent acquir from small begin in the former and scarc ever in the latter in small town and countri villag on account of the narrow of the market trade cannot alwai be extend as stock extend in such place therefor though the rate of a particular person profit mai be veri high the sum or amount of them can never be veri great nor consequ that of hi annual accumul in great town on the contrari trade can be extend as stock increas and the credit of a frugal and thrive man increas much faster than hi stock hi trade is extend in proport to the amount of both and the sum or amount of hi profit is in proport to the extent of hi trade and hi annual accumul in proport to the amount of hi profit it seldom happen howev that great fortun ar made even in great town by ani on regular establish and wellknown branch of busi but in consequ of a long life of industri frugal and attent sudden fortun inde

for it is far more than an equal chanc but that thei will have the certif person again and in a wors condit the moral of thi observ seem to be that certif ought alwai to be requir by the parish where

europ to the silver mine of potosi the moneypric of labour could be veri cheap it is otherwis when cultiv is extend over the greater part of the countri there is then more bread than butcher meat the competit chang it direct and the price of butcher meat becom greater than the price of bread by the extens besid of cultiv the unimprov wild becom insuffici to suppli the demand for butcher meat a great part of the cultiv land must be emploi in rear and fatten cattl of which the price therefor must be suffici to pai not onli the labour necessari for tend them but the rent which the landlord and the profit which the farmer could have drawn from such land emploi in tillag the cattl bred upon the most uncultiv moor when brought to the same market ar in proport to their weight or good sold at the same price as those which ar rear upon the most improv land the proprietor of those moor profit by it and rais the rent of their land in proport to the price of their cattl it is not more than a centuri ago that in mani part of the highland of scotland butcher meat wa as cheap or cheaper than even bread made of oatmeal the union open the market of england to the highland cattl their ordinari price at present is about three time greater than at the begin of the centuri and the rent of mani highland estat have been tripl and quadrupl in the same time in almost everi part of great britain a pound of the best butcher meat is in the present time gener worth more than two pound of the best white bread and in plenti year it is sometim worth three or four pound it is thu that in the progress of improv the rent and profit of unimprov pastur come to be regul in some measur by the rent and profit of what is improv and these again by the rent and profit of corn corn is an annual crop butcher meat a crop which requir four or five year to grow as an acr of land therefor will produc a much smaller quantiti of the on speci of food than of the other the inferior of the quantiti must be compens by the superior of the price if it wa more than compens more cornland would be turn into pastur and if it wa not compens part of what wa in pastur would be brought back into corn thi equal howev

onli through the greater part of the improv land of a great countri in some particular local situat it is quit otherwis and the rent and profit of grass ar much superior to what can be made by corn

countri too of which the princip produc is corn a wellinclos piec of grass will frequent rent higher than ani corn field in it neighbourhood it is conveni for the mainten of the cattl emploi in the cultiv of the corn and it high rent is in thi case not so properli paid from the valu of it own produc as from that of the corn land which ar cultiv by mean of it it is like to fall if ever the neighbour land ar complet inclos the present high rent of inclos land in scotland seem ow to the scarciti of inclosur and will probabl last no longer than that scarciti the advantag of inclosur is greater for pastur than for corn it save the labour of guard the cattl which feed better too when thei ar not liabl to be disturb by their keeper or hi dog but where there is no local advantag of thi

grass of turnip carrot cabbag and the other expedi which have been fallen upon to make an equal quantiti of land feed a greater number of cattl than when in natur grass should somewhat reduc it might be expect the superior which in an improv countri the price of butcher meat natur ha over that of bread it seem accordingli to have done so and there is some reason for believ that at least in the london market the price of butcher meat in proport to the price of bread is a good deal lower in the present time than it wa in the begin of the last centuri in the appendix to the life of princ henri doctor birch ha given us an account of the price of butcher meat as commonli paid by that princ it is there said that the four quarter of an ox weigh six hundr pound usual cost him nine pound ten shill or thereabout that is thirtyon shill and eightpenc per hundr pound weight princ henri di on the th of novemb in the nineteenth year of hi ag in march there wa a parliamentari inquiri into the caus of the high price of provis at that time it wa then among other proof to the same purpos given in evid by a virginia merchant that in march he had victual hi ship for twentyfour or twentyf shill the hundr weight of beef which he consid as the ordinari price wherea in that dear year he had paid twentyseven shill for the same weight and sort thi high price in is howev four shill and eightpenc cheaper than the ordinari price paid by princ henri and it is the best beef onli it must be observ which is fit to be salt for those distant voyag the price paid by princ henri amount to d th per pound weight of the whole carcas coars and choic piec taken togeth and at that rate the choic piec could not have been sold by retail for less than d or d the pound in the parliamentari inquiri in the wit state the price of the choic piec of the best beef to be to the consum d and d the pound and the coars piec in gener to be from seven farth to d and d and thi thei said wa in gener on halfpenni dearer than the same sort of piec had usual been sold in the month of march but even thi high price is still a good deal cheaper than what we can well suppos the ordinari retail price to have been in the time of princ henri dure the first twelv year of the last centuri the averag price of the best wheat at the windsor market wa d the quarter of nine winchest bushel but in the twelv year preced includ that year the averag price of the same measur of the best wheat at the same market wa d in the first twelv year of the last centuri therefor wheat appear to have been a good deal cheaper and butcher meat a good deal dearer than in the twelv year preced includ that year in all great countri the greater part of the cultiv land ar emploi in produc either food for men or food for cattl the rent and profit of these regul the rent and profit of all other cultiv land if ani particular produc afford less the land would soon be turn into corn or pastur and if ani afford more some part of the land in corn or pastur would soon be turn to that produc those product inde which requir either a greater origin expens of improv or a greater annual expens of cultiv in order to fit the land for them appear commonli to afford the on a greater rent the other a greater profit than corn or pastur thi superior howev will seldom be found to amount to more than a reason interest or compens for thi superior expens in a hop garden a fruit garden a kitchen garden both the rent of the landlord and the profit of the farmer ar gener greater than in acorn or grass field but to bring the ground into thi condit requir more expens henc a greater rent becom due to the landlord it requir too a more attent and skil manag henc a greater profit becom due to the farmer the crop too at least in the hop

for that the vineyard when properli plant and brought to perfect wa the most valuabl part of the farm seem to have been an undoubt maxim in the ancient agricultur as it is in the modern through all the wine countri but whether it wa advantag to plant a new vineyard wa a matter of disput among the ancient italian husbandmen as we learn from columella he decid like a true lover of all curiou cultiv in favour of the vineyard and endeavour to shew by a comparison of the profit and expens that it wa a most advantag improv such comparison howev between the profit and expens of new project ar commonli veri fallaci and in noth more so than in agricultur had the gain actual made by such plantat been commonli as great as he imagin it might have been there could have been no disput about it the same point is frequent at thi dai a matter of controversi in the wine countri their writer on agricultur inde the lover and promot of high cultiv seem gener dispos to decid with columella in favour of the vineyard in franc the anxieti of the proprietor of the old vineyard to prevent the plant of ani new on seem to favour their opinion and to indic a conscious in those who must have the experi that thi speci of cultiv is at present in that countri more profit than ani other it seem at the same time howev to indic anoth opinion that thi superior profit can last no longer than the law which at present restrain the free cultiv of the vine in thei obtain an order of council prohibit both the plant of new vineyard and the renew of these old on of which the cultiv had been interrupt for two year without a particular permiss from the king to be grant onli in consequ of an inform from the intend of the provinc certifi that he had examin the land and that it wa incap of ani other cultur the pretenc of thi order wa the scarciti of corn and pastur and the superabund of wine but had thi superabund been real it would without ani order of council have effectu prevent the plantat of new vineyard by reduc the profit of thi speci of cultiv below their natur proport to those of corn and pastur with regard to the suppos scarciti of corn occas by the multipl of vineyard corn is nowher

which would promot agricultur by discourag manufactur the rent and profit of those product therefor which requir either a greater origin expens of improv in order to fit the land for them or a greater annual expens of cultiv though often much superior to those of corn and pastur yet when thei do no more than compens such extraordinari expens ar in realiti regul by the rent and profit of those

coloni the price of sugar bear no such proport to that of the produc of a rice or corn field either in europ or america it is commonli said that a sugar planter expect that the rum and the molass should defrai the whole expens of hi cultiv and that hi sugar should be all clear profit if thi be true for i pretend not to affirm it it is as if a corn farmer expect to defrai the expens of hi cultiv with the chaff and the straw and that the grain should be all clear profit we see frequent societi of merchant in london and other trade town purchas wast land in our sugar coloni which thei expect to improv and cultiv with profit by mean of factor and agent notwithstand the great distanc and the uncertain return from the defect administr of justic in those countri nobodi will attempt to improv and cultiv in the same manner the most fertil land of scotland ireland or the corn provinc of north america though from the more exact administr of justic in these countri more regular return might be expect in virginia and maryland the cultiv of tobacco is prefer as most profit to that of corn tobacco might be cultiv with advantag through the greater part of europ but in almost everi part of europ it ha becom a princip subject of taxat and to collect a tax from everi differ farm in the countri where thi plant might happen to be cultiv would be more difficult it ha been suppos than to levi on upon it import at the customhous the cultiv of tobacco ha upon thi account been most absurdli prohibit through the greater part of europ which necessarili give a sort of monopoli to the countri where it is allow and as virginia and maryland produc the greatest quantiti of it thei share larg though with some competitor in the advantag of thi monopoli the cultiv of tobacco howev seem not to be so advantag as that of sugar i have never even heard of ani tobacco plantat that wa improv and cultiv by the capit of merchant who resid in great britain and our tobacco coloni send us home no such wealthi planter as we see frequent arriv from our sugar island though from the prefer given in those coloni to the cultiv of tobacco abov that of corn it would appear that the effectu demand of europ for tobacco is not complet suppli it probabl is more nearli so than that for sugar and though the present price of tobacco is probabl more than suffici to pai the whole rent wage and profit necessari for prepar and bring it to market accord to the rate at which thei ar commonli paid in corn land it must not be so much more as the present price of sugar our tobacco planter accordingli have shewn the same fear of the superabund of tobacco which the proprietor of the old vineyard in franc have of the superabund of wine by act of assembl thei have restrain it cultiv to six thousand plant suppos to yield a thousand weight of tobacco for everi negro between sixteen and sixti year of ag such a negro over and abov thi quantiti of tobacco can manag thei reckon four acr of indian corn to prevent the market from be overstock too thei have sometim in plenti year we ar told by dr dougla douglass summari vol ii p i suspect he ha been ill inform burnt a certain quantiti of tobacco for everi negro in the same manner as the dutch ar said to do of spice if such violent method ar necessari to keep up the present price of tobacco the superior advantag of it cultur over that of corn if it still ha ani will not probabl be of long continu it is in thi manner that the rent of the cultiv land of which the produc is human food regul the rent of the greater part of other cultiv land no particular produc can long afford less becaus the land would immedi be turn to anoth us and if ani particular produc commonli afford more it is becaus the quantiti of land which can be fit for it is too small to suppli the effectu demand in europ corn is the princip produc of land which serv immedi for human food except in particular situat therefor the rent of corn land regul in europ that of all other cultiv land britain need envi neither the vineyard of franc nor the oliv plantat of itali except in particular situat the valu of these is regul by that of corn in which the fertil of britain is not much inferior to that of either of those two countri if in ani countri the common and favourit veget food of the peopl should be drawn from a plant of which the most common land with the same or nearli the same cultur produc a much greater quantiti than the most fertil doe of corn the rent of the landlord or the surplu quantiti of food which would remain to him after pai the labour and replac the stock of the farmer togeth with it ordinari profit would necessarili be much greater whatev wa the rate at which labour wa commonli maintain in that countri thi greater surplu

field two crop in the year from thirti to sixti bushel each ar said to be the ordinari produc of an acr though it cultiv therefor requir more labour a much greater surplu remain after maintain all that labour in those rice countri therefor where rice is the common and favourit veget food of the peopl and where the cultiv ar chiefli maintain with it a greater share of thi greater surplu should belong to the landlord than in corn countri in carolina where the planter as in other british coloni ar gener both farmer and landlord and where rent consequ is confound with profit the cultiv of rice is found to be more profit than that of corn though their field produc onli on crop in the year and though from the preval of the custom of europ rice is not there the common and favourit veget food of the peopl a good rice field is a bog at all season and at on season a bog cover with water it is unfit either for corn or pastur or vineyard or inde for ani other veget produc that is veri us to men and the land which ar fit for those purpos ar not fit for rice even in the rice countri therefor the rent of rice land cannot regul the rent of the other cuitiv land which can never be turn to that produc the food produc by a field of potato is not inferior in quantiti to that produc by a field of rice and much superior to what is produc by a field of wheat twelv thousand weight of potato from an acr of land is not a greater produc than two thousand weight of wheat the food or solid nourish inde which can be drawn from each of those two plant is not altogeth in proport to their weight on account of the wateri natur of potato allow howev half the weight of thi root to go to water a veri larg allow such an acr of potato will still produc six thousand weight of solid nourish three time the quantiti produc by the acr of wheat an acr of potato is cultiv with less expens than an acr of wheat the fallow which gener preced the sow of wheat more than compens the hoe and other extraordinari cultur which is alwai given to potato should thi root ever becom in ani part of europ like rice in some rice countri the common and favourit veget food of the peopl so as to occupi the same proport of the land in tillag which wheat and other sort of grain for human food do at present the same quantiti of cultiv land would maintain a much greater number of peopl and the labour be gener fed with potato a greater surplu would remain after replac all the stock and maintain all the labour emploi in cultiv a greater share of thi surplu too would belong to the landlord popul would increas and rent would rise much beyond what thei ar at present the land which is fit for potato is fit for almost everi other us veget if thei occupi the same proport of cultiv land which corn doe at present thei would regul in the same manner the rent of the greater part of other cultiv land in some part of lancashir it is pretend i have been told that bread of oatmeal is a heartier food for labour peopl than wheaten bread and i have frequent heard the same doctrin held in scotland i am howev somewhat doubt of the truth of it the common peopl in scotland who ar fed with oatmeal ar in gener neither so strong nor so handsom as the same rank of peopl in england who ar fed with wheaten bread thei neither work so well nor look so well and as there is not the same differ between the peopl of fashion in the two countri experi would seem to shew that the food of the common peopl in scotland is not so suitabl to the human constitut as that of their neighbour of the same rank in england but it seem to be otherwis with potato the chairmen porter and coalheav in london and those unfortun women who live by prostitut the strongest men and the most beauti women perhap in the british dominion ar said to be the greater part of them from the lowest rank of peopl in ireland who ar gener fed with thi root no food can afford a more decis proof of it nourish qualiti or of it be peculiarli suitabl to the health of the human constitut it is difficult to preserv potato through the year and imposs to store them like corn for two or three year togeth the fear of not be abl to

the produc of land which sometim doe and sometim doe not afford rent human food seem to be the onli produc of land which alwai and necessarili afford some rent to the landlord other sort of produc

rais their price abov what it cost to send them to those wealthier neighbour it afford therefor some rent to the landlord when the greater part of the highland cattl were consum on their own hill the export of their hide made the most consider articl of the commerc of that countri and what thei were exchang for afford some addit to the rent of the highland estat the wool of england which in old

of foreign commerc when thei ar superabund in the countri which produc them it frequent happen even in the present commerci state of the world that thei ar of no valu to the landlord a good stone quarri in the neighbourhood of london would afford a consider rent in mani part of scotland and wale it afford none barren timber for build is of great valu in a popul and wellcultiv countri and the

of wealthier nation howev sometim enabl him to get a rent for it the pave of the street of london ha enabl the owner of some barren rock on the coast of scotland to draw a rent from what never afford

popul not in proport to the number of peopl whom their produc can cloth and lodg but in proport to that of those whom it can feed when food is provid it is easi to find the necessari cloth and lodg but though these ar at hand it mai often be difficult to find food in some part of the british dominion what is call a hous mai be built by on dai labour of on man the simplest speci of cloth the skin of anim requir somewhat more labour to dress and prepar them for us thei do not howev requir a great deal among savag or barbar nation a hundredth or littl more than a hundredth part of the labour of

but when by the improv and cultiv of land the labour of on famili can provid food for two the labour of half the societi becom suffici to provid food for the whole the other half therefor or at least the greater part of them can be emploi in provid other thing or in satisfi the other want and fanci of mankind cloth and lodg household furnitur and what is call equipag ar the princip object of the

it is veri nearli the same but compar the spaciou palac and great wardrob of the on with the hovel and the few rag of the other and you will be sensibl that the differ between their cloth lodg and household furnitur is almost as great in quantiti as it is in qualiti the desir of food is limit in everi man by the narrow capac of the human stomach but the desir of the conveni and ornament of

quantiti could not be sold coal ar a less agreeabl fuel than wood thei ar said too to be less wholesom the expens of coal therefor at the place where thei ar consum must gener be somewhat less than that of wood the price of wood again vari with the state of agricultur nearli in the same manner and exactli for the same reason as the price of cattl in it rude begin the greater part of everi

old tree hinder ani young on from come up so that in the cours of a centuri or two the whole forest goe to ruin the scarciti of wood then rais it price it afford a good rent and the landlord sometim find that he can scarc emploi hi best land more advantag than in grow barren timber of which the great of the profit often compens the late of the return thi seem in the present time to be nearli the state of thing in sever part of great britain where the profit of plant is found to be equal to that of either corn or pastur the advantag which the landlord deriv from plant can nowher exce at least for ani consider time the rent which these could afford him and in an inland countri which is highli cuitiv it will frequent not fall much short of thi rent upon the seacoast of a wellimprov countri inde if coal can conveni be had for fuel it mai sometim be cheaper to bring barren timber for build from less cultiv foreign countri than to rais it at home in the new town of edinburgh built within these few year there is not perhap a singl stick of scotch timber whatev mai be the price of wood if that of coal is such that the expens of a coal fire is nearli equal to that of a wood on we mai be assur that at that place and in these circumst the price of coal is as high as it can be it seem to be so in some of the inland part of england particularli in oxfordshir where it is usual even in the fire of the common peopl to mix coal and wood togeth and where the differ in the expens of those two sort of fuel cannot therefor be veri great coal in the coal countri ar everywher much below thi highest price if thei were not thei could not bear the expens of a distant carriag either by land or by water a small quantiti onli could be sold and the coal master and the coal proprietor find it more for their interest to sell a great quantiti at a price somewhat abov the lowest than a small quantiti at the highest the most fertil coal mine too regul the price of coal at all the other mine in it neighbourhood both the proprietor and the undertak of the work find the on that he can get a greater rent the other that he can get a greater profit by somewhat undersel all their neighbour their neighbour ar soon oblig to sell at the same price though thei cannot so well afford it and though it alwai diminish and sometim take awai altogeth both their rent and their profit some work ar abandon altogeth other can afford no rent and can be wrought onli by the proprietor the lowest price at which coal can be sold for ani consider time is like that of all other commod the price which is bare suffici to replac togeth with it ordinari profit the stock which must be emploi in bring them to market at a coal mine for which the landlord can get no rent but which he must either work himself or let it alon altogeth the price of coal must gener be nearli about thi price rent even where coal afford on ha gener a smaller share in their price than in that of most other part of the rude produc of

fifth of the gross produc is a veri great rent a tenth the common rent and it is seldom a rent certain but depend upon the occasion variat in the produc these ar so great that in a countri where thirti year purchas is consid as a moder price for the properti of a land estat ten year purchas is regard as a good price for that of a coal mine the valu of a coal mine to the proprietor frequent depend as much upon it situat as upon it fertil that of a metal mine depend more upon it fertil and less upon it situat the coars and still more the preciou metal when separ from the or ar so valuabl that thei can gener bear the expens of a veri long land and of the most distant sea carriag their market is not confin to the countri in the neighbourhood of the mine but extend to the whole world the

and a still smaller in that of the preciou metal labour and profit make up the greater part of both a sixth part of the gross produc mai be reckon the averag rent of the tin mine of cornwal the most fertil that ar known in the world as we ar told by the rev mr borlac vicewarden of the stannari some he sai afford more and some do not afford so much a sixth part of the gross produc is the rent too of sever veri fertil lead mine in scotland in the silver mine of peru we ar told by frezier and ulloa the proprietor frequent exact no other acknowledg from the undertak of the mine but that he will grind the or at hi mill pai him the ordinari multur or price of grind till inde the tax of the king of spain amount to on fifth of the standard silver which till then might be consid as the real rent of the greater part of the silver mine of peru the richest which have been known in the world if there had been no tax thi fifth would natur have belong to the landlord and mani mine might have been wrought which could not then be wrought becaus thei could not afford thi tax the tax of the duke of cornwal upon tin is suppos to amount to more than five per cent or on twentieth part of the valu and whatev mai be hi proport it would natur too belong to the proprietor of the mine if tin wa duti free but if you add on twentieth to on sixth you will find that the whole averag rent of the tin mine of cornwal wa to the whole averag rent of the silver mine of peru as thirteen to twelv but the silver mine of peru ar not now abl to pai even thi low rent and the tax upon silver wa in reduc from on fifth to on tenth even thi tax upon silver too give more temptat to smuggl than the tax of on twentieth upon tin and smuggl must be much easier in the preciou than in the bulki commod the tax of the king of spain accordingli is said to be veri ill paid and that of the duke of cornwal veri well rent therefor it is probabl make a greater part of the price of tin at the most fertil tin mine than it doe of silver at the most fertil silver mine in the world after replac the stock emploi in work those differ mine togeth with it ordinari profit the residu which remain to the proprietor is greater it seem in the coars than in the preciou metal neither ar the profit of the undertak of silver mine commonli veri great in peru the same most respect and wellinform author acquaint us that when ani

light as here as a lotteri in which the prize do not compens the blank though the great of some tempt mani adventur to throw awai their fortun in such unprosper project as the sovereign howev deriv a consider part of hi revenu from the produc of silver mine the law in peru give everi possibl encourag to the discoveri and work of new on whoever discov a new mine is entitl to measur off two hundr and fortysix feet in length accord to what he suppos to be the direct of the vein and half as much in breadth he becom proprietor of thi portion of the mine and can work it without pave ani acknowledg to the landlord the interest of the duke of cornwal ha given occas to a regul nearli of the same kind in that ancient dutchi in wast and uninclos land ani person who discov a tin mine mai mark out it

that the work could not bear even the lowest of these two tax if it is rare howev sai the same author frezier and ulloa to find a person who ha made hi fortun by a silver it is still much rarer to find on who ha done so by a gold mine thi twentieth part seem to be the whole rent which is paid by the greater part of the gold mine of chili and peru gold too is much more liabl to be smuggl than even silver not onli on account of the superior valu of the metal in proport to it bulk but on account of the peculiar wai in which natur produc it silver is veri seldom found virgin but like most other metal is gener miner with some other bodi from which it is imposs to separ it in such quantiti as will pai for the expens but by a veri labori and tediou oper which cannot well be carri on but

small quantiti of mercuri if the king tax therefor is but ill paid upon silver it is like to be much wors paid upon gold and rent must make a much smaller part of the price of gold than that of silver the lowest price at which the preciou metal can be sold or the smallest quantiti of other good for which thei can be exchang dure ani consider time is regul by the same principl which fix the lowest ordinari price of all other good the stock which must commonli be emploi the food cloth and lodg which must commonli be consum in bring them from the mine to the market determin it it must at least be suffici to replac that stock with the ordinari profit their highest price howev seem not to be necessarili determin by ani thing but the actual scarciti or plenti of these metal themselv it is not determin by that of ani other commod in the same manner as the price of coal is by that of wood beyond which no scarciti can ever rais it increas the scarciti of gold to a certain degre and the smallest bit of it mai becom more preciou than a diamond and exchang for a greater quantiti of other good the demand for those metal aris partli from their util and partli from their beauti if you

the valu of silver might be so much degrad as to render even the mine of potosi not worth the work befor the discoveri of the spanish west indi the most fertil mine in europ mai have afford as great a

sometim doe not afford rent the increas abund of food in consequ of the increas improv and cultiv must necessarili increas the demand for everi part of the produc of land which is not food and which can be appli either to us or to ornament in the whole progress of improv it might therefor be expect there should be onli on variat in the compar valu of those two differ sort of produc the valu of that sort which sometim doe and sometim doe not afford rent should constantli rise in proport to that which alwai afford some rent as art and industri advanc the materi of cloth and lodg the us fossil and materi of the earth the preciou metal and the preciou stone should gradual come to be more and more in demand should gradual exchang for a greater and a greater quantiti of food or in other word should gradual becom dearer and dearer thi accordingli ha been the case with most of these thing upon most occas and would have been the case with all of them upon all occas if particular accid had not upon some occas increas the suppli of some of them in a still greater proport than the demand the valu of a freeston quarri for exampl will necessarili increas with the increas improv and popul of the countri round about it especi if it should be the onli on in the neighbourhood but the valu of a silver mine even though there should not be anoth within a thousand mile of it will not necessarili increas with the improv of the countri in which it is situat the market for the produc of a freeston quarri can seldom extend more than a few mile round about it and the demand must gener be in proport to the improv and popul of that small district but the market for the produc of a silver mine mai extend over the whole known world unless the world in gener therefor be advanc in improv and popul the demand for silver might not be at all increas by the improv even of a larg countri in the neighbourhood of the mine even though the world in gener were improv yet if in the cours of it improv new mine should be discov much more fertil than ani which had been known befor though the demand for silver would necessarili increas yet the suppli might increas in so much a greater proport that the real price of that metal might gradual fall that is ani given quantiti a pound weight of it for exampl might gradual purchas or command a smaller and a smaller quantiti of labour or exchang for a smaller and a smaller quantiti of corn the princip part of the subsist of the labour the great market for silver is the commerci and civil part of the world if by the gener progress of improv the demand of thi market should increas while at the same time the suppli did not increas in the same proport the valu of silver would gradual rise in proport to that of corn ani given quantiti of silver would exchang for a greater and a greater quantiti of corn or in other word the averag monei price of corn would gradual becom cheaper and cheaper if on the contrari the suppli by some accid should increas for mani year togeth in a greater proport than the demand that metal would gradual becom cheaper and cheaper or in other word the averag monei price of corn would in spite of all improv gradual becom dearer and dearer but if on the other hand the suppli of that metal should increas nearli in the same proport as the demand it would continu to purchas or exchang for nearli the same quantiti of corn and the averag monei price of corn would in spite of all improv continu veri nearli the same these three seem to exhaust all the possibl combin of event which can happen in the progress of improv and dure the cours of the four centuri preced the present if we mai judg by what ha happen both in franc and great britain each of those three differ combin seem to have taken place in the european market and nearli in the same order too in which i have here set them down digress concern the variat in the valu of silver dure the cours of the four last centuri first periodin and for some time befor the averag price of the quarter of wheat in england seem not to have been estim lower than four ounc of silver tower weight equal to about twenti shill of our present monei from thi price it seem to have fallen gradual to two ounc of silver equal to about ten shill of our present monei the price at which we find it estim in the begin of the sixteenth centuri and at which it seem to have continu to be estim till about in be the th of edward iii wa enact what is call the statut of labour in the preambl it complain much of the insol of servant who endeavour to rais their wage upon their master it therefor ordain that all servant and labour should for the futur be content with the same wage and liveri liveri in those time signifi not onli cloth but provis which thei had been accustom to receiv in the th year of the king and the four preced year that upon thi account their liverywheat should nowher be estim higher than tenpenc abushel and that it should alwai be in the option of the master to deliv them either the wheat or the monei tenpenc abushel therefor had in the th of edward iii been reckon a veri moder price of wheat sinc it requir a particular statut to oblig servant to accept of it in exchang for their usual liveri of provis and it had been reckon a reason price ten year befor that or in the th year of the king the term to which the statut refer but in the th year of edward iii tenpenc contain about half an ounc of silver tower weight and wa nearli equal to halfacrown of our present monei four ounc of silver tower weight therefor equal to six shill and eightpenc of the monei of those time and to near twenti shill of that of the present must have been reckon a moder price for the quarter of eight bushel thi statut is sure a better evid of what wa reckon in those time a moder price of grain than the price of some particular year which have gener been record by historian and other writer on account of their extraordinari dear or cheap and from which therefor it is difficult to form ani judgment concern what mai have been the ordinari price there ar besid other reason for believ that in the begin of the fourteenth centuri and for some time befor the common price of wheat wa not less than four ounc of silver the quarter and that of other grain in proport in ralph de born prior of st augustin canterburi gave a feast upon hi installationdai of which william thorn ha preserv not onli the bill of fare but the price of mani particular in that feast were consum st fiftythre quarter of wheat which cost nineteen pound or seven shill and twopenc aquart equal to about oneandtwenti shill and sixpenc of our present monei dly fiftyeight quarter of malt which cost seventeen pound ten shill or six shill aquart equal to about eighteen shill of our present monei dly twenti quarter of oat which cost four pound or four shill aquart equal to about twelv shill of our present monei the price of malt and oat seem here to lie higher than their ordinari proport to the price of wheat these price ar not record on account of their extraordinari dear or cheap but ar mention accident as the price actual paid for larg quantiti of grain consum at a feast which wa famou for it magnific in be the st of henri iii wa reviv an ancient statut call the assiz of bread and al which the king sai in the preambl had been made in the time of hi progenitor some time king of england it is probabl therefor as old at least as the time of hi grandfath henri ii and mai have been as old as the conquest it regul the price of bread accord as the price of wheat mai happen to be from on shill to twenti shill the quarter of the monei of those time but statut of thi kind ar gener presum to provid with equal care for all deviat from the middl price for those below it as well as for those abov it ten shill therefor contain six ounc of silver tower weight and equal to about thirti shill of our present monei must upon thi supposit have been reckon the middl price of the quarter of wheat when thi statut wa first enact and must have continu to be so in the st of henri iii we cannot therefor be veri wrong in suppos that the middl price wa not less than onethird of the highest price at which thi statut regul the price of bread or than six shill and eightpenc of the monei of those time contain four ounc of silver tower weight from these differ fact therefor we seem to have some reason to conclud that about the middl of the fourteenth centuri and for a consider time befor the averag or ordinari price of the quarter of wheat wa not suppos to be less than four ounc of silver tower weight from about the middl of the fourteenth to the begin of the sixteenth centuri what wa reckon the reason and moder that is the ordinari or averag price of wheat seem to have sunk gradual to about on half of thi price so as at last to have fallen to about two ounc of silver tower weight equal to about ten shill of our present monei it continu to be estim at thi price till about in the household book of henri the fifth earl of northumberland drawn up in there ar two differ estim of wheat in on of them it is comput at six shill and eightpenc the quarter in the other at five shill and eightpenc onli in six shill and eightpenc contain onli two ounc of silver tower weight and were equal to about ten shill of our present monei from the th of edward iii to the begin of the reign of elizabeth dure the space of more than two hundr year six shill and eightpenc it appear from sever differ statut had continu to be consid as what is call the moder and reason that is the ordinari or averag price of wheat the quantiti of silver howev contain in that nomin sum wa dure the cours of thi period continu diminish in consequ of some alter which were made in the coin but the increas of the valu of silver had it seem so far compens the diminut of the quantiti of it contain in the same nomin sum that the legislatur did not think it worth while to attend to thi circumst thu in it wa enact that wheat might be export without a licenc when the price wa so low as six shill and eightpenc and in it wa enact that no wheat should be import if the price wa not abov six shill and eightpenc the quarter the legislatur had imagin that when the price wa so low there could be no inconveni in export but that when it rose higher it becam prudent to allow of import six shill and eightpenc therefor contain about the same quantiti of silver as thirteen shill and fourpenc of our present monei onethird part less than the same nomin sum contain in the time of edward iii had in those time been consid as what is call the moder and reason price of wheat in by the st and nd of philip and mari and in by the st of elizabeth the export of wheat wa in the same manner prohibit whenev the price of the quarter should exce six shill and eightpenc which did not then contain two penni worth more silver than the same nomin sum doe at present but it had soon been found that to restrain the export of wheat till the price wa so veri low wa in realiti to prohibit it altogeth in therefor by the th of elizabeth the export of wheat wa allow from certain port whenev the price of the quarter should not exce ten shill contain nearli the same quantiti of silver as the like nomin sum doe at present thi price had at thi time therefor been consid as what is call the moder and reason price of wheat it agre nearli with the estim of the northumberland book in that in franc the averag price of grain wa in the same manner much lower in the end of the fifteenth and begin of the sixteenth centuri than in the two centuri preced ha been observ both by mr dupr de st maur and by the eleg author of the essai on the polici of grain it price dure the same period had probabl sunk in the same manner through the greater part of europ thi rise in the valu of silver in proport to that of corn mai either have been ow altogeth to the increas of the demand for that metal in consequ of increas improv and cultiv the suppli in the mean time continu the same as befor or the demand continu the same as befor it mai have been ow altogeth to the gradual diminut of the suppli the greater part of the mine which were then known in the world be much exhaust and consequ the expens of work them much increas or it mai have been ow partli to the on and partli to the other of those two circumst in the end of the fifteenth and begin of the sixteenth centuri the greater part of europ wa approach toward a more settl from of govern than it had enjoi for sever ag befor the increas of secur would natur increas industri and improv and the demand for the preciou metal as well as for everi other luxuri and ornament would natur increas with the increas of rich a greater annual produc would requir a greater quantiti of coin to circul it and a greater number of rich peopl would requir a greater quantiti of plate and other ornament of silver it is natur to suppos too that the greater part of the mine which then suppli the european market with silver might be a good deal exhaust and have becom more expens in the work thei had been wrought mani of them from the time of the roman it ha been the opinion howev of the greater part of those who have written upon the price of commod in ancient time that from the conquest perhap from the invas of juliu caesar till the discoveri of the mine of america the valu of silver wa continu diminish thi opinion thei seem to have been led into partli by the observ which thei had occas to make upon the price both of corn and of some other part of the rude produc of land and partli by the popular notion that as the quantiti of silver natur increas in everi countri with the increas of wealth so it valu diminish as it quantiti increas in their observ upon the price of corn three differ circumst seem frequent to have misl them first in ancient time almost all rent were paid in kind in a certain quantiti of corn cattl poultri etc it sometim happen howev that the landlord would stipul that he should be at liberti to demand of the tenant either the annual payment in kind or a certain sum of monei instead of it the price at which the payment in kind wa in thi manner exchang for a certain sum of monei is in scotland call the convers price as the option is alwai in the landlord to take either the substanc or the price it is necessari for the safeti of the tenant that the convers price should rather be below than abov the averag market price in mani place accordingli it is not much abov on half of thi price through the greater part of scotland thi custom still continu with regard to poultri and in some place with regard to cattl it might probabl have continu to take place too with regard to corn had not the institut of the public fiar put an end to it these ar annual valuat accord to the judgment of an assiz of the averag price of all the differ sort of grain and of all the differ qualiti of each accord to the actual market price in everi differ counti thi institut render it suffici safe for the tenant and much more conveni for the landlord to convert as thei call it the corn rent rather at what should happen to be the price of the fiar of each year than at ani certain fix price but the writer who have collect the price of corn in ancient time seem frequent to have mistaken what is call in scotland the convers price for the actual market price fleetwood acknowledg upon on occas that he had made thi mistak as he wrote hi book howev for a particular purpos he doe not think proper to make thi acknowledg till after transcrib thi convers price fifteen time the price is eight shill the quarter of wheat thi sum in the year at which he begin with it contain the same quantiti of silver as sixteen shill of our present monei but in the year at which he end with it it contain no more than the same nomin sum doe at present secondli thei have been misl by the slovenli manner in which some ancient statut of assiz had been sometim transcrib by lazi copier and sometim perhap actual compos by the legislatur the ancient statut of assiz seem to have begun alwai with determin what ought to be the price of bread and al when the price of wheat and barlei were at the lowest and to have proceed gradual to determin what it ought to be accord as the price of those two sort of grain should gradual rise abov thi lowest price but the transcrib of those statut seem frequent to have thought it suffici to copi the regul as far as the three or four first and lowest price save in thi manner their own labour and judg i suppos that thi wa enough to show what proport ought to be observ in all higher price thu in the assiz of bread and al of the st of henri iii the price of bread wa regul accord to the differ price of wheat from on shill to twenti shill the quarter of the monei of those time but in the manuscript from which all the differ edit of the statut preced that of mr ruffhead were print the copier had never transcrib thi regul beyond the price of twelv shill sever writer therefor be misl by thi faulti transcript veri natur conclud that the middl price or six shill the quarter equal to about eighteen shill of our present monei wa the ordinari or averag price of wheat at that time in the statut of tumbrel and pillori enact nearli about the same time the price of al is regul accord to everi sixpenc rise in the price of barlei from two shill to four shill the quarter that four shill howev wa not consid as the highest price to which barlei might frequent rise in those time and that these price were onli given as an exampl of the proport which ought to be observ in all other price whether higher or lower we mai infer from the last word of the statut et sic deincep crescetur vel diminuetur per sex denario the express is veri slovenli but the mean is plain enough that the price of al is in thi manner to be increas or diminish accord to everi sixpenc rise or fall in the price of barlei in the composit of thi statut the legislatur itself seem to have been as neglig as the copier were in the transcript of the other in an ancient manuscript of the regiam majestatem an old scotch law book there is a statut of assiz in which the price of bread is regul accord to all the differ price of wheat from tenpenc to three shill the scotch boll equal to about half an english quarter three shill scotch at the time when thi assiz is suppos to have been enact were equal to about nine shill sterl of our present monei mr ruddiman seem see hi prefac to anderson diplomata scotia to conclud from thi that three shill wa the highest price to which wheat ever rose in those time and that tenpenc a shill or at most two shill were the ordinari price upon consult the manuscript howev it appear evid that all these price ar onli set down as exampl of the proport which ought to be observ between the respect price of wheat and bread the last word of the statut ar reliqua judicabi secundum praescripta habendo respectum ad pretium bladiy shall judg of the remain case accord to what is abov written have respect to the price of corn thirdli thei seem to have been misl too by the veri low price at which wheat wa sometim sold in veri ancient time and to have imagin that as it lowest price wa then much lower than in later time it ordinari price must likewis have been much lower thei might have found howev that in those ancient time it highest price wa fulli as much abov as it lowest price wa below ani thing that had ever been known in later time thu in fleetwood give us two price of the quarter of wheat the on is four pound sixteen shill of the monei of those time equal to fourteen pound eight shill of that of the present the other is six pound eight shill equal to nineteen pound four shill of our present monei no price can be found in the end of the fifteenth or begin of the sixteenth centuri which approach to the extravag of these the price of corn though at all time liabl to variat vari most in those turbul and disorderli societi in which the interrupt of all commerc and commun hinder the plenti of on part of the countri from reliev the scarciti of anoth in the disorderli state of england under the plantagenet who govern it from about the middl of the twelfth till toward the end of the fifteenth centuri on district might be in plenti while anoth at no great distanc by have it crop destroi either by some accid of the season or by the incurs of some neighbour baron might be suffer all the horror of a famin and yet if the land of some hostil lord were interpos between them the on might not be abl to give the least assist to the other under the vigor administr of the tudor who govern england dure the latter part of the fifteenth and through the whole of the sixteenth centuri no baron wa power enough to dare to disturb the public secur the reader will find at the end of thi chapter all the price of wheat which have been collect by fleetwood from to both inclus reduc to the monei of the present time and digest accord to the order of time into seven divis of twelv year each at the end of each divis too he will find the averag price of the twelv year of which it consist in that long period of time fleetwood ha been abl to collect the price of no more than eighti year so that four year ar want to make out the last twelv year i have ad therefor from the account of eton colleg the price of and it is the onli addit which i have made the reader will see that from the begin of the thirteenth till after the middl of the sixteenth centuri the averag price of each twelv year grow gradual lower and lower and that toward the end of the sixteenth centuri it begin to rise again the price inde which fleetwood ha been abl to collect seem to have been those chiefli which were remark for extraordinari dear or cheap and i do not pretend that ani veri certain conclus can be drawn from them so far howev as thei prove ani thing at all thei confirm the account which i have been endeavour to give fleetwood himself howev seem with most other writer to have believ that dure all thi period the valu of silver in consequ of it increas abund wa continu diminish the price of corn which he himself ha collect certainli do not agre with thi opinion thei agre perfectli with that of mr dupr de st maur and with that which i have been endeavour to explain bishop fleetwood and mr dupr de st maur ar the two author who seem to have collect with the greatest dilig and fidel the price of thing in ancient time it is some what curiou that though their opinion ar so veri differ their fact so far as thei relat to the price of corn at least should coincid so veri exactli it is not howev so much from the low price of corn as from that of some other part of the rude produc of land that the most judici writer have infer the great valu of silver in those veri ancient time corn it ha been said be a sort of manufactur wa in those rude ag much dearer in proport than the greater part of other commod it is meant i suppos than the greater part of unmanufactur commod such as cattl poultri game of all kind etc that in those time of poverti and barbar these were proportion much cheaper than corn is undoubtedli true but thi cheap wa not the effect of the high valu of silver but of the low valu of those commod it wa not becaus silver would in such time purchas or repres a greater quantiti of labour but becaus such commod would purchas or repres a much smaller quantiti than in time of more opul and improv silver must certainli be cheaper in spanish america than in europ in the countri where it is produc than in the countri to which it is brought at the expens of a long carriag both by land and by sea of a freight and an insur oneandtwenti penc halfpenni sterl howev we ar told by ulloa wa not mani year ago at bueno ayr the price of an ox chosen from a herd of three or four hundr sixteen shill sterl we ar told by mr byron wa the price of a good hors in the capit of chili in a countri natur fertil but of which the far greater part is altogeth uncultiv cattl poultri game of all kind etc as thei can be acquir with a veri small quantiti of labour so thei will purchas or command but a veri small quantiti the low monei price for which thei mai be sold is no proof that the real valu of silver is there veri high but that the real valu of those commod is veri low labour it must alwai be rememb and not ani particular commod or set of commod is the real measur of the valu both of silver and of all other commod but in countri almost wast or but thinli inhabit cattl poultri game of all kind etc as thei ar the spontan product of natur so she frequent produc them in much greater quantiti than the consumpt of the inhabit requir in such a state of thing the suppli commonli exce the demand in differ state of societi in differ state of improv therefor such commod will repres or be equival to veri differ quantiti of labour in everi state of societi in everi stage of improv corn is the product of human industri but the averag produc of everi sort of industri is alwai suit more or less exactli to the averag consumpt the averag suppli to the averag demand in everi differ stage of improv besid the rais of equal quantiti of corn in the same soil and climat will at an averag requir nearli equal quantiti of labour or what come to the same thing the price of nearli equal quantiti the continu increas of the product power of labour in an improv state of cultiv be more or less counterbalanc by the continu increas price of cattl the princip instrument of agricultur upon all these account therefor we mai rest assur that equal quantiti of corn will in everi state of societi in everi stage of improv more nearli repres or be equival to equal quantiti of labour than equal quantiti of ani other part of the rude produc of land corn accordingli it ha alreadi been observ is in all the differ stage of wealth and improv a more accur measur of valu than ani other commod or set of commod in all those differ stage therefor we can judg better of the real valu of silver by compar it with corn than by compar it with ani other commod or set of commod corn besid or whatev els is the common and favourit veget food of the peopl constitut in everi civil countri the princip part of the subsist of the labour in consequ of the extens of agricultur the land of everi countri produc a much greater quantiti of veget than of anim food and the labour everywher live chiefli upon the wholesom food that is cheapest and most abund butcher meat except in the most thrive countri or where labour is most highli reward make but an insignific part of hi subsist poultri make a still smaller part of it and game no part of it in franc and even in scotland where labour is somewhat better reward than in franc the labour poor seldom eat butcher meat except upon holidai and other extraordinari occas the monei price of labour therefor depend much more upon the averag monei price of corn the subsist of the labour than upon that of butcher meat or of ani other part of the rude produc of land the real valu of gold and silver therefor the real quantiti of labour which thei can purchas or command depend much more upon the quantiti of corn which thei can purchas or command than upon that of butcher meat or ani other part of the rude produc of land such slight observ howev upon the price either of corn or of other commod would not probabl have misl so mani intellig author had thei not been influenc at the same time by the popular notion that as the quantiti of silver natur increas in everi countri with the increas of wealth so it valu diminish as it quantiti increas thi notion howev seem to be altogeth groundless the quantiti of the preciou metal mai increas in ani countri from two differ caus either first from the increas abund of the mine which suppli it or secondli from the increas wealth of the peopl from the increas produc of their annual labour the first of these caus is no doubt necessarili connect with the diminut of the valu of the preciou metal but the second is not when more abund mine ar discov a greater quantiti of the preciou metal is brought to market and the quantiti of the necessari and conveni of life for which thei must be exchang be the same as befor equal quantiti of the metal must be exchang for smaller quantiti of commod so far therefor as the increas of the quantiti of the preciou metal in ani countri aris from the increas abund of the mine it is necessarili connect with some diminut of their valu when on the contrari the wealth of ani countri increas when the annual produc of it labour becom gradual greater and greater a greater quantiti of coin becom necessari in order to circul a greater quantiti of commod and the peopl as thei can afford it as thei have more commod to give for it will natur purchas a greater and a greater quantiti of plate the quantiti of their coin will increas from necess the quantiti of their plate from vaniti and ostent or from the same reason that the quantiti of fine statu pictur and of everi other luxuri and curios is like to increas among them but as statuari and painter ar not like to be wors reward in time of wealth and prosper than in time of poverti and depress so gold and silver ar not like to be wors paid for the price of gold and silver when the accident discoveri of more abund mine doe not keep it down as it natur rise with the wealth of everi countri so whatev be the state of the mine it is at all time natur higher in a rich than in a poor countri gold and silver like all other commod natur seek the market where the best price is given for them and the best price is commonli given for everi thing in the countri which can best afford it labour it must be rememb is the ultim price which is paid for everi thing and in countri where labour is equal well reward the monei price of labour will be in proport to that of the subsist of the labour but gold and silver will natur exchang for a greater quantiti of subsist in a rich than in a poor countri in a countri which abound with subsist than in on which is but indiffer suppli with it if the two countri ar at a great distanc the differ mai be veri great becaus though the metal natur fly from the wors to the better market yet it mai be difficult to transport them in such quantiti as to bring their price nearli to a level in both if the countri ar near the differ will be smaller and mai sometim be scarc percept becaus in thi case the transport will be easi china is a much richer countri than ani part of europ and the differ between the price of subsist in china and in europ is veri great rice in china is much cheaper than wheat is ani where in europ england is a much richer countri than scotland but the differ between the monei price of corn in those two countri is much smaller and is but just percept in proport to the quantiti or measur scotch corn gener appear to be a good deal cheaper than english but in proport to it qualiti it is certainli somewhat dearer scotland receiv almost everi year veri larg suppli from england and everi commod must commonli be somewhat dearer in the countri to which it is brought than in that from which it come english corn therefor must be dearer in scotland than in england and yet in proport to it qualiti or to the quantiti and good of the flour or meal which can be made from it it cannot commonli be sold higher there than the scotch corn which come to market in competit with it the differ between the monei price of labour in china and in europ is still greater than that between the monei price of subsist becaus the real recomp of labour is higher in europ than in china the greater part of europ be in an improv state while china seem to be stand still the monei price of labour is lower in scotland than in england becaus the real recomp of labour is much lower scotland though advanc to greater wealth advanc much more slowli than england the frequenc of emigr from scotland and the rariti of it from england suffici prove that the demand for labour is veri differ in the two countri the proport between the real recomp of labour in differ countri it must be rememb is natur regul not by their actual wealth or poverti but by their advanc stationari or declin condit gold and silver as thei ar natur of the greatest valu among the richest so thei ar natur of the least valu among the poorest nation among savag the poorest of all nation thei ar scarc of ani valu in great town corn is alwai dearer than in remot part of the countri thi howev is the effect not of the real cheap of silver but of the real dear of corn it doe not cost less labour to bring silver to the great town than to the remot part of the countri but it cost a great deal more to bring corn in some veri rich and commerci countri such as holland and the territori of genoa corn is dear for the same reason that it is dear in great town thei do not produc enough to maintain their inhabit thei ar rich in the industri and skill of their artific and manufactur in everi sort of machineri which can facilit and abridg labour in ship and in all the other instrument and mean of carriag and commerc but thei ar poor in corn which as it must be brought to them from distant countri must by an addit to it price pai for the carriag from those countri it doe not cost less labour to bring silver to amsterdam than to dantzic but it cost a great deal more to bring corn the real cost of silver must be nearli the same in both place but that of corn must be veri differ diminish the real opul either of holland or of the territori of genoa while the number of their inhabit remain the same diminish their power of suppli themselv from distant countri and the price of corn instead of sink with that diminut in the quantiti of their silver which must necessarili accompani thi declens either as it caus or as it effect will rise to the price of a famin when we ar in want of necessari we must part with all superflu of which the valu as it rise in time of opul and prosper so it sink in time of poverti and distress it is otherwis with necessari their real price the quantiti of labour which thei can purchas or command rise in time of poverti and distress and sink in time of opul and prosper which ar alwai time of great abund for thei could not otherwis be time of opul and prosper corn is a necessari silver is onli a superflu whatev therefor mai have been the increas in the quantiti of the preciou metal which dure the period between the middl of the fourteenth and that of the sixteenth centuri aros from the increas of wealth and improv it could have no tendenc to diminish their valu either in great britain or in my other part of europ if those who have collect the price of thing in ancient time therefor had dure thi period no reason to infer the diminut of the valu of silver from ani observ which thei had made upon the price either of corn or of other commod thei had still less reason to infer it from ani suppos increas of wealth and improv second periodbut how variou soever mai have been the opinion of the learn concern the progress of the valu of silver dure the first period thei ar unanim concern it dure the second from about to about dure a period of about seventi year the variat in the proport between the valu of silver and that of corn held a quit opposit cours silver sunk in it real valu or would exchang for a smaller quantiti of labour than befor and corn rose in it nomin price and instead of be commonli sold for about two ounc of silver the quarter or about ten shill of our present monei came to be sold for six and eight ounc of silver the quarter or about thirti and forti shill of our present monei the discoveri of the abund mine of america seem to have been the sole caus of thi diminut in the valu of silver in proport to that of corn it is account for accordingli in the same manner by everi bodi and there never ha been ani disput either about the fact or about the caus of it the greater part of europ wa dure thi period advanc in industri and improv and the demand for silver must consequ have been increas but the increas of the suppli had it seem so far exceed that of the demand that the valu of that metal sunk consider the discoveri of the mine of america it is to be observ doe not seem to have had ani veri sensibl effect upon the price of thing in england till after though even the mine of potosi had been discov more than twenti year befor from to both inclus the averag price of the quarter of nine bushel of the best wheat at windsor market appear from the account of eton colleg to have been from which sum neglect the fraction and deduct a ninth or s d the price of the quarter of eight bushel come out to have been and from thi sum neglect likewis the fraction and deduct a ninth or s d for the differ between the price of the best wheat and that of the middl wheat the price of the middl wheat come out to have been about or about six ounc and onethird of an ounc of silver from to both inclus the averag price of the same measur of the best wheat at the same market appear from the same account to have been s from which make the like deduct as in the forego case the averag price of the quarter of eight bushel of middl wheat come out to have been or about seven ounc and twothird of an ounc of silver third periodbetween and or about the effect of the discoveri of the mine of america in reduc the valu of silver appear to have been complet and the valu of that metal seem never to have sunk lower in proport to that of corn than it wa about that time it seem to have risen somewhat in the cours of the present centuri and it had probabl begun to do so even some time befor the end of the last from to both inclus be the sixtyfour last year of the last centuri the averag price of the quarter of nine bushel of the best wheat at windsor market appear from the same account to have been which is onli s d dearer than it had been dure the sixteen year befor but in the cours of these sixtyfour year there happen two event which must have produc a much greater scarciti of corn than what the cours of the season is would otherwis have occas and which therefor without suppos ani further reduct in the valu of silver will much more than account for thi veri small enhanc of price the first of these event wa the civil war which by discourag tillag and interrupt commerc must have rais the price of corn much abov what the cours of the season would otherwis have occas it must have had thi effect more or less at all the differ market in the kingdom but particularli at those in the neighbourhood of london which requir to be suppli from the greatest distanc in accordingli the price of the best wheat at windsor market appear from the same account to have been s and in to have been the quarter of nine bushel the excess of those two year abov s the averag price of the sixteen year preced is s which divid among the sixti four last year of the last centuri will alon veri nearli account for that small enhanc of price which seem to have taken place in them these howev though the highest ar by no mean the onli high price which seem to have been occas by the civil war the second event wa the bounti upon the export of corn grant in the bounti it ha been thought by mani peopl by encourag tillag mai in a long cours of year have occas a greater abund and consequ a greater cheap of corn in the home market than what would otherwis have taken place there how far the bounti could produc thi effect at ani time i shall examin hereaft i shall onli observ at present that between and it had not time to produc ani such effect dure thi short period it onli effect must have been by encourag the export of the surplu produc of everi year and therebi hinder the abund of on year from compens the scarciti of anoth to rais the price in the home market the scarciti which prevail in england from to both inclus though no doubt princip ow to the bad of the season and therefor extend through a consider part of europ must have been somewhat enhanc by the bounti in accordingli the further export of corn wa prohibit for nine month there wa a third event which occur in the cours of the same period and which though it could not occas ani scarciti of corn nor perhap ani augment in the real quantiti of silver which wa usual paid for it must necessarili have occas some augment in the nomin sum thi event wa the great debas of the silver coin by clip and wear thi evil had begun in the reign of charl ii and had gone on continu increas till at which time as we mai learn from mr lownd the current silver coin wa at an averag near fiveandtwenti per cent below it standard valu but the nomin sum which constitut the market price of everi commod is necessarili regul not so much by the quantiti of silver which accord to the standard ought to be contain in it as by that which it is found by experi actual is contain in it thi nomin sum therefor is necessarili higher when the coin is much debas by clip and wear than when near to it standard valu in the cours of the present centuri the silver coin ha not at ani time been more below it standard weight than it is at present but though veri much defac it valu ha been kept up by that of the gold coin for which it is exchang for though befor the late recoinag the gold coin wa a good deal defac too it wa less so than the silver in on the contrari the valu of the silver coin wa not kept up by the gold coin a guinea then commonli exchang for thirti shill of the worn and clipt silver befor the late recoinag of the gold the price of silver bullion wa seldom higher than five shill and sevenp an ounc which is but fivep abov the mint price but in the common price of silver bullion wa six shill and fivep an ounc lowndess essai on the silver coin which is fifteen penc abov the mint price even befor the late recoinag of the gold therefor the coin gold and silver togeth when compar with silver bullion wa not suppos to be more than eight per cent below it standard valu in on the contrari it had been suppos to be near fiveandtwenti per cent below that valu but in the begin of the present centuri that is immedi after the great recoinag in king william time the greater part of the current silver coin must have been still nearer to it standard weight than it is at present in the cours of the present centuri too there ha been no great public calam such as a civil war which could either discourag tillag or interrupt the interior commerc of the countri and though the bounti which ha taken place through the greater part of thi centuri must alwai rais the price of corn somewhat higher than it otherwis would be in the actual state of tillag yet as in the cours of thi centuri the bounti ha had full time to produc all the good effect commonli imput to it to encourag tillag and therebi to increas the quantiti of corn in the home market it mai upon the principl of a system which i shall explain and examin hereaft be suppos to have done someth to lower the price of that commod the on wai as well as to rais it the other it is by mani peopl suppos to have done more in the sixtyfour year of the present centuri accordingli the averag price of the quarter of nine bushel of the best wheat at windsor market appear by the account of eton colleg to have been which is about ten shill and sixpenc or more than fiveandtwenti percent cheaper than it had been dure the sixtyfour last year of the last centuri and about nine shill and sixpenc cheaper than it had been dure the sixteen year preced when the discoveri of the abund mine of america mai be suppos to have produc it full effect and about on shill cheaper than it had been in the twentysix year preced befor that discoveri can well be suppos to have produc it full effect accord to thi account the averag price of middl wheat dure these sixtyfour first year of the present centuri come out to have been about thirtytwo shill the quarter of eight bushel the valu of silver therefor seem to have risen somewhat in proport to that of corn dure the cours of the present centuri and it had probabl begun to do so even some time befor the end of the last in the price of the quarter of nine bushel of the best wheat at windsor market wa the lowest price at which it had ever been from in mr gregori king a man famou for hi knowledg in matter of thi kind estim the averag price of wheat in year of moder plenti to be to the grower s d the bushel or eightandtwenti shill the quarter the grower price i understand to be the same with what is sometim call the contract price or the price at which a farmer contract for a certain number of year to deliv a certain quantiti of corn to a dealer as a contract of thi kind save the farmer the expens and troubl of market the contract price is gener lower than what is suppos to be the averag market price mr king had judg eightandtwenti shill the quarter to be at that time the ordinari contract price in year of moder plenti befor the scarciti occas by the late extraordinari cours of bad season it wa i have been assur the ordinari contract price in all common year in wa grant the parliamentari bounti upon the export of corn the countri gentlemen who then compos a still greater proport of the legislatur than thei do at present had felt that the monei price of corn wa fall the bounti wa an expedi to rais it artifici to the high price at which it had frequent been sold in the time of charl i and ii it wa to take place therefor till wheat wa so high as fortyeight shill the quarter that is twenti shill or th dearer than mr king had in that veri year estim the grower price to be in time of moder plenti if hi calcul deserv ani part of the reput which thei have obtain veri univers eightandforti shill the quarter wa a price which without some such expedi as the bounti could not at that time be expect except in year of extraordinari scarciti but the govern of king william wa not then fulli settl it wa in no condit to refus anyth to the countri gentlemen from whom it wa at that veri time solicit the first establish of the annual landtax the valu of silver therefor in proport to that of corn had probabl risen somewhat befor the end of the last centuri and it seem to have continu to do so dure the cours of the greater part of the present though the necessari oper of the bounti must have hinder that rise from be so sensibl as it otherwis would have been in the actual state of tillag in plenti year the bounti by occas an extraordinari export necessarili rais the price of corn abov what it otherwis would be in those year to encourag tillag by keep up the price of corn even in the most plenti year wa the avow end of the institut in year of great scarciti inde the bounti ha gener been suspend it must howev have had some effect upon the price of mani of those year by the extraordinari export which it occas in year of plenti it must frequent hinder the plenti of on year from compens the scarciti of anoth both in year of plenti and in year of scarciti therefor the bounti rais the price of corn abov what it natur would be in the actual state of tillag if dure the sixtyfour first year of the present centuri therefor the averag price ha been lower than dure the sixtyfour last year of the last centuri it must in the same state of tillag have been much more so had it not been for thi oper of the bounti but without the bounti it mai be said the state of tillag would not have been the same what mai have been the effect of thi institut upon the agricultur of the countri i shall endeavour to explain hereaft when i come to treat particularli of bounti i shall onli observ at present that thi rise in the valu of silver in proport to that of corn ha not been peculiar to england it ha been observ to have taken place in franc dure the same period and nearli in the same proport too by three veri faith dilig and labori collector of the price of corn mr dupr de st maur mr messanc and the author of the essai on the polic of grain but in franc till the export of grain wa by law prohibit and it is somewhat difficult to suppos that nearli the same diminut of price which took place in on countri notwithstand thi prohibit should in anoth be ow to the extraordinari encourag given to export it would be more proper perhap to consid thi variat in the averag monei price of corn as the effect rather of some gradual rise in the real valu of silver in the european market than of ani fall in the real averag valu of corn corn it ha alreadi been observ is at distant period of time a more accur measur of valu than either silver or perhap ani other commod when after the discoveri of the abund mine of america corn rose to three and four time it former monei price thi chang wa univers ascrib not to ani rise in the real valu of corn but to a fall in the real valu of silver if dure the sixtyfour first year of the present centuri therefor the averag monei price of corn ha fallen somewhat below what it had been dure the greater part of the last centuri we should in the same manner imput thi chang not to ani fall in the real valu of corn but to some rise in the real valu of silver in the european market the high price of corn dure these ten or twelv year past inde ha occas a suspicion that the real valu of silver still continu to fall in the european market thi high price of corn howev seem evid to have been the effect of the extraordinari unfavour of the season and ought therefor to be regard not as a perman but as a transitori and occasion event the season for these ten or twelv year past have been unfavour through the greater part of europ and the disord of poland have veri much increas the scarciti in all those countri which in dear year us to be suppli from that market so long a cours of bad season though not a veri common event is by no mean a singular on and whoever ha inquir much into the histori of the price of corn in former time will be at no loss to recollect sever other exampl of the same kind ten year of extraordinari scarciti besid ar not more wonder than ten year of extraordinari plenti the low price of corn from to both inclus mai veri well be set in opposit to it high price dure these last eight or ten year from to the averag price of the quarter of nine bushel of the best wheat at windsor market it appear from the account of eton colleg wa onli which is nearli s d below the averag price of the sixtyfour first year of the present centuri the averag price of the quarter of eight bushel of middl wheat come out accord to thi account to have been dure these ten year onli between and howev the bounti must have hinder the price of corn from fall so low in the home market as it natur would have done dure these ten year the quantiti of all sort of grain export it appear from the customhous book amount to no less than quarter on bushel the bounti paid for thi amount to in accordingli mr pelham at that time prime minist observ to the hous of common that for the three year preced a veri extraordinari sum had been paid as bounti for the export of corn he had good reason to make thi observ and in the follow year he might have had still better in that singl year the bounti paid amount to no less than see tract on the corn trade tract it is unnecessari to observ how much thi forc export must have rais the price of corn abov what it otherwis would have been in the home market at the end of the account annex to thi chapter the reader will find the particular account of those ten year separ from the rest he will find there too the particular account of the preced ten year of which the averag is likewis below though not so much below the gener averag of the sixtyfour first year of the centuri the year howev wa a year of extraordinari scarciti these twenti year preced mai veri well be set in opposit to the twenti preced as the former were a good deal below the gener averag of the centuri notwithstand the intervent of on or two dear year so the latter have been a good deal abov it notwithstand the intervent of on or two cheap on of for exampl if the former have not been as much below the gener averag as the latter have been abov it we ought probabl to imput it to the bounti the chang ha evid been too sudden to be ascrib to ani chang in the valu of silver which is alwai slow and gradual the sudden of the effect can be account for onli by a caus which can oper suddenli the accident variat of the season the monei price of labour in great britain ha inde risen dure the cours of the present centuri thi howev seem to be the effect not so much of ani diminut in the valu of silver in the european market as of an increas in the demand for labour in great britain aris from the great and almost univers prosper of the countri in franc a countri not altogeth so prosper the monei price of labour ha sinc the middl of the last centuri been observ to sink gradual with the averag monei price of corn both in the last centuri and in the present the dai wage of common labour ar there said to have been pretti uniformli about the twentieth part of the averag price of the septier of wheat a measur which contain a littl more than four winchest bushel in great britain the real recomp of labour it ha alreadi been shewn the real quantiti of the necessari and conveni of life which ar given to the labour ha increas consider dure the cours of the present centuri the rise in it monei price seem to have been the effect not of ani diminut of the valu of silver in the gener market of europ but of a rise in the real price of labour in the particular market of great britain ow to the peculiarli happi circumst of the countri for some time after the first discoveri of america silver would continu to sell at it former or not much below it former price the profit of mine would for some time be veri great and much abov their natur rate those who import that metal into europ howev would soon find that the whole annual import could not be dispos of at thi high price silver would gradual exchang for a smaller and a smaller quantiti of good it price would sink gradual lower and lower till it fell to it natur price or to what wa just suffici to pai accord to their natur rate the wage of the labour the profit of the stock and the rent of the land which must be paid in order to bring it from the mine to the market in the greater part of the silver mine of peru the tax of the king of spain amount to a tenth of the gross produc eat up it ha alreadi been observ the whole rent of the land thi tax wa origin a half it soon afterward fell to a third then to a fifth and at last to a tenth at which late it still continu in the greater part of the silver mine of peru thi it seem is all that remain after replac the stock of the undertak of the work togeth with it ordinari profit and it seem to be univers acknowledg that these profit which were onc veri high ar now as low as thei can well be consist with carri on the work the tax of the king of spain wa reduc to a fifth of the regist silver in solorzano vol ii oneandforti year befor the date of the discoveri of the mine of potosi in the cours of nineti year or befor these mine the most fertil in all america had time suffici to produc their full effect or to reduc the valu of silver in the european market as low as it could well fall while it continu to pai thi tax to the king of spain nineti year is time suffici to reduc ani commod of which there is no monopoli to it natur price or to the lowest price at which while it pai a particular tax it can continu to be sold for ani consider time togeth the price of silver in the european market might perhap have fallen still lower and it might have becom necessari either to reduc the tax upon it not onli to onetenth as in but to on twentieth in the same manner as that upon gold or to give up work the greater part of the american mine which ar now wrought the gradual increas of the demand for silver or the gradual enlarg of the market for the produc of the silver mine of america is probabl the caus which ha prevent thi from happen and which ha not onli kept up the valu of silver in the european market but ha perhap even rais it somewhat higher than it wa about the middl of the last centuri sinc the first discoveri of america the market for the produc of it silver mine ha been grow gradual more and more extens first the market of europ ha becom gradual more and more extens sinc the discoveri of america the greater part of europ ha been much improv england holland franc and germani even sweden denmark and russia have all advanc consider both in agricultur and in manufactur itali seem not to have gone backward the fall of itali preced the conquest of peru sinc that time it seem rather to have recov a littl spain and portug inde ar suppos to have gone backward portug howev is but a veri small part of europ and the declens of spain is not perhap so great as is commonli imagin in the begin of the sixteenth centuri spain wa a veri poor countri even in comparison with franc which ha been so much improv sinc that time it wa the well known remark of the emperor charl v who had travel so frequent through both countri that everi thing abound in franc but that everi thing wa want in spain the increas produc of the agricultur and manufactur of europ must necessarili have requir a gradual increas in the quantiti of silver coin to circul it and the increas number of wealthi individu must have requir the like increas in the quantiti of their plate and other ornament of silver secondli america is itself a new market for the produc of it own silver mine and as it advanc in agricultur industri and popul ar much more rapid than those of the most thrive countri in europ it demand must increas much more rapidli the english coloni ar altogeth a new market which partli for coin and partli for plate requir a continu augment suppli of silver through a great contin where there never wa ani demand befor the greater part too of the spanish and portugues coloni ar altogeth new market new granada the yucatan paraguai and the brazil were befor discov by the european inhabit by savag nation who had neither art nor agricultur a consider degre of both ha now been introduc into all of

splendid state of those countri in ancient time whoever read with ani degre of sober judgment the histori of their first discoveri and conquest will evid discern that in art agricultur and commerc their inhabit were much more ignor than the tartar of the ukrain ar at present even the peruvian the more civil nation of the two though thei made us of gold and silver as ornament had no coin monei of ani kind their whole commerc wa carri on by barter and there wa accordingli scarc ani divis of labour among them those who cultiv the ground were oblig to build their own hous to make their own

half that number found almost everywher great difficulti in procur subsist the famin which thei ar said to have occas almost wherev thei went in countri too which at the same time ar repres as veri popul and well cultiv suffici demonstr that the stori of thi popul and high cultiv is in a great measur fabul the spanish coloni ar under a govern in mani respect less favour to agricultur improv and popul than that of the english coloni thei seem howev to be advanc in all those much more rapidli than ani countri in europ in a fertil soil and happi climat the great abund and cheap of land a

the same and as there seem to be no reason to doubt of the good inform of either it mark an increas which is scarc inferior to that of the english coloni america therefor is a new market for the produc of it own silver mine of which the demand must increas much more rapidli than that of the most thrive countri in europ thirdli the east indi is anoth market for the produc of the silver mine of america and a market which from the time of the first discoveri of those mine ha been continu take off a greater and a greater quantiti of silver sinc that time the direct trade between america and

quantiti of food in india than in europ but the mine which suppli the indian market with the preciou metal seem to have been a good deal less abund and those which suppli it with the preciou stone a good deal more so than the mine which suppli the european the preciou metal therefor would natur exchang in india for a somewhat greater quantiti of the preciou stone and for a much greater quantiti of food than in europ the monei price of diamond the greatest of all superflu would be somewhat lower and that of food the first of all necessari a great deal lower in the on countri than in the other but the real price of labour the real quantiti of the necessari of life which is given to the labour it ha alreadi been observ is lower both in china and indostan the two great market of india than it is through the greater part of europ the wage of the labour will there purchas a smaller quantiti of food and as the monei price of food is much lower in india than in europ the monei price of labour is there lower upon a doubl account upon account both of the small quantiti of food which it will purchas and of the low price of that food but in countri of equal art and industri the monei price of the greater part of manufactur will be in proport to the monei price of labour and in manufactur art and industri china and indostan though inferior seem not to be much inferior to ani part of europ the monei price of the greater part of manufactur therefor will natur be much lower in those great empir than it is anywher in europ through the greater part of europ too the expens of landcarriag increas veri much both the real and nomin price of most manufactur it cost more labour and therefor more monei to bring first the materi and afterward the complet manufactur to market in china and indostan the extent and varieti of inland navig save the greater part of thi labour and consequ of thi monei and therebi reduc still lower both the real and the nomin price of the greater part of their manufactur upon all these account the preciou metal ar a commod which it alwai ha been and still continu to be extrem advantag to carri from europ to india there is scarc ani commod which bring a better price there or which in proport to the quantiti of labour and commod which it cost in europ will purchas or command a greater quantiti of labour and commod in india it is more advantag too to carri silver thither than gold becaus in china and the greater part of the other market of india the proport between fine silver and fine gold is but as ten or at most as twelv to on wherea in europ it is as fourteen or fifteen to on in china and the greater part of the other market of india ten or at most twelv ounc of silver will purchas an ounc of gold in europ it requir from fourteen to fifteen ounc in the cargo therefor of the greater part of european ship which sail to india silver ha gener been on of the most valuabl articl it is the most valuabl articl in the acapulco ship which sail to manilla the silver of the new contin seem in thi manner to be on of the princip commod by which the commerc between the two extrem of the old on is carri on and it is by mean of it in a great measur that those distant part of the world ar connect with on anoth in order to suppli so veri wide extend a market the quantiti of silver annual brought from the mine must not onli be suffici to support that continu increas both of coin and of plate which is requir in all thrive countri but to repair that continu wast and consumpt of silver which take place in all countri where that metal is us the continu consumpt of the preciou metal in coin by wear and in plate both by wear and clean is veri sensibl and in commod of which the us is so veri wide extend would alon requir a veri great annual suppli the consumpt of those metal in some particular manufactur though it mai not perhap be greater upon the whole than thi gradual consumpt is howev much more sensibl as it is much more rapid in the manufactur of birmingham alon the quantiti of gold and silver annual emploi in gild and plate and therebi disqualifi from ever afterward appear in the shape of those metal is said to amount to more than fifti thousand pound sterl we mai from thenc form some notion how great must be the annual consumpt in all the differ part of the world either in manufactur of the same kind with those of birmingham or in lace embroideri gold and silver stuff the gild of book furnitur etc a consider quantiti too must be annual lost in transport those metal from on place to anoth both by sea and by land in the greater part of the govern of asia besid the almost univers custom of conceal treasur in the bowel of the earth of which the knowledg frequent di with the person who make the conceal must occas the loss of a still greater quantiti the quantiti of gold and silver import at both cadiz and lisbon includ not onli what come under regist but what mai be suppos to be smuggl amount accord to the best account to about six million sterl ayear accord to mr meggen postscript to the univers merchant p and thi postscript wa not print till three year after the public of the book which ha never had a second edit the postscript is therefor to be found in few copi it correct sever error in the book the annual import of the preciou metal into spain at an averag of six year viz from to both inclus and into portug at an averag of seven year viz from to both inclus amount in silver to pound weight and in gold to pound weight the silver at sixti two shill the pound troi amount to s sterl the gold at fortyfour guinea and a half the pound troi amount to s sterl both togeth amount to s sterl the account of what wa import under regist he assur us is exact he give us the detail of the particular place from which the gold and silver were brought and of the particular quantiti of each metal which accord to the regist each of them afford he make an allow too for the quantiti of each metal which he suppos mai have been smuggl the great experi of thi judici merchant render hi opinion of consider weight accord to the eloqu and sometim wellinform author of the philosoph and polit histori of the

have been smuggl howev the whole annual import he suppos mai have amount to seventeen million of piastr which at s d the piastr is equal to sterl he give the detail too of the particular place from which the gold and silver were brought and of the particular quantiti of each metal which accord to the regist each of them afford he inform us too that if we were to judg of the quantiti of gold annual import from the brazil to lisbon by the amount of the tax paid to the king of portug which it seem is onefifth of the standard metal we might valu it at eighteen million of cruzado or fortyf million of french livr equal to about twenti million sterl on account of what mai have been smuggl howev we mai safe he sai add to thi sum an eighth more or sterl so that the whole will amount to sterl accord to thi account therefor the whole annual import of the preciou metal into both spain and portug mount to about sterl sever other veri well authent though manuscript account i have been assur agre in make thi whole annual import amount at an averag to about six million sterl sometim a littl more sometim a littl less the annual import of the preciou metal into cadiz and lisbon inde is not equal to the whole annual produc of the mine of america some part is sent annual by the acapulco ship to manilla some part is emploi in a contraband trade which the spanish coloni carri on with those of other european nation and some part no doubt remain in the countri the mine of america besid ar by no mean the onli gold and silver mine in the world thei ar howev by far the most abund the produc of all the other mine which ar known is insignific it is acknowledg in comparison with their and the far greater part of their produc it is likewis acknowledg is annual import into cadiz and lisbon but the consumpt of birmingham alon at the rate of fifti thousand pound ayear is equal to the hundredandtwentieth part of thi annual import at the rate of six million ayear the whole annual consumpt of gold and silver therefor in all the differ countri of the world where those metal ar us mai perhap be nearli equal to the whole annual produc the remaind mai be no more than suffici to suppli the increas demand of all thrive countri it mai even have fallen so far short of thi demand as somewhat to rais the price of those metal in the european market the quantiti of brass and iron annual brought from the mine to the market is out of all proport greater than that of gold and silver we do not howev upon thi account imagin that those coars metal ar like to multipli beyond the demand or to becom gradual cheaper and cheaper why should we imagin that the preciou metal ar like to do so the coars metal inde though harder ar put to much harder us and as thei ar of less valu less care is emploi in their preserv the preciou metal howev ar not necessarili immort ani more than thei but ar liabl too to be lost wast and consum in a great varieti of wai the price of all metal though liabl to slow and gradual variat vari less from year to year than that of almost ani other part of the rude produc of land and the price of the preciou metal is even less liabl to sudden variat than that of the coars on the durabl of metal is the foundat of thi extraordinari steadi of price the corn which wa brought to market last year will be all or almost all consum long befor the end of thi year but some part of the iron which wa brought from the mine two or three hundr year ago mai be still in us and perhap some part of the gold which wa brought from it two or three thousand year ago the differ mass of corn which in differ year must suppli the consumpt of the world will alwai be nearli in proport to the respect produc of those differ year but the proport between the differ mass of iron which mai be in us in two differ year will be veri littl affect by ani accident differ in the produc of the iron mine of those two year and the proport between the mass of gold will be still less affect by ani such differ in the produc of the gold mine though the produc of the greater part of metal mine therefor vari perhap still more from year to year than that of the greater part of corn field those variat have not the same effect upon the price of the on speci of commod as upon that of the other variat in the proport between the respect valu of gold and silver befor the discoveri of the mine of america the valu of fine gold to fine silver wa regul in the differ mine of europ between the proport of on to ten and on to twelv that is an ounc of fine gold wa suppos to be worth from ten to twelv ounc of fine silver about the middl of the last centuri it came to be regul between the proport of on to fourteen and on to fifteen that is an ounc of fine gold came to be suppos worth between fourteen and fifteen ounc of fine silver gold rose in it nomin valu or in the quantiti of silver which wa given for it both metal sunk in their real valu or in the quantiti of labour which thei could purchas but silver sunk more than gold though both the gold and silver mine of america exceed in fertil all those which had ever been known befor the fertil of the silver mine had it seem been proportion still greater than that of the gold on the great quantiti of silver carri annual from europ to india have in some of the english settlement gradual reduc the valu of that metal in proport to gold in the mint of calcutta an ounc of fine gold is suppos to be worth fifteen ounc of fine silver in the same manner as in europ it is in the mint perhap rate too high for the valu which it bear in the market of bengal in china the proport of gold to silver still continu as on to ten or on to twelv in japan it is said to be as on to eight the proport between the quantiti of gold and silver annual import into europ accord to mr meggen account is as on to twentytwo nearli that is for on ounc of gold there ar import a littl more than twentytwo ounc of silver the great quantiti of silver sent annual to the east indi reduc he suppos the quantiti of those metal which remain in europ to the proport of on to fourteen or fifteen the proport of their valu the proport between their valu he seem to think must necessarili be the same as that between their quantiti and would therefor be as on to twentytwo were it not for thi greater export of silver but the ordinari proport between the respect valu of two commod is not necessarili the same as that between the quantiti of them which ar commonli in the market the price of an ox reckon at ten guinea is about three score time the price of a lamb reckon at s d it would be absurd howev to infer from thenc that there ar commonli in the market three score lamb for on ox and it would be just as absurd to infer becaus an ounc of gold will commonli purchas from fourteen or fifteen ounc of silver that there ar commonli in the market onli fourteen or fifteen ounc of silver for on ounc of gold the quantiti of silver commonli in the market it is probabl is much greater in proport to that of gold than the valu of a certain quantiti of gold is to that of an equal quantiti of silver the whole quantiti of a cheap commod brought to market is commonli not onli greater but of greater valu than the whole quantiti of a dear on the whole quantiti of bread annual brought to market is not onli greater but of greater valu than the whole quantiti of butcher meat the whole quantiti of butcher meat than the whole quantiti of poultri and the whole quantiti of poultri than the whole quantiti of wild fowl there ar so mani more purchas for the cheap than for the dear commod that not onli a greater quantiti of it but a greater valu can commonli be dispos of the whole quantiti therefor of the cheap commod must commonli be greater in proport to the whole quantiti of the dear on than the valu of a certain quantiti of the dear on is to the valu of an equal quantiti of the cheap on when we compar the preciou metal with on anoth silver is a cheap and gold a dear commod we ought natur to expect therefor that there should alwai be in the market not onli a greater quantiti but a greater valu of silver than of gold let ani man who ha a littl of both compar hi own silver with hi gold plate and he will probabl find that not onli the quantiti but the valu of the former greatli exce that of the latter mani peopl besid have a good deal of silver who have no gold plate which even with those who have it is gener confin to watchcas snuffbox and such like trinket of which the whole amount is seldom of great valu in the british coin inde the valu of the gold preponder greatli but it is not so in that of all countri in the coin of some countri the valu of the two metal is nearli equal in the scotch coin befor the union with england the gold preponder veri littl though it did somewhat see ruddiman prefac to anderson diplomata etc scotia as it appear by the account of the mint in the coin of mani countri the silver preponder in franc the largest sum ar commonli paid in that metal and it is there difficult to get more gold than what is necessari to carri about in your pocket the superior valu howev of the silver plate abov that of the gold which take place in all countri will much more than compens the preponder of the gold coin abov the silver which take place onli in some countri though in on sens of the word silver alwai ha been and probabl alwai will be much cheaper than gold yet in anoth sens gold mai perhap in the present state of the spanish market be said to be somewhat cheaper than silver a commod mai be said to be dear or cheap not onli accord to the absolut great or small of it usual price but accord as that price is more or less abov the lowest for which it is possibl to bring it to market for ani consider time togeth thi lowest price is that which bare replac with a moder profit the stock which must be emploi in bring the commod thither it is the price which afford noth to the landlord of which rent make not ani compon part but which resolv itself altogeth into wage and profit but in the present state of the spanish market gold is certainli somewhat nearer to thi lowest price than silver the tax of the king of spain upon gold is onli onetwentieth part of the standard metal or five per cent wherea hi tax upon silver amount to onetenth part of it or to ten per cent in these tax too it ha alreadi been observ consist the whole rent of the greater part of the gold and silver mine of spanish america and that upon gold is still wors paid than that upon silver the profit of the undertak of gold mine too as thei more rare make a fortun must in gener be still more moder than those of the undertak of silver mine the price of spanish gold therefor as it afford both less rent and less profit must in the spanish market be somewhat nearer to the lowest price for which it is possibl to bring it thither than the price of spanish silver when all expens ar comput the whole quantiti of the on metal it would seem cannot in the spanish market be dispos of so advantag as the whole quantiti of the other the tax inde of the king of portug upon the gold of the brazil is the same with the ancient tax of the king of spain upon the silver of mexico and peru or onefifth part of the standard metal it mai therefor be uncertain whether to the gener market of europ the whole mass of american gold come at a price nearer to the lowest for which it is possibl to bring it thither than the whole mass of american silver the price of diamond and other preciou stone mai perhap be still nearer to the lowest price at which it is possibl to bring them to market than even the price of gold though it is not veri probabl that ani part of a tax which is not onli impos upon on of the most proper subject of taxat a mere luxuri and superflu but which afford so veri import a revenu as the tax upon silver will ever be given up as long as it is possibl to pai it yet the same imposs of pai it which in made it necessari to reduc it from onefifth to onetenth mai in time make it necessari to reduc it still further in the same manner as it made it necessari to reduc the tax upon gold to onetwentieth that the silver mine of spanish america like all other mine becom gradual more expens in the work on account of the greater depth at which it is necessari to carri on the work and of the greater expens of draw out the water and of suppli them with fresh air at those depth is acknowledg by everybodi who ha inquir into the state of those mine these caus which ar equival to a grow scarciti of silver for a commod mai be said to grow scarcer when it becom more difficult and expens to collect a certain quantiti of it must in time produc on or other of the three follow event the increas of the expens must either first be compens altogeth by a proportion increas in the price of the metal or secondli it must be compens altogeth by a proportion diminut of the tax upon silver or thirdli it must be compens partli by the on and partli by the other of those two expedi thi third event is veri possibl as gold rose in it price in proport to silver notwithstand a great diminut of the tax upon gold so silver might rise in it price in proport to labour and commod notwithstand an equal diminut of the tax upon silver such success reduct of the tax howev though thei mai not prevent altogeth must certainli retard more or less the rise of the valu of silver in the european market in consequ of such reduct mani mine mai be wrought which could not be wrought befor becaus thei could not afford to pai the old tax and the quantiti of silver annual brought to market must alwai be somewhat greater and therefor the valu of ani given quantiti somewhat less than it otherwis would have been in consequ of the reduct in the valu of silver in the european market though it mai not at thi dai be lower than befor that reduct is probabl at least ten per cent lower than it would have been had the court of spain continu to exact the old tax that notwithstand thi reduct the valu of silver ha dure the cours of the present centuri begun to rise somewhat in the european market the fact and argument which have been alleg abov dispos me to believ or more properli to suspect and conjectur for the best opinion which i can form upon thi subject scarc perhap deserv the name of belief the rise inde suppos there ha been ani ha hitherto been so veri small that after all that ha been said it mai perhap appear to mani peopl uncertain not onli whether thi event ha actual taken place but whether the contrari mai not have taken place or whether the valu of silver mai not still continu to fall in the european market it must be observ howev that whatev mai be the suppos annual import of gold and silver there must be a certain period at which the annual consumpt of those metal will be equal to that annual import their consumpt must increas as their mass increas or rather in a much greater proport as their mass increas their valu diminish thei ar more us and less care for and their consumpt consequ increas in a greater proport than their mass after a certain period therefor the annual consumpt of those metal must in thi manner becom equal to their annual import provid that import is not continu increas which in the present time is not suppos to be the case if when the annual consumpt ha becom equal to the annual import the annual import should gradual diminish the annual consumpt mai for some time exce the annual import the mass of those metal mai gradual and insens diminish and their valu gradual and insens rise till the annual import becom again stationari the annual consumpt will gradual and insens accommod itself to what that annual import can maintain ground of the suspicion that the valu of silver still continu to decreas the increas of the wealth of europ and the popular notion that as the quantiti of the preciou metal natur increas with the increas of wealth so their valu diminish as their quantiti increas mai perhap dispos mani peopl to believ that their valu still continu to fall in the european market and the still gradual increas price of mani part of the rude produc of land mai confirm them still farther in thi opinion that that increas in the quantiti of the preciou metal which aris in ani countri from the increas of wealth ha no tendenc to diminish their valu i have endeavour to shew alreadi gold and silver natur resort to a rich countri for the same reason that all sort of luxuri and curios resort to it not becaus thei ar cheaper there than in poorer countri but becaus thei ar dearer or becaus a better price is given for them it is the superior of price which attract them and as soon as that superior ceas thei necessarili ceas to go thither if you except corn and such other veget as ar rais altogeth by human industri that all other sort of rude produc cattl poultri game of all kind the us fossil and miner of the earth etc natur grow dearer as the societi advanc in wealth and improv i have endeavour to shew alreadi though such commod therefor come to exchang for a greater quantiti of silver than befor it will not from thenc follow that silver ha becom realli cheaper or will purchas less labour than befor but that such commod have becom realli dearer or will purchas more labour than befor it is not their nomin price onli but their real price which rise in the progress of improv the rise of their nomin price is the effect not of ani degrad of the valu of silver but of the rise in their real price differ effect of the progress of improv upon three differ sort of rude produc these differ sort of rude produc mai be divid into three class the first comprehend those which it is scarc in the power of human industri to multipli at all the second those which it can multipli in proport to the demand the third those in which the efficaci of industri is either limit or uncertain in the progress of wealth and improv the real price of the first mai rise to ani degre of extravag and seem not to be limit by ani certain boundari that of the second though it mai rise greatli ha howev a certain boundari beyond which it cannot well pass for ani consider time togeth that of the third though it natur tendenc is to rise in the progress of improv yet in the same degre of improv it mai sometim happen even to fall sometim to continu the same and sometim to rise more or less accord as differ accid render the effort of human industri in multipli thi sort of rude produc more or less success first sortth first sort of rude produc of which the price rise in the progress of improv is that which it is scarc in the power of human industri to multipli at all it consist in those thing which natur produc onli in certain quantiti and which be of a veri perish natur it is imposs to accumul togeth the produc of mani differ season such ar the greater part of rare and singular bird and fish mani differ sort of game almost all wildfowl all bird of passag in particular as well as mani other thing when wealth and the luxuri which accompani it increas the demand for these is like to increas with them and no effort of human industri mai be abl to increas the suppli much beyond what it wa befor thi increas of the demand the quantiti of such commod therefor remain the same or nearli the same while the competit to purchas them is continu increas their price mai rise to ani degre of extravag and seem not to be limit by ani certain boundari if woodcock should becom so fashion as to sell for twenti guinea apiec no effort of human industri could increas the number of those brought to market much beyond what it is at present the high price paid by the roman in the time of their greatest grandeur for rare bird and fish mai in thi manner easili be account for these price were not the effect of the low valu of silver in those time but of the high valu of such rariti and curios as human industri could not multipli at pleasur the real valu of silver wa higher at rome for sometim befor and after the fall of the republ than it is through the greater part of europ at present three sestertii equal to about sixpenc sterl wa the price which the republ paid for the modiu or peck of the tith wheat of sicili thi price howev wa probabl below the averag market price the oblig to deliv their wheat at thi rate be consid as a tax upon the sicilian farmer when the roman therefor had occas to order more corn than the tith of wheat amount to thei were bound by capitul to pai for the surplu at the rate of four sestertii or eightpenc sterl the peck and thi had probabl been reckon the moder and reason that is the ordinari or averag contract price of those time it is equal to about oneandtwenti shill the quarter eightandtwenti shill the quarter wa befor the late year of scarciti the ordinari contract price of english wheat which in qualiti is inferior to the sicilian and gener sell for a lower price in the european market the valu of silver therefor in those ancient time must have been to it valu in the present as three to four invers that is three ounc of silver would then have purchas the same quantiti of labour and commod which four ounc will do at present when we read in plini therefor that seiu lib x c bought a white nightingal as a present for the empress agrippina at the price of six thousand sestertii equal to about fifti pound of our present monei and that asiniu celer lib ix c purchas a surmullet at the price of eight thousand sestertii equal to about sixtysix pound thirteen shill and fourpenc of our present monei the extravag of those price how much soever it mai surpris us is apt notwithstand to appear to us about on third less than it realli wa their real price the quantiti of labour and subsist which wa given awai for them wa about onethird more than their nomin price is apt to express to us in the present time seiu gave for the nightingal the command of a quantiti of labour and subsist equal to what d would purchas in the present time and asiniu celer gave for a surmullet the command of a quantiti equal to what d would purchas what occas the extravag of those high price wa not so much the abund of silver as the abund of labour and subsist of which those roman had the dispos beyond what wa necessari for their own us the quantiti of silver of which thei had the dispos wa a good deal less than what the command of the same quantiti of labour and subsist would have procur to them in the present time second sortth second sort of rude produc of which the price rise in the progress of improv is that which human industri can multipli in proport to the demand it consist in those us plant and anim which in uncultiv countri natur produc with such profus abund that thei ar of littl or no valu and which as cultiv advanc ar therefor forc to give place to some more profit produc dure a long period in the progress of improv the quantiti of these is continu diminish while at the same time the demand for them is continu increas their real valu therefor the real quantiti of labour which thei will purchas or command gradual rise till at last it get so high as to render them as profit a produc as ani thing els which human industri can rais upon the most fertil and best cultiv land when it ha got so high it cannot well go higher if it did more land and more industri would soon be emploi to increas their quantiti when the price of cattl for exampl rise so high that it is as profit to cultiv land in order to rais food for them as in order to rais food for man it cannot well go higher if it did more corn land would soon be turn into pastur the extens of tillag by diminish the quantiti of wild pastur diminish the quantiti of butcher meat which the countri natur produc without labour or cultiv and by increas the number of those who have either corn or what come to the same thing the price of corn to give in exchang for it increas the demand the price of butcher meat therefor and consequ of cattl must gradual rise till it get so high that it becom as profit to emploi the most fertil and best cultiv land in rais food for them as in rais corn but it must alwai be late in the progress of improv befor tillag can be so far extend as to rais the price of cattl to thi height and till it ha got to thi height if the countri is advanc at all their price must be continu rise there ar perhap some part of europ in which the price of cattl ha not yet got to thi height it had not got to thi height in ani part of scotland befor the union had the scotch cattl been alwai confin to the market of scotland in a countri in which the quantiti of land which can be appli to no other purpos but the feed of cattl is so great in proport to what can be appli to other purpos it is scarc possibl perhap that their price could ever have risen so high as to render it profit to cultiv land for the sake of feed them in england the price of cattl it ha alreadi been observ seem in the neighbourhood of london to have got to thi height about the begin of the last centuri but it wa much later probabl befor it got through the greater part of the remot counti in some of which perhap it mai scarc yet have got to it of all the differ substanc howev which compos thi second sort of rude produc cattl is perhap that of which the price in the progress of improv rise first to thi height till the price of cattl inde ha got to thi height it seem scarc possibl that the greater part even of those land which ar capabl of the highest cultiv can be complet cultiv in all farm too distant from ani town to carri manur from it that is in the far greater part of those of everi extens countri the quantiti of well cultiv land must be in proport to the quantiti of manur which the farm itself produc and thi again must be in proport to the stock of cattl which ar maintain upon it the land is manur either by pastur the cattl upon it or by feed them in the stabl and from thenc carri out their dung to it but unless the price of the cattl be suffici to pai both the rent and profit of cultiv land the farmer cannot afford to pastur them upon it and he can still less afford to feed them in the stabl it is with the produc of improv and cultiv land onli that cattl can be fed in the stabl becaus to collect the scanti and scatter produc of wast and unimprov land would requir too much labour and be too expens it the price of the cattl therefor is not suffici to pai for the produc of improv and cuitiv land when thei ar allow to pastur it that price will be still less suffici to pai for that produc when it must be collect with a good deal of addit labour and brought into the stabl to them in these circumst therefor no more cattl can with profit be fed in the stabl than what ar necessari for tillag but these can never afford manur enough for keep constantli in good condit all the land which thei ar capabl of cultiv what thei afford be insuffici for the whole farm will natur be reserv for the land to which it can be most advantag or conveni appli the most fertil or those perhap in the neighbourhood of the farmyard these therefor will be kept constantli in good condit and fit for tillag the rest will the greater part of them be allow to lie wast produc scarc ani thing but some miser pastur just suffici to keep aliv a few straggl halfstarv cattl the farm though much overstock in proport to what would be necessari for it complet cultiv be veri frequent overstock in proport to it actual produc a portion of thi wast land howev after have been pastur in thi wretch manner for six or seven year togeth mai be plough up when it will yield perhap a poor crop or two of bad oat or of some other coars grain and then be entir exhaust it must be rest and pastur again as befor and anoth portion plough up to be in the same manner exhaust and rest again in it turn such accordingli wa the gener system of manag all over the low countri of scotland befor the union the land which were kept constantli well manur and in good condit seldom exceed a third or fourth part of the whole farm and sometim did not amount to a fifth or a sixth part of it the rest were never manur but a certain portion of them wa in it turn notwithstand regularli cultiv and exhaust under thi system of manag it is evid even that part of the land of scotland which is capabl of good cultiv could produc but littl in comparison of what it mai be capabl of produc but how disadvantag soever thi system mai appear yet befor the union the low price of cattl seem to have render it almost unavoid if notwithstand a great rise in the price it still continu to prevail through a consider part of the countri it is ow in mani place no doubt to ignor and attach to old custom but in most place to the unavoid obstruct which the natur cours of thing oppos to the immedi or speedi establish of a better system first to the poverti of the tenant to their not have yet had time to acquir a stock of cattl suffici to cultiv their land more complet the same rise of price which would render it advantag for them to maintain a greater stock render it more difficult for them to acquir it and secondli to their not have yet had time to put their land in condit to maintain thi greater stock properli suppos thei were capabl of acquir it the increas of stock and the improv of land ar two event which must go hand in hand and of which the on can nowher much outrun the other without some increas of stock there can be scarc ani improv of land but there can be no consider increas of stock but in consequ of a consider improv of land becaus otherwis the land could not maintain it these natur obstruct to the establish of a better system cannot be remov but by a long cours of frugal and industri and half a centuri or a centuri more perhap must pass awai befor the old system which is wear out gradual can be complet abolish through all the differ part of the countri of all the commerci advantag howev which scotland ha deriv from the union with england thi rise in the price of cattl is perhap the greatest it ha not onli rais the valu of all highland estat but it ha perhap been the princip caus of the improv of the low countri in all new coloni the great quantiti of wast land which can for mani year be appli to no other purpos but the feed of cattl soon render them extrem abund and in everi thing great cheap is the necessari consequ of great abund though all the cattl of the european coloni in america were origin carri from europ thei soon multipli so much there and becam of so littl valu that even hors were allow to run wild in the wood without ani owner think it worth while to claim them it must be a long time after the first establish of such coloni befor it can becom profit to feed cattl upon the produc of cultiv land the same caus therefor the want of manur and the disproport between the stock emploi in cultiv and the land which it is destin to cultiv ar like to introduc there a system of husbandri not unlik that which still continu to take place in so mani part of scotland mr kalm the swedish travel when he give an account of the husbandri of some of the english coloni in north america as he found it in observ accordingli that he can with difficulti discov there the charact of the english nation so well skill in all the differ branch of agricultur thei make scarc ani manur for their corn field he sai but when on piec of ground ha been exhaust by continu crop thei clear and cultiv anoth piec of fresh land and when that is exhaust proce to a third their cattl ar allow to wander through the wood and other uncultiv ground where thei ar halfstarv have long ago extirp almost all the annual grass by crop them too earli in the spring befor thei had time to form their flower or to shed their seed kalm travel vol pp the annual grass were it seem the best natur grass in that part of north america and when the european first settl there thei us to grow veri thick and to rise three or four feet high a piec of ground which when he wrote could not maintain on cow would in former time he wa assur have maintain four each of which would have given four time the quantiti of milk which that on wa capabl of give the poor of the pastur had in hi opinion occas the degrad of their cattl which degener sensibl from me gener to anoth thei were probabl not unlik that stunt breed which wa common all over scotland thirti or forti year ago and which is now so much mend through the greater part of the low countri not so much by a chang of the breed though that expedi ha been emploi in some place as by a more plenti method of feed them though it is late therefor in the progress of improv befor cattl can bring such a price as to render it profit to cultiv land for the sake of feed them yet of all the differ part which compos thi second sort of rude produc thei ar perhap the first which bring thi price becaus till thei bring it it seem imposs that improv can be brought near even to that degre of perfect to which it ha arriv in mani part of europ as cattl ar among the first so perhap venison is among the last part of thi sort of rude produc which bring thi price the price of venison in great britain how extravag soever it mai appear is not near suffici to compens the expens of a deer park as is well known to all those who have had ani experi in the feed of deer if it wa otherwis the feed of deer would soon becom an articl of common farm in the same manner as the feed of those small bird call turdi wa among the ancient roman varro and columella assur us that it wa a most profit articl the fatten of ortolan bird of passag which arriv lean in the countri is said to be so in some part of franc if venison continu in fashion and the wealth and luxuri of great britain increas as thei have done for some time past it price mai veri probabl rise still higher than it is at present between that period in the progress of improv which bring to it height the price of so necessari an articl as cattl and that which bring to it the price of such a superflu as venison there is a veri long interv in the cours of which mani other sort of rude produc gradual arriv at their highest price some sooner and some later accord to differ circumst thu in everi farm the offal of the barn and stabl will maintain a certain number of poultri these as thei ar fed with what would otherwis be lost ar a mere saveal and as thei cost the farmer scarc ani thing so he can afford to sell them for veri littl almost all that he get is pure gain and their price can scarc be so low as to discourag him from feed thi number but in countri ill cultiv and therefor but thinli inhabit the poultri which ar thu rais without expens ar often fulli suffici to suppli the whole demand in thi state of thing therefor thei ar often as cheap as butcher meat or ani other sort of anim food but the whole quantiti of poultri which the farm in thi manner produc without expens must alwai be much smaller than the whole quantiti of butcher meat which is rear upon it and in time of wealth and luxuri what is rare with onli nearli equal merit is alwai prefer to what is common as wealth and luxuri increas therefor in consequ of improv and cultiv the price of poultri gradual rise abov that of butcher meat till at last it get so high that it becom profit to cultiv land for the sake of feed them when it ha got to thi height it cannot well go higher if it did more land would soon be turn to thi purpos in sever provinc of franc the feed of poultri is consid as a veri import articl in rural economi and suffici profit to encourag the farmer to rais a consider quantiti of indian corn and buckwheat for thi purpos a middl farmer will there sometim have four hundr fowl in hi yard the feed of poultri seem scarc yet to be gener consid as a matter of so much import in england thei ar certainli howev dearer in england than in franc as england receiv consider suppli from franc in the progress of improv the period at which everi particular sort of anim food is dearest must natur be that which immedi preced the gener practic of cultiv land for the sake of rais it for some time befor thi practic becom gener the scarciti must necessarili rais the price after it ha becom gener new method of feed ar commonli fallen upon which enabl the farmer to rais upon the same quantiti of ground a much greater quantiti of that particular sort of anim food the plenti not onli oblig him to sell cheaper but in consequ of these improv he can afford to sell cheaper for if he could not afford it the plenti would not be of long continu it ha been probabl in thi manner that the introduct of clover turnip carrot cabbag etc ha contribut to sink the common price of butcher meat in the london market somewhat below what it wa about the begin of the last centuri the hog that find hi food among ordur and greedili devour mani thing reject by everi other us anim is like poultri origin kept as a saveal as long as the number of such anim which can thu be rear at littl or no expens is fulli suffici to suppli the demand thi sort of butcher meat come to market at a much lower price than ani other but when the demand rise beyond what thi quantiti can suppli when it becom necessari to rais food on purpos for feed and fatten hog in the same manner as for feed and fatten other cattl the price necessarili rise and becom proportion either higher or lower than that of other butcher meat accord as the natur of the countri and the state of it agricultur happen to render the feed of hog more or less expens than that of other cattl in franc accord to mr buffon the price of pork is nearli equal to that of beef in most part of great britain it is at present somewhat higher the great rise in the price both of hog and poultri ha in great britain been frequent imput to the diminut of the number of cottag and other small occupi of land an event which ha in everi part of europ been the immedi forerunn of improv and better cultiv but which at the same time mai have contribut to rais the price of those articl both somewhat sooner and somewhat faster than it would otherwis have risen as the poorest famili can often maintain a cat or a dog without ani expens so the poorest occupi of land can commonli maintain a few poultri or a sow and a few pig at veri littl the littl offal of their own tabl their whei skim milk and butter milk suppli those anim with a part of their food and thei find the rest in the neighbour field without do ani sensibl damag to ani bodi by diminish the number of those small occupi therefor the quantiti of thi sort of provis which is thu produc at littl or no expens must certainli have been a good deal diminish and their price must consequ have been rais both sooner and faster than it would otherwis have risen sooner or later howev in the progress of improv it must at ani rate have risen to the utmost height to which it is capabl of rise or to the price which pai the labour and expens of cultiv the land which furnish them with food as well as these ar paid upon the greater part of other cultiv land the busi of the dairi like the feed of hog and poultri is origin carri on as a saveal the cattl necessarili kept upon the farm produc more milk than either the rear of their own young or the consumpt of the farmer famili requir and thei produc most at on particular season but of all the product of land milk is perhap the most perish in the warm season when it is most abund it will scarc keep fourandtwenti hour the farmer by make it into fresh butter store a small part of it for a week by make it into salt butter for a year and by make it into chees he store a much greater part of it for sever year part of all these is reserv for the us of hi own famili the rest goe to market in order to find the best price which is to be had and which can scarc be so low is to discourag him from send thither whatev is over and abov the us of hi own famili if it is veri low inde he will be like to manag hi dairi in a veri slovenli and dirti manner and will scarc perhap think it worth while to have a particular room or build on purpos for it but will suffer the busi to be carri on amidst the smoke filth and nasti of hi own kitchen as wa the case of almost all the farmer dairi in scotland thirti or forti year ago and as is the case of mani of them still the same caus which gradual rais the price of butcher meat the increas of the demand and in consequ of the improv of the countri the diminut of the quantiti which can be fed at littl or no expens rais in the same manner that of the produc of the dairi of which the price natur connect with that of butcher meat or with the expens of feed cattl the increas of price pai for more labour care and cleanli the dairi becom more worthi of the farmer attent and the qualiti of it produc gradual improv the price at last get so high that it becom worth while to emploi some of the most fertil and best cultiv land in feed cattl mere for the purpos of the dairi and when it ha got to thi height it cannot well go higher if it did more land would soon be turn to thi purpos it seem to have got to thi height through the greater part of england where much good land is commonli emploi in thi manner if you except the neighbourhood of a few consider town it seem not yet to have got to thi height anywher in scotland where common farmer seldom emploi much good land in rais food for cattl mere for the purpos of the dairi the price of the produc though it ha risen veri consider within these few year is probabl still too low to admit of it the inferior of the qualiti inde compar with that of the produc of english dairi is fulli equal to that of the price but thi inferior of qualiti is perhap rather the effect of thi low of price than the caus of it though the qualiti wa much better the greater part of what is brought to market could not i apprehend in the present circumst of the countri be dispos of at a much better price and the present price it is probabl would not pai the expens of the land and labour necessari for produc a much better qualiti through the greater part of england notwithstand the superior of price the dairi is not reckon a more profit employ of land than the rais of corn or the fatten of cattl the two great object of agricultur through the greater part of scotland therefor it cannot yet be even so profit the land of no countri it is evid can ever be complet cultiv and improv till onc the price of everi produc which human industri is oblig to rais upon them ha got so high as to pai for the expens of complet improv and cultiv in order to do thi the price of each particular produc must be suffici first to pai the rent of good corn land as it is that which regul the rent of the greater part of other cultiv land and secondli to pai the labour and expens of the farmer as well as thei ar commonli paid upon good corn land or in other word to replac with the ordinari profit the stock which he emploi about it thi rise in the price of each particular produc must evid be previou to the improv and cultiv of the land which is destin for rais it gain is the end of all improv and noth could deserv that name of which loss wa to be the necessari consequ but loss must be the necessari consequ of improv land for the sake of a produc of which the price could never bring back the expens if the complet improv and cultiv of the countri be as it most certainli is the greatest of all public advantag thi rise in the price of all those differ sort of rude produc instead of be consid as a public calam ought to be regard as the necessari forerunn and attend of the greatest of all public advantag thi rise too in the nomin or monei price of all those differ sort of rude produc ha been the effect not of ani degrad in the valu of silver but of a rise in their real price thei have becom worth not onli a greater quantiti of silver but a greater quantiti of labour and subsist than befor as it cost a greater quantiti of labour and subsist to bring them to market so when thei ar brought thither thei repres or ar equival to a greater quantiti third sortth third and last sort of rude produc of which the price natur rise in the progress of improv is that in which the efficaci of human industri in augment the quantiti is either limit or uncertain though the real price of thi sort of rude produc therefor natur tend to rise in the progress of improv yet accord as differ accid happen to render the effort of human industri more or less success in augment the quantiti it mai happen sometim even to fall sometim to continu the same in veri differ period of improv and sometim to rise more or less in the same period there ar some sort of rude produc which natur ha render a kind of appendag to other sort so that the quantiti of the on which ani countri can afford is necessarili limit by that of the other the quantiti of wool or of raw hide for exampl which ani countri can afford is necessarili limit by the number of great and small cattl that ar kept in it the state of it improv and the natur of it agricultur again necessarili determin thi number the same caus which in the progress of improv gradual rais the price of butcher meat should have the same effect it mai be thought upon the price of wool and raw hide and rais them too nearli in the same proport it probabl would be so if in the rude begin of improv the market for the latter commod wa confin within as narrow bound as that for the former but the extent of their respect market is commonli extrem differ the market for butcher meat is almost everywher confin to the countri which produc it ireland and some part of british america inde carri on a consider trade in salt provis but thei ar i believ the onli countri in the commerci world which do so or which export to other countri ani consider part of their butcher meat the market for wool and raw hide on the contrari is in the rude begin of improv veri seldom confin to the countri which produc them thei can easili be transport to distant countri wool without ani prepar and raw hide with veri littl and as thei ar the materi of mani manufactur the industri of other countri mai occas a demand for them though that of the countri which produc them might not occas ani in countri ill cultiv and therefor but thinli inhabit the price of the wool and the hide bear alwai a much greater proport to that of the whole beast than in countri where improv and popul be further advanc there is more demand for butcher meat mr hume observ that in the saxon time the fleec wa estim at twofifth of the valu of the whole sheep and that thi wa much abov the proport of it present estim in some provinc of spain i have been assur the sheep is frequent kill mere for the sake of the fleec and the tallow the carcas is often left to rot upon the ground or to be devour by beast and bird of prei if thi sometim happen even in spain it happen almost constantli in chili at bueno ayr and in mani other part of spanish america where the horn cattl ar almost constantli kill mere for the sake of the hide and the tallow thi too us to happen almost constantli in hispaniola while it wa infest by the buccan and befor the settlement improv and popul of the french plantat which now extend round the coast of almost the whole western half of the island had given some valu to the cattl of the spaniard who still continu to possess not onli the eastern part of the coast but the whole inland mountain part of the countri though in the progress of improv and popul the price of the whole beast necessarili rise yet the price of the carcas is like to be much more affect by thi rise than that of the wool and the hide the market for the carcas be in the rude state of societi confin alwai to the countri which produc it must necessarili be extend in proport to the improv and popul of that countri but the market for the wool and the hide even of a barbar countri often extend to the whole commerci world it can veri seldom be enlarg in the same proport the state of the whole commerci world can seldom be much affect by the improv of ani particular countri and the market for such commod mai remain the same or veri nearli the same after such improv as befor it should howev in the natur cours of thing rather upon the whole be somewhat extend in consequ of them if the manufactur especi of which those commod ar the materi should ever come to flourish in the countri the market though it might not be much enlarg would at least be brought much nearer to the place of growth than befor and the price of those materi might at least be increas by what had usual been the expens of transport them to distant countri though it might not rise therefor in the same proport as that of butcher meat it ought natur to rise somewhat and it ought certainli not to fall in england howev notwithstand the flourish state of it woollen manufactur the price of english wool ha fallen veri consider sinc the time of edward iii there ar mani authent record which demonstr that dure the reign of that princ toward the middl of the fourteenth centuri or about what wa reckon the moder and reason price of the tod or twentyeight pound of english wool wa not less than ten shill of the monei of those time see smith memoir of wool vol i c also vol ii contain at the rate of twentyp the ounc six ounc of silver tower weight equal to about thirti shill of our present monei in the present time oneandtwenti shill the tod mai be reckon a good price for veri good english wool the monei price of wool therefor in the time of edward iii wa to it monei price in the present time as ten to seven the superior of it real price wa still greater at the rate of six shill and eightpenc the quarter ten shill wa in those ancient time the price of twelv bushel of wheat at the rate of twentyeight shill the quarter oneandtwenti shill is in the present time the price of six bushel onli the proport between the real price of ancient and modern time therefor is as twelv to six or as two to on in those ancient time a tod of wool would have purchas twice the quantiti of subsist which it will purchas at present and consequ twice the quantiti of labour if the real recomp of labour had been the same in both period thi degrad both in the real and nomin valu of wool could never have happen in consequ of the natur cours of thing it ha accordingli been the effect of violenc and artific first of the absolut prohibit of export wool from england secondli of the permiss of import it from spain duti free thirdli of the prohibit of export it from ireland to anoth countri but england in consequ of these regul the market for english wool instead of be somewhat extend in consequ of the improv of england ha been confin to the home market where the wool of sever other countri is allow to come into competit with it and where that of ireland is forc into competit with it as the woollen manufactur too of ireland ar fulli as much discourag as is consist with justic and fair deal the irish can work up but a smaller part of their own wool at home and ar therefor oblig to send a greater proport of it to great britain the onli market thei ar allow i have not been abl to find ani such authent record concern the price of raw hide in ancient time wool wa commonli paid as a subsidi to the king and it valuat in that subsidi ascertain at least in some degre what wa it ordinari price but thi seem not to have been the case with raw hide fleetwood howev from an account in between the prior of burcest oxford and on of hi canon give us their price at least as it wa state upon that particular occas viz five ox hide at twelv shill five cow hide at seven shill and threepenc thirtysix sheep skin of two year old at nine shill sixteen calf skin at two shill in twelv shill contain about the same quantiti of silver as fourandtwenti shill of our present monei an ox hide therefor wa in thi account valu at the same quantiti of silver as s th of our present monei it nomin price wa a good deal lower than at present but at the rate of six shill and eightpenc the quarter twelv shill would in those time have purchas fourteen bushel and fourfifth of a bushel of wheat which at three and sixpenc the bushel would in the present time cost s d an ox hide therefor would in those time have purchas as much corn as ten shill and threepenc would purchas at present it real valu wa equal to ten shill and threepenc of our present monei in those ancient time when the cattl were half starv dure the greater part of the winter we cannot suppos that thei were of a veri larg size an ox hide which weigh four stone of sixteen pound of avoirdupoi is not in the present time reckon a bad on and in those ancient time would probabl have been reckon a veri good on but at halfacrown the stone which at thi moment februari i understand to be the common price such a hide would at present cost onli ten shill through it nomin price therefor is higher in the present than it wa in those ancient time it real price the real quantiti of subsist which it will purchas or command is rather somewhat lower the price of cow hide as state in the abov account is nearli in the common proport to that of ox hide that of sheep skin is a good deal abov it thei had probabl been sold with the wool that of calv skin on the contrari is greatli below it in countri where the price of cattl is veri low the calv which ar not intend to be rear in order to keep up the stock ar gener kill veri young as wa the case in scotland twenti or thirti year ago it save the milk which their price would not pai for their skin therefor ar commonli good for littl the price of raw hide is a good deal lower at present than it wa a few year ago ow probabl to the take off the duti upon seal skin and to the allow for a limit time the import of raw hide from ireland and from the plantat duti free which wa done in take the whole of the present centuri at an averag their real price ha probabl been somewhat higher than it wa in those ancient time the natur of the commod render it not quit so proper for be transport to distant market as wool it suffer more by keep a salt hide is reckon inferior to a fresh on and sell for a lower price thi circumst must necessarili have some tendenc to sink the price of raw hide produc in a countri which doe not manufactur them but is oblig to export them and compar to rais that of those produc in a countri which doe manufactur them it must have some tendenc to sink their price in a barbar and to rais it in an improv and manufactur countri it must have had some tendenc therefor to sink it in ancient and to rais it in modern time our tanner besid have not been quit so success as our clothier in convinc the wisdom of the nation that the safeti of the commonwealth depend upon the prosper of their particular manufactur thei have accordingli been much less favour the export of raw hide ha inde been prohibit and declar a nuisanc but their import from foreign countri ha been subject to a duti and though thi duti ha been taken off from those of ireland and the plantat for the limit time of five year onli yet ireland ha not been confin to the market of great britain for the sale of it surplu hide or of those which ar not manufactur at home the hide of common cattl have but within these few year been put among the enumer commod which the plantat can send nowher but to the mother countri neither ha the commerc of ireland been in thi case oppress hitherto in order to support the manufactur of great britain whatev regul tend to sink the price either of wool or of raw hide below what it natur would he must in an improv and cultiv countri have some tendenc to rais the price of butcher meat the price both of the great and small cattl which ar fed on improv and cultiv land must be suffici to pai the rent which the landlord and the profit which the farmer ha reason to expect from improv and cultiv land if it is not thei will soon ceas to feed them whatev part of thi price therefor is not paid by the wool and the hide must be paid by the carcas the less there is paid for the on the more must be paid for the other in what manner thi price is to be divid upon the differ part of the beast is indiffer to the landlord and farmer provid it is all paid to them in an improv and cultiv countri therefor their interest as landlord and farmer cannot be much affect by such regul though their interest as consum mai by the rise in the price of provis it would be quit otherwis howev in an unimprov and uncultiv countri where the greater part of the land could be appli to no other purpos but the feed of cattl and where the wool and the hide made the princip part of the valu of those cattl their interest as landlord and farmer would in thi case be veri deepli affect by such regul and their interest as consum veri littl the fall in the price of the wool and the hide would not in thi case rais the price of the carcas becaus the greater part of the land of the countri be applic to no other purpos but the feed of cattl the same number would still continu to be fed the same quantiti of butcher meat would still come to market the demand for it would be no greater than befor it price therefor would be the same as befor the whole price of cattl would fall and along with it both the rent and the profit of all those land of which cattl wa the princip produc that is of the greater part of the land of the countri the perpetu prohibit of the export of wool which is commonli but veri fals ascrib to edward iii would in the then circumst of the countri have been the most destruct regul which could well have been thought of it would not onli have reduc the actual valu of the greater part of the land in the kingdom but by reduc the price of the most import speci of small cattl it would have retard veri much it subsequ improv the wool of scotland fell veri consider in it price in consequ of the union with england by which it wa exclud from the great market of europ and confin to the narrow on of great britain the valu of the greater part of the land in the southern counti of scotland which ar chiefli a sheep countri would have been veri deepli affect by thi event had not the rise in the price of butcher meat fulli compens the fall in the price of wool as the efficaci of human industri in increas the quantiti either of wool or of raw hide is limit so far as it depend upon the produc of the countri where it is exert so it is uncertain so far as it depend upon the produc of other countri it so far depend not so much upon the quantiti which thei produc as upon that which thei do not manufactur and upon the restraint which thei mai or mai not think proper to impos upon the export of thi sort of rude produc these circumst as thei ar altogeth independ of domest industri so thei necessarili render the efficaci of it effort more or less uncertain in multipli thi sort of rude produc therefor the efficaci of human industri is not onli limit but uncertain in multipli anoth veri import sort of rude produc the quantiti of fish that is brought to market it is likewis both limit and uncertain it is limit by the local situat of the countri by the proxim or distanc of it differ provinc from the sea by the number of it lake and river and by what mai be call the fertil or barren of those sea lake and river as to thi sort of rude produc as popul increas as the annual produc of the land and labour of the countri grow greater and greater there come to be more buyer of fish and those buyer too have a greater quantiti and varieti of other good or what is the same thing the price of a greater quantiti and varieti of other good to bui with but it will gener be imposs to suppli the great and extend market without emploi a quantiti of labour greater than in proport to what had been requisit for suppli the narrow and confin on a market which from requir onli on thousand come to requir annual ten thousand ton of fish can seldom be suppli without emploi more than ten time the quantiti of labour which had befor been suffici to suppli it the fish must gener be sought for at a greater distanc larger vessel must be emploi and more expens machineri of everi kind made us of the real price of thi commod therefor natur rise in the progress of improv it ha accordingli done so i believ more or less in everi countri though the success of a particular dai fish mayb a veri uncertain matter yet the local situat of the countri be suppos the gener efficaci of industri in bring a certain quantiti of fish to market take the cours of a year or of sever year togeth it mai perhap be thought is certain enough and it no doubt is so as it depend more howev upon the local situat of the countri than upon the state of it wealth and industri as upon thi account it mai in differ countri be the same in veri differ period of improv and veri differ in the same period it connect with the state of improv is uncertain and it is of thi sort of uncertainti that i am here speak in increas the quantiti of the differ miner and metal which ar drawn from the bowel of the earth that of the more preciou on particularli the efficaci of human industri seem not to be limit but to be altogeth uncertain the quantiti of the preciou metal which is to be found in ani countri is not limit by ani thing in it local situat such as the fertil or barren of it own mine those metal frequent abound in countri which possess no mine their quantiti in everi particular countri seem to depend upon two differ circumst first upon it power of purchas upon the state of it industri upon the annual produc of it land and labour in consequ of which it can afford to emploi a greater or a smaller quantiti of labour and subsist in bring or purchas such superflu as gold and silver either from it own mine or from those of other countri and secondli upon the fertil or barren of the mine which mai happen at ani particular time to suppli the commerci world with those metal the quantiti of those metal in the countri most remot from the mine must be more or less affect by thi fertil or barren on account of the easi and cheap transport of those metal of their small bulk and great valu their quantiti in china and indostan must have been more or less affect by the abund of the mine of america so far as their quantiti in ani particular countri depend upon the former of those two circumst the power of purchas their real price like that of all other luxuri and superflu is like to rise with the wealth and improv of the countri and to fall with it poverti and depress countri which have a great quantiti of labour and subsist to spare can afford to purchas ani particular quantiti of those metal at the expens of a greater quantiti of labour and subsist than countri which have less to spare so far as their quantiti in ani particular countri depend upon the latter of those two circumst the fertil or barren of the mine which happen to suppli the commerci world their real price the real quantiti of labour and subsist which thei will purchas or exchang for will no doubt sink more or less in proport to the fertil and rise in proport to the barren of those mine the fertil or barren of the mine howev which mai happen at ani particular time to suppli the commerci world is a circumst which it is evid mai have no sort of connect with the state of industri in a particular countri it seem even to have no veri necessari connect with that of the world in gener as art and commerc inde gradual spread themselv over a greater and a greater part of the earth the search for new mine be extend over a wider surfac mai have somewhat a better chanc for be success than when confin within narrow bound the discoveri of new mine howev as the old on come to be gradual exhaust is a matter of the greatest uncertainti and such as no human skill or industri can insur all indic it is acknowledg ar doubt and the actual discoveri and success work of a new mine can alon ascertain the realiti of it valu or even of it exist in thi search there seem to be no certain limit either to the possibl success or to the possibl disappoint of human industri in the cours of a centuri or two it is possibl that new mine mai be discov more fertil than ani that have ever yet been known and it is just equal possibl that the most fertil mine then known mai be more barren than ani that wa wrought befor the discoveri of the mine of america whether the on or the other of those two event mai happen to take place is of veri littl import to the real wealth and prosper of the world to the real valu of the annual produc of the land and labour of mankind it nomin valu the quantiti of gold and silver by which thi annual produc could be express or repres would no doubt be veri differ but it real valu the real quantiti of labour which it could purchas or command would be precis the same a shill might in the on case repres no more labour than a penni doe at present and a penni in the other might repres as much as a shill doe now but in the on case he who had a shill in hi pocket would be no richer than he who ha a penni at present and in the other he who had a penni would be just as rich as he who ha a shill now the cheap and abund of gold and silver plate would be the sole advantag which the world could deriv from the on event and the dear and scarciti of those trifl superflu the onli inconveni it could suffer from the other conclus of the digress concern the variat in the valu of silver the greater part of the writer who have collect the monei price of thing in ancient time seem to have consid the low monei price of corn and of good in gener or in other word the high valu of gold and silver as a proof not onli of the scarciti of those metal but of the poverti and barbar of the countri at the time when it took place thi notion is connect with the system of polit economi which repres nation wealth as consist in the abund and nation poverti in the scarciti of gold and silver a system which i shall endeavour to explain and examin at great length in the fourth book of thi inquiri i shall onli observ at present that the high valu of the preciou metal can be no proof of the poverti or barbar of ani particular countri at the time when it took place it is a proof onli of the barren of the mine which happen at that time to suppli the commerci world a poor countri as it cannot afford to bui more so it can as littl afford to pai dearer for gold and silver than a rich on and the valu of those metal therefor is not like to be higher in the former than in the latter in china a countri much richer than ani part of europ the valu of the preciou metal is much higher than in ani part of europ as the wealth of europ inde ha increas greatli sinc the discoveri of the mine of america so the valu of gold and silver ha gradual diminish thi diminut of their valu howev ha not been ow to the increas of the real wealth of europ of the annual produc of it land and labour but to the accident discoveri of more abund mine than ani that were known befor the increas of the quantiti of gold and silver in europ and the increas of it manufactur and agricultur ar two event which though thei have happen nearli about the same time yet have arisen from veri differ caus and have scarc ani natur connect with on anoth the on ha arisen from a mere accid in which neither prudenc nor polici either had or could have ani share the other from the fall of the feudal system and from the establish of a govern which afford to industri the onli encourag which it requir some toler secur that it shall enjoi the fruit of it own labour poland where the feudal system still continu to take place is at thi dai as beggarli a countri as it wa befor the discoveri of america the monei price of corn howev ha risen the real valu of the preciou metal ha fallen in poland in the same manner as in other part of europ their quantiti therefor must have increas there as in other place and nearli in the same proport to the annual produc of it land and labour thi increas of the quantiti of those metal howev ha not it seem increas that annual produc ha neither improv the manufactur and agricultur of the countri nor mend the circumst of it inhabit spain and portug the countri which possess the mine ar after poland perhap the two most beggarli countri in europ the valu of the preciou metal howev must be lower in spain and portug than in ani other part of europ as thei come from those countri to all other part of europ load not onli with a freight and an insur but with the expens of smuggl their export be either prohibit or subject to a duti in proport to the annual produc of the land and labour therefor their quantiti must be greater in those countri than in ani other part of europ those countri howev ar poorer than the greater part of europ though the feudal system ha been abolish in spain and portug it ha not been succeed by a much better as the low valu of gold and silver therefor is no proof of the wealth and flourish state of the countri where it take place so neither is their high valu or the low monei price either of good in gener or of corn in particular ani proof of it poverti and barbar but though the low monei price either of good in gener or of corn in particular be no proof of the poverti or barbar of the time the low monei price of some particular sort of good such as cattl poultri game of all kind etc in proport to that of corn is a most decis on it clearli demonstr first their great abund in proport to that of corn and consequ the great extent of the land which thei occupi in proport to what wa occupi by corn and secondli the low valu of thi land in proport to that of corn land and consequ the uncultiv and unimprov state of the far greater part of the land of the countri it clearli demonstr that the stock and popul of the countri did not bear the same proport to the extent of it territori which thei commonli do in civil countri and that societi wa at that time and in that countri but in it infanc from the high or low monei price either of good in gener or of corn in particular we can infer onli that the mine which at that time happen to suppli the commerci world with gold and silver were fertil or barren not that the countri wa rich or poor but from the high or low monei price of some sort of good in proport to that of other we can infer with a degre of probabl that approach almost to certainti that it wa rich or poor that the greater part of it land were improv or unimprov and that it wa either in a more or less barbar state or in a more or less civil on ani rise in the monei price of good which proceed altogeth from the degrad of the valu of silver would affect all sort of good equal and rais their price univers a third or a fourth or a fifth part higher accord as silver happen to lose a third or a fourth or a fifth part of it former valu but the rise in the price of provis which ha been the subject of so much reason and convers doe not affect all sort of provis equal take the cours of the present centuri at an averag the price of corn it is acknowledg even by those who account for thi rise by the degrad of the valu of silver ha risen much less than that of some other sort of provis the rise in the price of those other sort of provis therefor cannot be ow altogeth to the degrad of the valu of silver some other caus must be taken into the account and those which have been abov assign will perhap without have recours to the suppos degrad of the valu of silver suffici explain thi rise in those particular sort of provis of which the price ha actual risen in proport to that of corn as to the price of corn itself it ha dure the sixtyfour first year of the present centuri and befor the late extraordinari cours of bad season been somewhat lower than it wa dure the sixtyfour last year of the preced centuri thi fact is attest not onli by the account of windsor market but by the public fiar of all the differ counti of scotland and by the account of sever differ market in franc which have been collect with great dilig and fidel by mr messanc and by mr dupr de st maur the evid is more complet than could well have been expect in a matter which is natur so veri difficult to be ascertain as to the high price of corn dure these last ten or twelv year it can be suffici account for from the bad of the season without suppos ani degrad in the valu of silver the opinion therefor that silver is continu sink in it valu seem not to be found upon ani good observ either upon the price of corn or upon those of other provis the same quantiti of silver it mai perhap be said will in the present time even accord to the account which ha been here given purchas a much smaller quantiti of sever sort of provis than it would have done dure some part of the last centuri and to ascertain whether thi chang be ow to a rise in the valu of those good or to a fall in the valu of silver is onli to establish a vain and useless distinct which can be of no sort of servic to the man who ha onli a certain quantiti of silver to go to market with or a certain fix revenu in monei i certainli do not pretend that the knowledg of thi distinct will enabl him to bui cheaper it mai not howev upon that account be altogeth useless it mai be of some us to the public by afford an easi proof of the prosper condit of the countri if the rise in the price of some sort of provis be ow altogeth to a fall in the valu of silver it is ow to a circumst from which noth can be infer but the fertil of the american mine the real wealth of the countri the annual produc of it land and labour mai notwithstand thi circumst be either gradual declin as in portug and poland or gradual advanc as in most other part of europ but if thi rise in the price of some sort of provis be ow to a rise in the real valu of the land which produc them to it increas fertil or in consequ of more extend improv and good cultiv to it have been render fit for produc corn it is ow to a circumst which indic in the clearest manner the prosper and advanc state of the countri the land constitut by far the greatest the most import and the most durabl part of the wealth of everi extens countri it mai sure be of some us or at least it mai give some satisfact to the public to have so decis a proof of the increas valu of by far the greatest the most import and the most durabl part of it wealth it mai too be of some us to the public in regul the pecuniari reward of some of it inferior servant if thi rise in the price of some sort of provis be ow to a fall in the valu of silver their pecuniari reward provid it wa not too larg befor ought certainli to be augment in proport to the extent of thi fall if it is not augment their real recomp will evid be so much diminish but if thi rise of price is ow to the increas valu in consequ of the improv fertil of the land which produc such provis it becom a much nicer matter to judg either in what proport ani pecuniari reward ought to be augment or whether it ought to be augment at all the extens of improv and cultiv as it necessarili rais more or less in proport to the price of corn that of everi sort of anim food so it as necessarili lower that of i believ everi sort of veget food it rais the price of anim food becaus a great part of the land which produc it be render fit for produc corn must afford to the landlord anti farmer the rent and profit of corn land it lower the price of veget food becaus by increas the fertil of the land it increas it abund the improv of agricultur too introduc mani sort of veget food which requir less land and not more labour than corn come much cheaper to market such ar potato and maiz or what is call indian corn the two most import improv which the agricultur of europ perhap which europ itself ha receiv from the great extens of it commerc and navig mani sort of veget food besid which in the rude state of agricultur ar confin to the kitchengarden and rais onli by the spade come in it improv state to be introduc into common field and to be rais by the plough such as turnip carrot cabbag etc if in the progress of improv therefor the real price of on speci of food necessarili rise that of anoth as necessarili fall and it becom a matter of more niceti to judg how far the rise in the on mai be compens by the fall in the other when the real price of butcher meat ha onc got to it height which with regard to everi sort except perhap that of hog flesh it seem to have done through a great part of england more than a centuri ago ani rise which can afterward happen in that of ani other sort of anim food cannot much affect the circumst of the inferior rank of peopl the circumst of the poor through a great part of england cannot sure be so much distress by ani rise in the price of poultri fish wildfowl or venison as thei must be reliev by the fall in that of potato in the present season of scarciti the high price of corn no doubt distress the poor but in time of moder plenti when corn is at it ordinari or averag price the natur rise in the price of ani other sort of rude produc cannot much affect them thei suffer more perhap by the artifici rise which ha been occas by tax in the price of some manufactur commod as of salt soap leather candl malt beer al etc effect of the progress of improv upon the real price of manufactur it is the natur effect of improv howev to diminish gradual the real price of almost all manufactur that of the manufactur workmanship diminish perhap in all of them without except in consequ of better machineri of greater dexter and of a more proper divis and distribut of work all of which ar the natur effect of improv a much smaller quantiti of labour becom requisit for execut ani particular piec of work and though in consequ of the flourish circumst of the societi the real price of labour should rise veri consider yet the great diminut of the quantiti will gener much more than compens the greatest rise which can happen in the price there ar inde a few manufactur in which the necessari rise in the real price of the rude materi will more than compens all the advantag which improv can introduc into the execut of the work in carpent and joiner work and in the coarser sort of cabinet work the necessari rise in the real price of barren timber in consequ of the improv of land will more than compens all the advantag which can be deriv from the best machineri the greatest dexter and the most proper divis and distribut of work but in all case in which the real price of the rude materi either doe not rise at all or doe not rise veri much that of the manufactur commod sink veri consider thi diminut of price ha in the cours of the present and preced centuri been most remark in those manufactur of which the materi ar the coarser metal a better movement of a watch than about the middl of the last centuri could have been bought for twenti pound mai now perhap be had for twenti shill in the work of cutler and locksmith in all the toi which ar made of the coarser metal and in all those good which ar commonli known by the name of birmingham and sheffield ware there ha been dure the same period a veri great reduct of price though not altogeth so great as in watchwork it ha howev been suffici to astonish the workmen of everi other part of europ who in mani case acknowledg that thei can produc no work of equal good for doubl or even for tripl the price there ar perhap no manufactur in which the divis of labour can be carri further or in which the machineri emploi admit of a greater varieti of improv than those of which the materi ar the coarser metal in the cloth manufactur there ha dure the same period been no such sensibl reduct of price the price of superfin cloth i have been assur on the contrari ha within these fiveandtwenti or thirti year risen somewhat in proport to it qualiti ow it wa said to a consider rise in the price of the materi which consist altogeth of spanish wool that of the yorkshir cloth which is made altogeth of english wool is said inde dure the cours of the present centuri to have fallen a good deal in proport to it qualiti qualiti howev is so veri disput a matter that i look upon all inform of thi kind as somewhat uncertain in the cloth manufactur the divis of labour is nearli the same now as it wa a centuri ago and the machineri emploi is not veri differ there mai howev have been some small improv in both which mai have occas some reduct of price but the reduct will appear much more sensibl and undeni if we compar the price of thi manufactur in the present time with what it wa in a much remot period toward the end of the fifteenth centuri when the labour wa probabl much less subdivid and the machineri emploi much more imperfect than it is at present in be the th of henri vii it wa enact that whosoev shall sell by retail a broad yard of the finest scarlet grain or of other grain cloth of the finest make abov sixteen shill shall forfeit forti shill for everi yard so sold sixteen shill therefor contain about the same quantiti of silver as fourandtwenti shill of our present monei wa at that time reckon not an unreason price for a yard of the finest cloth and as thi is a sumptuari law such cloth it is probabl had usual been sold somewhat dearer a guinea mai be reckon the highest price in the present time even though the qualiti of the cloth therefor should be suppos equal and that of the present time is most probabl much superior yet even upon thi supposit the monei price of the finest cloth appear to have been consider reduc sinc the end of the fifteenth centuri but it real price ha been much more reduc six shill and eightpenc wa then and long afterward reckon the averag price of a quarter of wheat sixteen shill therefor wa the price of two quarter and more than three bushel of wheat valu a quarter of wheat in the present time at eightandtwenti shill the real price of a yard of fine cloth must in those time have been equal to at least three pound six shill and sixpenc of our present monei the man who bought it must have part with the command of a quantiti of labour and subsist equal to what that sum would purchas in the present time the reduct in the real price of the coars manufactur though consider ha not been so great as in that of the fine in be the rd of edward iv it wa enact that no servant in husbandri nor common labour nor servant to ani artific inhabit out of a citi or burgh shall us or wear in their cloth ani cloth abov two shill the broad yard in the rd of edward iv two shill contain veri nearli the same quantiti of silver as four of our present monei but the yorkshir cloth which is now sold at four shill the yard is probabl much superior to ani that wa then made for the wear of the veri poorest order of common servant even the monei price of their cloth therefor mai in proport to the qualiti be somewhat cheaper in the present than it wa in those ancient time the real price is certainli a good deal cheaper tenpenc wa then reckon what is call the moder and reason price of a bushel of wheat two shill therefor wa the price of two bushel and near two peck of wheat which in the present time at three shill and sixpenc the bushel would be worth eight shill and ninep for a yard of thi cloth the poor servant must have part with the power of purchas a quantiti of subsist equal to what eight shill and ninep would purchas in the present time thi is a sumptuari law too restrain the luxuri and extravag of the poor their cloth therefor had commonli been much more expens the same order of peopl ar by the same law prohibit from wear hose of which the price should exce fourteenp the pair equal to about eightandtwenti penc of our present monei but fourteenp wa in those time the price of a bushel and near two peck of wheat which in the present time at three and sixpenc the bushel would cost five shill and threepenc we should in the present time consid thi as a veri high price for a pair of stock to a servant of the poorest and lowest order he must howev in those time have paid what wa realli equival to thi price for them in the time of edward iv the art of knit stock wa probabl not known in ani part of europ their hose were made of common cloth which mai have been on of the caus of their dear the first person that wore stock in england is said to have been queen elizabeth she receiv them as a present from the spanish ambassador both in the coars and in the fine woollen manufactur the machineri emploi wa much more imperfect in those ancient than it is in the present time it ha sinc receiv three veri capit improv besid probabl mani smaller on of which it mai be difficult to ascertain either the number or the import the three capit improv ar first the exchang of the rock and spindl for the spinningwheel which with the same quantiti of labour will perform more than doubl the quantiti of work secondli the us of sever veri ingeni machin which facilit and abridg in a still greater proport the wind of the worst and woollen yarn or the proper arrang of the warp and woof befor thei ar put into the loom an oper which previou to the invent of those machin must have been extrem tediou and troublesom thirdli the employ of the fullingmil for thicken the cloth instead of tread it in water neither wind nor water mill of ani kind were known in england so earli as the begin of the sixteenth centuri nor so far as i know in ani other part of europ north of the alp thei had been introduc into itali some time befor the consider of these circumst mai perhap in some measur explain to us why the real price both of the coars and of the fine manufactur wa so much higher in those ancient than it is in the present time it cost a greater quantiti of labour to bring the good to market when thei were brought thither therefor thei must have purchas or exchang for the price of a greater quantiti the coars manufactur probabl wa in those ancient time carri on in england in the same manner as it alwai ha been in countri where art and manufactur ar in their infanc it wa probabl a household manufactur in which everi differ part of the work wa occasion perform by all the differ member of almost everi privat famili but so as to be their work onli when thei had noth els to do and not to be the princip busi from which ani of them deriv the greater part of their subsist the work which is perform in thi manner it ha alreadi been observ come alwai much cheaper to market than that which is the princip or sole fund of the workman subsist the fine manufactur on the other hand wa not in those time carri on in england but in the rich and commerci countri of flander and it wa probabl conduct then in the same manner as now by peopl who deriv the whole or the princip part of their subsist from it it wa besid a foreign manufactur and must have paid some duti the ancient custom of tonnag and poundag at least to the king thi duti inde would not probabl be veri great it wa not then the polici of europ to restrain by high duti the import of foreign manufactur but rather to encourag it in order that merchant might be enabl to suppli at as easi a rate as possibl the great men with the conveni and luxuri which thei want and which the industri of their own countri could not afford them the consider of these circumst mai perhap in some measur explain to us why in those ancient time the real price of the coars manufactur wa in proport to that of the fine so much lower than in the present time conclus of the chapter i shall conclud thi veri long chapter with observ that everi improv in the circumst of the societi tend either directli or indirectli to rais the real rent of land to increas the real wealth of the landlord hi power of purchas the labour or the produc of the labour of other peopl the extens of improv and

the effect of the extend improv and cultiv and afterward the caus of their be still further extend the rise in the price of cattl for exampl tend too to rais the rent of land directli and in a still greater proport the real valu of the landlord share hi real command of the labour of other peopl not onli rise with the real valu of the produc but the proport of hi share to the whole produc rise with it that produc after the rise in it real price requir no more labour to collect it than befor a smaller proport of it will therefor be suffici to replac with the ordinari profit the stock which emploi that labour a greater proport of it must consequ belong to the landlord all those improv in the product power of labour which tend directli to reduc the rent price of manufactur tend indirectli to rais the real rent of land the landlord exchang that part of hi rude produc which is over and abov hi own consumpt or what come to the same thing the price of that part of it for manufactur produc whatev reduc the real price of the latter rais that of the former an equal quantiti of the former becom therebi equival to a greater quantiti of the latter and the landlord is enabl to purchas a greater quantiti of the conveni ornament or luxuri which he ha occas for everi increas in the real wealth of the societi everi increas in the quantiti of us labour emploi within it tend indirectli to rais the real rent of land a certain proport of thi labour natur goe to the land a greater number of men and cattl ar emploi in it cultiv the produc increas with the increas of the stock which is thu

price of manufactur from the decai of manufactur art and industri the declens of the real wealth of the societi all tend on the other hand to lower the real rent of land to reduc the real wealth of the landlord to diminish hi power of purchas either the labour or the produc of the labour of other peopl the whole annual produc of the land and labour of everi countri or what come to the same thing the whole price of that annual produc natur divid itself it ha alreadi been observ into three part the rent of land the wage of labour and the profit of stock and constitut a revenu to three differ

revenu from the greater part of it reserv onli so much for hi immedi consumpt as mai maintain him till thi revenu begin to come in hi whole stock therefor is distinguish into two part that part which he expect is to afford him thi revenu is call hi capit the other is that which suppli hi immedi consumpt and which consist either first in that portion of hi whole stock which wa origin reserv for thi

into the same three portion each of which ha a distinct function or offic the first is that portion which is reserv for immedi consumpt and of which the characterist is that it afford no revenu or profit it consist in the stock of food cloth household furnitur etc which have been purchas by their proper consum but which ar not yet entir consum the whole stock of mere dwellinghous too subsist at anyon time in the countri make a part of thi first portion the stock that is laid out in a hous if it is to be the dwellinghous of the proprietor ceas from that moment to serv in the function of a capit or to afford ani revenu to it owner a dwellinghous as such contribut noth to the revenu of it inhabit and though it is no doubt extrem us to him it is as hi cloth and household furnitur ar us to him which howev make a part of hi expens and not of hi revenu if it is to be let to a tenant for rent as the hous itself can produc noth the tenant must alwai pai the rent out of some other revenu which he deriv either from labour or stock or land though a hous therefor mai yield a revenu to it proprietor and therebi serv in the function of a capit to him it cannot yield ani to the public nor serv in the function of a capit to it and the revenu of the whole bodi of the peopl can never be in the smallest degre increas by it cloth and household furnitur in the same manner sometim yield a revenu and therebi serv in the function of a capit to particular person in countri where masquerad ar common it is a trade to let out masquerad dress for a night upholster frequent let furnitur by the month or by the year undertak let the furnitur of funer by the dai and by the week mani peopl let furnish hous and get a rent not onli for the us of the hous but for that of the furnitur the revenu howev which is deriv from such thing must alwai be ultim drawn from some other sourc of revenu of all part of the stock either of an individu or of a societi reserv for immedi consumpt what is laid out in hous is most slowli consum a stock of cloth mai last sever year a stock of furnitur half a centuri or a centuri but a stock of hous well built and properli taken care of mai last mani centuri though the period of their total consumpt howev is more distant thei ar still as realli a stock reserv for immedi consumpt as either cloth or household furnitur the second of the three portion into which the gener stock of the societi divid itself is the fix capit of which the characterist is that it afford a revenu or profit without circul or chang master it consist chiefli of the four follow articl first of all us machin and instrument of trade which facilit and abridg labour secondli of all those profit build which ar the mean of procur a revenu not onli to the proprietor who let them for a rent but to the person who possess them and pai that rent for them such as shop warehous workhous farmhous with all their necessari build stabl granari etc these ar veri differ from mere

a workman mai be consid in the same light as a machin or instrument of trade which facilit and abridg labour and which though it cost a certain expens repai that expens with a profit the third and last of the three portion into which the gener stock of the societi natur divid itself is the circul capit of which the characterist is that it afford a revenu onli by circul or chang master it is compos likewis of four part first of the monei by mean of which all the other three ar circul and distribut to their proper consum secondli of the stock of provis which ar in the possess of the butcher the grazier the farmer the cornmerch the brewer etc and from the sale of which thei expect to deriv a profit thirdli of the materi whether altogeth rude or more or less manufactur of cloth furnitur and build which ar not yet made up into ani of those three shape but which remain in the hand of the grower the manufactur the mercer and draper the timbermerch the carpent and joiner the brickmak etc fourthli and lastli of the work which is made up and complet but which is still in the hand of the merchant and manufactur and not yet dispos of or distribut to the proper consum such as the finish work which we frequent find readi made in the shop of the smith the cabinetmak the goldsmith the jewel the chinamerch etc the circul capit consist in thi manner of the provis materi and finish work of all kind that ar in the hand of their respect dealer and of the monei that is necessari for circul and distribut them to those who ar final to us or to consum them of these four part threeprovis materi and finish work ar either annual or in a longer or shorter period regularli withdrawn from it and place either in the fix capit or in the stock reserv for immedi consumpt everi fix capit is both origin deriv from and requir to be continu support by a circul capit all us machin and instrument of trade ar origin deriv from a circul capit which furnish the materi of which thei ar made and the mainten of the workmen who make them thei requir too a capit of the same kind to keep them in constant repair no fix capit can yield ani revenu but by mean of a circul capit the most us machin and instrument of trade will produc noth without the circul capit which afford the materi thei ar emploi upon and the mainten of the workmen who emploi them land howev improv will yield no revenu without a circul capit which maintain the labour who cultiv and collect it produc to maintain and augment the stock which mayb reserv for immedi consumpt is the sole end and purpos both of the fix and circul capit it is thi stock which feed cloth and lodg the peopl their rich or poverti depend upon the abund or spare suppli which those two capit can afford to the stock reserv for immedi consumpt so great a part of the circul capit be continu withdrawn from it in order to be place in the other two branch of the gener stock of the societi it must in it turn requir continu suppli without which it would soon ceas to exist these suppli ar princip drawn from three sourc the produc of land of mine and of fisheri these afford continu suppli of provis and materi of which part is afterward wrought up into finish work and by which ar replac the provis materi and finish work continu withdrawn from the circul capit from mine too is drawn what is necessari for maintain and augment that part of it which consist in monei for though in the ordinari cours of busi thi part is not like the other three necessarili withdrawn from it in order to be place in the other two branch of the gener stock of the societi it must howev like all other thing be wast and worn out at last and sometim too be either lost or sent abroad and must therefor requir continu though no doubt much smaller suppli land mine and fisheri requir all both a fix and circul capit to cultiv them and their produc replac with a profit not onli those capit but all the other in the societi thu the farmer annual replac to the manufactur the provis which he had consum and the materi which he had wrought up the year befor and the manufactur replac to the farmer the finish work which he had wast and worn out in the same time thi is the real exchang that is annual made between those two order of peopl though it seldom happen that the rude produc of the on and the manufactur produc of the other ar directli barter for on anoth becaus it seldom happen that the farmer sell hi corn and hi cattl hi flax and hi wool to the veri same person of whom he chuse to purchas the cloth furnitur and instrument of trade which he want he sell therefor hi rude produc for monei with which he can purchas wherev it is to be had the manufactur produc he ha occas for land even replac in part at least the capit with which fisheri and mine ar cultiv it is the produc of land which draw the fish from the water and it is the produc of the surfac of the earth which extract the miner from it bowel the produc of land mine and fisheri when their natur fertil is equal is in proport to the extent and proper applic of the capit emploi about them when the capit ar equal and equal well appli it is in proport to their natur fertil in all countri where there is a toler secur everi man of common understand will endeavour to emploi whatev stock he can command in procur either present enjoy or futur profit if it is emploi in procur present enjoy it is a stock reserv for immedi consumpt if it is emploi in procur futur profit it must procur thi profit either by stai with him or by go from him in the on case it is a fix in the other it is a circul capit a man must be perfectli crazi who where there is a toler secur doe not emploi all the stock which he command whether it be hi own or borrow of other peopl in some on or other of those three wai in those unfortun countri inde where men ar continu afraid of the violenc of their superior thei frequent buri or conceal a great part of their stock in order to have it alwai at hand to carri with them to some place of safeti in case of their be threaten with ani of those disast to which thei consid themselv at all time expos thi is said to be a common practic in turkei in indostan and i believ in most other govern of asia it seem to have been a common practic among our ancestor dure the violenc of the feudal govern treasuretrov wa in these time consid as no contempt part of the revenu of the greatest sovereign in europ it consist in such treasur as wa found conceal in the earth and to which no particular person could prove ani right thi wa regard in those time as so import an object that it wa alwai consid as belong to the sovereign and neither to the finder nor to the proprietor of the land unless the right to it had been convei to the latter by an express claus in hi charter it wa put upon the same foot with gold and silver mine which without a special claus in the charter were never suppos to be comprehend in the gener grant of the land though mine of lead copper tin and coal were as thing of smaller consequ chapter ii of monei consid as a particular branch of the gener stock of the societi or of the expens of maintain the nation capit it ha been shown in the first book that the price of the greater part of commod resolv itself into three part of which on pai the wage of the labour anoth the profit of the stock and a third the rent of the land which had been emploi in produc and bring them to market that there ar inde some commod of which the price is made up of two of those part onli the wage of labour and the profit of stock and a veri few in which it consist altogeth in on the wage of labour but that the price of everi commod necessarili resolv itself into some on or other or all of those three part everi part of it which goe neither to rent nor to wage be necessarili profit to some bodi sinc thi is the case it ha been observ with regard to everi particular commod taken separ it must be so with regard to all the commod which compos the whole annual produc of the land and labour of everi countri taken complexli the whole price or exchang valu of that annual produc must resolv itself into the same three part and be parcel out among the differ inhabit of the countri either as the wage of their labour the profit of their stock or the rent of their land but though the whole valu of the annual produc of the land and labour of everi countri is thu divid among and constitut a revenu to it differ inhabit yet as in the rent of a privat estat we distinguish between the gross rent and the neat rent so mai we likewis in the revenu of all the inhabit of a great countri the gross rent of a privat estat comprehend whatev is paid by the farmer the neat rent what remain free to the landlord after deduct the expens of manag of repair and all other necessari charg or what without hurt hi estat he can afford to place in hi stock reserv for immedi consumpt or to spend upon hi tabl equipag the ornament of hi hous and furnitur hi privat enjoy and amus hi real wealth is in proport not to hi gross but to hi neat rent the gross revenu of all the inhabit of a great countri comprehend the whole annual produc of their land and labour the neat revenu what remain free to them after deduct the expens of maintain first their fix and secondli their circul capit or what without encroach upon their capit thei can place in their stock reserv for immedi consumpt or spend upon their subsist conveni and amus their real wealth too is in proport not to their gross but to their neat revenu the whole expens of maintain the fix capit must evid be exclud from the neat revenu of the societi neither the materi necessari for support their us machin and instrument of trade their profit build etc nor the produc of the labour necessari for fashion those materi into the proper form can ever make ani part of it the price of that labour mai inde make a part of it as the workmen so emploi mai place the whole valu of their wage in their stock reserv for immedi consumpt but in other sort of labour both the price and the produc go to thi stock the price to that of the workmen the produc to that of other peopl whose subsist conveni and amus ar augment by the labour of those workmen the intent of the fix capit is to increas the product power of labour or to enabl the same number of labour to perform a much greater quantiti of work in a farm where all the necessari build fenc drain commun etc ar in the most perfect good order the same number of labour and labour cattl will rais a much greater produc than in on of equal extent and equal good ground but not furnish with equal conveni in manufactur the same number of hand assist with the best machineri will work up a much greater quantiti of good than with more imperfect instrument of trade the expens which is properli laid out upon a fix capit of ani kind is alwai repaid with great profit and increas the annual produc by a much greater valu than that of the support which such improv requir thi support howev still requir a certain portion of that produc a certain quantiti of materi and the labour of a certain number of workmen both of which might have been immedi emploi to augment the food cloth and lodg the subsist and conveni of the societi ar thu divert to anoth employ highli advantag inde but still differ from thi on it is upon thi account that all such improv in mechan as enabl the same number of workmen to perform an equal quantiti of work with cheaper and simpler machineri than had been usual befor ar alwai regard as advantag to everi societi a certain quantiti of materi and the labour of a certain number of workmen which had befor been emploi in support a more complex and expens machineri can afterward be appli to augment the quantiti of work which that or ani other machineri is us onli for perform the undertak of some great manufactori who emploi a thousand ayear in the mainten of hi machineri if he can reduc thi expens to five hundr will natur emploi the other five hundr in purchas an addit quantiti of materi to be wrought up by an addit number of workmen the quantiti of that work therefor which hi machineri wa us onli for perform will natur be augment and with it all the advantag and conveni which the societi can deriv from that work the expens of maintain the fix capit in a great countri mai veri properli be compar to that of repair in a privat estat the expens of repair mai frequent be necessari for support the produc of the estat and consequ both the gross and the neat rent of the landlord when by a more proper direct howev it can be diminish without occas ani diminut of produc the gross rent remain at least the same as befor and the neat rent is necessarili augment but though the whole expens of maintain the fix capit is thu necessarili exclud from the neat revenu of the societi it is not the same case with that of maintain the circul capit of the four part of which thi latter capit is compos monei provis materi and finish work the three last it ha alreadi been observ ar regularli withdrawn from it and place either in the fix capit of the societi or in their stock reserv for immedi consumpt whatev portion of those consum good is not emploi in maintain the former goe all to the latter and make a part of the neat revenu of the societi the mainten of those three part of the circul capit therefor withdraw no portion of the annual produc from the neat revenu of the societi besid what is necessari for maintain the fix capit the circul capit of a societi is in thi respect differ from that of an individu that of an individu is total exclud from make ani part of hi neat revenu which must consist altogeth in hi profit but though the circul capit of everi individu make a part of that of the societi to which he belong it is not upon that account total exclud from make a part likewis of their neat revenu though the whole good in a merchant shop must by no mean be place in hi own stock reserv for immedi consumpt thei mai in that of other peopl who from a revenu deriv from other fund mai regularli replac their valu to him togeth with it profit without occas ani diminut either of hi capit or of their monei therefor is the onli part of the circul capit of a societi of which the mainten can occas ani diminut in their neat revenu the fix capit and that part of the circul capit which consist in monei so far as thei affect the revenu of the societi bear a veri great resembl to on anoth first as those machin and instrument of trade etc requir a certain expens first to erect them and afterward to support them both which expens though thei make a part of the gross ar deduct from the neat revenu of the societi so the stock of monei which circul in ani countri must requir a certain expens first to collect it and afterward to support it both which expens though thei make a part of the gross ar in the same manner deduct from the neat revenu of the societi a certain quantiti of veri valuabl materi gold and silver and of veri curiou labour instead of augment the stock reserv for immedi consumpt the subsist conveni and amus of individu is emploi in support that great but expens instrument of commerc by mean of which everi individu in the societi ha hi subsist conveni and amus regularli distribut to him in their proper proport secondli as the machin and instrument of trade etc which compos the fix capit either of an individu or of a societi make no part either of the gross or of the neat revenu of either so monei by mean of which the whole revenu of the societi is regularli distribut among all it differ member make itself no part of that revenu the great wheel of circul is altogeth differ from the good which ar circul by mean of it the revenu of the societi consist altogeth in those good and not in the wheel which circul them in comput either the gross or the neat revenu of ani societi we must alwai from the whole annual circul of monei and good deduct the whole valu of the monei of which not a singl farth can ever make ani part of either it is the ambigu of languag onli which can make thi proposit appear either doubt or paradox when properli explain and understood it is almost selfevid when we talk of ani particular sum of monei we sometim mean noth but the metal piec of which it is compos and sometim we includ in our mean some obscur refer to the good which can be had in exchang for it or to the power of purchas which the possess of it convei thu when we sai that the circul monei of england ha been comput at eighteen million we mean onli to express the amount of the metal piec which some writer have comput or rather have suppos to circul in that countri but when we sai that a man is worth fifti or a hundr pound ayear we mean commonli to express not onli the amount of the metal piec which ar annual paid to him but the valu of the good which he can annual purchas or consum we mean commonli to ascertain what is or ought to be hi wai of live or the quantiti and qualiti of the necessari and conveni of life in which he can with proprieti indulg himself when by ani particular sum of monei we mean not onli to express the amount of the metal piec of which it is compos but to includ in it signif some obscur refer to the good which can be had in exchang for them the wealth or revenu which it in thi case denot is equal onli to on of the two valu which ar thu intim somewhat ambigu by the same word and to the latter more properli than to the former to the monei worth more properli than to the monei thu if a guinea be the weekli pension of a particular person he can in the cours of the week purchas with it a certain quantiti of subsist conveni and amus in proport as thi quantiti is great or small so ar hi real rich hi real weekli revenu hi weekli revenu is certainli not equal both to the guinea and to what can be purchas with it but onli to on or other of those two equal valu and to the latter more properli than to the former to the guinea worth rather than to the guinea if the pension of such a person wa paid to him not in gold but in a weekli bill for a guinea hi revenu sure would not so properli consist in the piec of paper as in what he could get for it a guinea mai be consid as a bill for a certain quantiti of necessari and conveni upon all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood the revenu of the person to whom it is paid doe not so properli consist in the piec of gold as in what he can get for it or in what he can exchang it for if it could be exchang for noth it would like a bill upon a bankrupt be of no more valu than the most useless piec of paper though the weekli or yearli revenu of all the differ inhabit of ani countri in the same manner mai be and in realiti frequent is paid to them in monei their real rich howev the real weekli or yearli revenu of all of them taken togeth must alwai be great or small in proport to the quantiti of consum good which thei can all of them purchas with thi monei the whole revenu of all of them taken togeth is evid not equal to both the monei and the consum good but onli to on or other of those two valu and to the latter more properli than to the former though we frequent therefor express a person revenu by the metal piec which ar annual paid to him it is becaus the amount of those piec regul the extent of hi power of purchas or the valu of the good which he can annual afford to consum we still consid hi revenu as consist in thi power of purchas or consum and not in the piec which convei it but if thi is suffici evid even with regard to an individu it is still more so with regard to a societi the amount of the metal piec which ar annual paid to an individu is often precis equal to hi revenu and is upon that account the shortest and best express of it valu but the amount of the metal piec which circul in a societi can never be equal to the revenu of all it member as the same guinea which pai the weekli pension of on man todai mai pai that of anoth tomorrow and that of a third the dai thereaft the amount of the metal piec which annual circul in ani countri must alwai be of much less valu than the whole monei pension annual paid with them but the power of purchas or the good which can success be bought with the whole of those monei pension as thei ar success paid must alwai be precis of the same valu with those pension as must likewis be the revenu of the differ person to whom thei ar paid that revenu therefor cannot consist in those metal piec of which the amount is so much inferior to it valu but in the power of purchas in the good which can success be bought with them as thei circul from hand to hand monei therefor the great wheel of circul the great instrument of commerc like all other instrument of trade though it make a part and a veri valuabl part of the capit make no part of the revenu of the societi to which it belong and though the metal piec of which it is compos in the cours of their annual circul distribut to everi man the revenu which properli belong to him thei make themselv no part of that revenu thirdli and lastli the machin and instrument of trade etc which compos the fix capit bear thi further resembl to that part of the circul capit which consist in monei that as everi save in the expens of erect and support those machin which doe not diminish the introduct power of labour is an improv of the neat revenu of the societi so everi save in the expens of collect and support that part of the circul capit which consist in monei is an improv of exactli the same kind it is suffici obviou and it ha partli too been explain alreadi in what manner everi save in the expens of support the fix capit is an improv of the neat revenu of the societi the whole capit of the undertak of everi work is necessarili divid between hi fix and hi circul capit while hi whole capit remain the same the smaller the on part the greater must necessarili be the other it is the circul capit which furnish the materi and wage of labour and put industri into motion everi save therefor in the expens of maintain the fix capit which doe not diminish the product power of labour must increas the fund which put industri into motion and consequ the annual produc of land and labour the real revenu of everi societi the substitut of paper in the room of gold and silver monei replac a veri expens instrument of commerc with on much less costli and sometim equal conveni circul come to be carri on by a new wheel which it cost less both to erect and to maintain than the old on but in what manner thi oper is perform and in what manner it tend to increas either the gross or the neat revenu of the societi is not altogeth so obviou and mai therefor requir some further explic there ar sever differ sort of paper monei but the circul note of bank and banker ar the speci which is best known and which seem best adapt for thi purpos when the peopl of ani particular countri have such confid in the fortun probiti and prudenc of a particular banker as to believ that he is alwai readi to pai upon demand such of hi promissori note as ar like to be at ani time present to him those note come to have the same currenc as gold and silver monei from the confid that such monei can at ani time be had for them a particular banker lend among hi custom hi own promissori note to the extent we shall suppos of a hundr thousand pound as those note serv all the purpos of monei hi debtor pai him the same interest as if he had lent them so much monei thi interest is the sourc of hi gain though some of those note ar continu come back upon him for payment part of them continu to circul for month and year togeth though he ha gener in circul therefor note to the extent of a hundr thousand pound twenti thousand pound in gold and silver mai frequent be a suffici provis for answer occasion demand by thi oper therefor twenti thousand pound in gold and silver perform all the function which a hundr thousand could otherwis have perform the same exchang mai be made the same quantiti of consum good mai be circul and distribut to their proper consum by mean of hi promissori note to the valu of a hundr thousand pound as by an equal valu of gold and silver monei eighti thousand pound of gold and silver therefor can in thi manner be spare from the circul of the countri and if differ oper of the the same kind should at the same time be carri on by mani differ bank and banker the whole circul mai thu be conduct with a fifth part onli of the gold and silver which would otherwis have been requisit let us suppos for exampl that the whole circul monei of some particular countri amount at a particular time to on million sterl that sum be then suffici for circul the whole annual produc of their land and labour let us suppos too that some time thereaft differ bank and banker issu promissori note payabl to the bearer to the extent of on million reserv in their differ coffer two hundr thousand pound for answer occasion demand there would remain therefor in circul eight hundr thousand pound in gold and silver and a million of bank note or eighteen hundr thousand pound of paper and monei togeth but the annual produc of the land and labour of the countri had befor requir onli on million to circul and distribut it to it proper consum and that annual produc cannot be immedi augment by those oper of bank on million therefor will be suffici to circul it after them the good to be bought and sold be precis the same as befor the same quantiti of monei will be suffici for bui and sell them the channel of circul if i mai be allow such an express will remain precis the same as befor on million we have suppos suffici to fill that channel whatev therefor is pour into it beyond thi sum cannot run into it but must overflow on million eight hundr thousand pound ar pour into it eight hundr thousand pound therefor must overflow that sum be over and abov what can be emploi in the circul of the countri but though thi sum cannot be emploi at home it is too valuabl to be allow to lie idl it will therefor be sent abroad in order to seek that profit employ which it cannot find at home but the paper cannot go abroad becaus at a distanc from the bank which issu it and from the countri in which payment of it can be exact by law it will not be receiv in common payment gold and silver therefor to the amount of eight hundr thousand pound will be sent abroad and the channel of home circul will remain fill with a million of paper instead of a million of those metal which fill it befor but though so great a quantiti of gold and silver is thu sent abroad we must not imagin that it is sent abroad for noth or that it proprietor make a present of it to foreign nation thei will exchang it for foreign good of some kind or anoth in order to suppli the consumpt either of some other foreign countri or of their own if thei emploi it in purchas good in on foreign countri in order to suppli the consumpt of anoth or in what is call the carri trade whatev profit thei make will be in addit to the neat revenu of their own countri it is like a new fund creat for carri on a new trade domest busi be now transact by paper and the gold and silver be convert into a fund for thi new trade if thei emploi it in purchas foreign good for home consumpt thei mai either first purchas such good as ar like to be consum by idl peopl who produc noth such as foreign wine foreign silk etc or secondli thei mai purchas an addit stock of materi tool and provis in order to maintain and emploi an addit number of industri peopl who reproduc with a profit the valu of their annual consumpt so far as it is emploi in the first wai it promot prodig increas expens and consumpt without increas product or establish ani perman fund for support that expens and is in everi respect hurt to the societi so far as it is emploi in the second wai it promot industri and though it increas the consumpt of the societi it provid a perman fund for support that consumpt the peopl who consum reproduc with a profit the whole valu of their annual consumpt the gross revenu of the societi the annual produc of their land and labour is increas by the whole valu which the labour of those workmen add to the materi upon which thei ar emploi and their neat revenu by what remain of thi valu after deduct what is necessari for support the tool and instrument of their trade that the greater part of the gold and silver which be forc abroad by those oper of bank is emploi in purchas foreign good for home consumpt is and must be emploi in purchas those of thi second kind seem not onli probabl but almost unavoid though some particular men mai sometim increas their expens veri consider though their revenu doe not increas at all we mayb assur that no class or order of men ever doe so becaus though the principl of common prudenc do not alwai govern the conduct of everi individu thei alwai influenc that of the major of everi class or order but the revenu of idl peopl consid as a class or order cannot in the smallest degre be increas by those oper of bank their expens in gener therefor cannot be much increas by them though that of a few individu among them mai and in realiti sometim is the demand of idl peopl therefor for foreign good be the same or veri nearli the same as befor a veri small part of the monei which be forc abroad by those oper of bank is emploi in purchas foreign good for home consumpt is like to be emploi in purchas those for their us the greater part of it will natur be destin for the employ of industri and not for the mainten of idl when we comput the quantiti of industri which the circul capit of ani societi can emploi we must alwai have regard to those part of it onli which consist in provis materi and finish work the other which consist in monei and which serv onli to circul those three must alwai be deduct in order to put industri into motion three thing ar requisit materi to work upon tool to work with and the wage or recomp for the sake of which the work is done monei is neither a materi to work upon nor a tool to work with and though the wage of the workman ar commonli paid to him in monei hi real revenu like that of all other men consist not in the monei but in the monei worth not in the metal piec but in what can be got for them the quantiti of industri which ani capit can emploi must evid be equal to the number of workmen whom it can suppli with materi tool and a mainten suitabl to the natur of the work monei mai be requisit for purchas the materi and tool of the work as well as the mainten of the workmen but the quantiti of industri which the whole capit can emploi is certainli not equal both to the monei which purchas and to the materi tool and mainten which ar purchas with it but onli to on or other of those two valu and to the latter more properli than to the former when paper is substitut in the room of gold and silver monei the quantiti of the materi tool and mainten which the whole circul capit can suppli mai be increas by the whole valu of gold and silver which us to be emploi in purchas them the whole valu of the great wheel of circul and distribut is ad to the good which ar circul and distribut by mean of it the oper in some measur resembl that of the undertak of some great work who in consequ of some improv in mechan take down hi old machineri and add the differ between it price and that of the new to hi circul capit to the fund from which he furnish materi and wage to hi workmen what is the proport which the circul monei of ani countri bear to the whole valu of the annual produc circul by mean of it it is perhap imposs to determin it ha been comput by differ author at a fifth at a tenth at a twentieth and at a thirtieth part of that valu but how small soever the proport which the circul monei mai bear to the whole valu of the annual produc as but a part and frequent but a small part of that produc is ever destin for the mainten of industri it must alwai bear a veri consider proport to that part when therefor by the substitut of paper the gold and silver necessari for circul is reduc to perhap a fifth part of the former quantiti if the valu of onli the greater part of the other fourfifth be ad to the fund which ar destin for the mainten of industri it must make a veri consider addit to the quantiti of that industri and consequ to the valu of the annual produc of land and labour an oper of thi kind ha within these fiveandtwenti or thirti year been perform in scotland by the erect of new bank compani in almost everi consider town and even in some countri villag the effect of it have been precis those abov describ the busi of the countri is almost entir carri on by mean of the paper of those differ bank compani with which purchas and payment of all kind ar commonli made silver veri seldom appear except in the chang of a twenti shill bank note and gold still seldom but though the conduct of all those differ compani ha not been unexception and ha accordingli requir an act of parliament to regul it the countri notwithstand ha evid deriv great benefit from their trade i have heard it assert that the trade of the citi of glasgow doubl in about fifteen year after the first erect of the bank there and that the trade of scotland ha more than quadrupl sinc the first erect of the two public bank at edinburgh of which the on call the bank of scotland wa establish by act of parliament in and the other call the royal bank by royal charter in whether the trade either of scotland in gener or of the citi of glasgow in particular ha realli increas in so great a proport dure so short a period i do not pretend to know if either of them ha increas in thi proport it seem to be an effect too great to be account for by the sole oper of thi caus that the trade and industri of scotland howev have increas veri consider dure thi period and that the bank have contribut a good deal to thi increas cannot be doubt the valu of the silver monei which circul in scotland befor the union in and which immedi after it wa brought into the bank of scotland in order to be recoin amount to sterl no account ha been got of the gold coin but it appear from the ancient account of the mint of scotland that the valu of the gold annual coin somewhat exceed that of the silver there were a good mani peopl too upon thi occas who from a diffid of repay did not bring their silver into the bank of scotland and there wa besid some english coin which wa not call in the whole valu of the gold and silver therefor which circul in scotland befor the union cannot be estim at less than a million sterl it seem to have constitut almost the whole circul of that countri for though the circul of the bank of scotland which had then no rival wa consider it seem to have made but a veri small part of the whole in the present time the whole circul of scotland cannot be estim at less than two million of which that part which consist in gold and silver most probabl doe not amount to half a million but though the circul gold and silver of scotland have suffer so great a diminut dure thi period it real rich and prosper do not appear to have suffer ani it agricultur manufactur and trade on the contrari the annual produc of it land and labour have evid been augment it is chiefli by discount bill of exchang that is by advanc monei upon them befor thei ar due that the greater part of bank and banker issu their promissori note thei deduct alwai upon whatev sum thei advanc the legal interest till the bill shall becom due the payment of the bill when it becom due replac to the bank the valu of what had been advanc togeth with a clear profit of the interest the banker who advanc to the merchant whose bill he discount not gold and silver but hi own promissori note ha the advantag of be abl to discount to a greater amount by the whole valu of hi promissori note which he find by experi ar commonli in circul he is therebi enabl to make hi clear gain of interest on so much a larger sum the commerc of scotland which at present is not veri great wa still more inconsider when the two first bank compani were establish and those compani would have had but littl trade had thei confin their busi to the discount of bill of exchang thei invent therefor anoth method of issu their promissori note by grant what thei call cash account that is by give credit to the extent of a certain sum two or three thousand pound for exampl to ani individu who could procur two person of undoubt credit and good land estat to becom sureti for him that whatev monei should be advanc to him within the sum for which the credit had been given should be repaid upon demand togeth with the legal interest credit of thi kind ar i believ commonli grant by bank and banker in all differ part of the world but the easi term upon which the scotch bank compani accept of repay ar so far as i know peculiar to them and have perhap been the princip caus both of the great trade of those compani and of the benefit which the countri ha receiv from it whoever ha a credit of thi kind with on of those compani and borrow a thousand pound upon it for exampl mai repai thi sum piecem by twenti and thirti pound at a time the compani discount a proportion part of the interest of the great sum from the dai on which each of those small sum is paid in till the whole be in thi manner repaid all merchant therefor and almost all men of busi find it conveni to keep such cash account with them and ar therebi interest to promot the trade of those compani by readili receiv their note in all payment and by encourag all those with whom thei have ani influenc to do the same the bank when their custom appli to them for monei gener advanc it to them in their own promissori note these the merchant pai awai to the manufactur for good the manufactur to the farmer for materi and provis the farmer to their landlord for rent the landlord repai them to the merchant for the conveni and luxuri with which thei suppli them and the merchant again return them to the bank in order to balanc their cash account or to replac what thei my have borrow of them and thu almost the whole monei busi of the countri is transact by mean of them henc the great trade of those compani by mean of those cash account everi merchant can without imprud carri on a greater trade than he otherwis could do if there ar two merchant on in london and the other in edinburgh who emploi equal stock in the same branch of trade the edinburgh merchant can without imprud carri on a greater trade and give employ to a greater number of peopl than the london merchant the london merchant must alwai keep by him a consider sum of monei either in hi own coffer or in those of hi banker who give him no interest for it in order to answer the demand continu come upon him for payment of the good which he purchas upon credit let the ordinari amount of thi sum be suppos five hundr pound the valu of the good in hi warehous must alwai be less by five hundr pound than it would have been had he not been oblig to keep such a sum unemploi let us suppos that he gener dispos of hi whole stock upon hand or of good to the valu of hi whole stock upon hand onc in the year by be oblig to keep so great a sum unemploi he must sell in a year five hundr pound worth less good than he might otherwis have done hi annual profit must be less by all that he could have made by the sale of five hundr pound worth more good and the number of peopl emploi in prepar hi good for the market must be less by all those that five hundr pound more stock could have emploi the merchant in edinburgh on the other hand keep no monei unemploi for answer such occasion demand when thei actual come upon him he satisfi them from hi cash account with the bank and gradual replac the sum borrow with the monei or paper which come in from the occasion sale of hi good with the same stock therefor he can without imprud have at all time in hi warehous a larger quantiti of good than the london merchant and can therebi both make a greater profit himself and give constant employ to a greater number of industri peopl who prepar those good for the market henc the great benefit which the countri ha deriv from thi trade the facil of discount bill of exchang it mai be thought inde give the english merchant a conveni equival to the cash account of the scotch merchant but the scotch merchant it must be rememb can discount their bill of exchang as easili as the english merchant and have besid the addit conveni of their cash account the whole paper monei of everi kind which can easili circul in ani countri never can exce the valu of the gold and silver of which it suppli the place or which the commerc be suppos the same would circul there if there wa no paper monei if twenti shill note for exampl ar the lowest paper monei current in scotland the whole of that currenc which can easili circul there cannot exce the sum of gold and silver which would be necessari for transact the annual exchang of twenti shill valu and upward usual transact within that countri should the circul paper at ani time exce that sum as the excess could neither be sent abroad nor be emploi in the circul of the countri it must immedi return upon the bank to be exchang for gold and silver mani peopl would immedi perceiv that thei had more of thi paper than wa necessari for transact their busi at home and as thei could not send it abroad thei would immedi demand payment for it from the bank when thi superflu paper wa convert into gold and silver thei could easili find a us for it by send it abroad but thei could find none while it remain in the shape of paper there would immedi therefor be a run upon the bank to the whole extent of thi superflu paper and if thei show ani difficulti or backward in payment to a much greater extent the alarm which thi would occas necessarili increas the run over and abov the expens which ar common to everi branch of trade such as the expens of houser the wage of servant clerk account etc the expens peculiar to a bank consist chiefli in two articl first in the expens of keep at all time in it coffer for answer the occasion demand of the holder of it note a larg sum of monei of which it lose the interest and secondli in the expens of replenish those coffer as fast as thei ar empti by answer such occasion demand a bank compani which issu more paper than can be emploi in the circul of the countri and of which the excess is continu return upon them for payment ought to increas the quantiti of gold and silver which thei keep at all time in their coffer not onli in proport to thi excess increas of their circul but in a much greater proport their note return upon them much faster than in proport to the excess of their quantiti such a compani therefor ought to increas the first articl of their expens not onli in proport to thi forc increas of their busi but in a much greater proport the coffer of such a compani too though thei ought to be fill much fuller yet must empti themselv much faster than if their busi wa confin within more reason bound and must requir not onli a more violent but a more constant and uninterrupt exert of expens in order to replenish them the coin too which is thu continu drawn in such larg quantiti from their coffer cannot be emploi in the circul of the countri it come in place of a paper which is over and abov what can be emploi in that circul and is therefor over and abov what can be emploi in it too but as that coin will not be allow to lie idl it must in on shape or anoth be sent abroad in order to find that profit employ which it cannot find at home and thi continu export of gold and silver by enhanc the difficulti must necessarili enhanc still farther the expens of the bank in find new gold and silver in order to replenish those coffer which empti themselv so veri rapidli such a compani therefor must in proport to thi forc increas of their busi increas the second articl of their expens still more than the first let us suppos that all the paper of a particular bank which the circul of the countri can easili absorb and emploi amount exactli to forti thousand pound and that for answer occasion demand thi bank is oblig to keep at all time in it coffer ten thousand pound in gold and silver should thi bank attempt to circul fortyfour thousand pound the four thousand pound which ar over and abov what the circul can easili absorb and emploi will return upon it almost as fast as thei ar issu for answer occasion demand therefor thi bank ought to keep at all time in it coffer not eleven thousand pound onli but fourteen thousand pound it will thu gain noth by the interest of the four thousand pound excess circul and it will lose the whole expens of continu collect four thousand pound in gold and silver which will be continu go out of it coffer as fast as thei ar brought into them had everi particular bank compani alwai understood and attend to it own particular interest the circul never could have been overstock with paper monei but everi particular bank compani ha not alwai understood or attend to it own particular interest and the circul ha frequent been overstock with paper monei by issu too great a quantiti of paper of which the excess wa continu return in order to be exchang for gold and silver the bank of england wa for mani year togeth oblig to coin gold to the extent of between eight hundr thousand pound and a million ayear or at an averag about eight hundr and fifti thousand pound for thi great coinag the bank inconsequ of the worn and degrad state into which the gold coin had fallen a few year ago wa frequent oblig to purchas gold bullion at the high price of four pound an ounc which it soon after issu in coin at an ounc lose in thi manner between two and a half and three per cent upon the coinag of so veri larg a sum though the bank therefor paid no seignorag though the govern wa properli at the expens of thi coinag thi liber of govern did not prevent altogeth the expens of the bank the scotch bank in consequ of an excess of the same kind were all oblig to emploi constantli agent at london to collect monei for them at an expens which wa seldom below on and a half or two per cent thi monei wa sent down by the waggon and insur by the carrier at an addit expens of three quarter per cent or fifteen shill on the hundr pound those agent were not alwai abl to replenish the coffer of their employ so fast as thei were empti in thi case the resourc of the bank wa to draw upon their correspond in london bill of exchang to the extent of the sum which thei want when those correspond afterward drew upon them for the payment of thi sum togeth with the interest and commiss some of those bank from the distress into which their excess circul had thrown them had sometim no other mean of satisfi thi draught but by draw a second set of bill either upon the same or upon some other correspond in london and the same sum or rather bill for the same sum would in thi manner make sometim more than two or three journei the debtor bank pai alwai the interest and commiss upon the whole accumul sum even those scotch bank which never distinguish themselv by their extrem imprud were sometim oblig to emploi thi ruinou resourc the gold coin which wa paid out either by the bank of england or by the scotch bank in exchang for that part of their paper which wa over and abov what could be emploi in the circul of the countri be likewis over and abov what could be emploi in that circul wa sometim sent abroad in the shape of coin sometim melt down and sent abroad in the shape of bullion and sometim melt down and sold to the bank of england at the high price of four pound an ounc it wa the newest the heaviest and the best piec onli which were carefulli pick out of the whole coin and either sent abroad or melt down at home and while thei remain in the shape of coin those heavi piec were of no more valu than the light but thei were of more valu abroad or when melt down into bullion at home the bank of england notwithstand their great annual coinag found to their astonish that there wa everi year the same scarciti of coin as there had been the year befor and that notwithstand the great quantiti of good and new coin which wa everi year issu from the bank the state of the coin instead of grow better and better becam everi year wors and wors everi year thei found themselv under the necess of coin nearli the same quantiti of gold as thei had coin the year befor and from the continu rise in the price of gold bullion in consequ of the continu wear and clip of the coin the expens of thi great annual coinag becam everi year greater and greater the bank of england it is to be observ by suppli it own coffer with coin is indirectli oblig to suppli the whole kingdom into which coin is continu flow from those coffer in a great varieti of wai whatev coin therefor wa want to support thi excess circul both of scotch and english paper monei whatev vacuiti thi excess circul occas in the necessari coin of the kingdom the bank of england wa oblig to suppli them the scotch bank no doubt paid all of them veri dearli for their own imprud and inattent but the bank of england paid veri dearli not onli for it own imprud but for the much greater imprud of almost all the scotch bank the overtrad of some bold projector in both part of the unit kingdom wa the origin caus of thi excess circul of paper monei what a bank can with proprieti advanc to a merchant or undertak of ani kind is not either the whole capit with which he trade or even ani consider part of that capit but that part of it onli which he would otherwis be oblig to keep by him unemploi and in readi monei for answer occasion demand if the paper monei which the bank advanc never exce thi valu it can never exce the valu of the gold and silver which would necessarili circul in the countri if there wa no paper monei it can never exce the quantiti which the circul of the countri can easili absorb and emploi when a bank discount to a merchant a real bill of exchang drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor and which as soon as it becom due is realli paid by that debtor it onli advanc to him a part of the valu which he would otherwis be oblig to keep by him unemploi and in readi monei for answer occasion demand the payment of the bill when it becom due replac to the bank the valu of what it had advanc togeth with the interest the coffer of the bank so far as it deal ar confin to such custom resembl a waterpond from which though a stream is continu run out yet anoth is continu run in fulli equal to that which run out so that without ani further care or attent the pond keep alwai equal or veri near equal full littl or no expens can ever be necessari for replenish the coffer of such a bank a merchant without overtrad mai frequent have occas for a sum of readi monei even when he ha no bill to discount when a bank besid discount hi bill advanc him likewis upon such occas such sum upon hi cash account and accept of a piecem repay as the monei come in from the occasion sale of hi good upon the easi term of the bank compani of scotland it dispens him entir from the necess of keep ani part of hi stock by him unemploi and in readi monei for answer occasion demand when such demand actual come upon him he can answer them suffici from hi cash account the bank howev in deal with such custom ought to observ with great attent whether in the cours of some short period of four five six or eight month for exampl the sum of the repay which it commonli receiv from them is or is not fulli equal to that of the advanc which it commonli make to them if within the cours of such short period the sum of the repay from certain custom is upon most occas fulli equal to that of the advanc it mai safe continu to deal with such custom though the stream which is in thi case continu run out from it coffer mai be veri larg that which is continu run into them must be at least equal larg so that without ani further care or attent those coffer ar like to be alwai equal or veri near equal full and scarc ever to requir ani extraordinari expens to replenish them if on the contrari the sum of the repay from certain other custom fall commonli veri much short of the advanc which it make to them it cannot with ani safeti continu to deal with such custom at least if thei continu to deal with it in thi manner the stream which is in thi case continu run out from it coffer is necessarili much larger than that which is continu run in so that unless thei ar replenish by some great and continu effort of expens those coffer must soon be exhaust altogeth the bank compani of scotland accordingli were for a long time veri care to requir frequent and regular repay from all their custom and did not care to deal with ani person whatev might be hi fortun or credit who did not make what thei call frequent and regular oper with them by thi attent besid save almost entir the extraordinari expens of replenish their coffer thei gain two other veri consider advantag first by thi attent thei were enabl to make some toler judgment concern the thrive or declin circumst of their debtor without be oblig to look out for ani other evid besid what their own book afford them men be for the most part either regular or irregular in their repay accord as their circumst ar either thrive or declin a privat man who lend out hi monei to perhap half a dozen or a dozen of debtor mai either by himself or hi agent observ and inquir both constantli and carefulli into the conduct and situat of each of them but a bank compani which lend monei to perhap five hundr differ peopl and of which the attent is continu occupi by object of a veri differ kind can have no regular inform concern the conduct and circumst of the greater part of it debtor beyond what it own book afford it in requir frequent and regular repay from all their custom the bank compani of scotland had probabl thi advantag in view secondli by thi attent thei secur themselv from the possibl of issu more paper monei than what the circul of the countri could easili absorb and emploi when thei observ that within moder period of time the repay of a particular custom were upon most occas fulli equal to the advanc which thei had made to him thei might be assur that the paper monei which thei had advanc to him had not at ani time exceed the quantiti of gold and silver which he would otherwis have been oblig to keep by him for answer occasion demand and that consequ the paper monei which thei had circul by hi mean had not at ani time exceed the quantiti of gold and silver which would have circul in the countri had there been no paper monei the frequenc regular and amount of hi repay would suffici demonstr that the amount of their advanc had at no time exceed that part of hi capit which he would otherwis have been oblig to keep by him unemploi and in readi monei for answer occasion demand that is for the purpos of keep the rest of hi capit in constant employ it is thi part of hi capit onli which within moder period of time is continu return to everi dealer in the shape of monei whether paper or coin and continu go from him in the same shape if the advanc of the bank had commonli exceed thi part of hi capit the ordinari amount of hi repay could not within moder period of time have equal the ordinari amount of it advanc the stream which by mean of hi deal wa continu run into the coffer of the bank could not have been equal to the stream which by mean of the same deal wa continu run out the advanc of the bank paper by exceed the quantiti of gold and silver which had there been no such advanc he would have been oblig to keep by him for answer occasion demand might soon come to exce the whole quantiti of gold and silver which the commerc be suppos the same would have circul in the countri had there been no paper monei and consequ to exce the quantiti which the circul of the countri could easili absorb and emploi and the excess of thi paper monei would immedi have return upon the bank in order to be exchang for gold and silver thi second advantag though equal real wa not perhap so well understood by all the differ bank compani in scotland as the first when partli by the conveni of discount bill and partli by that of cash account the credit trader of ani countri can be dispens from the necess of keep ani part of their stock by them unemploi and in readi monei for answer occasion demand thei can reason expect no farther assist from hank and banker who when thei have gone thu far cannot consist with their own interest and safeti go farther a bank cannot consist with it own interest advanc to a trader the whole or even the greater part of the circul capit with which he trade becaus though that capit is continu return to him in the shape of monei and go from him in the same shape yet the whole of the return is too distant from the whole of the outgo and the sum of hi repay could not equal the sum of hi advanc within such moder period of time as suit the conveni of a bank still less could a bank afford to advanc him ani consider part of hi fix capit of the capit which the undertak of an iron forg for exampl emploi in erect hi forg and smeltinghous hi workhous and warehous the dwellinghous of hi workmen etc of the capit which the undertak of a mine emploi in sink hi shaft in erect engin for draw out the water in make road and waggonwai etc of the capit which the person who undertak to improv land emploi in clear drain inclos manur and plough wast and uncultiv field in build farmhous with all their necessari appendag of stabl granari etc the return of the fix capit ar in almost all case much slower than those of the circul capit and such expens even when laid out with the greatest prudenc and judgment veri seldom return to the undertak till after a period of mani year a period by far too distant to suit the conveni of a bank trader and other undertak mai no doubt with great proprieti carri on a veri consider part of their project with borrow monei in justic to their creditor howev their own capit ought in thi case to be suffici to insur if i mai sai so the capit of those creditor or to render it extrem improb that those creditor should incur ani loss even though the success of the project should fall veri much short of the expect of the projector even with thi precaut too the monei which is borrow and which it is meant should not be repaid till after a period of sever year ought not to be borrow of a bank but ought to be borrow upon bond or mortgag of such privat peopl as propos to live upon the interest of their monei without take the troubl themselv to emploi the capit and who ar upon that account will to lend that capit to such peopl of good credit as ar like to keep it for sever year a bank inde which lend it monei without the expens of stamp paper or of attornei fee for draw bond and mortgag and which accept of repay upon the easi term of the bank compani of scotland would no doubt be a veri conveni creditor to such trader and undertak but such trader and undertak would sure be most inconveni debtor to such a bank it is now more than five and twenti year sinc the paper monei issu by the differ bank compani of scotland wa fulli equal or rather wa somewhat more than fulli equal to what the circul of the countri could easili absorb and emploi those compani therefor had so long ago given all the assist to the trader and other undertak of scotland which it is possibl for bank and banker consist with their own interest to give thei had even done somewhat more thei had overtrad a littl and had brought upon themselv that loss or at least that diminut of profit which in thi particular busi never fail to attend the smallest degre of overtrad those trader and other undertak have got so much assist from bank and banker wish to get still more the bank thei seem to have thought could extend their credit to whatev sum might be want without incur ani other expens besid that of a few ream of paper thei complain of the contract view and dastardli spirit of the director of those bank which did not thei said extend their credit in proport to the extens of the trade of the countri mean no doubt by the extens of that trade the extens of their own project beyond what thei could carri on either with their own capit or with what thei had credit to borrow of privat peopl in the usual wai of bond or mortgag the bank thei seem to have thought were in honour bound to suppli the defici and to provid them with all the capit which thei want to trade with the bank howev were of a differ opinion and upon their refus to extend their credit some of those trader had recours to an expedi which for a time serv their purpos though at a much greater expens yet as effectu as the utmost extens of bank credit could have done thi expedi wa no other than the well known shift of draw and redraw the shift to which unfortun trader have sometim recours when thei ar upon the brink of bankruptci the practic of rais monei in thi manner had been long known in england and dure the cours of the late war when the high profit of trade afford a great temptat to overtrad is said to have been carri on to a veri great extent from england it wa brought into scotland where in proport to the veri limit commerc and to the veri moder capit of the countri it wa soon carri on to a much greater extent than it ever had been in england the practic of draw and redraw is so well known to all men of busi that it mai perhap be thought unnecessari to give ani account of it but as thi book mai come into the hand of mani peopl who ar not men of busi and as the effect of thi practic upon the bank trade ar not perhap gener understood even by men of busi themselv i shall endeavour to explain it as distinctli as i can the custom of merchant which were establish when the barbar law of europ did not enforc the perform of their contract and which dure the cours of the two last centuri have been adopt into the law of all european nation have given such extraordinari privileg to bill of exchang that monei is more readili advanc upon them than upon ani other speci of oblig especi when thei ar made payabl within so short a period as two or three month after their date if when the bill becom due the acceptor doe not pai it as soon as it is present he becom from that moment a bankrupt the bill is protest and return upon the drawer who if he doe not immedi pai it becom likewis a bankrupt if befor it came to the person who present it to the acceptor for payment it had pass through the hand of sever other person who had success advanc to on anoth the content of it either in monei or good and who to express that each of them had in hi turn receiv those content had all of them in their order indors that is written their name upon the back of the bill each indors becom in hi turn liabl to the owner of the bill for those content and if he fail to pai he becom too from that moment a bankrupt though the drawer acceptor and indors of the bill should all of them be person of doubt credit yet still the short of the date give some secur to the owner of the bill though all of them mai be veri like to becom bankrupt it is a chanc if thei all becom so in so short a time the hous is crazi sai a weari travel to himself and will not stand veri long but it is a chanc if it fall tonight and i will ventur therefor to sleep in it tonight the trader a in edinburgh we shall suppos draw a bill upon b in london payabl two month after date in realiti b in london ow noth to a in edinburgh but he agre to accept of a s bill upon condit that befor the term of payment he shall redraw upon a in edinburgh for the same sum togeth with the interest and a commiss anoth bill payabl likewis two month after date b accordingli befor the expir of the first two month redraw thi bill upon a in edinburgh who again befor the expir of the second two month draw a second bill upon b in london payabl likewis two month

sever year togeth the bill alwai return upon a in edinburgh with the accumul interest and commiss of all the former bill the interest wa five per cent in the year and the commiss wa never less than on half per cent on each draught thi commiss be repeat more than six time in the year whatev monei a might rais by thi expedi might necessarili have cost him someth more than eight per cent in the year and sometim a great deal more when either the price of the commiss happen to rise or when he wa oblig to pai compound interest upon the interest and commiss of former bill thi practic wa call rais monei by circul in a countri where the ordinari profit of stock in the greater part of mercantil project ar suppos to run between six and ten per cent it must have been a veri fortun specul of which the return could not onli repai the enorm expens at which the monei wa thu borrow for carri it on but afford besid a good surplu profit to the projector mani vast and extens project howev were undertaken and for sever year carri on without ani other fund to support them besid what wa rais at thi enorm expens the projector no doubt had in their golden dream the most distinct vision of thi great profit upon their awaken howev either at the end of their project or when thei were no longer abl to carri them on thei veri seldom i believ had the good fortun to find it the method describ in the text wa by no mean either the most common or the most expens on in which those adventur sometim rais monei by circul it frequent happen that a in edinburgh would enabl b in london to pai the first

more than eight per cent by save howev the exchang between edinburgh and london it wa less expens than that mention in the forego part of thi note but then it requir an establish credit with more hous

due with some bank or banker in edinburgh and the bill which b in london redrew upon a in edinburgh he as regularli discount either with the bank of england or with some other banker in london whatev wa advanc upon such circul bill wa in edinburgh advanc in the paper of the scotch bank and in london when thei were discount at the bank of england in the paper of that bank though the bill upon which thi paper had been advanc were all of them repaid in their turn as soon as thei becam due yet the valu which had been realli advanc upon the first bill wa never realli return to the bank which advanc it becaus befor each bill becam due anoth bill wa alwai drawn to somewhat a greater amount than the bill which wa soon to be paid and the discount of thi other bill wa essenti necessari toward the payment of that which wa soon to be due thi payment therefor wa altogeth fictiti the stream which by mean of those circul bill of exchang had onc been made to run out from the coffer of the bank wa never replac by ani stream which realli ran into them the paper which wa issu upon those circul bill of exchang amount upon mani occas to the whole fund destin for carri on some vast and extens

answer occasion demand the greater part of thi paper wa consequ over and abov the valu of the gold and silver which would have circul in the countri had there been no paper monei it wa over and abov therefor what the circul of the countri could easili absorb and emploi and upon that account immedi return upon the bank in order to be exchang for gold and silver which thei were to find as thei could it wa a capit which those projector had veri artfulli contriv to draw from those bank not onli without their knowledg or deliber consent but for some time perhap without their have the most distant suspicion that thei had realli advanc it when two peopl who ar continu draw and redraw upon on anoth discount their bill alwai with the same banker he must immedi discov what thei ar about and see clearli that thei ar trade not with ani capit of their own but with the capit which he advanc to them but thi discoveri is not altogeth so easi when thei discount their bill sometim with on banker and sometim with anoth and when the two same person do not constantli draw and redraw upon on anoth but occasion run the round of a great circl of projector who find it for their interest to assist on anoth in thi method of rais monei and to render it upon that account as difficult as possibl to distinguish between a real and a fictiti bill of exchang between a bill drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor and a bill for which there wa properli no real creditor but the bank which discount it nor ani real debtor but the projector who made us of the monei when a banker had even made thi discoveri he might sometim make it too late and might find that he had alreadi discount the bill of those projector to so great an extent that by refus to discount ani more he would necessarili make them all bankrupt and thu by ruin them might perhap ruin himself for hi own interest and safeti therefor he might find it necessari in thi veri peril situat to go on for some time endeavour howev to withdraw gradual and upon that account make everi dai greater and greater difficulti about discount in order to forc these projector by degre to have recours either to other banker or to other method of rais monei so as that he himself might as soon as possibl get out of the circl the difficulti accordingli which the bank of england which the princip banker in london and which even the more prudent scotch bank began after a certain time and when all of them had alreadi gone too far to make about discount not onli alarm but enrag in the highest degre those projector their own distress of which thi prudent and necessari reserv of the bank wa no doubt the immedi occas thei call the distress of the countri and thi distress of the countri thei said wa altogeth ow to the ignor pusillanim and bad conduct of the bank which did not give a suffici liber aid to the spirit undertak of those who exert themselv in order to beautifi improv and enrich the countri it wa the duti of the bank thei seem to think to lend for as long a time and to as great an extent as thei might wish to borrow the bank howev by refus in thi manner to give more credit to those to whom thei had alreadi given a great deal too much took the onli method by which it wa now possibl to save either their own credit or the public credit of the countri in the midst of thi clamour and distress a new bank wa establish in scotland for the express purpos of reliev the distress of the countri the design wa gener but the execut wa imprud and the natur and caus of the distress which it meant to reliev were not perhap well understood thi bank wa more liber than ani other had ever been both in grant cashaccount and in discount bill of exchang with regard to the latter it seem to have made scarc ani distinct between real and circul bill but to have discount all equal it wa the avow principl of thi bank to advanc upon ani reason secur the whole capit which wa to be emploi in those improv of which the return ar the most slow and distant such as the improv of land to promot such improv wa even said to be the chief of the publicspirit purpos for which it wa institut by it liber in grant cashaccount and in discount bill of exchang it no doubt issu great quantiti of it bank note but those bank note be the greater part of them over and abov what the circul of the countri could easili absorb and emploi return upon it in order to be exchang for gold and silver as fast as thei were issu it coffer were never well fill the capit which had been subscrib to thi bank at two differ subscript amount to on hundr and sixti thousand pound of which eighti per cent onli wa paid up thi sum ought to have been paid in at sever differ instal a great part of the proprietor when thei paid in their first instal open a

what thei paid in upon all their subsequ instal such payment therefor onli put into on coffer what had the moment befor been taken out of anoth but had the coffer of thi bank been fill ever so well it excess circul must have empti them faster than thei could have been replenish by ani other expedi but the ruinou on of draw upon london and when the bill becam due pai it togeth with interest and

proprietor of thi bank were worth sever million and by their subscript to the origin bond or contract of the bank were realli pledg for answer all it engag by mean of the great credit which so great a pledg necessarili gave it it wa notwithstand it too liber conduct enabl to carri on busi for more than two year when it wa oblig to stop it had in the circul about two hundr thousand pound in bank

whole bank busi to themselv to supplant all the other scotch bank particularli those establish at edinburgh whose backward in discount bill of exchang had given some offenc thi bank no doubt gave some temporari relief to those projector and enabl them to carri on their project for about two year longer than thei could otherwis have done but it therebi onli enabl them to get so much deeper into debt so that when ruin came it fell so much the heavier both upon them and upon their creditor the oper of thi bank therefor instead of reliev in realiti aggrav in the longrun the distress which those projector had brought both upon themselv and upon their countri it would have been much better for themselv their creditor and their countri had the greater part of them been oblig to stop two year sooner than thei actual did the temporari relief howev which thi bank afford to those projector prove a real and perman relief to the other scotch bank all the dealer in circul bill of exchang which those other bank had becom so backward in discount had recours to thi new bank where thei were receiv with open arm those other bank therefor were enabl to get veri easili out of that fatal circl from which thei could not otherwis have disengag themselv without incur a consider loss and perhap too even some degre of discredit in the longrun therefor the oper of thi bank increas the real distress of the countri which it meant to reliev and effectu reliev from a veri great distress those rival whom it meant to supplant at the first set out of thi bank it wa the opinion of some peopl that how fast soever it coffer might be empti it might easili replenish them by rais monei upon the secur of those to whom it had advanc it paper experi i believ soon convinc them that thi method of rais monei wa by much too slow to answer their purpos and that coffer which origin were so ill fill and which empti themselv so veri fast could be replenish by no other expedi but the ruinou on of draw bill upon london and when thei becam due pai them by other draught on the same place with accumul interest and commiss but though thei had been abl by thi method to rais monei as fast as thei want it yet instead of make a profit thei must have suffer a loss of everi such oper so that in the longrun thei must have ruin themselv as a mercantil compani though perhap not so soon as by the more expens practic of draw and redraw thei could still have made noth by the interest of the paper which be over and abov what the circul of the countri could absorb and emploi return upon them in order to be exchang for gold and silver as fast as thei issu it and for the payment of which thei were themselv continu oblig to borrow monei on the contrari the whole expens of thi borrow of emploi agent to look out for peopl who had monei to lend of negoti with those peopl and of draw the proper bond or assign must have fallen upon them and have been so much clear loss upon the balanc of their account the project of replenish their coffer in thi manner mai be compar to that of a man who had a waterpond from which a stream wa continu run out and into which no stream wa continu run but who propos to keep it alwai equal full by emploi a number of peopl to go continu with bucket to a well at some mile distanc in order to bring water to replenish it but though thi oper had prove not onli practic but profit to the bank as a mercantil compani yet the countri could have deriv no benefit front it but on the contrari must have suffer a veri consider loss by it thi oper could not augment in the smallest degre the quantiti of monei to be lent it could onli have erect thi bank into a sort of gener loan offic for the whole countri those who want to borrow must have appli to thi bank instead of appli to the privat person who had lent it their monei but a bank which lend monei perhap to five hundr differ peopl the greater part of whom it director can know veri littl about is not like to be more judici in the choic of it debtor than a privat person who lend out hi monei among a few peopl whom he know and in whose sober and frugal conduct he think he ha good reason to confid the debtor of such a bank as that whose conduct i have been give some account of were like the greater part of them to be chimer projector the drawer and redraw of circul bill of exchang who would emploi the monei

realli cost would never afford a fund capabl of maintain a quantiti of labour equal to that which had been emploi about them the sober and frugal debtor of privat person on the contrari would be more like to emploi the monei borrow in sober undertak which were proport to their capit and which though thei might have less of the grand and the marvel would have more of the solid and the profit which would repai with a larg profit whatev had been laid out upon them and which would thu afford a fund capabl of maintain a much greater quantiti of labour than that which had been emploi about them the success of thi oper therefor without increas in the smallest degre the capit of the countri would onli have transfer a great part of it from prudent and profit to imprud and unprofit undertak that the

worth of good so that it often return into the hand of a dealer befor the consum ha spent the fortieth part of the monei where bank note ar issu for so small sum as s as in scotland paper monei extend

under valu be in most part of the kingdom a sum which though it will purchas perhap littl more than half the quantiti of good is as much consid and is as seldom spent all at onc as ar amidst the profus expens of london where paper monei it is to be observ is pretti much confin to the circul between dealer and dealer as at london there is alwai plenti of gold and silver where it extend itself to a consider part of the circul between dealer and consum as in scotland and still more in north america it banish gold and silver almost entir from the countri almost all the ordinari transact of it interior commerc be thu carri on by paper the suppress of ten and five shill bank note somewhat reliev the scarciti of gold and silver in scotland and the suppress of twenti shill note will probabl

such present togeth with the legal interest for the said six month the director of some of those bank sometim took advantag of thi option claus and sometim threaten those who demand gold and silver in

constitut at that time the far greater part of the currenc of scotland which thi uncertainti of payment necessarili degrad below valu of gold and silver monei dure the continu of thi abus which

the whole annual produc if we except the spontan product of the earth be the effect of product labour though the whole annual produc of the land and labour of everi countri is no doubt ultim destin

that part is from that moment withdrawn from hi capit and place in hi stock reserv for immedi consumpt unproduct labour and those who do not labour at all ar all maintain by revenu either first by that part of the annual produc which is origin destin for constitut a revenu to some particular person either as the rent of land or as the profit of stock or secondli by that part which though origin

most to spare thei might both maintain indiffer either product or unproduct hand thei seem howev to have some predilect for the latter the expens of a great lord feed gener more idl than industri peopl the rich merchant though with hi capit he maintain industri peopl onli yet by hi expens that is by the employ of hi revenu he feed commonli the veri same sort as the great lord the proport therefor between the product and unproduct hand depend veri much in everi countri upon the proport between that part of the annual produc which as soon as it come either from the ground or from the hand of the product labour is destin for replac a capit and that which is destin for constitut a revenu either as rent or as profit thi proport is veri differ in rich from what it is in poor countri thu at present in the opul countri of europ a veri larg frequent the largest portion of the produc of the land is destin for replac the capit of the rich and independ farmer the other for pai hi

their lord could at all time command their labour in peac and their servic in war though thei live at a distanc from hi hous thei were equal depend upon him as hi retain who live in it but the whole

not a fourth part of the whole produc of the land the rent of land howev in all the improv part of the countri ha been tripl and quadrupl sinc those ancient time and thi third or fourth part of the

present the rate of interest in the improv part of europ is nowher higher than six per cent and in some of the most improv it is so low as four three and two per cent though that part of the revenu of the inhabit which is deriv from the profit of stock is alwai much greater in rich than in poor countri it is becaus the stock is much greater in proport to the stock the profit ar gener much less that part of the annual produc therefor which as soon as it come either from the ground or from the hand of the product labour is destin for replac a capit is not onli much greater in rich than in poor countri but bear a much greater proport to that which is immedi destin for constitut a revenu either as rent or as profit the fund destin for the mainten of product labour ar not onli much greater in the former than in the latter but bear a much greater proport to those which though thei mai be emploi to maintain either product or unproduct hand have gener a predilect for the latter the proport between those differ fund necessarili determin in everi countri the gener charact of the inhabit as to industri or idl we ar more industri than our forefath becaus in the present time the fund destin for the mainten of industri ar much greater in proport to those which ar like to be emploi in the mainten of idl than thei were two or three centuri ago our ancestor were idl for want of a suffici encourag to industri it is better sai the proverb to plai for noth than to work for noth in mercantil and manufactur town where the inferior rank of peopl ar chiefli maintain by the employ of capit thei ar in gener industri sober and thrive as in mani english and in most dutch town in those town which ar princip support by the constant or occasion resid of a court and in which the inferior rank

attract a great capit by the great employ which thei afford it and the employ of thi capit is the caus of the industri of those two citi in the other parliament town of franc veri littl more capit seem to be emploi than what is necessari for suppli their own consumpt that is littl more than the smallest capit which can be emploi in them the same thing mai be said of pari madrid and vienna of those three citi pari is by far the most industri but pari itself is the princip market of all the manufactur establish at pari and it own consumpt is the princip object of all the trade which it carri on london lisbon and copenhagen ar perhap the onli three citi in europ which ar both the constant resid of a court and can at the same time be consid as trade citi or as citi which trade not

which the inferior rank of peopl have no other mainten but what thei deriv from the employ of such a capit the idl of the greater part of the peopl who ar maintain by the expens of revenu corrupt it is probabl the industri of those who ought to be maintain by the employ of capit and render it less advantag to emploi a capit there than in other place there wa littl trade or industri in edinburgh befor the union when the scotch parliament wa no longer to be assembl in it when it ceas to be the necessari resid of the princip nobil and gentri of scotland it becam a citi of some trade and

so far as it depend upon him the quantiti of that labour which add a valu to the subject upon which it is bestow and consequ the valu of the annual produc of the land and labour of the whole countri the real wealth and revenu of it inhabit if the prodig of some were not compens by the frugal of other the conduct of everi prodig by feed the idl with the bread of the industri would tend not onli to

had befor been emploi the number of it product labour it is evid can never be much increas but in consequ of an increas of capit or of the fund destin for maintain them the product power of the same

it land ar better cultiv it manufactur more numer and more flourish and it trade more extens we mai be assur that it capit must have increas dure the interv between those two period and that more must have been ad to it by the good conduct of some than had been taken from it either by the privat misconduct of other or by the public extravag of govern but we shall find thi to have been the case of almost all nation in all toler quiet and peaceabl time even of those who have not enjoi the most prudent and parsimoni govern to form a right judgment of it inde we must compar the state of the countri at period somewhat distant from on anoth the progress is frequent so gradual that at near period the improv is not onli not sensibl but from the declens either of certain branch of industri or of certain district of the countri thing which sometim happen though the countri in gener is in great prosper there frequent aris a suspicion that the rich and industri of the whole ar decai the annual produc of the land and labour of england for exampl is certainli much greater than it wa a littl more than a centuri ago at the restor of charl ii though at present few peopl i believ doubt of thi yet dure thi period five year have seldom pass awai in which some book or pamphlet ha not been publish written too with such abil as to gain some author with the public and pretend to demonstr that the wealth of the nation wa fast declin that the countri wa depopul agricultur neglect manufactur decai and trade undon nor have these public been all parti pamphlet the wretch offspr of falsehood and venal mani of them have been written by veri candid and veri intellig peopl who wrote noth but what thei believ and for no other reason but becaus thei believ it the annual produc of the land and labour of england again wa certainli much greater at the restor than we can suppos it to have been about a hundr year befor at the access of elizabeth at thi period too we have all reason to believ the countri wa much more advanc in improv than it had been about a centuri befor toward the close of the dissens between the hous of york and lancast even then it wa probabl in a better condit than it had been at the norman conquest and at the norman conquest than dure the confus of the saxon heptarchi even at thi earli period it wa certainli a more improv countri than at the invas of juliu caesar when it inhabit were nearli in the same state with the savag in north america in each of those period howev there wa not onli much privat and public profus mani expens and unnecessari war great pervers of the annual produc from maintain product to maintain unproduct hand but sometim in the confus of civil discord such absolut wast and destruct of stock as might be suppos not onli to retard

contract more than of debt over and abov all the other extraordinari annual expens which thei occas so that the whole cannot be comput at less than so great a share of the annual produc of the land and labour of the countri ha sinc the revolut been emploi upon differ occas in maintain an extraordinari number of unproduct hand but had not those war given thi particular direct to so larg a capit the greater part of it would natur have been emploi in maintain product hand whose labour would have replac with a profit the whole valu of their consumpt the valu of the annual produc of the land and labour of the countri would have been consider increas by it everi year and everi year increas would have augment still more that of the follow year more hous would have been built more land would have been improv and those which had been improv befor would have been better cultiv more manufactur would have been establish and those which had been establish befor would have been more extend and to what height the real wealth and revenu of the countri might by thi time have been rais it is not perhap veri easi even to imagin but though the profus of govern must undoubtedli have retard the natur progress of england toward wealth and improv it ha not been abl to stop it the annual produc of it land and labour is undoubtedli much greater at present than it wa either at the restor or at the revolut the capit therefor annual emploi in cultiv thi land and in maintain thi labour must likewis be much greater in the midst of all the exact of govern thi capit ha been silent and gradual accumul by the privat frugal and good conduct of individu by their univers continu and uninterrupt effort to better their own condit it is thi effort protect by law and allow by liberti to exert itself in the manner that is most advantag which ha maintain the progress of england toward opul and improv in almost all former time and which it is to be hope will do so in all futur time england howev as it ha never been bless with a veri parsimoni govern so parsimoni ha at no time been the characterist virtu of it inhabit it is the highest impertin and presumpt therefor in king and minist to pretend to watch over the economi of privat peopl and to restrain their expens either by sumptuari law or by prohibit the import of foreign luxuri thei ar themselv alwai and without ani except the greatest spendthrift in the societi let them look well after their own expens and thei mai safe trust privat peopl with their if their own extravag doe not ruin the state that of the subject never will as frugal increas and prodig diminish the public capit so the conduct of those whose expens just equal their revenu without either accumul or encroach neither increas nor diminish it some mode of expens howev seem to contribut more to the growth of public opul than other the revenu of an individu mai be spent either in thing which ar consum immedi and in which on dai expens can neither allevi

is alwai consid as a capit by the lender he expect that in due time it is to be restor to him and that in the mean time the borrow is to pai him a certain annual rent for the us of it the borrow mai us it either as a capit or as a stock reserv for immedi consumpt if he us it as a capit he emploi it in the mainten of product labour who reproduc the valu with a profit he can in thi case both restor the capit and pai the interest without alien or encroach upon ani other sourc of revenu if he us it as a stock reserv for immedi consumpt he act the part of a prodig and dissip in the mainten of the idl what wa destin for the support of the industri he can in thi case neither restor the capit nor pai the interest without either alien or encroach upon some other sourc of revenu such as the properti or the rent of land the stock which is lent at interest is no doubt occasion emploi in both these wai but in the former much more frequent than in the latter the man who borrow in order to spend will soon be ruin and he who lend to him will gener have occas to repent of hi folli to borrow or to lend for such a purpos therefor is in all case where gross usuri is out of the question contrari to the interest of both parti and though it no doubt happen sometim that peopl do both the on and the other yet from the regard that all men have for their own interest we mai be assur that it cannot happen so veri frequent as we ar sometim apt to imagin ask ani rich man of common prudenc to which of the two sort of peopl he ha lent the greater part of hi stock to those who he think will emploi it profit or to those who will spend it idli and he will laugh at you for propos the question even among borrow therefor not the peopl in the world most famou for frugal the number of the frugal and industri surpass consider that of the prodig and idl the onli peopl to whom stock is commonli lent without their be expect to make ani veri profit us of it ar countri gentlemen who borrow upon mortgag even thei scarc ever borrow mere to spend what thei borrow on mai sai is commonli spent befor thei borrow it thei have gener consum so great a quantiti of good advanc to them upon credit by shopkeep and tradesmen that thei find it necessari to borrow at interest in order to pai the debt the capit borrow replac the capit of those shopkeep and tradesmen which the countri gentlemen could not have replac from the rent of their estat it is not properli borrow in order to be spent but in order to replac a capit which had been spent befor almost all loan at interest ar made in monei either of paper or of gold and silver but what the borrow realli want and what the lender readili suppli him with is not the monei but the monei worth or the good which it can purchas if he want it as a stock for immedi consumpt it is those good onli which he can place in that stock if he want it as a capit for emploi industri it is from those good onli that the industri can be furnish with the tool materi and mainten necessari for carri on their work by mean of the loan the lender as it were assign to the borrow hi right to a certain portion of the annual produc of the land and labour of the countri to be emploi as the borrow pleas the quantiti of stock therefor or as it is commonli express of monei which can be lent at interest in ani countri is not regul by the valu of the monei whether paper or coin which serv as the instrument of the differ loan made in that countri but by the valu of that part of the annual produc which as soon as it come either from the ground or from the hand of the product labour is destin not onli for replac a capit but such a capit as the owner doe not care to be at the troubl of emploi himself as such capit ar commonli lent out and paid back in monei thei constitut what is call the moni interest it is distinct not onli from the land but from the trade and manufactur interest as in these last the owner themselv emploi their own capit even in the moni interest howev the monei is as it were but the deed of assign which convei from on hand to anoth those capit which the owner do not care to emploi themselv those capit mai be greater in almost ani proport than the amount of the monei which serv as the instrument of their convey the same piec of monei success serv for mani differ loan as well as for mani differ purchas a for exampl

for the same reason lend them to y who again purchas good with them of d in thi manner the same piec either of coin or of paper mai in the cours of a few dai serv as the instrument of three differ loan and of three differ purchas each of which is in valu equal to the whole amount of those piec what the three moni men a b and c assign to the three borrow w x and y is the power of make those purchas in thi power consist both the valu and the us of the loan the stock lent by the three moni men is equal to the valu of the good which can be purchas with it and is three time greater than that of the monei with which the purchas ar made those loan howev mai be all perfectli well secur the good purchas by the differ debtor be so emploi as in due time to bring back with a profit an equal valu either of coin or of paper and as the same piec of monei can thu serv as the instrument of differ loan to three or for the same reason to thirti time their valu so thei mai likewis success serv as the instrument of repay a capit lent at interest mai in thi manner be consid as an assign from the lender to the borrow of a certain consider portion of the annual produc upon condit that the burrow in return shall dure the continu of the loan annual assign to the lender a small portion call the interest and at the end of it a portion equal consider with that which had origin been assign to him call the repay though monei either coin or paper serv gener as the deed of assign both to the smaller and to the more consider portion it is itself altogeth differ from what is assign by it in proport as that share of the annual produc which as soon as it come either from the ground or from the hand of the product labour is destin for replac a capit increas in ani countri what is call the moni interest natur increas with it the increas of those particular capit from which the owner wish to deriv a revenu without be at the troubl of emploi them themselv natur accompani the gener increas of capit or in other word as stock increas the quantiti of stock to be lent at interest grow gradual greater and greater as the quantiti of stock to be lent at interest increas the interest or the price which must be paid for the us of that stock necessarili diminish not onli from those gener caus which make the market price of thing commonli diminish as their quantiti increas but from other caus which ar peculiar to thi particular case as capit increas in ani countri the profit which can be made by emploi them necessarili diminish it becom gradual more and more difficult to find within the countri a profit method of emploi ani new capit there aris in consequ a competit between differ capit the owner of on endeavour to get possess of that employ which is occupi by anoth but upon most occas he can hope to justl that other out of thi employ by no other mean but by deal upon more reason term he must not onli sell what he deal in somewhat cheaper but in order to get it to sell he must sometim too bui it dearer the demand for product labour by the increas of the fund which ar destin for maintain it grow everi dai greater and greater labour easili find employ but the owner of capit find it difficult to get labour to emploi their competit rais the wage of labour and sink the profit of stock but when the profit which can be made by the us of a capit ar in thi manner diminish as it were at both end the price which can be paid for the us of it that is the rate of interest must necessarili be diminish with them mr lock mr law and mr montesquieu as well as mani other writer seem to have imagin that the increas of the quantiti of gold and silver in consequ of the discoveri of the spanish west indi wa the real caus of the lower of the rate of interest through the greater part of europ those metal thei sai have becom of less valu themselv the us of ani particular portion of them necessarili becam of less valu too and consequ the price which could be paid for it thi notion which at first sight seem so plausibl ha been so fulli expos by mr hume that it is perhap unnecessari to sai ani thing more about it the follow veri short and plain argument howev mai serv to explain more distinctli the fallaci which seem to have misl those gentlemen befor the discoveri of the spanish west indi ten per cent seem to have been the common rate of interest through the greater part of europ it ha sinc that time in differ countri sunk to six five four and three per cent let us suppos that in everi particular countri the valu of silver ha sunk precis in the same proport as the rate of interest and that in those countri for exampl where interest ha been reduc from ten to five per cent the same quantiti of silver can now purchas just half the quantiti of good which it could have purchas befor thi supposit will not i believ be found anywher agreeabl to the truth but it is the most favour to the opinion which we ar go to examin and even upon thi supposit it is utterli imposs that the lower of the valu of silver could have the smallest tendenc to lower the rate of interest if ar in those countri now of no more valu than were then must now be of no more valu than were then whatev were the caus which lower the valu of the capit the same must necessarili have lower that of the interest and exactli in the same proport the proport between the valu of the capit and that of the interest must have remain the same though the rate had never been alter by alter the rate on the contrari the proport between those two valu is necessarili alter if now ar worth no more than were then now can be worth no more than s were then by reduc the rate of interest therefor from ten to five per cent we give for the us of a capit which is suppos to be equal to on half of it former valu an interest which is equal to on fourth onli of the valu of the former interest an increas in the quantiti of silver while that of the commod circul by mean of it remain the same could have no other effect than to diminish the valu of that metal the nomin valu of all sort of good would be greater but their real valu would be precis the same as befor thei would be exchang for a greater number of piec of silver but the quantiti of labour which thei could command the number of peopl whom thei could maintain and emploi would be precis the same the capit of the countri would be the same though a greater number of piec might be requisit for convei ani equal portion of it from on hand to anoth the deed of assign like the convey of a verbos attornei would be more cumbersom but the thing assign would be precis the same as befor and could produc onli the same effect the fund for maintain product labour be the same the demand for it would be the same it price or wage therefor though nomin greater would realli be the same thei would be paid in a greater number of piec of silver but thei would purchas onli the same quantiti of good the profit of stock would be the same both nomin and realli the wage of labour ar commonli comput by the quantiti of silver which is paid to the labour when that is increas therefor hi wage appear to be increas though thei mai sometim be no greater than befor but the profit of stock ar not comput by the number of piec of silver with which thei ar paid but by the proport which those piec bear to the whole capit emploi thu in a particular countri s aweek ar said to be the common wage of labour and ten per cent the common profit of stock but the whole capit of the countri be the same as befor the competit between the differ capit of individu into which it wa divid would likewis be the same thei would all trade with the same advantag and disadvantag the common proport between capit and profit therefor would be the same and consequ the common interest of monei what can commonli be given for the us of monei be necessarili regul by what can commonli be made by the us of it ani increas in the quantiti of commod annual circul within the countri while that of the monei which circul them remain the same would on the contrari produc mani other import effect besid that of rais the valu of the monei the capit of the countri though it might nomin be the same would realli be augment it might continu to be express by the same quantiti of monei but it would command a greater quantiti of labour the quantiti of product labour which it could maintain and emploi would be increas and consequ the demand for that labour it wage would natur rise with the demand and yet might appear to sink thei might be paid with a smaller quantiti of monei but that smaller quantiti might purchas a greater quantiti of good than a greater had done befor the profit of stock would be diminish both realli and in appear the whole capit of the countri be augment the competit between the differ capit of which it wa compos would natur be augment along with it the owner of those particular capit would be oblig to content themselv with a smaller proport of the produc of that labour which their respect capit emploi the interest of monei keep pace alwai with the profit of stock might in thi manner be greatli diminish though the valu of monei or the quantiti of good which ani particular sum could purchas wa greatli augment in some countri the interest of monei ha been prohibit by law but as someth can everywher be made by the us of monei someth ought everywher to be paid for the us of it thi regul instead of prevent ha been found from experi to increas the evil of usuri the debtor be oblig to pai not onli for the us of the monei but for the risk which hi creditor run by accept a compens for that us he is oblig if on mai sai so to insur hi creditor from the penalti of usuri in countri where interest is permit the law in order to prevent the extort of usuri gener fix the highest rate which can be taken without incur a penalti thi rate ought alwai to be somewhat abov the lowest market price or the price which is commonli paid for the us of monei by those who can give the most undoubt secur if thi legal rate should be fix below the lowest market rate the effect of thi fixat must be nearli the same as those of a total prohibit of interest the creditor will not lend hi monei for less than the us of it is worth and the debtor must pai him for the risk which he run by accept the full valu of that us if it is fix precis at the lowest market price it ruin with honest peopl who respect the law of their countri the credit of all those who cannot give the veri best secur and oblig them to have recours to exorbit usur in a countri such as great britain where monei is lent to govern at three per cent and to privat peopl upon good secur at four and four and ahalf the present legal rate five per cent is perhap as proper as ani the legal rate it is to be observ though it ought to be somewhat abov ought not to be much abov the lowest market rate if the legal rate of interest in great britain for exampl wa fix so high as eight or ten per cent the greater part of the monei which wa to be lent would be lent to prodig and projector who alon would be will to give thi high interest sober peopl who will give for the us of

therefor of the foreign trade of consumpt should be as quick as those of the home trade the capit emploi in it will give but on half of the encourag to the industri or product labour of the countri but the return of the foreign trade of consumpt ar veri seldom so quick as those of the home trade the return of the home trade gener come in befor the end of the year and sometim three or four time

howev must have been purchas either immedi with the produc of domest industri or with someth els that had been purchas with it for the case of war and conquest except foreign good can never be acquir but in exchang for someth that had been produc at home either immedi or after two or more differ exchang the effect therefor of a capit emploi in such a roundabout foreign trade of consumpt ar in everi respect the same as those of on emploi in the most direct trade of the same kind except that the final return ar like to be still more distant as thei must depend upon the return of two or three distinct foreign trade if the hemp and flax of riga ar purchas with the tobacco of virginia which had been purchas with british manufactur the merchant must wait for the return of two distinct foreign trade befor he can emploi the same capit in repurchas a like quantiti of british manufactur if the tobacco of virginia had been purchas not with british manufactur but with the sugar and rum of jamaica which had been purchas with those manufactur he must wait for the return of three if those two or three distinct foreign trade should happen to be carri on by two or three distinct merchant of whom the second bui the good import by the first and the third bui those import by the second in order to export them again each merchant inde will in thi case receiv the return of hi own capit more quickli but the final return of the whole capit emploi in the trade will be just as slow as ever whether the whole capit emploi in such a round about trade belong to on merchant or to three can make no differ with regard to the countri though it mai with regard to the particular merchant three time a greater capit must in both case be emploi in order to exchang a certain valu of british manufactur for a certain quantiti of flax and hemp than would have been necessari had the manufactur and the flax and hemp been directli exchang for on anoth the whole capit emploi therefor in such a roundabout foreign trade of consumpt will gener give less encourag and support to the product labour of the countri than an equal capit emploi in a more direct trade of the same kind whatev be the foreign commod with which the foreign good for home consumpt ar purchas it can occas no essenti differ either in the natur of the trade or in the encourag and support which it can give to the product labour of the countri from which it is carri on if thei ar purchas with the gold of brazil for exampl or with the silver of peru thi gold and silver like the tobacco of virginia must have been purchas with someth that either wa the produc of the industri of the countri or that had been purchas with someth els that wa so so far therefor as the product labour of the countri is concern the foreign trade of consumpt which is carri on by mean of gold and silver ha all the advantag and all the inconveni of ani other equal roundabout foreign trade of consumpt and will replac just as fast or just as slow the capit which is immedi emploi in support that product labour it seem even to have on advantag over ani other equal roundabout foreign trade the transport of those metal from on place to anoth on account of their small bulk and great valu is less expens than that of almost ani other foreign good of equal valu their freight is much less and their insur not greater and no good besid ar less liabl to suffer by the carriag an equal quantiti of foreign good therefor mai frequent be purchas with a smaller quantiti of the produc of domest industri by the intervent of gold and silver than by that of ani other foreign good the demand of the countri mai frequent in thi manner be suppli more complet and at a smaller expens than in ani other whether by the continu export of those metal a trade of thi kind is like to impoverish the countri from which it is carri on in ani other wai i shall have occas to examin at great length hereaft that part of the capit of ani countri which is emploi in the carri trade is altogeth withdrawn from support the product labour of that particular countri to support that of some foreign countri though it mai replac by everi oper two distinct capit yet neither of them belong to that particular countri the capit of the dutch merchant which carri the corn of poland to portug and bring back the fruit and wine of portug to poland replac by everi such oper two capit neither of which had been emploi in support the product labour of holland but on of them in support that of poland and the other that of portug the profit onli return regularli to

countri it doe not howev seem essenti to the natur of the trade that it should be so a dutch merchant mai for exampl emploi hi capit in transact the commerc of poland and portug by carri part of the surplu produc of the on to the other not in dutch but in british bottom it mayb presum that he actual doe so upon some particular occas it is upon thi account howev that the carri trade ha been suppos peculiarli advantag to such a countri as great britain of which the defenc and secur depend upon the number of it sailor and ship but the same capit mai emploi as mani sailor and ship either in the foreign trade of consumpt or even in the home trade when carri on by coast vessel as it could in the carri trade the number of sailor and ship which ani particular capit can emploi doe not depend upon the natur of the trade but partli upon the bulk of the good in proport to their valu and partli upon the distanc of the port between which thei ar to be carri chiefli upon the former of those two circumst the coal trade from newcastl to london for exampl emploi more ship than all the carri trade of england though the port ar at no great distanc to forc therefor by extraordinari encourag a larger share of the capit of ani countri into the carri trade than what would natur go to it will not alwai necessarili increas the ship of that countri the capit therefor emploi in the home trade of ani countri will gener give encourag and support to a greater quantiti of product labour in that countri and increas the valu of it annual produc more than an equal capit emploi in the foreign trade of consumpt and the capit emploi in thi latter trade ha in both these respect a still greater advantag over an equal capit emploi in the carri trade the rich and so far as power depend upon rich the power of everi countri must alwai be in proport to the valu of it annual produc the fund from which all tax must ultim be paid but the great object of the polit economi of everi countri is to increas the rich and power of that countri it ought therefor to give no prefer nor superior encourag to the foreign trade of consumpt abov the home trade nor to the carri trade abov either of the other two it ought neither to forc nor to allur into either of those two channel a greater share of the capit of the countri than what would natur flow into them of it own accord each of those differ branch of

trade which ar carri on in town so great an advantag over that which is carri on in the countri that privat person frequent find it more for their advantag to emploi their capit in the most distant carri trade of asia and america than in the improv and cultiv of the most fertil field in their own neighbourhood i shall endeavour to explain at full length in the two follow book book iii of the

veri properli be said to gain it whole wealth and subsist from the countri we must not howev upon thi account imagin that the gain of the town is the loss of the countri the gain of both ar mutual and

greater quantiti of manufactur good with the produc of a much smaller quantiti of their own labour than thei must have emploi had thei attempt to prepar them themselv the town afford a market for the surplu produc of the countri or what is over and abov the mainten of the cultiv and it is there that the inhabit of the countri exchang it for someth els which is in demand among them the greater the number and revenu of the inhabit of the town the more extens is the market which it afford to those of the countri and the more extens that market it is alwai the more advantag to a great number the corn which grow within a mile of the town sell there for the same price with that which come from twenti mile distanc but the price of the latter must gener not onli pai the expens of rais it and bring it to market but afford too the ordinari profit of agricultur to the farmer the proprietor and cultiv of the countri therefor which li in the neighbourhood of the town over and abov the ordinari profit of agricultur gain in the price of what thei sell the whole valu of the carriag of the like produc that is brought from more distant part and thei save besid the whole valu of thi carriag in

the countri is benefit by the commerc of the town among all the absurd specul that have been propag concern the balanc of trade it ha never been pretend that either the countri lose by it commerc with the town or the town by that with the countri which maintain it as subsist is in the natur of thing prior to conveni and luxuri so the industri which procur the former must necessarili be prior to

in which thei were situat could support till such time at least as the whole of that territori wa complet cultiv and improv upon equal or nearli equal profit most men will choos to emploi their capit rather in the improv and cultiv of land than either in manufactur or in foreign trade the man who emploi hi capit in land ha it more under hi view and command and hi fortun is much less liabl to accid

differ ag and nation ha given occas to two differ system of polit economi with regard to enrich the peopl the on mai be call the system of commerc the other that of agricultur i shall endeavour to explain both as fulli and distinctli as i can and shall begin with the system of commerc it is the modern system and is best understood in our own countri and in our own time chapter i of the principl of the commerci or mercantil system that wealth consist in monei or in gold and silver is a popular notion which natur aris from the doubl function of monei as the instrument of commerc and as the measur of valu in consequ of it be the instrument of commerc when we have monei we can more readili obtain whatev els we have occas for than by mean of ani other commod the great affair we alwai find is to get monei when that is obtain there is no difficulti in make ani subsequ purchas in consequ of it be the measur of valu we estim that of all other commod by the quantiti of monei which thei will exchang for we sai of a rich man that he is worth a great deal and of a poor man that he is worth veri littl monei a frugal man or a man eager to be rich is said to love monei and a careless a gener or a profus man is said to be indiffer about it to grow rich is to get monei and wealth and monei in short ar in common languag consid as in everi respect synonym a rich countri in the same manner as a rich man is suppos to be a countri abound in monei and to heap up gold and silver in ani countri is suppos to be the readiest wai to enrich it for some time after the discoveri of america the first inquiri of the spaniard when thei arriv upon ani unknown coast us to be if there wa ani gold or silver to be found in the neighbourhood by the inform which thei receiv thei judg whether it wa worth while to make a settlement there or if the countri wa worth the conquer plano carpino a monk sent ambassador from the king of franc to on of the son of the famou gengi khan sai that the tartar us frequent to ask him if there wa plenti of sheep and oxen in the kingdom of franc their inquiri had the same object with that of the spaniard thei want to know if the countri wa rich enough to be worth the conquer among the tartar as among all other nation of shepherd who ar gener ignor of the us of monei cattl ar the instrument of commerc and the measur of valu wealth therefor accord to them consist in cattl as accord to the spaniard it consist in gold and silver of the two the tartar notion perhap wa the nearest to the truth mr lock remark a distinct between monei and other moveabl good all other moveabl good he sai ar of so consum a natur that the wealth which consist in them cannot be much depend on and a nation which abound in them on year mai without ani export but mere by their own wast and extravag be in great want of them the next monei on the contrari is a steadi friend which though it mai travel about from hand to hand yet if it can be kept from go out of the countri is not veri liabl to be wast and consum gold and silver therefor ar accord to him the must solid and substanti part of the moveabl wealth of a nation and to multipli those metal ought he think upon that account to be the great object of it polit economi other admit that if a nation could be separ from all the world it would be of no consequ how much or how littl monei circul in it the consum good which were circul by mean of thi monei would onli be exchang for a greater or a smaller number of piec but the real wealth or poverti of the countri thei allow would depend altogeth upon the abund or scarciti of those consum good but it is otherwis thei think with countri which have connect with foreign nation and which ar oblig to carri on foreign war and to maintain fleet and armi in distant countri thi thei sai cannot be done but by send abroad monei to pai them with and a nation cannot send much monei abroad unless it ha a good deal at home everi such nation therefor must endeavour in time of peac to accumul gold and silver that when occas requir it mai have wherewith to carri on foreign war in consequ of those popular notion all the differ nation of europ have studi though to littl purpos everi possibl mean of accumul gold and silver in their respect countri spain and portug the proprietor of the princip mine which suppli europ with those metal have either prohibit their export under the severest penalti or subject it to a consider duti the like prohibit seem ancient to have made a part of the polici of most other european nation it is even to be found where we should least of all expect to find it in some old scotch act of parliament which forbid under heavi penalti the carri gold or silver forth of the kingdom the like polici ancient took place both in franc and england when those countri becam commerci the merchant found thi prohibit upon mani occas extrem inconveni thei could frequent bui more advantag with gold and silver than with ani other commod the foreign good which thei want either to import into their own or to carri to some other foreign countri thei remonstr therefor against thi prohibit as hurt to trade thei repres first that the export of gold and silver in order to purchas foreign good did not alwai diminish the quantiti of those metal in the kingdom that on the contrari it might frequent increas the quantiti becaus if the consumpt of foreign good wa not therebi increas in the countri those good might be reexport to foreign countri and be there sold for a larg profit might bring back much more treasur than wa origin sent out to purchas them mr mun compar thi oper of foreign trade to the seedtim and harvest of agricultur if we onli behold sai he the action of the husbandman in the seed time when he casteth awai much good corn into the ground we shall account him rather a madman than a husbandman but when we consid hi labour in the harvest which is the end of hi endeavour we shall find the worth and plenti increas of hi action thei repres secondli that thi prohibit could not hinder the export of gold and silver which on account of the small of their bulk in proport to their valu could easili be smuggl abroad that thi export could onli be prevent by a proper attent to what thei call the balanc of trade that when the countri export to a greater valu than it import a balanc becam due to it from foreign nation which wa necessarili paid to it in gold and silver and therebi increas the quantiti of those metal in the kingdom but that when it import to a greater valu than it export a contrari balanc becam due to foreign nation which wa necessarili paid to them in the same manner and therebi diminish that quantiti that in thi case to prohibit the export of those metal could not prevent it but onli by make it more danger render it more expens that the exchang wa therebi turn more against the countri which ow the balanc than it otherwis might have been the merchant who purchas a bill upon the foreign countri be oblig to pai the banker who sold it not onli for the natur risk troubl and expens of send the monei thither but for the extraordinari risk aris from the prohibit but that the more the exchang wa against ani countri the more the balanc of trade becam necessarili against it the monei of that countri becom necessarili of so much less valu in comparison with that of the countri to which the balanc wa due that if the exchang between england and holland for exampl wa five per cent against england it would requir ounc of silver in england to purchas a bill for ounc of silver in holland that ounc of silver in england therefor would be worth onli ounc of silver in holland and would purchas onli a proportion quantiti of dutch good but that ounc of silver in holland on the contrari would be worth ounc in england and would purchas a proportion quantiti of english good that the english good which were sold to holland would be sold so much cheaper and the dutch good which were sold to england so much dearer by the differ of the exchang that the on would draw so much less dutch monei to england and the other so much more english monei to holland as thi differ amount to and that the balanc of trade therefor would necessarili be so much more against england and would requir a greater balanc of gold and silver to be export to holland those argument were partli solid and partli sophist thei were solid so far as thei assert that the export of gold and silver in trade might frequent be advantag to the countri thei were solid too in assert that no prohibit could prevent their export when privat peopl found ani advantag in export them but thei were sophist in suppos that either to preserv or to augment the quantiti of those metal requir more the attent of govern than to preserv or to augment the quantiti of ani other us commod which the freedom of trade without ani such attent never fail to suppli in the proper quantiti thei were sophist too perhap in assert that the high price of exchang necessarili increas what thei call the unfavour balanc of trade or occas the export of a greater quantiti of gold and silver that high price inde wa extrem disadvantag to the merchant who had ani monei to pai in foreign countri thei paid so much dearer for the bill which their banker grant them upon those countri but though the risk aris from the prohibit might occas some extraordinari expens to the banker it would not necessarili carri ani more monei out of the countri thi expens would gener be all laid out in the countri in smuggl the monei out of it and could seldom occas the export of a singl sixpenc beyond the precis sum drawn for the high price of exchang too would natur dispos the merchant to endeavour to make their export nearli balanc their import in order that thei might have thi high exchang to pai upon as small a sum as possibl the high price of exchang besid must necessarili have oper as a tax in rais the price of foreign good and therebi diminish their consumpt it would tend therefor not to increas but to diminish what thei call the unfavour balanc of trade and consequ the export of gold and silver such as thei were howev those argument convinc the peopl to whom thei were address thei were address by merchant to parliament and to the council of princ to nobl and to countri gentlemen by those who were suppos to understand trade to those who were consciou to them selv that thei knew noth about the matter that foreign trade enrich the countri experi demonstr to the nobl and countri gentlemen as well as to the merchant but how or in what manner none of them well knew the merchant knew perfectli in what manner it enrich themselv it wa their busi to know it but to know in what manner it enrich the countri wa no part of their busi the subject never came into their consider but when thei had occas to appli to their countri for some chang in the law relat to foreign trade it then becam necessari to sai someth about the benefici effect of foreign trade and the manner in which those effect were obstruct by the law as thei then stood to the judg who were to decid the busi it appear a most satisfactori account of the matter when thei were told that foreign trade brought monei into the countri but that the law in question hinder it from bring so much as it otherwis would do those argument therefor produc the wishedfor effect the prohibit of export gold and silver wa in franc and england confin to the coin of those respect countri the export of foreign coin and of bullion wa made free in holland and in some other place thi liberti wa extend even to the coin of the countri the attent of govern wa turn awai from guard against the export of gold and silver to watch over the balanc of trade as the onli caus which could occas ani augment or diminut of those metal from on fruitless care it wa turn awai to anoth care much more intric much more embarrass and just equal fruitless the titl of mun book england treasur in foreign trade becam a fundament maxim in the polit economi not of england onli but of all other commerci countri the inland or home trade the most import of all the trade in which an equal capit afford the greatest revenu and creat the greatest employ to the peopl of the countri wa consid as subsidiari onli to foreign trade it neither brought monei into the countri it wa said nor carri ani out of it the countri therefor could never becom either richer or poorer by mean of it except so far as it prosper or decai might indirectli influenc the state of foreign trade a countri that ha no mine of it own must undoubtedli draw it gold and silver from foreign countri in the same manner as on that ha no vineyard of it own must draw it wine it doe not seem necessari howev that the attent of govern should be more turn toward the on than toward the other object a countri that ha wherewith to bui wine will alwai get the wine which it ha occas for and a countri that ha wherewith to bui gold and silver will never be in want of those metal thei ar to be bought for a certain price like all other commod and as thei ar the price of all other commod so all other commod ar the price of those metal we trust with perfect secur that the freedom of trade without ani attent of govern will alwai suppli us with the wine which we have occas for and we mai trust with equal secur that it will alwai suppli us with all the gold and silver which we can afford to purchas or to emploi either in circul our commod or in other us the quantiti of everi commod which human industri can either purchas or produc natur regul itself in everi countri accord to the effectu demand or accord to the demand of those who ar will to pai the whole rent labour and profit which must be paid in order to prepar and bring it to market but no commod regul themselv more easili or more exactli accord to thi effectu demand than gold and silver becaus on account of the small bulk and great valu of those metal no commod can be more easili transport from on place to anoth from the place where thei ar cheap to those where thei ar dear from the place where thei exce to those where thei fall short of thi effectu demand if there were in england for exampl an effectu demand for an addit quantiti of gold a packetboat could bring from lisbon or from wherev els it wa to be had fifti ton of gold which could be coin into more than five million of guinea but if there were an effectu demand for grain to the same valu to import it would requir at five guinea aton a million of ton of ship or a thousand ship of a thousand ton each the navi of england would not be suffici when the quantiti of gold and silver import into ani countri exce the effectu demand no vigil of govern can prevent their export all the sanguinari law of spain and portug ar not abl to keep their gold and silver at home the continu import from peru and brazil exce the effectu demand of those countri and sink the price of those metal there below that in the neighbour countri if on the contrari in ani particular countri their quantiti fell short of the effectu demand so as to rais their price abov that of the neighbour countri the govern would have no occas to take ani pain to import them if it were even to take pain to prevent their import it would not be abl to effectu it those metal when the spartan had got wherewith to purchas them broke through all the barrier which the law of lycurgu oppos to their entranc into lacedaemon all the sanguinari law of the custom ar not abl to prevent the import of the tea of the dutch and gottenburg east india compani becaus somewhat cheaper than those of the british compani a pound of tea howev is about a hundr time the bulk of on of the highest price sixteen shill that is commonli paid for it in silver and more than two thousand time the bulk of the same price in gold and consequ just so mani time more difficult to smuggl it is partli ow to the easi transport of gold and silver from the place where thei abound to those where thei ar want that the price of those metal doe not fluctuat continu like that of the greater part of other commod which ar hinder by their bulk from shift their situat when the market happen to be either over or understock with them the price of those metal inde is not altogeth exempt from variat but the chang to which it is liabl ar gener slow gradual and uniform in europ for exampl it is suppos without much foundat perhap that dure the cours of the present and preced centuri thei have been constantli but gradual sink in their valu on account of the continu import from the spanish west indi but to make ani sudden chang in the price of gold and silver so as to rais or lower at onc sensibl and remark the monei price of all other commod requir such a revolut in commerc as that occas by the discoveri of america if not withstand all thi gold and silver should at ani time fall short in a countri which ha wherewith to purchas them there ar more expedi for suppli their place than that of almost ani other commod if the materi of manufactur ar want industri must stop if provis ar want the peopl must starv but if monei is want barter will suppli it place though with a good deal of inconveni bui and sell upon credit and the differ dealer compens their credit with on anoth onc amonth or onc ayear will suppli it with less inconveni a wellregul papermonei will suppli it not onli without ani inconveni but in some case with some advantag upon everi account therefor the attent of govern never wa so unnecessarili emploi as when direct to watch over the preserv or increas of the quantiti of monei in ani countri no complaint howev is more common than that of a scarciti of monei monei like wine must alwai be scarc with those who have neither wherewith to bui it nor credit to borrow it those who have either will seldom be in want either of the monei or of the wine which thei have occas for thi complaint howev of the scarciti of monei is not alwai confin to improvid spendthrift it is sometim gener through a whole mercantil town and the countri in it neighbourhood overtrad is the common caus of it sober men whose project have been disproport to their capit ar as like to have neither wherewith to bui monei nor credit to borrow it as prodig whose expens ha been disproport to their revenu befor their project can be brought to bear their stock is gone and their credit with it thei run about everywher to borrow monei and everybodi tell them that thei have none to lend even such gener complaint of the scarciti of monei do not alwai prove that the usual number of gold and silver piec ar not circul in the countri but that mani peopl want those piec who have noth to give for them when the profit of trade happen to be greater than ordinari overtrad becom a gener error both among great and small dealer thei do not alwai send more monei abroad than usual but thei bui upon credit both at home and abroad an unusu quantiti of good which thei send to some distant market in hope that the return will come in befor the demand for payment the demand come befor the return and thei have noth at hand with which thei can either purchas monei or give solid secur for borrow it is not ani scarciti of gold and silver but the difficulti which such peopl find in borrow and which their creditor find in get payment that occas the gener complaint of the scarciti of monei it would be too ridicul to go about serious to prove that wealth doe not consist in monei or in gold and silver but in what monei purchas and is valuabl onli for purchas monei no doubt make alwai a part of the nation capit but it ha alreadi been shown that it gener make but a small part and alwai the most unprofit part of it it is not becaus wealth consist more essenti in monei than in good that the merchant find it gener more easi to bui good with monei than to bui monei with good but becaus monei is the known and establish instrument of commerc for which everi thing is readili given in exchang but which is not alwai with equal readi to be got in exchang for everi thing the greater part of good besid ar more perish than monei and he mai frequent sustain a much greater loss by keep them when hi good ar upon hand too he is more liabl to such demand for monei as he mai not be abl to answer than when he ha got their price in hi coffer over and abov all thi hi profit aris more directli from sell than from bui and he is upon all these account gener much more anxiou to exchang hi good for monei than hi monei for good but though a particular merchant with abund of good in hi warehous mai sometim be ruin by not be abl to sell them in time a nation or countri is not liabl to the same accid the whole capit of a merchant frequent consist in perish good destin for purchas monei but it is but a veri small part of the annual produc of the land and labour of a countri which can ever be destin for purchas gold and silver from their neighbour the far greater part is circul and consum among themselv and even of the surplu which is sent abroad the greater part is gener destin for the purchas of other foreign good though gold and silver therefor could not be had in exchang for the good destin to purchas them the nation would not be ruin it might inde suffer some loss and inconveni and be forc upon some of those expedi which ar necessari for suppli the place of monei the annual produc of it land and labour howev would be the same or veri nearli the same as usual becaus the same or veri nearli the same consum capit would be emploi in maintain it and though good do not alwai draw monei so readili as monei draw good in the longrun thei draw it more necessarili than even it draw them good can serv mani other purpos besid purchas monei but monei can serv no other purpos besid purchas good monei therefor necessarili run after good but good do not alwai or necessarili run after monei the man who bui doe not alwai mean to sell again but frequent to us or to consum wherea he who sell alwai mean to bui again the on mai frequent have done the whole but the other can never have done more than the on half of hi busi it is not for it own sake that men desir monei but for the sake of what thei can purchas with it consum commod it is said ar soon destroi wherea gold and silver ar of a more durabl natur and were it not for thi continu export might be accumul for ag togeth to the incred augment of the real wealth of the countri noth therefor it is pretend can be more disadvantag to ani countri than the trade which consist in the exchang of such last for such perish commod we do not howev reckon that trade disadvantag which consist in the exchang of the hardwar of england for the wine of franc and yet hardwar is a veri durabl commod and were it not for thi continu export might too be accumul for ag togeth to the incred augment of the pot and pan of the countri but it readili occur that the number of such utensil is in everi countri necessarili limit by the us which there is for them that it would be absurd to have more pot and pan than were necessari for cook the victual usual consum there and that if the quantiti of victual were to increas the number of pot and pan would readili increas along with it a part of the increas quantiti of victual be emploi in purchas them or in maintain an addit number of workmen whose busi it wa to make them it should as readili occur that the quantiti of gold and silver is in everi countri limit by the us which there is for those metal that their us consist in circul commod as coin and in afford a speci of household furnitur as plate that the quantiti of coin in everi countri is regul by the valu of the commod which ar to be circul by it increas that valu and immedi a part of it will be sent abroad to purchas wherev it is to be had the addit quantiti of coin requisit for circul them that the quantiti of plate is regul by the number and wealth of those privat famili who choos to indulg themselv in that sort of magnific increas the number and wealth of such famili and a part of thi increas wealth will most probabl be emploi in purchas wherev it is to be found an addit quantiti of plate that to attempt to increas the wealth of ani countri either by introduc or by detain in it an unnecessari quantiti of gold and silver is as absurd as it would be to attempt to increas the good cheer of privat famili by oblig them to keep an unnecessari number of kitchen utensil as the expens of purchas those unnecessari utensil would diminish instead of increas either the quantiti or good of the famili provis so the expens of purchas an unnecessari quantiti of gold and silver must in everi countri as necessarili diminish the wealth which feed cloth and lodg which maintain and emploi the peopl gold and silver whether in the shape of coin or of plate ar utensil it must be rememb as much as the furnitur of the kitchen increas the us of them increas the consum commod which ar to be circul manag and prepar by mean of them and you will infal increas the quantiti but if you attempt by extraordinari mean to increas the quantiti you will as infal diminish the us and even the quantiti too which in those metal can never be greater than what the us requir were thei ever to be accumul beyond thi quantiti their transport is so easi and the loss which attend their ly idl and unemploi so great that no law could prevent their be immedi sent out of the countri it is not alwai necessari to accumul gold and silver in order to enabl a countri to carri on foreign war and to maintain fleet and armi in distant countri fleet and armi ar maintain not with gold and silver but with consum good the nation which from the annual produc of it domest industri from the annual revenu aris out of it land and labour and consum stock ha wherewith to purchas those consum good in

ha hitherto increas them so littl is probabl ow to the restraint which it everywher labour under i thought it necessari though at the hazard of be tediou to examin at full length thi popular notion that wealth consist in monei or in gold and silver monei in common languag as i have alreadi observ frequent signifi wealth and thi ambigu of express ha render thi popular notion so familiar to us that even thei who ar convinc of it absurd ar veri apt to forget their own principl and in the cours of their reason to take it for grant as a certain and undeni truth some of the best english writer upon commerc set out with observ that the wealth of a countri consist not in it gold and silver onli but in it land hous and consum good of all differ kind in the cours of their reason howev the land hous and consum good seem to slip out of their memori and the strain of their argument frequent suppos that all wealth consist in gold and silver and that to multipli those metal is the great object of nation industri and commerc the two principl be establish howev that wealth consist in gold and silver and that those metal could be brought into a countri which had no mine onli by the balanc of trade or by export to a greater valu than it import it necessarili becam the great object of polit economi to diminish as much as possibl the import of foreign good for home consumpt and to increas as much as possibl the export of the produc of domest industri it two great engin for enrich the countri therefor were restraint upon import and encourag to export the restraint upon import were of two kind first restraint upon the import of such foreign good for home consumpt as could be produc at home from whatev countri thei were import secondli restraint upon the import of good of almost all kind from those particular countri with which the balanc of trade wa suppos to be disadvantag those differ restraint consist sometim in high duti and sometim in absolut prohibit export wa encourag sometim by drawback sometim by bounti sometim by advantag treati of commerc with foreign state and sometim by the establish of coloni in distant countri drawback were given upon two differ occas when the home manufactur were subject to ani duti or excis either the whole or a part of it wa frequent drawn back upon their export and when foreign good liabl to a duti were import in order to be export again either the whole or a part of thi duti wa sometim given back upon such export bounti were given for the encourag either of some begin manufactur or of such sort of industri of other kind as were suppos to deserv particular favour by advantag treati of commerc particular privileg were procur in some foreign state for the good and merchant of the countri beyond what were grant to those of other countri by the establish of coloni in distant countri not onli particular privileg but a monopoli wa frequent procur for the good and merchant of the countri which establish them the two sort of restraint upon import abov mention togeth with these four encourag to export constitut the six princip mean by which the commerci system propos to increas the quantiti of gold and silver in ani countri by turn the balanc of trade in it favour i shall consid each of them in a particular chapter and without take much farther notic of their suppos tendenc to bring monei into the countri i shall examin chiefli what ar like to be the effect of each of them upon the annual produc of it industri accord as thei tend either to increas or diminish the valu of thi annual produc thei must evid tend either to increas or diminish the real wealth and revenu of the countri chapter ii of restraint upon import from foreign countri of such good as can be produc at home by restrain either by high duti or by absolut prohibit the import of such good from foreign countri as can be produc at home the monopoli of the home market is more or less secur to the domest industri emploi in produc them thu the prohibit of import either live cattl or salt provis from foreign countri secur to the grazier of great britain the monopoli of the home market for butcher meat the high duti upon the import of corn which in time of moder plenti amount to a prohibit give a like advantag to the grower of that commod the prohibit of the import of foreign woollen is equal favour to the woollen manufactur the silk manufactur though altogeth emploi upon foreign materi ha late obtain the same advantag the linen manufactur ha not yet obtain it but is make great stride toward it mani other sort of manufactur have in the same manner obtain in great britain either altogeth or veri nearli a monopoli against their countrymen the varieti of good of which the import into great britain is prohibit either absolut or under certain circumst greatli exce what can easili be suspect by those who ar not well acquaint with the law of the custom that thi monopoli of the home market frequent give great encourag to that particular speci of industri which enjoi it and frequent turn toward that employ a greater share of both the labour and stock of the societi than would otherwis have gone to it cannot be doubt but whether it tend either to increas the gener industri of the societi or to give it the most advantag direct is not perhap altogeth so evid the gener industri of the societi can never exce what the capit of the societi can emploi as the number of workmen that can be kept in employ by ani particular person must bear a certain proport to hi capit so the number of those that can be continu emploi by all the member of a great societi must bear a certain proport to the whole capit of the societi and never can exce that proport no regul of commerc can increas the quantiti of industri in ani societi beyond what it capit can maintain it can onli divert a part of it into a direct into which it might not otherwis have gone and it is by no mean certain that thi artifici direct is like to be more advantag to the societi than that into which it would have gone of it own accord everi individu is continu exert himself to find out the most advantag employ for whatev capit he can command it is hi own advantag inde and not that of the societi which he ha in view but the studi of hi own advantag natur or rather necessarili lead him to prefer that employ which is most advantag to the societi first everi individu endeavour to emploi hi capit as near home as he can and consequ as much as he can in the support of domest industri provid alwai that he can therebi obtain the ordinari or not a great deal less than the ordinari profit of stock thu upon equal or nearli equal profit everi wholesal merchant natur prefer the home trade to the foreign trade of consumpt and the foreign trade of consumpt to the carri trade in the home trade hi capit is never so long out of hi sight as it frequent is in the foreign trade of consumpt he can know better the charact and situat of the person whom he trust and if he should happen to be deceiv he know better the law of the countri from which he must seek redress in the carri trade the capit of the merchant is as it were divid between two foreign countri and no part of it is ever necessarili brought home or place under hi own immedi view and command the capit which an amsterdam merchant emploi in carri corn from koningsberg to lisbon and fruit and wine from lisbon to koningsberg must gener be the on half of it at koningsberg and the other half at lisbon no part of it need ever come to amsterdam the natur resid of such a merchant should either be at koningsberg or lisbon and it can onli be some veri particular circumst which can make him prefer the resid of amsterdam the uneasi howev which he feel at be separ so far from hi capit gener determin him to bring part both of the koningsberg good which he destin for the market of lisbon and of the lisbon good which he destin for that of koningsberg to amsterdam and though thi necessarili subject him to a doubl charg of load and unload as well as to the payment of some duti and custom yet for the sake of have some part of hi capit alwai under hi own view and command he willingli submit to thi extraordinari charg and it is in thi manner that everi countri which ha ani consider share of the carri trade becom alwai the emporium or gener market for the good of all the differ countri whose trade it carri on the merchant in order to save a second load and unload endeavour alwai to sell in the home market as much of the good of all those differ countri as he can and thu so far as he can to convert hi carri trade into a foreign trade of consumpt a merchant in the same manner who is engag in the foreign trade of consumpt when he collect good for foreign market will alwai be glad upon equal or nearli equal profit to sell as great a part of them at home as he can he save himself the risk and troubl of export when so far as he can he thu convert hi foreign trade of consumpt into a home trade home is in thi manner the centr if i mai sai so round which the capit of the inhabit of everi countri ar continu circul and toward which thei ar alwai tend though by particular caus thei mai sometim be driven off and repel from it toward more distant employ but a capit emploi in the home trade it ha alreadi been shown necessarili put into motion a greater quantiti of domest industri and give revenu and employ to a greater number of the inhabit of the countri than an equal capit emploi in the foreign trade of consumpt and on emploi in the foreign trade of consumpt ha the same advantag over an equal capit emploi in the carri trade upon equal or onli nearli equal profit therefor everi individu natur inclin to emploi hi capit in the manner in which it is like to afford the greatest support to domest industri and to give revenu and employ to the greatest number of peopl of hi own countri secondli everi individu who emploi hi capit in the support of domest industri necessarili endeavour so to direct that industri that it produc mai be of the greatest possibl valu the produc of industri is what it add to the subject or materi upon which it is

and he will alwai therefor endeavour to emploi it in the support of that industri of which the produc is like to be of the greatest valu or to exchang for the greatest quantiti either of monei or of

necessarili labour to render the annual revenu of the societi as great as he can he gener inde neither intend to promot the public interest nor know how much he is promot it by prefer the support of

mani other case led by an invis hand to promot an end which wa no part of hi intent nor is it alwai the wors for the societi that it wa no part of it by pursu hi own interest he frequent promot that of the societi more effectu than when he realli intend to promot it i have never known much good done by those who affect to trade for the public good it is an affect inde not veri common among merchant and veri few word need be emploi in dissuad them from it what is the speci of domest industri which hi capit can emploi and of which the produc is like to be of the greatest valu everi individu it is evid can in hi local situat judg much better than ani statesman or lawgiv can do for him the statesman who should attempt to direct privat peopl in what manner thei ought to emploi their capit would not onli load himself with a most unnecessari attent but assum an author which could safe be trust not onli to no singl person but to no council or senat whatev and which would nowher be so danger as in the hand of a man who had folli and presumpt enough to fanci himself fit to exercis it to give the monopoli of the home market to the produc of domest industri in ani particular art or manufactur is in some measur to direct privat peopl in what manner thei ought to emploi their capit and must in almost all case be either a useless or a hurt regul if the produc of domest can be brought there as cheap as that of foreign industri the regul is evid useless if it cannot it must gener be hurt it is the maxim of everi prudent master of a famili never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to bui the tailor doe not attempt to make hi own shoe but bui them of the shoemak the shoemak doe not attempt to make hi own cloth but emploi a

privat famili can scarc be folli in that of a great kingdom if a foreign countri can suppli us with a commod cheaper than we ourselv can make it better bui it of them with some part of the produc of our own industri emploi in a wai in which we have some advantag the gener industri of the countri be alwai in proport to the capit which emploi it will not therebi be diminish no more than that of the

which it can bui cheaper than it can make the valu of it annual produc is certainli more or less diminish when it is thu turn awai from produc commod evid of more valu than the commod which it is direct to produc accord to the supposit that commod could be purchas from foreign countri cheaper than it can be made at home it could therefor have been purchas with a part onli of the commod or what is the same thing with a part onli of the price of the commod which the industri emploi by an equal capit would have produc at home had it been left to follow it natur cours the industri of the countri therefor is thu turn awai from a more to a less advantag employ and the exchang valu of it annual produc instead of be increas accord to the intent of the lawgiv must necessarili be diminish by everi such regul by mean of such regul inde a particular manufactur mai sometim be acquir sooner than it could have been otherwis and after a certain time mai be made at home as cheap or cheaper than in the foreign countri but though the industri of the societi mai be thu carri with advantag into a particular channel sooner than it could have been otherwis it will by no mean follow that the sumtot either of it industri or of it revenu can ever be augment by ani such regul the industri of the societi can augment onli in proport as it capit augment and it capit can augment onli in proport to what can be gradual save out of it revenu but the immedi effect of everi such regul is to diminish it revenu and what diminish it revenu is certainli not veri like to augment it capit faster than it would have augment of it own accord had both capit and industri been left to find out their natur employ though for want of such regul the societi should never acquir the propos manufactur it would not upon that account necessarili be the poorer in anyon period of it durat in everi period of it durat it whole capit and industri might still have been emploi though upon differ object in the manner that wa most advantag at the time in everi period it revenu might have been the greatest which it capit could afford and both capit and revenu might have been augment with the greatest possibl rapid the natur advantag which on countri ha over anoth in produc particular commod ar sometim so great that it is acknowledg by all the world to be in vain to struggl with them by mean of glass hotb and hotwal veri good grape can be rais in scotland and veri good wine too can be made of them at about thirti time the expens for which at least equal good can be brought from foreign countri would it be a reason law to prohibit the import of all foreign wine mere to encourag the make of claret and burgundi in scotland but if there would be a manifest absurd in turn toward ani employ thirti time more of the capit and industri of the countri than would be necessari to purchas from foreign countri an equal quantiti of the commod want there must be an absurd though not altogeth so glare yet exactli of the same kind in turn toward ani such employ a thirtieth or even a three hundredth part more of either whether the advantag which on countri ha over anoth be natur or acquir is in thi respect of no consequ as long as the on countri ha those advantag and the other want them it will alwai be more advantag for the latter rather to bui of the former than to make it is an acquir advantag onli which on artific ha over hi neighbour who exercis anoth trade and yet thei both find it more advantag to bui of on anoth than to make what doe not belong to their particular trade merchant and manufactur ar the peopl who deriv the greatest advantag from thi monopoli of the home market the prohibit of the import of foreign cattl and of salt provis togeth with the high duti upon foreign corn which in time of moder plenti amount to a prohibit ar not near so advantag to the grazier and farmer of great britain as other regul of the same kind ar to it merchant and manufactur manufactur those of the finer kind especi ar more easili transport from on countri to anoth than corn or cattl it is in the fetch and carri manufactur accordingli that foreign trade is chiefli emploi in manufactur a veri small advantag will enabl foreign to undersel our own workmen even in the home market it will requir a veri great on to enabl them to do so in the rude produc of the soil if the free import of foreign manufactur were permit sever of the home manufactur would probabl suffer and some of them perhap go to ruin altogeth and a consider part of the stock and industri at present emploi in them would be forc to find out some other employ but the freest import of the rude produc of the soil could have no such effect upon the agricultur of the countri if the import of foreign cattl for exampl were made ever so free so few could be import that the graze trade of great britain could be littl affect by it live cattl ar perhap the onli commod of which the transport is more expens by sea than by land by land thei carri themselv to market by sea not onli the cattl but their food and their water too must be carri at no small expens and inconveni the short sea between ireland and great britain inde render the import of irish cattl more easi but though the free import of them which wa late permit onli for a limit time were render perpetu it could have no consider effect upon the interest of the grazier of great britain those part of great britain which border upon the irish sea ar all graze countri irish cattl could never be import for their us but must be drove through those veri extens countri at no small expens and inconveni befor thei could arriv at their proper market fat cattl could not be drove so far lean cattl therefor could onli be import and such import could interfer not with the interest of the feed or fatten countri to which by reduc the price of lean cattl it would rather be advantag but with that of the breed countri onli the small number of irish cattl import sinc their import wa permit togeth with the good price at which lean cattl still continu to sell seem to demonstr that even the breed countri of great britain ar never like to be much affect by the free import of irish cattl the common peopl of ireland inde ar said to have sometim oppos with violenc the export of their cattl but if the export had found ani great advantag in continu the trade thei could easili when the law wa on their side have conquer thi mobbish opposit feed and fatten countri besid must alwai be highli improv wherea breed countri ar gener uncultiv the high price of lean cattl by augment the valu of uncultiv land is like a bounti against improv to ani countri which wa highli improv throughout it would be more advantag to import it lean cattl than to breed them the provinc of holland accordingli is said to follow thi maxim at present the mountain of scotland wale and northumberland inde ar countri not capabl of much improv and seem destin by natur to be the breed countri of great britain the freest import of foreign cattl could have no other effect than to hinder those breed countri from take advantag of the increas popul and improv of the rest of the kingdom from rais their price to an exorbit height and from lai a real tax upon all the more improv and cultiv part of the countri the freest import of salt provis in the same manner could have as littl effect upon the interest of the grazier of great britain as that of live cattl salt provis ar not onli a veri bulki commod but when compar with fresh meat thei ar a commod both of wors qualiti and as thei cost more labour and expens of higher price thei could never therefor come into competit with the fresh meat though thei might with the salt provis of the countri thei might be us for victual ship for distant voyag and such like us but could never make ani consider part of the food of the peopl the small quantiti of salt provis import from ireland sinc their import wa render free is an experiment proof that our grazier have noth to apprehend from it it doe not appear that the price of butcher meat ha ever been sensibl affect by it even the free import of foreign corn could veri littl affect the interest of the farmer of great britain corn is a much more bulki commod than butcher meat a pound of wheat at a penni is as dear as a pound of butcher meat at fourpenc the small quantiti of foreign corn import even in time of the greatest scarciti mai satisfi our farmer that thei can have noth to fear from the freest import the averag quantiti import on year with anoth amount onli accord to the veri well inform author of the tract upon the corn trade to quarter of all sort of grain and doe not exce the five hundredth and seventyon part of the annual consumpt but as the bounti upon corn occas a greater export in year of plenti so it must of consequ occas a greater import in year of scarciti than in the actual state of tillag would otherwis take place by mean of it the plenti of on year doe not compens the scarciti of anoth and as the averag quantiti export is necessarili augment by it so must likewis in the actual state of tillag the averag quantiti import if there were no bounti as less corn would be export suit is probabl that on year with anoth less would be import than at present the cornmerch the fetcher and carrier of corn between great britain and foreign countri would have much less employ and might suffer consider but the countri gentlemen and farmer could suffer veri littl it is in the cornmerch accordingli rather than the countri gentlemen and farmer that i have observ the greatest anxieti for the renew and continu of the bounti countri gentlemen and farmer ar to their great honour of all peopl the least subject to the wretch spirit of monopoli the undertak of a great manufactori is sometim alarm if anoth work of the same kind is establish within twenti mile of him the dutch undertak of the woollen manufactur at abbevil stipul that no work of the same kind should be establish within thirti leagu of that citi farmer and countri gentlemen on the contrari ar gener dispos rather to promot than to obstruct the cultiv and improv of their neighbour farm and estat thei have no secret such as those of the greater part of manufactur but ar gener rather fond of commun to their neighbour and of extend as far as possibl ani new practic which thei mai have found to be advantag piu quaestu sai old cato stabilissimusqu minimequ invidiosu minimequ male cogitant sunt qui in eo studio occupati sunt countri gentlemen and farmer dispers in differ part of the countri cannot so easili combin as merchant and manufactur who be collect into town and accustom to that exclus corpor spirit which prevail in them natur endeavour to obtain against all their countrymen the same exclus privileg which thei gener possess against the inhabit of their respect town thei accordingli seem to have been the origin inventor of those restraint upon the import of foreign good which secur to them the monopoli of the home market it wa probabl in imit of them and to put themselv upon a level with those who thei found were dispos to oppress them that the countri gentlemen and farmer of great britain so far forgot the generos which is natur to their station as to demand the exclus privileg of suppli their countrymen with corn and butcher meat thei did not perhap take time to consid how much less their interest could be affect by the freedom of trade than that of the peopl whose exampl thei follow to prohibit by a perpetu law the import of foreign corn and cattl is in realiti to enact that the popul and industri of the countri shall at no time exce what the rude produc of it own soil can maintain there seem howev to be two case in which it will gener be advantag to lai some burden upon foreign for the encourag of domest industri the first is when some particular sort of industri is necessari for the defenc of the countri the defenc of great britain for exampl depend veri much upon the number of it sailor and ship the act of navig therefor veri properli endeavour to give the sailor and ship of great britain the monopoli of the trade of their own countri in some case by absolut prohibit and in other by heavi burden upon the ship of foreign countri the follow ar the princip disposit of thi act first all ship of which the owner master and threefourth of the marin ar not british subject ar prohibit upon pain of forfeit ship and cargo from trade to the british settlement and plantat or from be emploi in the coast trade of great britain secondli a great varieti of the most bulki articl of import can be brought into great britain onli either in such ship as ar abov describ or in ship of the countri where those good ar produc and of which the owner master and threefourth of the marin ar of that particular countri and when import even in ship of thi latter kind thei ar subject to doubl alien duti if import in ship of ani other countri the penalti is forfeitur of ship and good when thi act wa made the dutch were what thei still ar the great carrier of europ and by thi regul thei were entir exclud from be the carrier to great britain or from import to us the good of ani other european countri thirdli a great varieti of the most bulki articl of import ar prohibit from be import even in british ship from ani countri but that in which thei ar produc under pain of forfeit ship and cargo thi regul too wa probabl intend against the dutch holland wa then as now the great emporium for all european good and by thi regul british ship were hinder from load in holland the good of ani other european countri fourthli salt fish of all kind whale fin whalebon oil and blubber not caught by and cure on board british vessel when import into great britain ar subject to doubl alien duti the dutch as thei ar still the princip were then the onli fisher in europ that attempt to suppli foreign nation with fish by thi regul a veri heavi burden wa laid upon their suppli great britain when the act of navig wa made though england and holland were not actual at war the most violent animos subsist between the two nation it had begun dure the govern of the long parliament which first frame thi act and it broke out soon after in the dutch war dure that of the protector and of charl ii it is not imposs therefor that some of the regul of thi famou act mai have proceed from nation animos thei ar as wise howev as if thei had all been dictat by the most deliber wisdom nation animos at that particular time aim at the veri same object which the most deliber wisdom would have recommend the diminut of the naval power of holland the onli naval power which could endang the secur of england the act of navig is not favour to foreign commerc or to the growth of that opul which can aris from it the interest of a nation in it commerci relat to foreign nation is like that of a merchant with regard to the differ peopl with whom he deal to bui as cheap and to sell as dear as possibl but it will be most like to bui cheap when by the most perfect freedom of trade it encourag all nation to bring to it the good which it ha occas to purchas and for the same reason it will be most like to sell dear when it market ar thu fill with the greatest number of buyer the act of navig it is true lai no burden upon foreign ship that come to export the produc of british industri even the ancient alien duti which us to be paid upon all good export as well as import ha by sever subsequ act been taken off from the greater part of the articl of export but if foreign either by prohibit or high duti ar hinder from come to sell thei cannot alwai afford to come to bui becaus come without a cargo thei must lose the freight from their own countri to great britain by diminish the number of seller therefor we necessarili diminish that of buyer and ar thu like not onli to bui foreign good dearer but to sell our own cheaper than if there wa a more perfect freedom of trade as defenc howev is of much more import than opul the act of navig is perhap the wisest of all the commerci regul of england the second case in which it will gener be advantag to lai some burden upon foreign for the encourag of domest industri is when some tax is impos at home upon the produc of the latter in thi case it seem reason that an equal tax should be impos upon the like produc of the former thi would not give the monopoli of the born market to domest industri nor turn toward a particular employ a greater share of the stock and labour of the countri than what would natur go to it it would onli hinder ani part of what would natur go to it from be turn awai by the tax into a less natur direct and would leav the competit between foreign and domest industri after the tax as nearli as possibl upon the same foot as befor it in great britain when ani such tax is laid upon the produc of domest industri it is usual at the same time in order to stop the clamor complaint of our merchant and manufactur that thei will be undersold at home to lai a much heavier duti upon the import of all foreign good of the same kind thi second limit of the freedom of trade accord to some peopl should upon most occas be extend much farther than to the precis foreign commod which could come into competit with those which had been tax at home when the necessari of life have been tax in ani countri it becom proper thei pretend to tax not onli the like necessari of life import from other countri but all sort of foreign good which can come into competit with ani thing that is the produc of domest industri subsist thei sai becom necessarili dearer in consequ of such tax and the price of labour must alwai rise with the price of the labour subsist everi commod therefor which is the produc of domest industri though not immedi tax itself becom dearer in consequ of such tax becaus the labour which produc it becom so such tax therefor ar realli equival thei sai to a tax upon everi particular commod produc at home in order to put domest upon the same foot with foreign industri therefor it becom necessari thei think to lai some duti upon everi foreign commod equal to thi enhanc of the price of the home commod with which it can come into competit whether tax upon the necessari of life such as those in great britain upon soap salt leather candl etc necessarili rais the price of labour and consequ that of all other commod i shall consid hereaft when i come to treat of tax suppos howev in the mean time that thei have thi effect and thei have it undoubtedli thi gener enhanc of the price of all commod in consequ of that labour is a case which differ in the two follow respect from that of a particular commod of which the price wa enhanc by a particular tax immedi impos upon it first it might alwai be known with great exact how far the price of such a commod could be enhanc by such a tax but how far the gener enhanc of the price of labour might affect that of everi differ commod about which labour wa emploi could never be known with ani toler exact it would be imposs therefor to proport with ani toler exact the tax of everi foreign to the enhanc of the price of everi home commod secondli tax upon the necessari of life have nearli the same effect upon the circumst of the peopl as a poor soil and a bad climat provis ar therebi render dearer in the same manner as if it requir extraordinari labour and expens to rais them as in the natur scarciti aris from soil and climat it would be absurd to direct the peopl in what manner thei ought to emploi their capit and industri so is it likewis in the artifici scarciti aris from such tax to be left to accommod as well as thei could their industri to their situat and to find out those employ in which notwithstand their unfavour circumst thei might have some advantag either in the home or in the foreign market is what in both case would evid be most for their advantag to lai a newtax upon them becaus thei ar alreadi overburden with tax and becaus thei alreadi pai too dear for the necessari of life to make them likewis pai too dear for the greater part of other commod is certainli a most absurd wai of make amend such tax when thei have grown up to a certain height ar a curs equal to the barren of the earth and the inclem of the heaven and yet it is in the richest and most industri countri that thei have been most gener impos no other countri could support so great a disord as the strongest bodi onli can live and enjoi health under an unwholesom regimen so the nation onli that in everi sort of industri have the greatest natur and acquir advantag can subsist and prosper under such tax holland is the countri in europ in which thei abound most and which from peculiar circumst continu to prosper not by mean of them as ha been most absurdli suppos but in spite of them as there ar two case in which it will gener be advantag to lai some burden upon foreign for the encourag of domest industri so there ar two other in which it mai sometim be a matter of deliber in the on how far it is proper to continu the free import of certain foreign good and in the other how far or in what manner it mai be proper to restor that free import after it ha been for some time interrupt the case in which it mai sometim be a matter of deliber how far it is proper to continu the free import of certain foreign good is when some foreign nation restrain by high duti or prohibit the import of some of our manufactur into their countri reveng in thi case natur dictat retali and that we should impos the like duti and prohibit upon the import of some or all of their manufactur into our nation accordingli seldom fail to retali in thi manner the french have been particularli forward to favour their own manufactur by restrain the import of such foreign good as could come into competit with them in thi consist a great part of the polici of mr colbert who notwithstand hi great abil seem in thi case to have been impos upon by the sophistri of merchant and manufactur who ar alwai demand a monopoli against their countrymen it is at present the opinion of the most intellig men in franc that hi oper of thi kind have not been benefici to hi countri that minist by the tariff of impos veri high duti upon a great number of foreign manufactur upon hi refus to moder them in favour of the dutch thei in prohibit the import of the wine brandi and manufactur of franc the war of seem to have been in part occas by thi commerci disput the peac of nimeguen put an end to it in by moder some of those duti in favour of the dutch who in consequ took off their prohibit it wa about the same time that the french and english began mutual to oppress each other industri by the like duti and prohibit of which the french howev seem to have set the first exampl the spirit of hostil which ha subsist between the two nation ever sinc ha hitherto hinder them from be moder on either side in the ehglish prohibit the import of bone lace the manufactur of flander the govern of that countri at that time under the dominion of spain prohibit in return the import of english woollen in the prohibit of import bone lace into england wa taken oft upon condit that the import of english woollen into flander should be put on the same foot as befor there mai be good polici in retali of thi kind when there is a probabl that thei will procur the repeal of the high duti or prohibit complain of the recoveri of a great foreign market will gener more than compens the transitori inconveni of pai dearer dure a short time for some sort of good to judg whether such retali ar like to produc such an effect doe not perhap belong so much to the scienc of a legisl whose deliber ought to be govern by gener principl which ar alwai the same as to the skill of that insidi and crafti anim vulgarli call a statesman or politician whose council ar direct by the momentari fluctuat of affair when there is no probabl that ani such repeal can be procur it seem a bad method of compens the injuri done to certain class of our peopl to do anoth injuri ourselv not onli to those class but to almost all the other class of them when our neighbour prohibit some manufactur of our we gener prohibit not onli the same for that alon would seldom affect them consider but some other manufactur of their thi mai no doubt give encourag to some particular class of workmen among ourselv and by exclud some of their rival mai enabl them to rais their price in the home market those workmen howev who suffer by our neighbour prohibit will not be benefit by our on the contrari thei and almost all the other class of our citizen will therebi be oblig to pai dearer than befor for certain good everi such law therefor impos a real tax upon the whole countri not in favour of that particular class of workmen who were injur by our neighbour prohibit but of some other class the case in which it mai sometim be a matter of deliber how far or in what manner it is proper to restor the free import of foreign good after it ha been for some time interrupt is when particular manufactur by mean of high duti or prohibit upon all foreign good which can come into competit with them have been so far extend as to emploi a great multitud of hand human mai in thi case requir that the freedom of trade should be restor onli by slow gradat and with a good deal of reserv and circumspect were those high duti and prohibit taken awai all at onc cheaper foreign good of the same kind might be pour so fast into the home market as to depriv all at onc mani thousand of our peopl of their ordinari employ and mean of subsist the disord which thi would occas might no doubt be veri consider it would in all probabl howev be much less than is commonli imagin for the two follow reason first all those manufactur of which ani part is commonli export to other european countri without a bounti could be veri littl affect by the freest import of foreign good such manufactur must be sold as cheap abroad as ani other foreign good of the same qualiti and kind and consequ must be sold cheaper at home thei would still therefor keep possess of the home market and though a caprici man of fashion might sometim prefer foreign ware mere becaus thei were foreign to cheaper and better good of the same kind that were made at home thi folli could from the natur of thing extend to so few that it could make no sensibl impress upon the gener employ of the peopl but a great part of all the differ branch of our woollen manufactur of our tan leather and of our hardwar ar annual export to other european countri without ani bounti and these ar the manufactur which emploi the greatest number of hand the silk perhap is the manufactur which would suffer the most by thi freedom of trade and after it the linen though the latter much less than the former secondli though a great number of peopl should by thu restor the freedom of trade be thrown all at onc out of their ordinari employ and common method of subsist it would by no mean follow that thei would therebi be depriv either of employ or subsist by the reduct of the armi and navi at the end of the late war more than soldier and seamen a number equal to what is emploi in the greatest manufactur were all at onc thrown out of their ordinari employ but though thei no doubt suffer some inconveni thei were not therebi depriv of all employ and subsist the greater part of the seamen it is probabl gradual betook themselv to the merchant servic as thei could find occas and in the mean time both thei and the soldier were absorb in the great mass of the peopl and emploi in a great varieti of occup not onli no great convuls but no sensibl disord aros from so great a chang in the situat of more than men all accustom to the us of arm and mani of them to rapin and plunder the number of vagrant wa scarc anywher sensibl increas by it even the wage of labour were not reduc by it in ani occup so far as i have been abl to learn except in that of seamen in the merchant servic but if we compar togeth the habit of a soldier and of ani sort of manufactur we shall find that those of the latter do not tend so much to disqualifi him from be emploi in a new trade as those of the former from be emploi in ani the manufactur ha alwai been accustom to look for hi subsist from hi labour onli the soldier to expect it from hi pai applic and industri have been familiar to the on idl and dissip to the other but it is sure much easier to chang the direct of industri from on sort of labour to anoth than to turn idl and dissip to ani to the greater part of manufactur besid it ha alreadi been observ there ar other collater manufactur of so similar a natur that a workman can easili transfer hi industri from on of them to anoth the greater part of such workmen too ar occasion emploi in countri labour the stock which emploi them in a particular manufactur befor will still remain in the countri to emploi an equal number of peopl in some other wai the capit of the countri remain the same the demand for labour will likewis be the same or veri nearli the same though it mai be exert in differ place and for differ occup soldier and seamen inde when discharg from the king servic ar at liberti to exercis ani trade within ani town or place of great britain or ireland let the same natur liberti of exercis what speci of industri thei pleas be restor to all hi majesti subject in the same manner as to soldier and seamen that is break down the exclus privileg of corpor and repeal the statut of apprenticeship both which ar realli encroach upon natur liberti and add to those the repeal of the law of settlement so that a poor workman when thrown out of employ either in on trade or in on place mai seek for it in anoth trade or in anoth place without the fear either of a prosecut or of a remov and neither the public nor the individu will suffer much more from the occasion disband some particular class of manufactur than from that of the soldier our manufactur have no doubt great merit with their countri but thei cannot have more than those who defend it with their blood nor deserv to be treat with more delicaci to expect inde that the freedom of trade should ever be entir restor in great britain is as absurd as to expect that an oceana or utopia should ever be establish in it not onli the prejudic of the public but what is much more unconquer the privat interest of mani individu irresist oppos it were the offic

commerc between the two nation and smuggler ar now the princip import either of british good into franc or of french good into great britain the principl which i have been examin in the forego chapter took their origin from privat interest and the spirit of monopoli those which i am go te examin in thi from nation prejudic and animos thei ar accordingli as might well be expect still more unreason thei ar so even upon the principl of the commerci system first though it were certain that in the case of a free trade between franc and england for exampl the balanc would be in favour of franc it would by no mean follow that such a trade would be disadvantag to england or that the gener balanc of it whole trade would therebi be turn more against it if the wine of franc ar better and cheaper than those of portug or it linen than those of germani it would be more advantag for great britain to purchas both the wine and the foreign linen which it had occas for of franc than of portug and germani though the valu of the annual import from franc would therebi be greatli augment the valu of the whole annual import would be diminish in proport as the french good of the same qualiti were cheaper than those of the other two countri thi would be the case even upon the supposit that the whole french good import were to be consum in great britain but secondli a great part of them might be reexport to other countri where be sold with profit thei might bring back a return equal in valu perhap to the prime cost of the whole french good import what ha frequent been said of the east india trade might possibl be true of the french that though the greater part of east india good were bought with gold and silver the reexport of a part of them to other countri brought back more gold and silver to that which carri on the trade than the prime cost of the whole amount to on of the most import branch of the dutch trade at present consist in the carriag of french good to other european countri some part even of the french wine drank in great britain is clandestin import from holland and zealand if there wa either a free trade between franc and england or if french good could be import upon pai onli the same duti as those of other european nation to be drawn back upon export england might have some share of a trade which is found so advantag to holland thirdli and lastli there is no certain criterion by which we can determin on which side what is call the balanc between ani two countri li or which of them export to the greatest valu nation prejudic and animos prompt alwai by the privat interest of particular trader ar the principl which gener direct our judgment upon all question concern it there ar two criterion howev which have frequent been appeal to upon such occas the customhous book and the cours of exchang the customhous book i think it is now gener acknowledg ar a veri uncertain criterion on account of the inaccuraci of the valuat at which the greater part of good ar rate in them the cours of exchang is perhap almost equal so when the exchang between two place such as london and pari is at par it is said to be a sign that the debt due from london to pari ar compens by those due from pari to london on the contrari when a premium is paid at london for a bill upon pari it is said to be a sign that the debt due from london to pari ar not compens by those due from pari to london but that a balanc in monei must be sent out from the latter place for the risk troubl and expens of export which the premium is both demand and given but the ordinari state of debt and credit between those two citi must necessarili be regul it is said by the ordinari cours of their deal with on anoth when neither of them import from from other to a greater amount than it export to that other the debt and credit of each mai compens on anoth but when on of them import from the other to a greater valu than it export to that other the former necessarili becom indebt to the latter in a greater sum than the latter becom indebt to it the debt and credit of each do not compens on anoth and monei must be sent out from that place of which the debt overbal the credit the ordinari cours of exchang therefor be an indic of the ordinari state of debt and credit between two place must likewis be an indic of the ordinari cours of their export and import as these necessarili regul that state but though the ordinari cours of exchang shall be allow to be a suffici indic of the ordinari state of debt and credit between ani two place it would not from thenc follow that the balanc of trade wa in favour of that place which had the ordinari state of debt and credit in it favour the ordinari state of debt and credit between ani two place is not alwai entir regul by the ordinari cours of their deal with on anoth but is often influenc by that of the deal of either with mani other place if it is usual for exampl for the merchant of england to pai for the good which thei bui of hamburg dantzic riga etc by bill upon holland the ordinari state of debt and credit between england and holland will not be regul entir by the ordinari cours of the deal of those two countri with on anoth but will be influenc by that of the deal in england with those other place england mai be oblig to send out everi year monei to holland though it annual export to that countri mai exce veri much the annual valu of it import from thenc and though what is call the balanc of trade mai be veri much in favour of england in the wai besid in which the par of exchang ha hitherto been comput the ordinari cours of exchang can afford no suffici indic that the ordinari state of debt and credit is in favour of that countri which seem to have or which is suppos to have the ordinari cours of exchang in it favour or in other word the real exchang mai be and in fact often is so veri differ from the comput on that from the cours of the latter no certain conclus can upon mani occas be drawn concern that of the former when for a sum or monei paid in england contain accord to the standard of the english mint a certain number of ounc of pure silver you receiv a bill for a sum of monei to be paid in franc contain accord to the standard of the french mint an equal number of ounc of pure silver exchang is said to be at par between england and franc when you pai more you ar suppos to give a premium and exchang is said to be against england and in favour of franc when you pai less you ar suppos to get a premium and exchang is said to be against franc and in favour of england but first we cannot alwai judg of the valu of the current monei of differ countri by the standard of their respect mint in some it is more in other it is less worn clipt and otherwis degener from that standard but the valu of the current coin of everi countri compar with that of ani other countri is in proport not to the quantiti of pure silver which it ought to contain but to that which it actual doe contain befor the reform of the silver coin in king william time exchang between england and holland comput in the usual manner accord to the standard of their respect mint wa fiveand twenti per cent against england but the valu of the current coin of england as we learn from mr lownd wa at that time rather more than fiveandtwenti per cent below it standard valu the real exchang therefor mai even at that time have been in favour of england notwithstand the comput exchang wa so much against it a smaller number or ounc of pure silver actual paid in england mai have purchas a bill for a greater number of ounc of pure silver to be paid in holland and the man who wa suppos to give mai in realiti have got the premium the french coin wa befor the late reform of the english gold coin much less wore than the english and wa perhap two or three per cent nearer it standard if the comput exchang with franc therefor wa not more than two or three per cent against england the real exchang might have been in it favour sinc the reform of the gold coin the exchang ha been constantli in favour of england and against franc secondli in some countri the expens of coinag is defrai by the govern in other it is defrai by the privat peopl who carri their bullion to the mint and the govern even deriv some revenu from the coinag in england it is defrai by the govern and if you carri a pound weight of standard silver to the mint you get back sixtytwo shill contain a pound weight of the like standard silver in franc a duti of eight per cent is deduct for the coinag which not onli defrai the expens of it but afford a small revenu to the govern in england as the coinag cost noth the current coin can never be much more valuabl than the quantiti of bullion which it actual contain in franc the workmanship as you pai for it add to the valu in the same manner as to that of wrought plate a sum of french monei therefor contain an equal weight of pure silver is more valuabl than a sum of english monei contain an equal weight of pure silver and must requir more bullion or other commod to purchas it though the current coin of the two countri therefor were equal near the standard of their respect mint a sum of english monei could not well purchas a sum of french monei contain an equal number of ounc of pure silver nor consequ a bill upon franc for such a sum if for such a bill no more addit monei wa paid than what wa suffici to compens the expens of the french coinag the real exchang might be at par between the two countri their debt and credit might mutual compens on anoth while the comput exchang wa consider in favour of franc if less than thi wa paid the real exchang might be in favour of england while the comput wa in favour of franc thirdli and lastli in some place as at amsterdam hamburg venic etc foreign bill of exchang ar paid in what thei call bank monei while in other as at london lisbon antwerp leghorn etc thei ar paid in the common currenc of the countri what is call bank monei is alwai of more valu than the same nomin sum of common currenc a thousand guilder in the bank of amsterdam for exampl ar of more valu than a thousand guilder of amsterdam currenc the differ between them is call the agio of the bank which at amsterdam is gener about five per cent suppos the current monei of the two countri equal near to the standard of their respect mint and that the on pai foreign bill in thi common currenc while the other pai them in bank monei it is evid that the comput exchang mai be in favour of that which pai in bank monei though the real exchang should be in favour of that which pai in current monei for the same reason that the comput exchang mai be in favour of that which pai in better monei or in monei nearer to it own standard though the real exchang should be in favour of that which pai in wors the comput exchang befor the late reform of the gold coin wa gener against london with amsterdam hamburg venic and i believ with all other place which pai in what is call bank monei it will by no mean follow howev that the real exchang wa against it sinc the reform of the gold coin it ha been in favour of london even with those place the comput exchang ha gener been in favour of london with lisbon antwerp leghorn and if you except franc i believ with most other part of europ that pai in common currenc and it is not improb that the real exchang wa so too digress concern bank of deposit particularli concern that of amsterdam the currenc of a great state such as franc or england gener consist almost entir of it own coin should thi currenc therefor be at ani time worn clipt or otherwis degrad below it standard valu the state by a reform of it coin can effectu reestablish it currenc but the currenc of a small state such as genoa or hamburg can seldom consist altogeth in it own coin but must be made up in a great measur of the coin of all the neighbour state with which it inhabit have a continu intercours such a state therefor by reform it coin will not alwai be abl to reform it currenc if foreign bill of exchang ar paid in thi currenc the uncertain valu of ani sum of what is in it own natur so uncertain must render the exchang alwai veri much against such a state it currenc be in all foreign state necessarili valu even below what it is worth in order to remedi the inconveni to which thi disadvantag exchang must have subject their merchant such small state when thei began to attend to the interest of trade have frequent enact that foreign bill of exchang of a certain valu should be paid not in common currenc but by an order upon or by a transfer in the book of a certain bank establish upon the credit and under the protect of the state thi bank be alwai oblig to pai in good and true monei exactli accord to the standard of the state the bank of venic genoa amsterdam hamburg and nuremberg seem to have been all origin establish with thi view though some of them mai have afterward been made subservi to other purpos the monei of such bank be better than the common currenc of the countri necessarili bore an agio which wa greater or smaller accord as the currenc wa suppos to be more or less degrad below the standard of the state the agio of the bank of hamburg for exampl which is said to be commonli about fourteen per cent is the suppos differ between the good standard monei of the state and the clipt worn and diminish currenc pour into it from all the neighbour state befor the great quantiti of clipt and worn foreign coin which the extens trade of amsterdam brought from all part of europ reduc the valu of it currenc about nine per cent below that of good monei fresh from the mint such monei no sooner appear than it wa melt down or carri awai as it alwai is in such circumst the merchant with plenti of currenc could not alwai find a suffici quantiti of good monei to pai their bill of exchang and the valu of those bill in spite of sever regul which were made to prevent it becam in a great measur uncertain in order to remedi these inconveni a bank wa establish in under the guarante of the citi thi bank receiv both foreign coin and the light and worn coin of the countri at it real intrins valu in the good standard monei of the countri deduct onli so much as wa necessari for defrai the expens of coinag and the other necessari expens of manag for the valu which remain after thi small deduct wa made it gave a credit in it book thi credit wa call bank monei which as it repres monei exactli accord to the standard of the mint wa alwai of the same real valu and intrins worth more than current monei it wa at the same time enact that all bill drawn upon or negoti at amsterdam of the valu of guilder and upward should be paid in bank monei which at onc took awai all uncertainti in the valu of those bill everi merchant in consequ of thi regul wa oblig to keep an account with the bank in order to pai hi foreign bill of exchang which necessarili occas a certain demand for bank monei bank monei over and abov both it intrins superior to currenc and the addit valu which thi demand necessarili give it ha likewis some other advantag it is secur from fire robberi and other accid the citi of amsterdam is bound for it it can be paid awai by a simpl transfer without the troubl of count or the risk of transport it from on place to anoth in consequ of those differ advantag it seem from the begin to have born an agio and it is gener believ that all the monei origin deposit in the bank wa allow to remain there nobodi care to demand payment of a debt which he could sell for a premium in the market by demand payment of the bank the owner of a bank credit would lose thi premium as a shill fresh from the mint will bui no more good in the market than on of our common worn shill so the good and true monei which might be brought from the coffer of the bank into those of a privat person be mix and confound with the common currenc of the countri would be of no more valu than that currenc from which it could no longer be readili distinguish while it remain in the coffer of the bank it superior wa known and ascertain when it had come into those of a privat

should belong to the bank at the price at which it had been receiv or for which credit had been given in the transfer book what is thu paid for the keep of the deposit mai be consid as a sort of warehous rent and why thi warehous rent should be so much dearer for gold than for silver sever differ reason have been assign the fine of gold it ha been said is more difficult to be ascertain than

seldom is said to happen sometim and more frequent with regard to gold than with regard to silver on account of the higher warehous rent which is paid for the keep of the more preciou metal the person who by make a deposit of bullion obtain both a bank credit and a receipt pai hi bill of exchang as thei becom due with hi bank credit and either sell or keep hi receipt accord as he judg that the

arisen from it wa unforeseen and mai be consid as accident but it is now time to return from thi long digress into which i have been insens led in endeavour to explain the reason why the exchang between the countri which pai in what is call bank monei and those which pai in common currenc should gener appear to be in favour of the former and against the latter the former pai in a speci of monei of which the intrins valu is alwai the same and exactli agreeabl to the standard of their respect mint the latter is a speci of monei of which the intrins valu is continu vari and is almost alwai more or less below that standard part iiof the unreason of those extraordinari restraint upon other principl in the forego part of thi chapter i have endeavour to show even upon the principl of the commerci system how unnecessari it is to lai extraordinari restraint upon the import of good from those countri with which the balanc of trade is suppos to be disadvantag noth howev can be more absurd than thi whole doctrin of the balanc of trade upon which not onli these restraint but almost all the other regul of commerc ar found when two place trade with on anoth thi doctrin suppos that if the balanc be even neither of them either lose or gain but if it lean in ani degre to on side that on of them lose and the other gain in proport to it declens from the exact equilibrium both supposit ar fals a trade which is forc by mean of bounti and monopoli mai be and commonli is disadvantag to the countri in whose favour it is meant to be establish as i shall endeavour to show hereaft but that trade which without forc or constraint is natur and regularli carri on between ani two place is alwai advantag though not alwai equal so to both by advantag or gain i understand not the increas of the quantiti of gold and silver but that of the exchang valu of the annual produc of the land and labour of the countri or the increas of the annual revenu of it inhabit if the balanc be even and if the trade between the two place consist altogeth in the exchang of their nativ commod thei will upon most occas not onli both gain but thei will gain equal or veri nearli equal each will in thi case afford a market for a part of the surplu produc of the other each will replac a capit which had been emploi in rais and prepar for the market thi part of the surplu produc of the other and which had been distribut among and given revenu and mainten to a certain number of it inhabit some part of the inhabit of each therefor will directli deriv their revenu and mainten from the other as the commod exchang too ar suppos to be of equal valu so the two capit emploi in the trade will upon most occas be equal or veri nearli equal and both be emploi in rais the nativ commod of the two countri the revenu and mainten which their distribut will afford to the inhabit of each will be equal or veri nearli equal thi revenu and mainten thu mutual afford will be greater or smaller in proport to the extent of their deal if these should annual amount to for exampl or to on each side each of them will afford an annual revenu in the on case of and in the other of to the inhabit of the other if their trade should be of such a natur that on of them export to the other noth but nativ commod while the return of that other consist altogeth in foreign good the balanc in thi case would still be suppos even commod be paid for with commod thei would in thi case too both gain but thei would not gain equal and the inhabit of the countri which export noth but nativ commod would deriv the greatest revenu from the trade if england for exampl should import from franc noth but the nativ commod of that countri and not have such commod of it own as were in demand there should annual repai them by send thither a larg quantiti of foreign good tobacco we shall suppos and east india good thi trade though it would give some revenu to the inhabit of both countri would give more to those of franc than to those of england the whole french capit annual emploi in it would annual be distribut among the peopl of franc but that part of the english capit onli which wa emploi in produc the english commod with which those foreign good were purchas would be annual distribut among the peopl of england the greater part of it would replac the capit which had been emploi in virginia indostan and china and which had given revenu and mainten to the inhabit of those distant countri if the capit were equal or nearli equal therefor thi employ of the french capit would augment much more the revenu of the peopl of franc than that of the english capit would the revenu of the peopl of england franc would in thi case carri on a direct foreign trade of consumpt with england wherea england would carri on a roundabout trade of the same kind with franc the differ effect of a capit emploi in the direct and of on emploi in the roundabout foreign trade of consumpt have alreadi been fulli explain there is not probabl between ani two countri a trade which consist altogeth in the exchang either of nativ commod on both side or of nativ commod on on side and of foreign good on the other almost all countri exchang with on anoth partli nativ and partli foreign good that countri howev in whose cargo there is the greatest proport of nativ and the least of foreign good will alwai be the princip gainer if it wa not with tobacco and east india good but with gold and silver that england paid for the commod annual import from franc the balanc in thi case would be suppos uneven commod not be paid for with commod but with gold and silver the trade howev would in thi case as in the forego give some revenu to the inhabit of both countri but more to those of franc than to those of england it would give some revenu to those of england the capit which had been emploi in produc the english good that purchas thi gold and silver the capit which had been distribut among and given revenu to certain inhabit of england would therebi be replac and enabl to continu that employ the whole capit of england would no more be diminish by thi export of gold and silver than by the export of an equal valu of ani other good on the contrari it would in most case be augment no good ar sent abroad but those for which the demand is suppos to be greater abroad than at home and of which the return consequ it is expect will be of more valu at home than the commod export if the tobacco which in england is worth onli when sent to franc will purchas wine which is in england worth the exchang will augment the capit of england by if of english gold in the same manner purchas french wine which in england is worth thi exchang will equal augment the capit of england by as a merchant who ha worth of wine in hi cellar is a richer man than he who ha onli worth of tobacco in hi warehous so is he likewis a richer man than he who ha onli worth of gold in hi coffer he can put into motion a greater quantiti of industri and give revenu mainten and employ to a greater number of peopl than either of the other two but the capit of the countri is equal to the capit of all it differ inhabit and the quantiti of industri which can be annual maintain in it is equal to what all those differ capit can maintain both the capit of the countri therefor and the quantiti of industri which can be annual maintain in it must gener be augment by thi exchang it would inde be more advantag for england that it could purchas the wine of franc with it own hardwar and broad cloth than with either the tobacco of virginia or the gold and silver of brazil and peru a direct foreign trade of consumpt is alwai more advantag than a roundabout on but a roundabout foreign trade of consumpt which is carri on with gold and silver doe not seem to be less advantag than ani other equal roundabout on neither is a countri which ha no mine more like to be exhaust of gold and silver by thi annual export of those metal than on which doe not grow tobacco by the like annual export of that plant as a countri which ha wherewith to bui tobacco will never be long in want of it so neither will on be long in want of gold and silver which ha wherewith to purchas those metal it is a lose trade it is said which a workman carri on with the alehous and the trade which a manufactur nation would natur carri on with a wine countri mai be consid as a trade of the same natur i answer that the trade with the alehous is not necessarili a lose trade in it own natur it is just as advantag as ani other though perhap somewhat more liabl to be abus the employ of a brewer and even that of a retail of ferment liquor ar as necessari divis of labour as ani other it will gener be more advantag for a workman to bui of the brewer the quantiti he ha occas for than to brew it himself and if he is a poor workman it will gener be more advantag for him to bui it by littl and littl of the retail than a larg quantiti of the brewer he mai no doubt bui too much of either as he mai of ani other dealer in hi neighbourhood of the butcher if he is a glutton or of the draper if he affect to be a beau among hi companion it is advantag to the great bodi of workmen notwithstand that all these trade should be free though thi freedom mai be abus in all of them and is more like to be so perhap in some than in other though individu besid mai sometim ruin their fortun by an excess consumpt of ferment liquor there seem to be no risk that a nation should do so though in everi countri there ar mani peopl who spend upon such liquor more than thei can afford there ar alwai mani more who spend less it deserv to be remark too that if we consult experi the cheap of wine seem to be a caus not of drunken but of sobrieti the inhabit of the wine countri ar in gener the soberest peopl of europ wit the spaniard the italian and the inhabit of the southern provinc of franc peopl ar seldom guilti of excess in what is their daili fare nobodi affect the charact of liber and good fellowship by be profus of a liquor which is as cheap as small beer on the contrari in the countri which either from excess heat or cold produc no grape and where wine consequ is dear and a rariti drunken is a common vice as among the northern nation and all those who live between the tropic the negro for exampl on the coast of guinea when a french regiment come from some of the northern provinc of franc where wine is somewhat dear to be quarter in the southern where it is veri cheap the soldier i have frequent heard it observ ar at first debauch by the cheap and novelti of good wine but after a few month resid the greater part of them becom as sober as the rest of the inhabit were the duti upon foreign wine and the excis upon malt beer and al to be taken awai all at onc it might in the same manner occas in great britain a pretti gener and temporari drunken among the middl and inferior rank of peopl which would probabl be soon follow by a perman and almost univers sobrieti at present drunken is by no mean the vice of peopl of fashion or of those who can easili afford the most expens liquor a gentleman drunk with al ha scarc ever been seen among us the restraint upon the wine trade in great britain besid do not so much seem calcul to hinder the peopl from go if i mai sai so to the alehous as from go where thei can bui the best and

such maxim as these howev nation have been taught that their interest consist in beggar all their neighbour each nation ha been made to look with an invidi ey upon the prosper of all the nation with

neither ar nor ought to be the ruler of mankind though it cannot perhap be correct mai veri easili be prevent from disturb the tranquil of anybodi but themselv that it wa the spirit of monopoli which

great bodi of the peopl to bui whatev thei want of those who sell it cheapest the proposit is so veri manifest that it seem ridicul to take ani pain to prove it nor could it ever have been call in question had not the interest sophistri of merchant and manufactur confound the common sens of mankind their interest is in thi respect directli opposit to that of the great bodi of the peopl as it is the interest of the freemen of a corpor to hinder the rest of the inhabit from emploi ani workmen but themselv so it is the interest of the merchant and manufactur of everi countri to secur to themselv the monopoli of the home market henc in great britain and in most other european countri the extraordinari duti upon almost all good import by alien merchant henc the high duti and prohibit upon all those foreign manufactur which can come into competit with our own henc too the extraordinari restraint upon the import of almost all sort of good from those countri with which the balanc of

advantag in trade in a state of hostil it mai enabl our enemi to maintain fleet and armi superior to our own but in a state of peac and commerc it must likewis enabl them to exchang with us to a

the same maxim which would in thi manner direct the common sens of on or ten or twenti individu should regul the judgment of on or ten or twenti million and should make a whole nation regard the rich of it neighbour as a probabl caus and occas for itself to acquir rich a nation that would enrich itself by foreign trade is certainli most like to do so when it neighbour ar all rich industri and commerci nation a great nation surround on all side by wander savag and poor barbarian might no doubt acquir rich by the cultiv of it own land and by it own interior commerc but not by foreign trade it seem to have been in thi manner that the ancient egyptian and the modern chines acquir their great wealth the ancient egyptian it is said neglect foreign commerc and the modern chines it is known hold it in the utmost contempt and scarc deign to afford it the decent protect of the law the modern maxim of foreign commerc by aim at the impoverish of all our neighbour so far as thei ar capabl of produc their intend effect tend to render that veri commerc insignific and contempt it is in consequ of these maxim that the commerc between franc and england ha in both countri been subject to so mani discourag and restraint if those two countri howev were to consid their real interest without either mercantil jealousi or nation animos the commerc of franc might be more advantag to great britain than that of ani other countri and for the same reason that of great britain to franc franc is the nearest neighbour to great britain in the trade between the southern coast of england and the northern and northwestern coast of franc the return might be expect in the same manner as in the inland trade four five or six time in the year the capit therefor emploi in thi trade could in each of the two countri keep in motion four five or six time the quantiti of industri and afford employ and subsist to four five or six time the number of peopl which all equal capit could do in the greater part of the other branch of foreign trade between the part of franc and great britain most remot from on anoth the return might be expect at least onc in the year and even thi trade would so far be at least equal advantag as the greater part of the other branch of our foreign european trade it would be at least three time more advantag than the boast trade with our north american coloni in which the return were seldom made in less than three year frequent not in less than four or five year franc besid is suppos to contain of inhabit our north american coloni were never suppos to contain more than and franc is a much richer countri than north america though on account of the more unequ distribut of rich there is much more poverti and beggari in the on countri than in the other franc therefor could afford a market at least eight time more extens and on account of the superior frequenc of the return fourandtwenti time more advantag than that which our north american coloni ever afford the trade of great britain would be just as advantag to franc and in proport to the wealth popul and proxim of the respect countri would have the same superior over that which franc carri on with her own coloni such is the veri great differ between that trade which the wisdom of both nation ha thought proper to discourag and that which it ha favour the most but the veri same circumst

encourag to export of these encourag what ar call drawback seem to be the most reason to allow the merchant to draw back upon export either the whole or a part of whatev excis or inland duti is impos upon domest industri can never occas the export of a greater quantiti of good than what would have been export had no duti been impos such encourag do not tend to turn toward ani particular employ a

good upon which thei ar paid could seldom have been export nor consequ import for want of a market the duti therefor of which a part is retain would never have been paid these reason seem suffici to

been thought therefor is to pai them for bui it is in thi manner that the mercantil system propos to enrich the whole countri and to put monei into all our pocket by mean of the balanc of trade bounti it is allow ought to be given to those branch of trade onli which cannot be carri on without them but everi branch of trade in which the merchant can sell hi good for a price which replac to him with the ordinari profit of stock the whole capit emploi in prepar and send them to market can be carri on without a bounti everi such branch is evid upon a level with all the other branch of trade which ar carri on without bounti and cannot therefor requir on more than thei those trade onli requir bounti in which the merchant is oblig to sell hi good for a price which doe not replac to him hi capit togeth with the ordinari profit or in which he is oblig to sell them for less than it realli cost him to send them to market the bounti is given in order to make up thi loss and to encourag him to continu or perhap to begin a trade of which the expens is suppos to be greater than the return of which everi oper eat up a part of the capit emploi in it and which is of such a natur that if all other trade resembl it there would soon be no capit left in the countri the trade it is to be observ which ar carri on by mean of bounti ar the onli on which can be carri on between two nation for ani consider time togeth in such a manner as that on of them shall alwai and regularli lose or sell it good for less than it realli cost to send them to market but if the bounti did not repai to the merchant what he would otherwis lose upon the price of hi good hi own interest would soon oblig him to emploi hi stock in anoth wai or to find out a trade in which the price of the good would replac to him with the ordinari profit the capit emploi in send them to market the effect of bounti like that of all the other expedi of the mercantil system can onli be to forc the trade of a countri into a channel much less advantag than that in which it would natur run of it own accord the ingeni and wellinform author of the tract upon the corn trade ha shown veri clearli that sinc the bounti upon the export of corn wa first establish the price of the corn export valu moder enough ha exceed that of the corn import valu veri high by a much greater sum than the amount of the whole bounti which have been paid dure that period thi he imagin upon the true principl of the mercantil system is a clear proof that thi forc corn trade is benefici to the nation the valu of the export exceed that of the import by a much greater sum than the whole extraordinari expens which the public ha been at in order to get it export he doe not consid that thi extraordinari expens or the bounti is the smallest part of the expens which the export of corn realli cost the societi the capit which the farmer emploi in rais it must likewis be taken into the account unless the price of the corn when sold in the foreign market replac not onli the bounti but thi capit togeth with the ordinari profit of stock the societi is a loser by the differ or the nation stock is so much diminish but the veri reason for which it ha been thought necessari to grant a bounti is the suppos insuffici of the price to do thi the averag price of corn it ha been said ha fallen consider sinc the establish of the bounti that the averag price of corn began to fall somewhat toward the end of the last centuri and ha continu to do so dure the cours of the sixtyfour first year of the present i have alreadi endeavour to show but thi event suppos it to be real as i believ it to be must have happen in spite of the bounti and cannot possibl have happen in consequ of it it ha happen in franc as well as in england though in franc there wa not onli no bounti but till the export of corn wa subject to a gener prohibit thi gradual fall in the averag price of grain it is probabl therefor is ultim ow neither to the on regul nor to the other but to that gradual and insens rise in the real valu of silver which in the first book of thi discours i have endeavour to show ha taken place in the gener market of europ dure the cours of the present centuri it seem to be altogeth imposs that the bounti could ever contribut to lower the price of grain in year of plenti it ha alreadi been observ the bounti by occas an extraordinari export necessarili keep up the price of corn in the home market abov what it would natur fall to to do so wa the avow purpos of the institut in year of scarciti though the bounti is frequent suspend yet the great export which it occas in year of plenti must frequent hinder more or less the plenti of on year from reliev the scarciti of anoth both in year of plenti and in year of scarciti therefor the bounti necessarili tend to rais the monei price of corn somewhat higher than it otherwis would be in the home market that in the actual state of tillag the bounti must necessarili have thi tendenc will not i apprehend be disput by ani reason person but it ha been thought by mani peopl that it tend to encourag tillag and that in two differ wai first by open a more extens foreign market to the corn of the farmer it tend thei imagin to increas the demand for and consequ the product of that commod and secondli by secur to him a better price than he could otherwis expect in the actual state of tillag it tend thei suppos to encourag tillag thi doubl encourag must thei imagin in a long period of year occas such an increas in the product of corn as mai lower it price in the home market much more than the bounti can rais it in the actual state which tillag mai at the end of that period happen to be in i answer that whatev extens of the foreign market can be occas by the bounti must in everi particular year be altogeth at the expens of the home market as everi bushel of corn which is export by mean of the bounti and which would not have been export without the bounti would have remain in the home market to increas the consumpt and to lower the price of that commod the corn bounti it is to be observ as well as everi other bounti upon export impos two differ tax upon the peopl first the tax which thei ar oblig to contribut in order to pai the bounti and secondli the tax which aris from the advanc price of the commod in the home market and which as the whole bodi of the peopl ar purchas of corn must in thi particular commod be paid by the whole bodi of the peopl in thi particular commod therefor thi second tax is by much the heaviest of the two let us suppos that take on year with anoth the bounti of s upon the export of the quarter of wheat rais the price of that commod in the home market onli d the bushel or s the quarter higher than it otherwis would have been in the actual state of the crop even upon thi veri moder supposit the great bodi of the peopl over and abov contribut the tax which pai the bounti of s upon everi quarter of wheat export must pai anoth of s upon everi quarter which thei themselv consum but accord to the veri well inform author of the tract upon the corn trade the averag proport of the corn export to that consum at home is not more than that of on to thirtyon for everi s therefor which thei contribut to the payment of the first tax thei must contribut s to the payment of the second so veri heavi a tax upon the first necessari of lifemust either reduc the subsist of the labour poor or it must occas some augment in their pecuniari wage proportion to that in the pecuniari price of their subsist so far as it oper in the on wai it must reduc the abil of the labour poor to educ and bring up their children and must so far tend to restrain the popul of the countri so far as it oper in the other it must reduc the abil of the employ of the poor to emploi so great a number as thei otherwis might do and must so far tend to restrain the industri of the countri the extraordinari export of corn therefor occas by the bounti not onli in everi particular year diminish the home just as much as it extend the foreign market and consumpt but by restrain the popul and industri of the countri it final tendenc is to stint and restrain the gradual extens of the home market and therebi in the longrun rather to diminish than to augment the whole market and consumpt of corn thi enhanc of the monei price of corn howev it ha been thought by render that commod more profit to the farmer must necessarili encourag it product i answer that thi might be the case if the effect of the bounti wa to rais the real price of corn or to enabl the farmer with an equal quantiti of it to maintain a greater number of labour in the same manner whether liber moder or scanti than other labour ar commonli maintain in hi neighbourhood but neither the bounti it is evid nor ani other human institut can have ani such effect it is not the real but the nomin price of corn which can in ani consider degre be affect by the bounti and though the tax which that institut impos upon the whole bodi of the peopl mai be veri burdensom to those who pai it it is of veri littl advantag to those who receiv it the real effect of the bounti is not so much to rais the real valu of corn as to degrad the real valu of silver or to make an equal quantiti of it exchang for a smaller quantiti not onli of corn but of all other home made commod for the monei price of corn regul that of all other home made commod it regul the monei price of labour which must alwai be such as to enabl the labour to purchas a quantiti of corn suffici to maintain him and hi famili either in the liber moder or scanti manner in which the advanc stationari or declin circumst of the societi oblig hi employ to maintain him it regul the monei price of all the other part of the rude produc of land which in everi period of improv must bear a certain proport to that of corn though thi proport is differ in differ period it regul for exampl the monei price of grass and hai of butcher meat of hors and the mainten of hors of land carriag consequ or of the greater part of the inland commerc of the countri by regul the monei price of all the other part of the rude produc of land it regul that of the materi of almost all manufactur by regul the monei price of labour it regul that of manufactur art and industri and by regul both it regul that of the complet manufactur the monei price of labour and of everi thing that is the produc either of land or labour must necessarili either rise or fall in proport to the monei price of corn though in consequ of the bounti therefor the farmer should be enabl to sell hi corn for s the bushel instead of s d and to pai hi landlord a monei rent proportion to thi rise in the monei price of hi produc yet if in consequ of thi rise in the price of corn s will purchas no more home made good of ani other kind than s d would have done befor neither the circumst of the farmer nor those of the landlord will be much mend by thi chang the farmer will not be abl to cultiv much better the landlord will not be abl to live much better in the purchas of foreign commod thi enhanc in the price of corn mai give them some littl advantag in that of home made commod it can give them none at all and almost the whole expens of the farmer and the far greater part even of that of the landlord is in home made commod that degrad in the valu of silver which is the effect of the fertil of the mine and which oper equal or veri nearli equal through the greater part of the commerci world is a matter of veri littl consequ to ani particular countri the consequ rise of all monei price though it doe not make those who receiv them realli richer doe not make them realli poorer a servic of plate becom realli cheaper and everi thing els remain precis of the same real valu as befor but that degrad in the valu of silver which be the effect either of the peculiar situat or of the polit institut of a particular countri take place onli in that countri is a matter of veri great consequ which far from tend to make anybodi realli richer tend to make everi bodi realli poorer the rise in the monei price of all commod which is in thi case peculiar to that countri tend to discourag more or less everi sort of industri which is carri on within it and to enabl foreign nation by furnish almost all sort of good for a smaller quantiti of silver than it own workmen can afford to do to undersel them not onli in the foreign but even in the home market it is the peculiar situat of spain and portug as proprietor of the mine to be the distribut of gold and silver to all the other countri of europ those metal ought natur therefor to be somewhat cheaper in spain and portug than in ani other part of europ the differ howev should be no more than the amount of the freight and insur and on account of the great valu and small bulk of those metal their freight is no great matter and their insur is the same as that of ani other good of equal valu spain and portug therefor could suffer veri littl from their peculiar situat if thei did not aggrav it disadvantag by their polit institut spain by tax and portug by prohibit the export of gold and silver load that export with the expens of smuggl and rais the valu of those metal in other countri so much more abov what it is in their own by the whole amount of thi expens when you dam up a stream of water as soon as the dam is full as much water must run over the damhead as if there wa no dam at all the prohibit of export cannot detain a greater quantiti of gold and silver in spain and portug than what thei can afford to emploi than what the annual produc of their land and labour will allow them to emploi in coin plate gild and other ornament of gold and silver when thei have got thi quantiti the dam is full and the whole stream which flow in afterward must run over the annual export of gold and silver from spain and portug accordingli is by all account notwithstand these restraint veri near equal to the whole annual import as the water howev must alwai be deeper behind the damhead than befor it so the quantiti of gold and silver which these restraint detain in spain and portug must in proport to the annual produc of their land and labour be greater than what is to be found in other countri the higher and stronger the damhead the greater must be the differ in the depth of water behind and befor it the higher the tax the higher the penalti with which the prohibit is guard the more vigil and sever the polic which look after the execut of the law the greater must be the differ in the proport of gold and silver to the annual produc of the land and labour of spain and portug and to that of other countri it is said accordingli to be veri consider and that you frequent find there a profus of plate in hous where there is noth els which would in other countri be thought suitabl or correspond to thi sort of magnific the cheap of gold and silver or what is the same thing the dear of all commod which is the necessari effect of thi redund of the preciou metal discourag both the agricultur and manufactur of spain and portug and enabl foreign nation to suppli them with mani sort of rude and with almost all sort of manufactur produc for a smaller quantiti of gold and silver than what thei themselv can either rais or make them for at home the tax and prohibit oper in two differ wai thei not onli lower veri much the valu of the preciou metal in spain and portug but by detain there a certain quantiti of those metal which would otherwis flow over other countri thei keep up their valu in those other countri somewhat abov what it otherwis would be and therebi give those countri a doubl advantag in their commerc with spain and portug open the floodgat and there will present be less water abov and more below the damhead and it will soon come to a level in both place remov the tax and the prohibit and as the quantiti of gold and silver will diminish consider in spain and portug so it will increas somewhat in other countri and the valu of those metal their proport to the annual produc of land and labour will soon come to a level or veri near to a level in all the loss which spain and portug could sustain by thi export of their gold and silver would be altogeth nomin and imaginari the nomin valu of their good and of the annual produc of their land and labour would fall and would be express or repres by a smaller quantiti of silver than befor but their real valu would be the same as befor and would be suffici to maintain command and emploi the same quantiti of labour as the nomin valu of their good would fall the real valu of what remain of their gold and silver would rise and a smaller quantiti of those metal would answer all the same purpos of commerc and circul which had emploi a greater quantiti befor the gold and silver which would go abroad would not go abroad for noth but would bring back an equal valu of good of some kind or other those good too would not be all matter of mere luxuri and expens to be consum by idl peopl who produc noth in return for their consumpt as the real wealth and revenu of idl peopl would not be augment by thi extraordinari export of gold and silver so neither would their consumpt be much augment by it those good would probabl the greater part of them and certainli some part of them consist in materi tool and provis for the employ and mainten of industri peopl who would reproduc with a profit the full valu of their consumpt a part of the dead stock of the societi would thu be turn into activ stock and would put into motion a greater quantiti of industri than had been emploi befor the annual produc of their land and labour would immedi be augment a littl and in a few year would probabl be augment a great deal their industri be thu reliev from on of the most oppress burden which it at present labour under the bounti upon the export of corn necessarili oper exactli in the same wai as thi absurd polici of spain and portug whatev be the actual state of tillag it render our corn somewhat dearer in the home market than it otherwis would be in that state and somewhat cheaper in the foreign and as the averag monei price of corn regul more or less that of all other commod it lower the valu of silver consider in the on and tend to rais it a littl in the other it enabl foreign the dutch in particular not onli to eat our corn cheaper than thei otherwis could do but sometim to eat it cheaper than even our own peopl can do upon the same occas as we ar assur by an excel author that of sir matthew decker it hinder our own workmen from furnish their good for so small a quantiti of silver as thei otherwis might do and enabl the dutch to furnish their for a smaller it tend to render our manufactur somewhat dearer in everi market and their somewhat cheaper than thei otherwis would be and consequ to give their industri a doubl advantag over our own the bounti as it rais in the home market not so much the real as the nomin price of our corn as it augment not the quantiti of labour which a certain quantiti of corn can maintain and emploi but onli the quantiti of silver which it will exchang for it discourag our manufactur without render ani consider servic either to our farmer or countri gentlemen it put inde a littl more monei into the pocket of both and it will perhap be somewhat difficult to persuad the greater part of them that thi is not render them a veri consider servic but if thi monei sink in it valu in the quantiti of labour provis and homemad commod of all differ kind which it is capabl of purchas as much as it rise in it quantiti the servic will be littl more than nomin and imaginari there is perhap but on set of men in the whole commonwealth to whom the bounti either wa or could be essenti servic these were the corn merchant the export and import of corn in year of plenti the bounti necessarili occas a greater export than would otherwis have taken place and by hinder the plenti of the on year from reliev the scarciti of anoth it occas in year of scarciti a greater import than would otherwis have been necessari it increas the busi of the corn merchant in both and in the year of scarciti it not onli enabl him to import a greater quantiti but to sell it for a better price and consequ with a greater profit than he could otherwis have made if the plenti of on year had not been more or less hinder from reliev the scarciti of anoth it is in thi set of men accordingli that i have observ the greatest zeal for the continu or renew of the bounti our countri gentlemen when thei impos the high duti upon the export of foreign corn which in time of moder plenti amount to a prohibit and when thei establish the bounti seem to have imit the conduct of our manufactur by the on institut thei secur to themselv the monopoli of the home market and by the other thei endeavour to prevent that market from ever be overstock with their commod by both thei endeavour to rais it real valu in the same manner as our manufactur had by the like institut rais the real valu of mani differ sort of manufactur good thei did not perhap attend to the great and essenti differ which natur ha establish between corn and almost everi other sort of good when either by the monopoli of the home market or by a bounti upon export you enabl our woollen or linen manufactur to sell their good for somewhat a better price than thei otherwis could get for them you rais not onli the nomin but the real price of those good you render them equival to a greater quantiti of labour and subsist you increas not onli the nomin but the real profit the real wealth and revenu of those manufactur and you enabl them either to live better themselv or to emploi a greater quantiti of labour in those particular manufactur you realli encourag those manufactur and direct toward them a greater quantiti of the industri of the countri than what would properli go to them of it own accord but when by the like institut you rais the nomin or monei price of corn you do not rais it real valu you do not increas the real wealth the real revenu either of our farmer or countri gentlemen you do not encourag the growth of corn becaus you do not enabl them to maintain and emploi more labour in rais it the natur of thing ha stamp upon corn a real valu which cannot be alter by mere alter it monei price no bounti upon export no monopoli of the home market can rais that valu the freest competit cannot lower it through the world in gener that valu is equal to the quantiti of labour which it can maintain and in everi particular place it is equal to the quantiti of labour which it can maintain in the wai whether liber moder or scanti in which labour is commonli maintain in that place woollen or linen cloth ar not the regul commod by which the real valu of all other commod must be final measur and determin corn is the real valu of everi other commod is final measur and determin by the proport which it averag monei price bear to the averag monei price of corn the real valu of corn doe not vari with those variat in it averag monei price which sometim occur from on centuri to anoth it is the real valu of silver which vari with them bounti upon the export of ani homemad commod ar liabl first to that gener object which mai be made to all the differ expedi of the mercantil system the object of forc some part of the industri of the countri into a channel less advantag than that in which it would run of it own accord and secondli to the particular object of forc it not onli into a channel that is less advantag but into on that is actual disadvantag the trade which cannot be carri on but by mean of a bounti be necessarili a lose trade the bounti upon the export of corn is liabl to thi further object that it can in no respect promot the rais of that particular commod of which it wa meant to encourag the product when our countri gentlemen therefor demand the establish of the bounti though thei act in imit of our merchant and manufactur thei did not act with that complet comprehens of their own interest which commonli direct the conduct of those two other order of peopl thei load the public revenu with a veri consider expens thei impos a veri heavi tax upon the whole bodi of the peopl but thei did not in ani sensibl degre increas the real valu of their own commod and by lower somewhat the real valu of silver thei discourag in some degre the gener industri of the countri and instead of advanc retard more or less the improv of their own land which necessarili depend upon the gener industri of the countri to encourag the product of ani commod a bounti upon product on should imagin would have a more direct oper than on upon export it would besid impos onli on tax upon the peopl that which thei must contribut in order to pai the bounti instead of rais it would tend to lower the price of the commod in the home market and therebi instead of impos a second tax upon the peopl it might at least in part repai them for what thei had contribut to the first bounti upon product howev have been veri rare grant the prejudic establish by the commerci system have taught us to believ that nation wealth aris more immedi from export than from product it ha been more favour accordingli as the more immedi mean of bring monei into the countri bounti upon product it ha been said too have been found by experi more liabl to fraud than those upon export how far thi is true i know not that bounti upon export have been abus to mani fraudul purpos is veri well known but it is not the interest of merchant and manufactur the great inventor of all these expedi that the home market should be overstock with their good an event which a bounti upon product might sometim occas a bounti upon export by enabl them to send abroad their surplu part and to keep up the price of what remain in the home market effectu prevent thi of all the expedi of the mercantil system accordingli it is the on of which thei ar the fondest i have known the differ undertak of some particular work agre privat among themselv to give a bounti out of their own pocket upon the export of a certain proport of the good which thei dealt in thi expedi succeed so well that it more than doubl the price of their good in the home market notwithstand a veri consider increas in the produc the oper of the bounti upon corn must have been wonderfulli differ if it ha lower the monei price of that commod someth like a bounti upon product howev ha been grant upon some particular occas the tonnag bounti given to the white her and whale fisheri mai perhap be consid as somewhat of thi natur thei tend directli it mai be suppos to render the good cheaper in the home market than thei otherwis would be in other respect their effect it must be acknowledg ar the same as those of bounti upon export by mean of them a part of the capit of the countri is emploi in bring good to market of which the price doe not repai the cost togeth with the ordinari profit of stock but though the tonnag bounti to those fisheri do not contribut to the opul of the nation it mai perhap be thought that thei contribut to it defenc by augment the number of it sailor and ship thi it mai be alleg mai sometim be done by mean of such bounti at a much smaller expens than by keep up a great stand navi if i mai us such an express in the same wai as a stand armi notwithstand these favour alleg howev the follow consider dispos me to believ that in grant at least on of these bounti the legislatur ha been veri grossli impos upon first the herringbuss bounti seem too larg from the commenc of the winter fish to the end of the winter fish the tonnag bounti upon the herringbuss fisheri ha been at thirti shill the ton dure these eleven year the whole number of barrel caught by the herringbuss fisheri of scotland amount to the her caught and cure at sea ar call seastick in order to render them what ar call merchant her it is necessari to repack them with an addit quantiti of salt and in thi case it is reckon that three barrel of seastick ar usual repack into two barrel of merchant her the number of barrel of merchant her therefor caught dure these eleven year will amount onli accord to thi account to dure these eleven year the tonnag bounti paid amount to s or s d upon everi barrel of seastick and to s d upon everi barrel of merchant her the salt with which these her ar cure is sometim scotch and sometim foreign salt both which ar deliv free of all excis duti to the fishcur the excis duti upon scotch salt is at present s d that upon foreign salt s the bushel a barrel of her is suppos to requir about on bushel and onefourth of a bushel foreign salt two bushel ar the suppos averag of scotch salt if the her ar enter for export no part of thi duti is paid up if enter for home consumpt whether the her were cure with foreign or with scotch salt onli on shill the barrel is paid up it wa the old scotch duti upon a bushel of salt the quantiti which at a low estim had been suppos necessari for cure a barrel of her in scotland foreign salt is veri littl us for ani other purpos but the cure of fish but from the th april to the th april the quantiti of foreign salt import amount to bushel at eightyfour pound the bushel the quantiti of scotch salt deliv from the work to the fishcur to no more than at fiftysix pound the bushel onli it would appear therefor that it is princip foreign salt that is us in the fisheri upon everi barrel of her export there is besid a bounti of s d and more than twothird of the busscaught her ar export put all these thing togeth and you will find that dure these eleven year everi barrel of busscaught her cure with scotch salt when export ha cost govern s d and when enter for home consumpt s d and that everi barrel cure with foreign salt when export ha cost govern d and when enter for home consumpt d the price of a barrel of good merchant her run from seventeen and eighteen to four and fiveandtwenti shill about a guinea at an averag see the account at the end of thi book secondli the bounti to the whiteh fisheri is a tonnag bounti and is proport to the burden of the ship not to her dilig or success in the fisheri and it ha i am afraid been too common for the vessel to fit out for the sole purpos of catch not the fish but the bounti in the year when the bounti wa at fifti shill the ton the whole buss fisheri of scotland brought in onli four barrel of seastick in that year each barrel of seastick cost govern in bounti alon s each barrel of merchant her thirdli the mode of fish for which thi tonnag bounti in the white her fisheri ha been given by buss or deck vessel from twenti to eighti ton burden seem not so well adapt to the situat of scotland as to that of holland from the practic of which countri it appear to have been borrow holland li at a great distanc from the sea to which her ar known princip to resort and can therefor carri on that fisheri onli in deck vessel which can carri water and provis suffici for a voyag to a distant sea but the hebrid or western island the island of shetland and the northern and northwestern coast of scotland the countri in whose neighbourhood the her fisheri is princip carri on ar everywher intersect by arm of the sea which run up a consider wai into the land and which in the languag of the countri ar call sealoch it is to these sealoch that the her princip resort dure the season in which thei visit these sea for the visit of thi and i am assur of mani other sort of fish ar not quit regular and constant a boatfisheri therefor seem to be the mode of fish best adapt to the peculiar situat of scotland the fisher carri the her on shore as fast as thei ar taken to be either cure or consum fresh but the great encourag which a bounti of s the ton give to the bussfisheri is necessarili a discourag to the boatfisheri which have no such bounti cannot bring it cure fish to market upon the same term as the bussfisheri the boatfisheri accordingli which befor the establish of the bussbounti wa veri consider and is said to have emploi a number of seamen not inferior to what the bussfisheri emploi at present is now gone almost entir to decai of the former extent howev of thi now ruin and abandon fisheri i must acknowledg that i cannot pretend to speak with much precis as no bounti waspaid upon the outfit of the boatfisheri no account wa taken of it by the offic of the custom or salt duti fourthli in mani part of scotland dure certain season of the year her make no inconsider part of the food of the common peopl a bounti which tend to lower their price in the home market might contribut a good deal to the relief of a great number of our fellowsubject whose circumst ar by no mean affluent but the herringbu bounti contribut to no such good purpos it ha ruin the boat fisheri which is by far the best adapt for the suppli of the home market and the addit bounti of s d the barrel upon export carri the greater part more than twothird of the produc of the bussfisheri abroad between thirti and forti year ago befor the establish of the bussbounti s the barrel i have been assur wa the common price of white her between ten and fifteen year ago befor the boatfisheri wa entir ruin the price wa said to have run from seventeen to twenti shill the barrel for these last five year it ha at an averag been at twentyf shill the barrel thi high price howev mai have been ow to the real scarciti of the her upon the coast of scotland i must observ too that the cask or barrel which is usual sold with the her and of which the price is includ in all the forego price ha sinc the commenc of the american war risen to about doubl it former price or from about s to about s i must likewis observ that the account i have receiv of the price of former time have been by no mean quit uniform and consist and an old man of great accuraci and experi ha assur me that more than fifti year ago a guinea wa the usual price of a barrel of good merchant her and thi i imagin mai still be look upon as the averag price all account howev i think agre that the price ha not been lower in the home market in consequ of the bussbounti when the undertak of fisheri after such liber bounti have been bestow upon them continu to sell their commod at the same or even at a higher price than thei were accustom to do befor it might be expect that their profit should be veri great and it is not improb that those of some individu mai have been so in gener howev i have everi reason to believ thei have been quit otherwis the usual effect of such bounti is to encourag rash undertak to adventur in a busi which thei do not understand and what thei lose by their own neglig and ignor more than compens all that thei can gain by the utmost liber of govern in by the same

manufactur wa necessari inde for the defenc of the societi it might not alwai be prudent to depend upon our neighbour for the suppli and if such manufactur could not otherwis be support at home it might not be unreason that all the other branch of industri should be tax in order to support it the bounti upon the export of british made sailcloth and british made gunpowd mai perhap both be vindic upon thi principl but though it can veri seldom be reason to tax the industri of the great bodi of the peopl in order to support that of some particular class of manufactur yet in the wanton of great prosper when the public enjoi a greater revenu than it know well what to do with to give such bounti to favourit manufactur mai perhap be as natur as to incur ani other idl expens in public as well as in privat expens great wealth mai perhap frequent be admit as an apolog for great folli but there must sure be someth more than ordinari absurd in continu such profus in time of gener difficulti and distress what is call a bounti is sometim no more than a drawback and consequ is not liabl to the same object as what is properli a bounti the bounti for exampl upon refin sugar export mai be consid

sometim call premium as drawback ar sometim call bounti but we must in all case attend to the natur of the thing without pai ani regard to the word digress concern the corn trade and corn law i cannot conclud thi chapter concern bounti without observ that the prais which have been bestow upon the law which establish the bounti upon the export of corn and upon that system of regul which is connect with it ar altogeth unmerit a particular examin of the natur of the corn trade and of the princip british law which relat to it will suffici demonstr the truth of thi assert the great import of thi subject must justifi the length of the digress the trade of the corn merchant is compos of four differ branch which though thei mai sometim be all carri on by the same person ar in their own natur four separ and distinct trade these ar first the trade of the inland dealer secondli that of the merchantimport for home consumpt thirdli that of the merchantexport of home produc for foreign consumpt and fourthli that of the merchantcarri or of the import of corn in order to export it again i the interest of the inland dealer and that of the great bodi of the peopl how opposit soever thei mai at first appear ar even in year of the greatest scarciti exactli the same it is hi interest to rais the price of hi corn as high as the real scarciti of the season requir and it can never be hi interest to rais it higher by rais the price he discourag the consumpt and put everi bodi more or less but particularli the inferior rank of peopl upon thrift and good manag if by rais it too high he discourag the consumpt so much that the suppli of the season is like to go beyond the consumpt of the season and to last for some time after the next crop begin to come in he run the hazard not onli of lose a consider part of hi corn by natur caus but of be oblig to sell what remain of it for much less than what he might have had for it sever month befor if by not rais the price high enough he discourag the consumpt so littl that the suppli of the season is like to fall short of the consumpt of the season he not onli lose a part of the profit which he might otherwis have made but he expos the peopl to suffer befor the end of the season instead of the hardship of a dearth the dread horror of a famin it is the interest of the peopl that their daili weekli and monthli consumpt should be proport as exactli as possibl to the suppli of the season the interest of the inland corn dealer is the same by suppli them as nearli as he can judg in thi proport he is like to sell all hi corn for the highest price and with the greatest profit and hi knowledg of the state of the crop and of hi daili weekli and monthli sale enabl him to judg with more or less accuraci how far thei realli ar suppli in thi manner without intend the interest of the peopl he is necessarili led by a regard to hi own interest to treat them even in year of scarciti pretti much in the same manner as the prudent master of a vessel is sometim oblig to treat hi crew when he forese that provis ar like to run short he put them upon short allow though from excess of caution he should sometim do thi without ani real necess yet all the inconveni which hi crew can therebi suffer ar inconsider in comparison of the danger miseri and ruin to which thei might sometim be expos by a less provid conduct though from excess of avaric in the same manner the inland corn merchant should sometim rais the price of hi corn somewhat higher than the scarciti of the season requir yet all the inconveni which the peopl can suffer from thi conduct which effectu secur them from a famin in the end of the season ar inconsider in comparison of what thei might have been expos to by a more liber wai of deal in the begin of it the corn merchant himself is like to suffer the most by thi excess of avaric not onli from the indign which it gener excit against him but though he should escap the effect of thi indign from the quantiti of corn which it necessarili leav upon hi hand in the end of the season and which if the next season happen to prove favour he must alwai sell for a much lower price than he might otherwis have had were it possibl inde for on great compani of merchant to possess themselv of the whole crop of an extens countri it might perhap be their interest to deal with it as the dutch ar said to do with the spiceri of the molucca to destroi or throw awai a consider part of it in order to keep up the price of the rest but it is scarc possibl even by the violenc of law to establish such an extens monopoli with regard to corn and wherev the law leav the trade free it is of all commod the least liabl to be engross or monopol by the forc a few larg capit which bui up the greater part of it not onli it valu far exce what the capit of a few privat men ar capabl of purchas but suppos thei were capabl of purchas it the manner in which it is produc render thi purchas altogeth impractic as in everi civil countri it is the commod of which the annual consumpt is the greatest so a greater quantiti of industri is annual emploi in produc corn than in produc ani other commod when it first come from the ground too it is necessarili divid among a greater number of owner than ani other commod and these owner can never be collect into on place like a number of independ manufactur but ar necessarili scatter through all the differ corner of the countri these first owner either immedi suppli the consum in their own neighbourhood or thei suppli other inland dealer who suppli those consum the inland dealer in corn therefor includ both the farmer and the baker ar necessarili more numer than the dealer in ani other commod and their dispers situat render it altogeth imposs for them to enter into ani gener combin if in a year of scarciti therefor ani of them should find that he had a good deal more corn upon hand than at the current price he could hope to dispos of befor the end of the season he would never think of keep up thi price to hi own loss and to the sole benefit of hi rival and competitor but would immedi lower it in order to get rid of hi corn befor the new crop began to come in the same motiv the same interest which would thu regul the conduct of ani on dealer would regul that of everi other and oblig them all in gener to sell their corn at the price which accord to the best of their judgment wa most suitabl to the scarciti or plenti of the season whoever examin with attent the histori of the dearth and famin which have afflict ani part of europ dure either the cours of the present or that of the two preced centuri of sever of which we have pretti exact account will find i believ that a dearth never ha arisen from ani combin among the inland dealer in corn nor from ani other caus but a real scarciti occas sometim perhap and in some particular place by the wast of war but in by far the greatest number of case by the fault of the season and that a famin ha never arisen from ani other caus but the violenc of govern attempt by improp mean to remedi the inconveni of a dearth in an extens corn countri between all the differ part of which there is a free commerc and commun the scarciti occas by the most unfavour season can never be so great as to produc a famin and the scantiest crop if manag with frugal and economi will maintain through the year the same number of peopl that ar commonli fed in a more affluent manner by on of moder plenti the season most unfavour to the crop ar those of excess drought or excess rain but as corn grow equal upon high and low land upon ground that ar dispos to be too wet and upon those that ar dispos to be too dry either the drought or the rain which is hurt to on part of the countri is favour to anoth and though both in the wet and in the dry season the crop is a good deal less than in on more properli temper yet in both what is lost in on part of the countri is in some measur compens by what is gain in the other in rice countri where the crop not onli requir a veri moist soil but where in a certain period of it grow it must be laid under water the effect of a drought ar much more dismal even in such countri howev the drought is perhap scarc ever so univers as necessarili to occas a famin if the govern would allow a free trade the drought in bengal a few year ago might probabl have occas a veri great dearth some improp regul some injudici restraint impos by the servant of the east india compani upon the rice trade contribut perhap to turn that dearth into a famin when the govern in order to remedi the inconveni of a dearth order all the dealer to sell their corn at what it suppos a reason price it either hinder them from bring it to market which mai sometim produc a famin even in the begin of the season or if thei bring it thither it enabl the peopl and therebi encourag them to consum it so fast as must necessarili produc a famin befor the end of the season the unlimit unrestrain freedom of the corn trade as it is the onli effectu prevent of the miseri of a famin so it is the best palli of the inconveni of a dearth for the inconveni of a real scarciti cannot be remedi thei can onli be palliat no trade deserv more the full protect of the law and no trade requir it so much becaus no trade is so much expos to popular odium in year of scarciti the inferior rank of peopl imput their distress to the avaric of the corn merchant who becom the object of their hatr and indign instead of make profit upon such occas therefor he is often in danger of be utterli ruin and of have hi magazin plunder and destroi by their violenc it is in year of scarciti howev when price ar high that the corn merchant expect to make hi princip profit he is gener in contract with some farmer to furnish him for a certain number of year with a certain quantiti of corn at a certain price thi contract price is settl accord to what is suppos to be the moder and reason that is the ordinari or averag price which befor the late year of scarciti wa commonli about s for the quarter of wheat and for that of other grain in proport in year of scarciti therefor the corn merchant bui a great part of hi corn for the ordinari price and sell it for a much higher that thi extraordinari profit howev is no more than suffici to put hi trade upon a fair level with other trade and to compens the mani loss which he sustain upon other occas both from the perish natur of the commod itself and from the frequent and unforeseen fluctuat of it price seem evid enough from thi singl circumst that great fortun ar as seldom made in thi as in ani other trade the popular odium howev which attend it in year of scarciti the onli year in which it can be veri profit render peopl of charact and fortun avers to enter into it it is abandon to an inferior set of dealer and miller baker mealmen and mealfactor togeth with a number of wretch huckster ar almost the onli middl peopl that in the home market come between the grower and the consum the ancient polici of europ instead of discountenanc thi popular odium against a trade so benefici to the public seem on the contrari to have authoris and encourag it by the th and th of edward vi cap it wa enact that whoever should bui ani corn or grain with intent to sell it again should be reput an unlaw engross and should for the first fault suffer two month imprison and forfeit the valu of the corn for the second suffer six month imprison and forfeit doubl the valu and for the third be set in the pillori suffer imprison dure the king pleasur and forfeit all hi good and chattel the ancient polici of most other part of europ wa no better than that of england our ancestor seem to have imagin that the peopl would bui their corn cheaper of the farmer than of the corn merchant who thei were afraid would requir over and abov the price which he paid to the farmer an exorbit profit to himself thei endeavour therefor to annihil hi trade altogeth thei even endeavour to hinder as much as possibl ani middl man of ani kind from come in between the grower and the consum and thi wa the mean of the mani restraint which thei impos upon the trade of those whom thei call kidder or carrier of corn a trade which nobodi wa allow to exercis without a licenc ascertain hi qualif as a man of probiti and fair deal the author of three justic of the peac wa by the statut of edward vi necessari in order to grant thi licenc but even thi restraint wa afterward thought insuffici and by a statut of elizabeth the privileg of grant it wa confin to the quartersess the ancient polici of europ endeavour in thi manner to regul agricultur the great trade of the countri by maxim quit differ from those which it establish with regard to manufactur the great trade of the town by leav a farmer no other custom but either the consum or their immedi factor the kidder and carrier of corn it endeavour to forc him to exercis the trade not onli of a farmer but of a corn merchant or corn retail on the contrari it in mani case prohibit the manufactur from exercis the trade of a shopkeep or from sell hi own good by retail it meant by the on law to promot the gener interest of the countri or to render corn cheap without perhap it be well understood how thi wa to be done by the other it meant to promot that of a particular order of men the shopkeep who would be so much undersold by the manufactur it wa suppos that their trade would be ruin if he wa allow to retail at all the manufactur howev though he had been allow to keep a shop and to sell hi own good by retail could not have undersold the common shopkeep whatev part of hi capit he might have place in hi shop he must have withdrawn it from hi manufactur in order to carri on hi busi on a level with that of other peopl as he must have had the profit of a manufactur on the on part so he must have had that of a shopkeep upon the other let us suppos for exampl that in the particular town where he live ten per cent wa the ordinari profit both of manufactur and shopkeep stock he must in thi case have charg upon everi piec of hi own good which he sold in hi shop a profit of twenti per cent when he carri them from hi workhous to hi shop he must have valu them at the price for which he could have sold them to a dealer or shopkeep who would have bought them by wholesal if he valu them lower he lost a part of the profit of hi manufactur capit when again he sold them from hi shop unless he got the same price at which a shopkeep would have sold them he lost a part of the profit of hi shopkeep capit though he might appear therefor to make a doubl profit upon the same piec of good yet as these good made success a part of two distinct capit he made but a singl profit upon the whole capit emploi about them and if he made less than hi profit he wa a loser and did not emploi hi whole capit with the same advantag as the greater part of hi neighbour what the manufactur wa prohibit to do the farmer wa in some measur enjoin to do to divid hi capit between two differ employ to keep on part of it in hi granari and stackyard for suppli the occasion demand of the market and to emploi the other in the cultiv of hi land but as he could not afford to emploi the latter for less than the ordinari profit of farm stock so he could as littl afford to emploi the former for less than the ordinari profit of mercantil stock whether the stock which realli carri on the busi of a corn merchant belong to the person who wa call a farmer or to the person who wa call a corn merchant an equal profit wa in both case requisit in order to indemnifi it owner for emploi it in thi manner in order to put hi busi on a level with other trade and in order to hinder him from have an interest to chang it as soon as possibl for some other the farmer therefor who wa thu forc to exercis the trade of a corn merchant could not afford to sell hi corn cheaper than ani other corn merchant would have been oblig to do in the case of a free competit the dealer who can emploi hi whole stock in on singl branch of busi ha an advantag of the same kind with the workman who can emploi hi whole labour in on singl oper as the latter acquir a dexter which enabl him with the same two hand to perform a much greater quantiti of work so the former acquir so easi and readi a method of transact hi busi of bui and dispos of hi good that with the same capit he can transact a much greater quantiti of busi as the on can commonli afford hi work a good deal cheaper so the other can commonli afford hi good somewhat cheaper than if hi stock and attent were both emploi about a greater varieti of object the greater part of manufactur could not afford to retail their own good so cheap as a vigil and activ shopkeep whose sole busi it wa to bui them by wholesal and to retail them again the greater part of farmer could still less afford to retail their own corn to suppli the inhabit of a town at perhap four or five mile distanc from the greater part of them so cheap as a vigil and activ corn merchant whose sole busi it wa to purchas corn by wholesal to collect it into a great magazin and to retail it again the law which prohibit the manufactur from exercis the trade of a shopkeep endeavour to forc thi divis in the employ of stock to go on faster than it might otherwis have done the law which oblig the farmer to exercis the trade of a corn merchant endeavour to hinder it from go on so fast both law were evid violat of natur liberti and therefor unjust and thei were both too as impolit as thei were unjust it is the interest of everi societi that thing of thi kind should never either he forc or obstruct the man who emploi either hi labour or hi stock in a greater varieti of wai than hi situat render necessari can never hurt hi neighbour by undersel him he mai hurt himself and he gener doe so jackofalltrad will never be rich sai the proverb but the law ought alwai to trust peopl with the care of their own interest as in their local situat thei must gener be abl to judg better of it than the legislatur can do the law howev which oblig the farmer to exercis the trade of a corn merchant wa by far the most pernici of the two it obstruct not onli that divis in the employ of stock which is so advantag to everi societi but it obstruct likewis the improv and cultiv of the land by oblig the farmer to carri on two trade instead of on it forc him to divid hi capit into two part of which on onli could be emploi in cultiv but if he had been at liberti to sell hi whole crop to a corn merchant as fast as he could thresh it out hi whole capit might have return immedi to the land and have been emploi in bui more cattl and hire more servant in order to improv and cultiv it better but by be oblig to sell hi corn by retail he wa oblig to keep a great part of hi capit in hi granari and stackyard through the year and could not therefor cultiv so well as with the same capit he might otherwis have done thi law therefor necessarili obstruct the improv of the land and instead of tend to render corn cheaper must have tend to render it scarcer and therefor dearer than it would otherwis have been after the busi of the farmer that of the corn merchant is in realiti the trade which if properli protect and encourag would contribut the most to the rais of corn it would support the trade of the farmer in the same manner as the trade of the wholesal dealer support that of the manufactur the wholesal dealer by afford a readi market to the manufactur by take hi good off hi hand as fast as he can make them and by sometim even advanc their price to him befor he ha made them enabl him to keep hi whole capit and sometim even more than hi whole capit constantli emploi in manufactur and consequ to manufactur a much greater quantiti of good than if he wa oblig to dispos of them himself to the immedi consum or even to the retail as the capit of the wholesal merchant too is gener suffici to replac that of mani manufactur thi intercours between him and them interest the owner of a larg capit to support the owner of a great number of small on and to assist them in those loss and misfortun which might otherwis prove ruinou to them an intercours of the same kind univers establish between the farmer and the corn merchant would be attend with effect equal benefici to the farmer thei would be enabl to keep their whole capit and even more than their whole capit constantli emploi in cultiv in case of ani of those accid to which no trade is more liabl than their thei would find in their ordinari custom the wealthi corn merchant a person who had both an interest to support them and the abil to do it and thei would not as at present be entir depend upon the forbear of their landlord or the merci of hi steward were it possibl as perhap it is not to establish thi intercours univers and all at onc were it possibl to turn all at onc the whole farm stock of the kingdom to it proper busi the cultiv of land withdraw it from everi other employ into which ani part of it mai be at present divert and were it possibl in order to support and assist upon occas the oper of thi great stock to provid all at onc anoth stock almost equal great it is not perhap veri easi to imagin how great how extens and how sudden would be the improv which thi chang of circumst would alon produc upon the whole face of the countri the statut of edward vi therefor by prohibit as much as possibl ani middl man from come in between the grower and the consum endeavour to annihil a trade of which the free exercis is not onli the best palli of the inconveni of a dearth but the best prevent of that calam after the trade of the farmer no trade contribut so much to the grow of corn as that of the corn merchant the rigour of thi law wa afterward soften by sever subsequ statut which success permit the engross of corn when the price of wheat should not exce s and s s and s the quarter at last by the th of charl ii c the engross or bui of corn in order to sell it again as long as the price of wheat did not exce s the quarter and that of other grain in proport wa declar law to all person not be forestal that is not sell again in the same market within three month all the freedom which the trade of the inland corn dealer ha ever yet enjoi wa bestow upon it by thi statut the statut of the twelfth of the present king which repeal almost all the other ancient law against engross and forestal doe not repeal the restrict of thi particular statut which therefor still continu in forc thi statut howev authoris in some measur two veri absurd popular prejudic first it suppos that when the price of wheat ha risen so high as s the quarter and that of other grain in proport corn is like to be so engross as to hurt the peopl but from what ha been alreadi said it seem evid enough that corn can at no price be so engross by the inland dealer as to hurt the peopl and s the quarter besid though it mai be consid as a veri high price yet in year of scarciti it is a price which frequent take place immedi after harvest when scarc ani part of the new crop can be sold off and when it is imposs even for ignor to suppos that ani part of it can be so engross as to hurt the peopl secondli it suppos that there is a certain price at which corn is like to be forestal that is bought up in order to be sold again soon after in the same market so as to hurt the peopl but if a merchant ever bui up corn either go to a particular market or in a particular market in order to sell it again soon after in the same market it must be becaus he judg that the market cannot be so liber suppli through the whole season as upon that particular occas and that the price therefor must soon rise if he judg wrong in thi and if the price doe not rise he not onli lose the whole profit of the stock which he emploi in thi manner but a part of the stock itself by the expens and loss which necessarili attend the store and keep of corn he hurt himself therefor much more essenti than he can hurt even the particular peopl whom he mai hinder from suppli themselv upon that particular market dai becaus thei mai afterward suppli themselv just as cheap upon ani other market dai if he judg right instead of hurt the great bodi of the peopl he render them a most import servic by make them feel the inconveni of a dearth somewhat earlier than thei otherwis might do he prevent their feel them afterward so sever as thei certainli would do if the cheap of price encourag them to consum faster than suit the real scarciti of the season when the scarciti is real the best thing that can be done for the peopl is to divid the inconveni of it as equal as possibl through all the differ month and week and dai of the year the interest of the corn merchant make him studi to do thi as exactli as he can and as no other person can have either the same interest or the same knowledg or the same abil to do it so exactli as he thi most import oper of commerc ought to be trust entir to him or in other word the corn trade so far at least as concern the suppli of the home market ought to be left perfectli free the popular fear of engross and forestal mai be compar to the popular terror and suspicion of witchcraft the unfortun wretch accus of thi latter crime were not more innoc of the misfortun imput to them than those who have been accus of the former the law which put an end to all prosecut against witchcraft which put it out of ani man power to gratifi hi own malic by accus hi neighbour of that imaginari crime seem effectu to have put an end to those fear and suspicion by take awai the great caus which encourag and support them the law which would restor entir freedom to the inland trade of corn would probabl prove as effectu to put an end to the popular fear of engross and forestal the th of charl ii c howev with all it imperfect ha perhap contribut more both to the plenti suppli of the home market and to the increas of tillag than ani other law in the statut book it is from thi law that the inland corn trade ha deriv all the liberti and protect which it ha ever yet enjoi and both the suppli of the home market and the interest of tillag ar much more effectu promot by the inland than either by the import or export trade the proport of the averag quantiti of all sort of grain import into great britain to that of all sort of grain consum it ha been comput by the author of the tract upon the corn trade doe not exce that of on to five hundr and seventi for suppli the home market therefor the import of the inland trade must be to that of the import trade as five hundr and seventi to on the averag quantiti of all sort of grain export from great britain doe not accord to the same author exce the oneandthirtieth part of the annual produc for the encourag of tillag therefor by provid a market for the home produc the import of the inland trade must be to that of the export trade as thirti to on i have no great faith in polit arithmet and i mean not to warrant the exact of either of these comput i mention them onli in order to show of how much less consequ in the opinion of the most judici and experienc person the foreign trade of corn is than the home trade the great cheap of corn in the year immedi preced the establish of the bounti mai perhap with reason he ascrib in some measur to the oper of thi statut of charl ii which had been enact about fiveandtwenti year befor and which had therefor full time to produc it effect a veri few word will suffici explain all that i have to sai concern the other three branch of the corn trade ii the trade of the merchantimport of foreign corn for home consumpt evid contribut to the immedi suppli of the home market and must so far be immedi benefici to the great bodi of the peopl it tend inde to lower somewhat the averag monei price of corn but not to diminish it real valu or the quantiti of labour which it is capabl of maintain if import wa at all time free our farmer and countri gentlemen would probabl on year with anoth get less monei for their corn than thei do at present when import is at most time in effect prohibit but the monei which thei got would be of more valu would bui more good of all other kind and would emploi more labour their real wealth their real revenu therefor would be the same as at present though it might be express by a smaller quantiti of silver and thei would neither be disabl nor discourag from cultiv corn as much as thei do at present on the contrari as the rise in the real valu of silver in consequ of lower the monei price of corn lower somewhat the monei price of all other commod it give the industri of the countri where it take place some advantag in all foreign market and therebi tend to encourag and increas that industri but the extent of the home market for corn must be in proport to the gener industri of the countri where it grow or to the number of those who produc someth els and therefor have someth els or what come to the same thing the price of someth els to give in exchang for corn but in everi countri the home market as it is the nearest and most conveni so is it likewis the greatest and most import market for corn that rise in the real valu of silver therefor which is the effect of lower the averag monei price of corn tend to enlarg the greatest and most import market for corn and therebi to encourag instead of discourag it growth by the d of charl ii c the import of wheat whenev the price in the home market did not exce s d the quarter wa subject to a duti of s the quarter and to a duti of s whenev the price did not exce the former of these two price ha for more than a centuri past taken place onli in time of veri great scarciti and the latter ha so far as i know not taken place at all yet till wheat ha risen abov thi latter price it wa by thi statut subject to a veri high duti and till it had risen abov the former to a duti which amount to a prohibit the import of other sort of grain wa restrain at rate and by duti in proport to the valu of the grain almost equal high befor the th of the present king the

by the d of charl ii in place of the old subsidi partli by the new subsidi by the onethird and twothird subsidi and by the subsidi subsequ law still further increas those duti the distress which in year of scarciti the strict execut of those law might have brought upon the peopl would probabl have been veri great but upon such occas it execut wa gener suspend by temporari statut which permit for a limit time the import of foreign corn the necess of these temporari statut suffici demonstr the improprieti of thi gener on these restraint upon import though prior to the establish of the bounti were dictat by the same spirit by the same principl which afterward enact that regul how hurt soever in themselv these or some other restraint upon import becam necessari in consequ of that regul if when wheat wa either below s the quarter or not much abov it foreign corn could have been import either duti free or upon pai onli a small duti it might have been export again with the benefit of the

much more free than that of the inland dealer by the last of these statut corn could be engross at ani price for export but it could not be engross for inland sale except when the price did not exce s the quarter the interest of the inland dealer howev it ha alreadi been shown can never be opposit to that of the great bodi of the peopl that of the merchantexport mai and in fact sometim is if while hi own countri labour under a dearth a neighbour countri should be afflict with a famin it might be hi interest to carri corn to the latter countri in such quantiti as might veri much aggrav the calam

export when the price wa so high as s the quarter that market wa not even in time of consider scarciti allow to enjoi the whole of that growth the temporari law prohibit for a limit time the export of corn and take off for a limit time the duti upon it import expedi to which great britain ha been oblig so frequent to have recours suffici demonstr the improprieti of her gener system had that system been good she would not so frequent have been reduc to the necess of depart from it were all nation to follow the liber system of free export and free import the differ state into which a great contin wa divid would so far resembl the differ provinc of a great empir as among the differ provinc of a great empir the freedom of the inland trade appear both from reason and experi not onli the best

easier the commun through all the differ part of it both by land and by water the less would ani on particular part of it ever be expos to either of these calam the scarciti of ani on countri be more like to be reliev by the plenti of some other but veri few countri have entir adopt thi liber system the freedom of the corn trade is almost everywher more or less restrain and in mani countri is confin by such absurd regul as frequent aggrav the unavoid misfortun of a dearth into the dread calam of a famin the demand of such countri for corn mai frequent becom so great and so urgent that a small state in their neighbourhood which happen at the same time to be labour under some degre of dearth could not ventur to suppli them without expos itself to the like dread calam the veri bad polici of on countri mai thu render it in some measur danger and imprud to establish what would otherwis be the best polici in anoth the unlimit freedom of export howev would be much less danger in great state in which the growth be much greater the suppli could seldom be much affect by ani quantiti or corn that wa like to be export in a swiss canton or in some of the littl state in itali it mai perhap sometim be necessari to restrain the export of corn in such great countri as franc or england it scarc ever can to hinder besid the farmer from send hi good at all time to the best market is evid to sacrific the ordinari law of justic to an idea of public util to a sort of reason of state an act or legisl author which ought to be exercis onli which can be pardon onli in case of the most urgent necess the price at which export of corn is prohibit if it is ever to be prohibit ought alwai to be a veri high price the law concern corn mai everywher be compar to the law concern religion the peopl feel themselv so much interest in what relat either to their subsist in thi life or to their happi in a life to come that govern must yield to their prejudic and in order to preserv the public tranquil establish that system which thei approv of it is upon thi account perhap that we so seldom find a reason system establish with regard to either of those two capit object iv the trade of the merchantcarri or of the import of foreign corn in order to export it again contribut to the plenti suppli of the home market it is not inde the direct purpos of hi trade to sell hi corn there but he will gener be will to do so and even for a good deal less monei than he might expect in a foreign market becaus he save in thi manner the expens of load and unload of freight and insur the inhabit of the countri which by mean of the carri trade becom the magazin and storehous for the suppli of other countri can veri seldom be in want themselv though the carri trade must thu contribut to reduc the averag monei price of corn in the home market it would not therebi lower it real valu it would onli rais somewhat the real valu of silver the carri trade wa in effect prohibit in great britain upon all ordinari occas by the high duti upon the import of foreign corn of the greater part of which there wa no drawback and upon extraordinari occas when a scarciti made it necessari to suspend those duti by temporari statut export wa alwai prohibit by thi system of law therefor the carri trade wa in effect prohibit that system of law therefor which is connect with the establish of the bounti seem to deserv no part of the prais which ha been bestow upon it the improv and prosper of great britain which ha been so often ascrib to those law mai veri easili be account for by other caus that secur which the law in great britain give to everi man that he shall enjoi the fruit of hi own labour is alon suffici to make ani countri flourish notwithstand these and twenti other absurd regul of commerc and thi secur wa perfect by the revolut much about the same time that the bounti wa establish the natur effort of everi individu to better hi own condit when suffer to exert itself with freedom and secur is so power a principl that it is alon and without ani assist not onli capabl of carri on the societi to wealth and prosper but of surmount a hundr impertin obstruct with which the folli of human law too often encumb it oper though the effect of those obstruct is alwai more or less either to encroach upon it freedom or to diminish it secur in great britain industri is perfectli secur and though it is far from be perfectli free it is as free or freer than in ani other part of europ though the period of the greatest prosper and improv of great britain ha been posterior to that system of law which is connect with the bounti we must not upon that account imput it to those law it ha been posterior likewis to the nation debt but the nation debt ha most assuredli not been the caus of it though the system of law which is connect with the bounti ha exactli the same tendenc with the practic of spain and portug to lower somewhat the valu of the preciou metal in the countri where it take place yet great britain is certainli on of the richest countri in europ while spain and portug ar perhap amongst the most beggarli thi differ of situat howev mai easili be account for from two differ caus first the tax in spain the prohibit in portug of export gold and silver and the vigil polic which watch over the execut of those law must in two veri poor countri which between them import annual upward of six million sterl oper not onli more directli but much more forcibl in reduc the valu of those metal there than the corn law can do in great britain and secondli thi bad polici is not in those countri counterbalanc by the gener liberti and secur of the peopl industri is there neither free nor secur and the civil and ecclesiast govern of both spain and portug ar such as would alon be suffici to perpetu their present state of poverti even though their regul of commerc were as wise as the greatest part of them ar absurd and foolish the th of the present king c seem to have establish a new system with regard to the corn law in mani respect better than the ancient on but in on or two respect perhap not quit so good by thi statut the high duti upon import for home consumpt ar taken off so soon as the price of middl wheat rise to s the quarter that of middl rye peas or bean to s that of barlei to s and that of oat to s and instead of them a small duti is impos of onli d upon the quarter of wheat and upon that or other grain in proport with regard to all those differ sort of grain but particularli with regard to wheat the home market is thu open to foreign suppli at price consider lower than befor by the same statut the old bounti of s upon the export of wheat ceas so soon as the price rise to s the quarter instead of s the price at which it ceas befor that of s d upon the export of barlei ceas so soon as the price rise to s instead of s the price at which it ceas befor that of s d upon the export of oatmeal ceas so soon as the price rise to s instead of s the price at which it ceas befor the bounti upon rye is reduc from s d to s and it ceas so soon as the price rise to s instead of s the price at which it ceas befor if bounti ar as improp as i have endeavour to prove them to be the sooner thei ceas and the lower thei ar so much the better the same statut permit at the lowest price the import of corn in order to be export again duti free provid it is in the mean time lodg in a warehous under the joint lock of the king and the import thi liberti inde extend to no more than twentyf of the differ port of great britain thei ar howev the princip on and there mai not perhap be warehous proper for thi purpos in the greater part of the other so far thi law seem evid an improv upon the ancient system but by the same law a bounti of s the quarter is given for the export of oat whenev the price doe not exce fourteen shill no bounti had ever been given befor for the export of thi grain no more than for that of peas or bean by the same law too the export of wheat is prohibit so soon as the price rise to fortyfour shill the quarter that of rye so soon as it rise to twentyeight shill that of barlei so soon as it rise to twentytwo shill and that of oat so soon as thei rise to fourteen shill those sever price seem all of them a good deal too low and there seem to be an improprieti besid in prohibit export altogeth at those precis price at which that bounti which wa given in order to forc it is withdrawn the bounti ought certainli either to have been withdrawn at a much lower price or export ought to have been allow at a much higher so far therefor thi law seem to be inferior to the ancient system with all it imperfect howev we mai perhap sai of it what wa said of the law of solon that though not the best in itself it is the best which the interest prejudic and temper of the time would admit of it mai perhap in due time prepar the wai for a better chapter vi of treati of commerc when a nation bind itself by treati either to permit the entri of certain good from on foreign countri which it prohibit from all other or to exempt the good of on countri from duti to which it subject those of all other the countri or at least the merchant and manufactur of the countri whose commerc is so favour must necessarili deriv great advantag from the treati those merchant and manufactur enjoi a sort of monopoli in the countri which is so indulg to them that countri becom a market both more extens and more advantag for their good more extens becaus the good of other nation be either exclud or subject to heavier duti it take off a greater quantiti of their more advantag becaus the merchant of the favour countri enjoi a sort of monopoli there will often sell their good for a better price than if expos to the free competit of all other nation such treati howev though thei mai be advantag to the merchant and manufactur of the favour ar necessarili disadvantag to those of the favour countri a monopoli is thu grant against them to a foreign nation and thei must frequent bui the foreign good thei have occas for dearer than if the free competit of other nation wa admit that part of it own produc with which such a nation purchas foreign good must consequ be sold cheaper becaus when two thing ar exchang for on anoth the cheap of the on is a necessari consequ or rather is the same thing with the dear of the other the exchang valu of it annual produc therefor is like to be diminish by everi such treati thi diminut howev can scarc amount to ani posit loss but onli to a lessen of the gain which it might otherwis make though it sell it good cheaper than it otherwis might do it will not probabl sell them for less than thei cost nor as in the case of bounti for a price which will not replac the capit emploi in bring them to market togeth with the ordinari profit of stock the trade could not go on long if it did even the favour countri therefor mai still gain by the trade though less than if there wa a free competit some treati of commerc howev have been suppos advantag upon principl veri differ from these and a commerci countri ha sometim grant a monopoli of thi kind against itself to certain good of a foreign nation becaus it expect that in the whole commerc between them it would annual sell more than it would bui and that a balanc in gold and silver would be annual return to it it is upon thi principl that the treati of commerc between england and portug conclud in by mr methuen ha been so much commend the follow is a liter translat of that treati which consist of three articl onli art i hi sacr royal majesti of portug promis both in hi own name and that of hi successor to admit for ever hereaft into portug the woollen cloth and the rest of the woollen manufactur of the british as wa accustom till thei were prohibit by the law nevertheless upon thi condit art ii that is to sai that her sacr royal majesti of great britain shall in her own name and that of her successor be oblig for ever hereaft to admit the wine of the growth of portug into britain so that at no time whether there shall be peac or war between the kingdom of britain and franc ani thing more shall be demand for these wine by the name of custom or duti or by whatsoev other titl directli or indirectli whether thei shall be import into great britain in pipe or hogshead or other cask than what shall be demand for the like quantiti or measur of french wine deduct or abat a third part of the custom or duti but if at ani time thi deduct or abat of custom which is to be made as aforesaid shall in ani manner be attempt and prejud it shall be just and law for hi sacr royal majesti of portug again to prohibit the woollen cloth and the rest of the british woollen manufactur art iii the most excel lord the plenipotentiari promis and take upon themselv that their abov name master shall ratifi thi treati and within the space of two month the ratif shall be exchang by thi treati the crown of portug becom bound to admit the english woollen upon the same foot as befor the prohibit that is not to rais the duti which had been paid befor that time but it doe not becom bound to admit them upon ani better term than those of ani other nation of franc or holland for exampl the crown of great britain on the contrari becom bound to admit the wine of portug upon pai onli twothird of the duti which is paid for those of franc the wine most like to come into competit with them so far thi treati therefor is evid advantag to portug and disadvantag to great britain it ha been celebr howev as a masterpiec of the commerci polici of england portug receiv annual from the brazil a greater quantiti of gold than can be emploi in it domest commerc whether in the shape of coin or of plate the surplu is too valuabl to be allow to lie idl and lock up in coffer and as it can find no advantag market at home it must notwithstand ani prohibit be sent abroad and exchang for someth for which there is a more advantag market at home a larg share of it come annual to england in return either for english good or for those of other european nation that receiv their return through england mr barretti wa inform that the weekli packetboat from lisbon bring on week with anoth more than in gold to england the sum had probabl been exagger it would amount to more than a year which is more than the brazil ar suppos to afford our merchant were some year ago out of humour with the crown of portug some privileg which had been grant them not by treati but by the free grace of that crown at the solicit inde it is probabl and in return for much greater favour defenc and protect from the crown of great britain had been either infring or revok the peopl therefor usual most interest in celebr the portug trade were then rather dispos to repres it as less advantag than it had commonli been imagin the far greater part almost the whole thei pretend of thi annual import of gold wa not on account of great britain but of other european nation the fruit and wine of portug annual import into great britain nearli compens the valu of the british good sent thither let us suppos howev that the whole wa on account of great britain and that it amount to a still greater sum than mr barretti seem to imagin thi trade would not upon that account be more advantag than ani other in which for the same valu sent out we receiv an equal valu of consum good in return it is but a veri small part of thi import which it can be suppos is emploi as an annual addit either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom the rest must all be sent abroad and exchang for consum good of some kind or other but if those consum good were purchas directli with the produc of english industri it would be more for the advantag of england than first to purchas with that produc the gold of portug and afterward to purchas with that gold those consum good a direct foreign trade of consumpt is alwai more advantag than a roundabout on and to bring the same valu of foreign good to the home market requir a much smaller capit in the on wai than in the ether if a smaller share of it industri therefor had been emploi in produc good fit for the portug market and a greater in produc those lit for the other market where those consum good for which there is a demand in great britain ar to be had it would have been more for the advantag of england to procur both the gold which it want for it own us and the consum good would in thi wai emploi a much smaller capit than at present there would be a spare capit therefor to be emploi for other purpos in excit an addit quantiti of industri and in rais a greater annual produc though britain were entir exclud from the portug trade it could find veri littl difficulti in procur all the annual suppli of gold which it want either for the purpos of plate or of coin or of foreign trade gold like everi other commod is alwai somewher or anoth to be got for it valu by those who have that valu to give for it the annual surplu of gold in portug besid would still be sent abroad and though not carri awai by great britain would be carri awai by some other nation which would be glad to sell it again for it price in the same manner as great britain doe at present in bui gold of portug inde we bui it at the first hand wherea in bui it of ani other nation except spain we should bui it at the second and might pai somewhat dearer thi differ howev would sure be too insignific to deserv the public attent almost all our gold it is said come from portug with other nation the balanc of trade is either against as or not much in our favour but we should rememb that the more gold we import from on countri the less we must necessarili import from all other the effectu demand for gold like that for everi other commod is in everi countri limit to a certain quantiti if ninetenth of thi quantiti ar import from on countri there remain a tenth onli to be import from all other the more gold besid that is annual import from some particular countri over and abov what is requisit for plate and for coin the more must necessarili be export to some other and the more that most insignific object of modern polici the balanc of trade appear to be in our favour with some particular countri the more it must necessarili appear to be against us with mani other it wa upon thi silli notion howev that england could not subsist without the portug trade that toward the end of the late war franc and spain without pretend either offenc or provoc requir the king of portug to exclud all british ship from hi port and for the secur of thi exclus to receiv into them french or spanish garrison had the king of portug submit to those ignomini term which hi brotherinlaw the king of spain propos to him britain would have been freed from a much greater inconveni than the loss of the portug trade the burden of support a veri weak alli so unprovid of everi thing for hi own defenc that the whole power of england had it been direct to that singl purpos could scarc perhap have defend him for anoth campaign the loss of the portug trade would no doubt have occas a consider embarrass to the merchant at that time engag in it who might not perhap have found out for a year or two ani other equal advantag method of emploi their capit and in thi would probabl have consist all the inconveni which england could have suffer from thi notabl piec of commerci polici the great annual import of gold and silver is neither for the purpos of plate nor of coin but of foreign trade a roundabout foreign trade of consumpt can be carri on more advantag by mean of these metal than of almost ani other good as thei ar the univers instrument of commerc thei ar more readili receiv in return for all commod than ani other good and on account of their small bulk and great valu it cost less to transport them backward and forward from on place to anoth than almost ani other sort of merchand and thei lose less of their valu by be so transport of all the commod therefor which ar bought in on foreign countri for no other purpos but to be sold or exchang again for some other good in anoth there ar none so conveni as gold and silver in facilit all the differ roundabout foreign trade of consumpt which ar carri on in great britain consist the princip advantag of the portug trade and though it is not a capit advantag it is no doubt a consider on that ani annual addit which it can reason be suppos is made either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom could requir but a veri small annual import of gold and silver seem evid enough and though we had no direct trade with portug thi small quantiti could alwai somewher or anoth be veri easili got though the goldsmith trade be veri consider in great britain the far greater part of the new plate which thei annual sell is made from other old plate melt down so that the addit annual made to the whole plate of the kingdom cannot be veri great and could requir but a veri small annual import it is the same case with the coin nobodi imagin i believ that even the greater part of the annual coinag amount for ten year togeth befor the late reform of the gold coin to upward of ayear in gold wa an annual addit to the monei befor current in the kingdom in a countri where the expens of the coinag is defrai by the govern the valu of the coin even when it contain it full standard weight of gold and silver can never be much greater than that of an equal quantiti of those metal uncoin becaus it requir onli the troubl of go to the mint and the delai perhap of a few week to procur for ani quantiti of uncoin gold and silver an equal quantiti of those metal in coin but in everi countri the greater part of the current coin is almost alwai more or less worn or otherwis degener from it standard in great britain it wa befor the late reform a good deal so the gold be more than two per cent and the silver more than eight per cent below it standard weight but if fortyfour guinea and ahalf contain their full standard weight a pound weight of gold could purchas veri littl more than a pound weight of uncoin gold fortyfour guinea and ahalf want a part of their weight could not purchas a pound weight and someth wa to be ad in order to make up the defici the current price of gold bullion at market therefor instead of be the same with the mint price or wa then about s and sometim about when the greater part of the coin howev wa in thi degener condit forti four guinea and ahalf fresh from the mint would purchas no more good in the market than ani other ordinari guinea becaus when thei came into the coffer of the merchant be confound with other monei thei could not afterward be distinguish without more troubl than the differ wa worth like other guinea thei were worth no more than if thrown into the melt pot howev thei produc without ani sensibl loss a pound weight of standard gold which could be sold at ani time for between s and either in gold or silver as fit for all the purpos of coin as that which had been melt down there wa an evid profit therefor in melt down newcoin monei and it wa done so instantan that no precaut of govern could prevent it the oper of the mint were upon thi account somewhat like the web of penelop the work that wa done in the dai wa undon in the night the mint wa emploi not so much in make daili addit to the coin as in replac the veri best part of it which wa daili melt down were the privat peopl who carri their gold and silver to the mint to pai themselv for the coinag it would add to the valu of those metal in the same manner as the fashion doe to that of plate coin gold and silver would be more valuabl than uncoin the seignorag if it wa not exorbit would add to the bullion the whole valu of the duti becaus the govern have everywher the exclus privileg of coin no coin can come to market cheaper than thei think proper to afford it if the duti wa exorbit inde that is if it wa veri much abov the real valu of the labour and expens requisit for coinag fals coiner both at home and abroad might be encourag by the great differ between the valu of bullion and that of coin to pour in so great a quantiti of counterfeit monei as might reduc the valu of the govern monei in franc howev though the seignorag is eight per cent no sensibl inconveni of thi kind is found to aris from it the danger to which a fals coiner is everywher expos if he live in the countri of which he counterfeit the coin and to which hi agent or correspond ar expos if he live in a foreign countri ar by far too great to be incur for the sake of a profit of six or seven per cent the seignorag in franc rais the valu of the coin higher than in proport to the quantiti of pure gold which it contain thu by the edict of januari the mint price of fine gold of twentyfour carat wa fix at seven hundr and forti livr nine sou and on denier oneeleventh the mark of eight pari ounc see dictionnair de monnoi tom ii articl seigneurag p par abbot de bazinghen conseillercommissair en la cour de monnoi pari the gold coin of franc make an allow

livr ten denier but in franc thi mark of standard gold is coin into thirti loui dor of twentyfour livr each or into seven hundr and twenti livr the coinag therefor increas the valu of a mark of standard gold bullion by the differ between six hundr and seventyon livr ten denier and seven hundr and twenti livr or by fortyeight livr nineteen sou and two denier a seignorag will in mani case take awai altogeth and will in all case diminish the profit of melt down the new coin thi profit alwai aris from the differ between the quantiti of bullion which the common currenc ought to contain and that which it actual doe contain if thi differ is less than the seignorag there will be loss instead of profit if it is equal to the seignorag there will be neither profit nor loss if it is greater than the seignorag there will inde be some profit but less than if there wa no seignorag if befor the late reform of the gold coin for exampl there had been a seignorag of five per cent upon the coinag there would have been a loss of three per cent upon the melt down of the gold coin if the seignorag had been two per cent there would have been neither profit nor loss if the seignorag had been on per cent there would have been a profit but of on per cent onli instead of two per cent wherev monei is receiv by tale therefor and not by weight a seignorag is the most effectu prevent of the melt down of the coin and for the same reason of it export it is the best and heaviest piec that ar commonli either melt down or export becaus it is upon such that the largest profit ar made the law for the encourag of the coinag by render it dutyfre wa first enact dure the reign of charl ii for a limit time and afterward continu by differ prolong till when it wa render perpetu the bank of england in order to replenish their coffer with monei ar frequent oblig to carri bullion to the mint and it wa more for their interest thei probabl imagin that the coinag should be at the expens of the govern than at their own it wa probabl out of complais to thi great compani that the govern agre to render thi law perpetu should the custom of weigh gold howev come to be disus as it is veri like to be on account of it inconveni should the gold coin of england come to be receiv by tale as it wa befor the late recoinag thi great compani mai perhap find that thei have upon thi as upon some other occas mistaken their own interest not a littl befor the late recoinag when the gold currenc of england wa two per cent below it standard weight as there wa no seignorag it wa two per cent below the valu of that quantiti of standard gold bullion which it ought to have contain when thi great compani therefor bought gold bullion in order to have it coin thei were oblig to pai for it two per cent more than it wa worth after the coinag but if there had been a seignorag of two per cent upon the coinag the common gold currenc though two per cent below it standard weight would notwithstand have been equal in valu to the quantiti of standard gold which it ought to have contain the valu of the fashion compens in thi case the diminut of the weight thei would inde have had the seignorag to pai which be two per cent their loss upon the whole transact would have been two per cent exactli the same but no greater than it actual wa if the seignorag had been five per cent and the gold currenc onli two per cent below it standard weight the bank would in thi case have gain three per cent upon the price of the bullion but as thei would have had a seignorag of five per cent to pai upon the coinag their loss upon the whole transact would in the same manner have been exactli two per cent if the seignorag had been onli on per cent and the gold currenc two per cent below it standard weight the bank would in thi case have lost onli on per cent upon the price of the bullion but as thei would likewis have had a seignorag of on per cent to pai their loss upon the whole transact would have been exactli two per cent in the same manner as in all other case if there wa a reason seignorag while at the same time the coin contain it full standard weight as it ha done veri nearli sinc the late recoinag whatev the bank might lose by the seignorag thei would gain upon the price of the bullion and whatev thei might gain upon the price of the bullion thei would lose by the seignorag thei would neither lose nor gain therefor upon the whole transact and thei would in thi as in all the forego case be exactli in the same situat as if there wa no seignorag when the tax upon a commod is so moder as not to encourag smuggl the merchant who deal in it though he advanc doe not properli pai the tax as he get it back in the price of the commod the tax is final paid by the last purchas or consum but monei is a commod with regard to which everi man is a merchant nobodi bui it but in order to sell it again and with regard to it there is in ordinari case no last purchas or consum when the tax upon coinag therefor is so moder as not to encourag fals coin though everi bodi advanc the tax nobodi final pai it becaus everi bodi get it back in the advanc valu of the coin a moder seignorag therefor would not in ani case augment the expens of the bank or of ani other privat person who carri their bullion to the mint in order to be coin and the want of a moder seignorag doe not in ani case

all the differ state of ancient greec possess each of them but a veri small territori and when the peopl in anyon of them multipli beyond what that territori could easili maintain a part of them were

which divid the public territori in a certain proport among the differ citizen who compos the state the cours of human affair by marriag by success and by alien necessarili derang thi origin divis and

de gamo set out from portug and after a voyag of between two and three month discov first some of the small bahama or lucyan island and afterward the great island of st domingo but the countri which columbu discov either in thi or in ani of hi subsequ voyag had no resembl to those which he had gone in quest of instead of the wealth cultiv and popul of china and indostan he found in st domingo and in all the other part of the new world which he ever visit noth but a countri quit cover with wood uncultiv and inhabit onli by some tribe of nake and miser savag he wa not veri will howev to believ that thei were not the same with some of the countri describ by marco polo the first european who had visit or at least had left behind him ani descript of china or the east indi and a veri slight

contrari to the clearest evid in hi letter to ferdinand and isabella he call the countri which he had discov the indi he entertain no doubt but that thei were the extrem of those which had been describ by marco polo and that thei were not veri distant from the gang or from the countri which had been conquer by alexand even when at last convinc that thei were differ he still flatter himself that those rich countri were at no great distanc and in a subsequ voyag accordingli went in quest of them along the coast of terra firma and toward the isthmu of darien in consequ of thi mistak of

fell from the mountain were suffici to satisfi him that those mountain abound with the richest gold mine st domingo therefor wa repres as a countri abound with gold and upon that account accord to the prejudic not onli of the present time but of those time an inexhaust sourc of real wealth to the crown and kingdom of spain when columbu upon hi return from hi first voyag wa introduc with a sort of triumphal honour to the sovereign of castil and arragon the princip product of the countri which he had discov were carri in solemn process befor him the onli valuabl part of them consist in some

the gold and silver that should be found there should belong to the crown thi propos wa approv of by the council as long as the whole or the greater part of the gold which the first adventur import into europ wa got by so veri easi a method as the plunder of the defenceless nativ it wa not perhap veri difficult to pai even thi heavi tax but when the nativ were onc fairli stript of all that thei

befor the conquest of the spaniard there were no cattl fit for draught either in mexico or peru the lama wa their onli beast of burden and it strength seem to have been a good deal inferior to that of

plentifulli furnish with all sort of european cattl and when the us of iron of the plough and of mani of the art of europ have been introduc among them but the popul of everi countri must be in proport to the degre of it improv and cultiv in spite of the cruel destruct of the nativ which follow the conquest these two great empir ar probabl more popul now than thei ever were befor and the peopl ar sure veri differ for we must acknowledg i apprehend that the spanish creol ar in mani respect superior to the ancient indian after the settlement of the spaniard that of the portugues in brazil is the oldest of ani european nation in america but as for a long time after the first discoveri neither gold nor silver mine were found in it and as it afford upon that account littl or no revenu to the crown it wa for a long time in a great measur neglect and dure thi state of neglect it grew up to be a great and power coloni while portug wa under the dominion of spain brazil wa attack by the dutch who got possess of seven of the fourteen provinc into which it is divid thei expect soon to conquer the other seven when portug recov it independ by the elev of the famili of braganza to the throne the dutch then as enemi to the spaniard becam friend to the portugues who were likewis the enemi of the spaniard thei agre therefor to leav that part of brazil which thei had not conquer to the king of portug who agre to leav that part which thei had conquer to them as a matter not worth disput about with such good alli but the dutch govern soon began to oppress the portugues colonist who instead of amus themselv with complaint took arm against their new master and by their own valour and resolut with the conniv inde but without ani avow assist from the mother countri drove them out of brazil the dutch therefor find it imposs to keep ani part of the countri to themselv were content that it should be entir restor to the crown of portug in thi coloni there ar said to be more than six hundr thousand peopl either portugues or descend from portugues creol mulatto and a mix race between portugues and brazilian no on coloni in america is suppos to contain so great a number of peopl of european extract toward the end of the fifteenth and dure the greater part of the sixteenth centuri spain and portug were the two great naval power upon the ocean for though the commerc of venic extend to everi part of europ it fleet had scarc ever sail beyond the mediterranean the spaniard in virtu of the first discoveri claim all america as their own and though thei could not hinder so great a naval power as that of portug from settl in brazil such wa at that time the terror of their name that the greater part of the other nation of europ were afraid to establish themselv in ani other part of that great contin the french who attempt to settl in florida were all murder by the spaniard but the declens of the naval power of thi latter nation in consequ of the defeat or miscarriag of what thei call their invinc armada which happen toward the end of the sixteenth centuri put it out of their power to obstruct ani longer the settlement of the other european nation in the cours of the seventeenth centuri therefor the english french dutch dane and swede all the great nation who had ani port upon the ocean attempt to make some settlement in the new world the swede establish themselv in new jersei and the number of swedish famili still to be found there suffici demonstr that thi coloni wa veri like to prosper had it been protect by the mother countri but be neglect by sweden it wa soon swallow up by the dutch coloni of new york which again in fell under the dominion of the english the small island of st thoma and santa cruz ar the onli countri in the new world that have ever been possess by the dane these littl settlement too were under the govern of an exclus compani which had the sole right both of purchas the surplu produc of the coloni and of suppli them with such good of other countri as thei want and which therefor both in it purchas and sale had not onli the power of oppress them but the greatest temptat to do so the govern of an exclus compani of merchant is perhap the worst of all govern for ani countri whatev it wa not howev abl to stop altogeth the progress of these coloni though it render it more slow and languid the late king of denmark dissolv thi compani and sinc that time the prosper of these coloni ha been veri great the dutch settlement in the west as well as those in the east indi were origin put under the govern of an exclus compani the progress of some of them therefor though it ha been consider in comparison with that of almost ani countri that ha been long peopl and establish ha been languid and slow in comparison with that of the greater part of new coloni the coloni of surinam though veri consider is still inferior to the greater part of the sugar coloni of the other european nation the coloni of nova belgia now divid into the two provinc of new york and new jersei would probabl have soon becom consider too even though it had remain under the govern of the dutch the plenti and cheap of good land ar such power caus of prosper that the veri worst govern is scarc capabl of check altogeth the efficaci of their oper the great distanc too from the mother countri would enabl the colonist to evad more or less by smuggl the monopoli which the compani enjoi against them at present the compani allow all dutch ship to trade to surinam upon pai two and ahalf per cent upon the valu of their cargo for a licens and onli reserv to itself exclus the direct trade from africa to america which consist almost entir in the slave trade thi relax in the exclus privileg of the compani is probabl the princip caus of that degre of prosper which that coloni at present enjoi curacoa and eustatia the two princip island belong to the dutch ar free port open to the ship of all nation and thi freedom in the midst of better coloni whose port ar open to those of on nation onli ha been the great caus of the prosper of those two barren island the french coloni of canada wa dure the greater part of the last centuri and some part of the present under the govern of an exclus compani under so unfavour an administr it progress wa necessarili veri slow in comparison with that of other new coloni but it becam much more rapid when thi compani wa dissolv after the fall of what is call the mississippi scheme when the english got possess of thi countri thei found in it near doubl the number of inhabit which father charlevoix had assign to it between twenti and thirti year befor that jesuit had travel over the whole countri and had no inclin to repres it as less inconsider than it realli wa the french coloni of st domingo wa establish by pirat and freeboot who for a long time neither requir the protect nor acknowledg the author of franc and when that race of banditti becam so far citizen as to acknowledg thi author it wa for a long time necessari to exercis it with veri great gentl dure thi period the popul and improv of thi coloni increas veri fast even the oppress of the exclus compani to which it wa for some time subject with all the other coloni of franc though it no doubt retard had not been abl to stop it progress altogeth the cours of it prosper return as soon as it wa reliev from that oppress it is now the most import of the sugar coloni of the west indi and it produc is said to be greater than that of all the english sugar coloni put togeth the other sugar coloni of franc ar in gener all veri thrive but there ar no coloni of which the progress ha been more rapid than that of the english in north america plenti of good land and liberti to manag their own affair their own wai seem to be the two great caus of the prosper of all new coloni in the plenti of good land the english coloni of north america though no doubt veri abundantli provid ar howev inferior to those of the spaniard and portugues and not superior to some of those possess by the french befor the late war but the polit institut of the english coloni have been more favour to the improv and cultiv of thi land than those of the other three nation first the engross of uncultiv land though it ha by no mean been prevent altogeth ha been more restrain in the english coloni than in ani other the coloni law which impos upon everi proprietor the oblig of improv and cultiv within a limit time a certain proport of hi land and which in case of failur declar those neglect land grantabl to ani other person though it ha not perhap been veri strictli execut ha howev had some effect secondli in pennsylvania there is no right of primogenitur and land like moveabl ar divid equal among all the

engross by a particular individu it is like in the cours of a gener or two to be suffici divid again in the other english coloni inde the right of primogenitur take place as in the law of england but in all the english coloni the tenur of the land which ar all held by free soccag facilit alien and the grante of an extens tract of land gener find it for hi interest to alien as fast as he can the

the heir of the superior or by the heir of the famili and all the largest estat of the countri ar held by such nobl tenur which necessarili embarrass alien but in a new coloni a great uncultiv estat is like to be much more speedili divid by alien than by success the plenti and cheap of good land it ha alreadi been observ ar the princip caus of the rapid prosper of new coloni the engross of land in effect destroi thi plenti and cheap the engross of uncultiv land besid is the greatest obstruct to it improv but the labour that is emploi in the improv and cultiv of land afford the greatest and most valuabl produc to the societi the produc of labour in thi case pai not onli it own wage and the profit of the stock which emploi it but the rent of the land too upon which it is emploi the labour of the english coloni therefor be more emploi in the improv and cultiv of land is like to afford a greater and more valuabl produc than that of ani of the other three nation which by the engross of land is more or less divert toward other employ thirdli the labour of the english colonist is not onli like to afford a greater and more valuabl produc but in consequ of the moder of their tax a greater proport of thi produc belong to themselv which thei mai store up and emploi in put into motion a still greater quantiti of labour the english colonist have never yet contribut ani thing toward

in the dispos of their surplu produc or of what is over and abov their own consumpt the english coloni have been more favour and have been allow a more extens market than those of ani other european nation everi european nation ha endeavour more or less to monopol to itself the commerc of it coloni and upon that account ha prohibit the ship of foreign nation from trade to them and ha prohibit them from import european good from ani foreign nation but the manner in which thi monopoli ha been exercis in differ nation ha been veri differ some nation have given up the whole commerc of their coloni to an exclus compani of whom the colonist were oblig to bui all such european good as thei want and to whom thei were oblig to sell the whole of their surplu produc it wa the interest of the compani therefor not onli to sell the former as dear and to bui the latter as cheap as possibl but to bui no more of the latter even at thi low price than what thei could dispos of for a veri high price in europ it wa their interest not onli to degrad in all case the valu of the surplu produc of the coloni but in mani case to discourag and keep down the natur increas of it quantiti of all the expedi that can well be contriv to stunt the natur growth of a new coloni that of an exclus compani is undoubtedli the most effectu thi howev ha been the polici of holland though their compani in the

for their interest to act in concert the trade which wa carri on in thi manner would necessarili be conduct veri nearli upon the same principl as that of an exclus compani the profit of those merchant would be almost equal exorbit and oppress the coloni would be ill suppli and would be oblig both to bui veri dear and to sell veri cheap thi howev till within these few year had alwai been the polici of spain and the price of all european good accordingli is said to have been enorm in the spanish west indi at quito we ar told by ulloa a pound of iron sold for about s d and a pound of steel for about s d sterl but it is chiefli in order to purchas european good that the coloni part with their own produc the more therefor thei pai for the on the less thei realli get for the other and the dear of the on is the same thing with the cheap of the other the polici of portug is in thi respect the same as the ancient polici of spain with regard to all it coloni except pernambucco and marannon and with regard to these it ha late adopt a still wors other nation leav the trade of their coloni free to all their subject who mai carri it on from all the differ port of the mother countri and who have occas for no other licens than the common despatch of the customhous in thi case the number and dispers situat of the differ trader render it imposs for them to enter into ani gener combin and their competit is suffici to hinder them from make veri exorbit profit under so liber a polici the coloni ar enabl both to sell their own produc and to bui the good of europ at a reason price but sinc the dissolut of the plymouth compani when our coloni were but in their infanc thi ha alwai been the polici of england it ha gener too been that of franc and ha been uniformli so sinc the dissolut of what in england is commonli call their mississippi compani the profit of the trade therefor which franc and england carri on with their coloni though no doubt somewhat higher than if the competit were free to all other nation ar howev by no mean exorbit and the price of european good accordingli is not extravagantli high in the greater past of the coloni of either of those nation in the export of their own surplu produc too it is onli with regard to certain commod that the coloni of great britain ar confin to the market of the mother countri these commod have been enumer in the act of navig and in

by mean of proper duti thei might be render alwai somewhat dearer than the former and yet a good deal cheaper than the latter by confin such commod to the home market therefor it wa propos to discourag the produc not of great britain but of some foreign countri with which the balanc of trade wa believ to be unfavour to great britain the prohibit of export from the coloni to ani other countri but great britain mast yard and bowsprit tar pitch and turpentin natur tend to lower the price of timber in the coloni and consequ to increas the expens of clear their land the princip obstacl to their improv but about the begin of the present centuri in the pitch and tar compani of sweden endeavour to rais the price of their commod to great britain by prohibit their export except in their

but of all the other northern power great britain gave a bounti upon the import of naval store from america and the effect of thi bounti wa to rais the price of timber in america much more than the confin to the home market could lower it and as both regul were enact at the same time their joint effect wa rather to encourag than to discourag the clear of land in america though pig and bar iron too have been put among the enumer commod yet as when import from america thei ar exempt from consider duti to which thei ar subject when import front ani other countri the on part of the regul

the interest of the mother countri wa sacrif to it even accord to the mercantil idea of that interest it wa for the interest of the merchant to pai as littl as possibl for the foreign good which thei

which had been paid upon the import of such good and in her manufactur by be undersold in the coloni market in consequ of the easi term upon which foreign manufactur could be carri thither by mean of those drawback the progress of the linen manufactur of great britain it is commonli said ha been a good deal retard by the drawback upon the reexport of german linen to the american coloni but though the polici of great britain with regard to the trade of her coloni ha been dictat by the same mercantil spirit as that of other nation it ha howev upon the whole been less illiber and oppress than

those of england from refin their own sugar and what is still of greater import the geniu of their govern natur introduc a better manag of their negro slave in all european coloni the cultur of the sugarcan is carri on by negro slave the constitut of those who have been born in the temper climat of europ could not it is suppos support the labour of dig the ground under the burn sun of the west indi and the cultur of the sugarcan as it is manag at present is all hand labour though in the opinion of mani the drill plough might be introduc into it with great advantag but as the profit and success of the cultiv which is carri on by mean of cattl depend veri much upon the good manag of those cattl so the profit and success of that which is carri on by slave must depend equal upon the good manag of those slave and in the good manag of their slave the french planter i think it is gener allow ar superior to the english the law so far as it give some weak protect to the slave against the violenc of hi master is like to be better execut in a coloni where the govern is in a great measur arbitrari than in on where it is altogeth free in ever countri where the unfortun law of slaveri is establish the magistr when he protect the slave intermeddl in some measur in the manag of the privat properti of the master and in a free countri where the master is perhap either a member of the coloni assembl or an elector of such a member he dare not do thi but with the greatest caution and circumspect the respect which he is oblig to pai to the master render it more difficult for him to protect the slave but in a countri where the govern is in a great measur arbitrari where it is usual for the magistr to intermeddl even in the manag of the privat properti of individu and to send them perhap a lettr de cachet if thei do not manag it accord to hi like it is much easier for him to give some protect to the slave and common human natur dispos him to do so the protect of the magistr render the slave less contempt in the ey of hi master who is therebi induc to consid him with more regard and to treat him with more gentl gentl usag render the slave not onli more faith but more intellig and therefor upon a doubl account more us he approach more to the condit of a free servant and mai possess some degre of integr and attach to hi master interest virtu which frequent belong to free servant but which never can belong to a slave who is treat as slave commonli ar in countri where the master is perfectli free and secur that the condit of a slave is better under an arbitrari than under a free govern is i believ support by the histori of all ag and nation in the roman histori the first time we read of the magistr interpos to protect the slave from the violenc of hi master is under the emperor when vidiu pollio in the presenc of augustu order on of hi slave who had commit a slight fault to be cut into piec and thrown into hi fishpond in order to feed hi fish the emperor command him with indign to emancip immedi not onli that slave but all the other that belong to him under the republ no magistr could have had author enough to protect the slave much less to punish the master the stock it is to be observ which ha improv the sugar coloni of franc particularli the great coloni of st domingo ha been rais almost entir from the gradual improv and cultiv of those coloni it ha been almost altogeth the produc of the soil and of the industri of the colonist or what come to the same thing the price of that produc gradual accumul by good manag and emploi in rais a still greater produc but the stock which ha improv and cultiv the sugar coloni of england ha a great part of it been sent out from england and ha by no mean been altogeth the produc of the soil and industri of the colonist the prosper of the english sugar coloni ha been in a great measur ow to the great rich of england of which a part ha overflow if on mai sai so upon these coloni but the prosper of the sugar coloni of franc ha been entir ow to the good conduct of the colonist which must therefor have had some superior over that of the english and thi superior ha been remark in noth so much as in the good manag of their slave such have been the gener outlin of the polici of the differ european nation with regard to their coloni the polici of europ therefor ha veri littl to boast of either in the

and england and secondli of all those which without trade to it directli send through the medium of other countri good to it of their own produc such as austrian flander and some provinc of germani which through the medium of the countri befor mention send to it a consider quantiti of linen and other good all such countri have evid gain a more extens market for their surplu produc and must consequ have been encourag to increas it quantiti but that those great event should likewis have contribut to encourag the industri of countri such as hungari and poland which mai never perhap have sent a singl commod of their own produc to america is not perhap altogeth so evid that those event have done so howev cannot be doubt some part of the produc of america is consum in hungari and poland and there is some demand there for the sugar chocol and tobacco of that new quarter of the world but those commod must be purchas with someth which is either the produc of the industri of hungari and poland or with someth which had been purchas with some part of that produc those commod of america ar new valu new equival introduc into hungari and poland to be exchang there for the surplu produc of

to america it mai be carri to other countri which purchas it with a part of their share of the surplu produc of america and it mai find a market by mean of the circul of that trade which wa origin put into motion by the surplu produc of america those great event mai even have contribut to increas the enjoy and to augment the industri of countri which not onli never sent ani commod to america but never receiv ani from it even such countri mai have receiv a greater abund of other commod from countri of which the surplu produc had been augment by mean of the american trade thi greater abund as it must necessarili have increas their enjoy so it must likewis have augment their industri a greater number of new equival of some kind or other must have been present to them to be exchang for the surplu produc of that industri a more extens market must have been creat for that surplu produc so as to rais it valu and therebi encourag it increas the mass of commod annual thrown into the great circl of european commerc and by it variou revolut annual distribut among all the differ nation comprehend within it must have been augment by the whole surplu produc of america a greater share of thi greater mass therefor is like to have fallen to each of those nation to have increas their enjoy and augment their industri the exclus trade of the mother countri tend to diminish or at least to keep down below what thei would otherwis rise to both the enjoy and industri of all those nation in gener and of the american coloni in particular it is a dead weight upon the action of on of the great spring which put into motion a great part of the busi of mankind by render the coloni produc dearer in all other countri it lessen it consumpt and therebi cramp the industri of the coloni and both the enjoy and the industri of all other countri which both enjoi less when thei pai more for what thei enjoi and produc less when thei get less for what thei produc by render the produc of all other countri dearer in the coloni it cramp in the same manner the industri of all other coloni and both the enjoy and the industri of the coloni it is a clog which for the suppos benefit of some particular countri embarrass the pleasur and encumb the industri of all other countri but of the coloni more than of ani other it not onli exclud as much as possibl all other countri from on particular market but it confin as much as possibl the coloni to on particular market and the differ is veri great between be exclud from on particular market when all other ar open and be confin to on particular market when all other ar shut up the surplu produc of the coloni howev is the origin sourc of all that increas of enjoy and industri which europ deriv from the discoveri and colon of america and the exclus trade of the mother countri tend to render thi sourc much less abund than it otherwis would be the particular advantag which each colon countri deriv from the coloni which particularli belong to it ar of two differ kind first those common advantag which everi empir deriv from the provinc subject to it dominion and secondli those peculiar advantag which ar suppos to result from provinc of so veri peculiar a natur as the european coloni of america the common advantag which everi empir deriv from the provinc subject to it dominion consist first in the militari forc which thei furnish for it defenc and secondli in the revenu which thei furnish for the support of it civil govern the roman coloni furnish occasion both the on and the other the greek coloni sometim furnish a militari forc but seldom ani revenu thei seldom acknowledg themselv subject to the dominion of the mother citi thei were gener her alli in war but veri seldom her subject in peac the european coloni of america have never yet furnish ani militari forc for the defenc of the mother countri the militari forc ha never yet been suffici for their own defenc and in the differ war in which the mother countri have been engag the defenc of their coloni ha gener occas a veri consider distract of the militari forc of those countri in thi respect therefor all the european coloni have without except been a caus rather of weak than of strength to their respect mother countri the coloni of spain and portug onli have contribut ani revenu toward the defenc of the mother countri or the support of her civil govern the tax which have been levi upon those of other european nation upon those of england in particular have seldom been equal to the expens laid out upon them in time of peac and never suffici to defrai that which thei occas in time of war such coloni therefor have been a sourc of expens and not of revenu to their respect mother countri the advantag of such coloni to their respect mother countri consist altogeth in those peculiar advantag which ar suppos to result from provinc of so veri peculiar a natur as the european coloni of america and the exclus trade it is acknowledg is the sole sourc of all those peculiar advantag in consequ of thi exclus trade all that part of the surplu produc of the english coloni for exampl which consist in what ar call enumer commod can be sent to no other countri but england other countri must afterward bui it of her it must be cheaper therefor in england than it can be in ani other countri and must contribut more to increas the enjoy of england than those of ani other countri it must likewis contribut more to encourag her industri for all those part of her own surplu produc which england exchang for those enumer commod she must get a better price than ani other countri can get for the like part of their when thei exchang them for the same commod the manufactur of england for exampl will purchas a greater quantiti of the sugar and tobacco of her own coloni than the like manufactur of other countri can purchas of that sugar and tobacco so far therefor as the manufactur of england and those of other countri ar both to be exchang for the sugar and tobacco of the english coloni thi superior of price give an encourag to the former beyond what the latter can in these circumst enjoi the exclus trade of the coloni therefor as it diminish or at least keep down below what thei would otherwis rise to both the enjoy and the industri of the countri which do not possess it so it give an evid advantag to the countri which do possess it over those other countri thi advantag howev will perhap be found to be rather what mai be call a rel than an absolut advantag and to give a superior to the countri which enjoi it rather by depress the industri and produc of other countri than by rais those of that particular countri abov what thei would natur rise to in the case of a free trade the tobacco of maryland and virginia for exampl by mean of the monopoli which england enjoi of it certainli come cheaper to england than it can do to franc to whom england commonli sell a consider part of it but had franc and all other european countri been at all time allow a free trade to maryland and virginia the tobacco of those coloni might by thi time have come cheaper than it actual doe not onli to all those other countri but likewis to england the produc of tobacco in consequ of a market so much more extens than ani which it ha hitherto enjoi might and probabl would by thi time have been so much increas as to reduc the profit of a tobacco plantat to their natur level with those of a corn plantat which it is suppos thei ar still somewhat abov the price of tobacco might and probabl would by thi time have fallen somewhat lower than it is at present an equal quantiti of the commod either of england or of those other countri might have purchas in maryland and virginia a greater quantiti of tobacco than it can do at present and consequ have been sold there for so much a better price so far as that weed therefor can by it cheap and abund increas the enjoy or augment the industri either of england or of ani other countri it would probabl in the case of a free trade have produc both these effect in somewhat a greater degre than it can do at present england inde would not in thi case have had ani advantag over other countri she might have bought the tobacco of her coloni somewhat cheaper and consequ have sold some of her own commod somewhat dearer than she actual doe but she could neither have bought the on cheaper nor sold the other dearer than ani other countri might have done she might perhap have gain an absolut but she would certainli have lost a rel advantag in order howev to obtain thi rel advantag in the coloni trade in order to execut the invidi and malign project of exclud as much as possibl other nation from ani share in it england there ar veri probabl reason for believ ha not onli sacrif a part of the absolut advantag which she as well as everi other nation might have deriv from that trade but ha subject herself both to an absolut and to a rel disadvantag in almost everi other branch of trade when by the act of navig england assum to herself the monopoli of the coloni trade the foreign capit which had befor been emploi in it were necessarili withdrawn from it the english capit which had befor carri on but a part of it wa now to carri on the whole the capit which had befor suppli the coloni with but a part of the good which thei want from europ wa now all that wa emploi to suppli them with the whole but it could not suppli them with the whole and the good with which it did suppli them were necessarili sold veri dear the capit which had befor bought but a part of the surplu produc of the coloni wa now all that wa emploi to bui the whole but it could not bui the whole at ani thing near the old price and therefor whatev it did bui it necessarili bought veri cheap but in an employ of capit in which the merchant sold veri dear and bought veri cheap the profit must have been veri great and much abov the ordinari level of profit in other branch of trade thi superior of profit in the coloni trade could not fail to draw from other branch of trade a part of the capit which had befor been emploi in them but thi revuls of capit as it must have gradual increas the competit of capit in the coloni trade so it must have gradual diminish that competit in all those other branch of trade as it must have gradual lower the profit of the on so it must have gradual rais those of the other till the profit of all came to a new level differ from and somewhat higher than that at which thei had been befor thi doubl effect of draw capit from all other trade and of rais the rate of profit somewhat higher than it otherwis would have been in all trade wa not onli produc by thi monopoli upon it first establish but ha continu to be produc by it ever sinc first thi monopoli ha been continu draw capit from all other trade to be emploi in that of the coloni though the wealth of great britain ha increas veri much sinc the establish of the act of navig it certainli ha not increas in the same proport as that or the coloni but the foreign trade of everi countri natur increas in proport to it wealth it surplu produc in proport to it whole produc and great britain have engross to herself almost the whole of what mai be call the foreign trade of the coloni and her capit not have increas in the same proport as the extent of that trade she could not carri it on without continu withdraw from other branch of trade some part of the capit which had befor been emploi in them as well as withhold from them a great deal more which would otherwis have gone to them sinc the establish of the act of navig accordingli the coloni trade ha been continu increas while mani other branch of foreign trade particularli of that to other part of europ have been continu decai our manufactur for foreign sale instead of be suit as befor the act of navig to the neighbour market of europ or to the more distant on of the countri which lie round the mediterranean sea have the greater part of them been accommod to the still more distant on of the coloni to the market in which thei have the monopoli rather than to that in which thei have mani competitor the caus of decai in other branch of foreign trade which by sir matthew decker and other writer have been sought for in the excess and improp mode of taxat in the high price of labour in the increas of luxuri etc mai all be found in the overgrowth of the coloni trade the mercantil capit of great britain though veri great yet not be infinit and though greatli increas sinc the act of navig yet not be increas in the same proport as the coloni trade that trade could not possibl be carri on without withdraw some part of that capit from other branch of trade nor consequ without some decai of those other branch england it must be observ wa a great trade countri her mercantil capit wa veri great and like to becom still greater and greater everi dai not onli befor the act of navig had establish the monopoli of the corn trade but befor that trade wa veri consider in the dutch war dure the govern of cromwel her navi wa superior to that of holland and in that which broke out in the begin of the reign of charl ii it wa at least equal perhap superior to the unit navi of franc and holland it superior perhap would scarc appear greater in the present time at least if the dutch navi were to bear the same proport to the dutch commerc now which it did then but thi great naval power could not in either of those war be ow to the act of navig dure the first of them the plan of that act had been but just form and though befor the break out of the second it had been fulli enact by legal author yet no part of it could have had time to produc ani consider effect and least of all that part which establish the exclus trade to the coloni both the coloni and their trade were inconsider then in comparison of what thei ar how the island of jamaica wa an unwholesom desert littl inhabit and less cultiv new york and new jersei were in the possess of the dutch the half of st christoph in that of the french the island of antigua the two carolina pennsylvania georgia and nova scotia were not plant virginia maryland and new england were

wealth popul and improv the island of barbado in short wa the onli british coloni of ani consequ of which the condit at that time bore ani resembl to what it is at present the trade of the coloni of which england even for some time after the act of navig enjoi but a part for the act of navig wa not veri strictli execut till sever year after it wa enact could not at that time be the caus of the great trade of england nor of the great naval power which wa support by that trade the trade which at that time support that great naval power wa the trade of europ and of the countri which lie round the mediterranean sea but the share which great britain at present enjoi of that trade could not support ani such great naval power had the grow trade of the coloni been left free to all nation whatev share of it might have fallen to great britain and a veri consider share would probabl have fallen to her must have been all an addit to thi great trade of which she wa befor in possess in consequ of the monopoli the increas of the coloni trade ha not so much occas an addit to the trade which great britain had befor as a total chang in it direct secondli thi monopoli ha necessarili contribut to keep up the rate of profit in all the differ branch of british trade higher than it natur would have been had all nation been allow a free trade to the british coloni the monopoli of the coloni trade as it necessarili drew toward that trade a greater proport of the capit of great britain than what would have gone to it of it own accord so by the expuls of all foreign capit it necessarili reduc the whole quantiti of capit emploi in that trade below what it natur would have been in the case of a free trade but by lessen the competit of capit in that branch of trade it necessarili rais the rate of profit in that branch by lessen too the competit of british capit in all other branch of trade it necessarili rais the rate of british profit in all those other branch whatev mai have been at ani particular period sinc the establish of the act of navig the state or extent of the mercantil capit of great britain the monopoli of the coloni trade must dure the continu of that state have rais the ordinari rate of british profit higher than it otherwis would have been both in that and in all the other branch of british trade if sinc the establish of the act of navig the ordinari rate of british profit ha fallen consider as it certainli ha it must have fallen still lower had not the monopoli establish by that act contribut to keep it up but whatev rais in ani countri the ordinari rate of profit higher than it otherwis would be necessarili subject that countri both to an absolut and to a rel disadvantag in everi branch of trade of which she ha not the monopoli it subject her to an absolut disadvantag becaus in such branch of trade her merchant cannot get thi greater profit without sell dearer than thei otherwis would do both the good of foreign countri which thei import into their own and the good of their own countri which thei export to foreign countri their own countri must both bui dearer and sell dearer must both bui less and sell less must both enjoi less and produc less than she otherwis would do it subject her to a rel disadvantag becaus in such branch of trade it set other countri which ar not subject to the same absolut disadvantag either more abov her or less below her than thei otherwis would be it enabl them both to enjoi more and to produc more in proport to what she enjoi and produc it render their superior greater or their inferior less than it otherwis would be by rais the price of her produc abov what it otherwis would be it enabl the merchant of other countri to undersel her in foreign market and therebi to justl her out of almost all those branch of trade of which she ha not the monopoli our merchant frequent complain of the high wage of british labour as the caus of their manufactur be undersold in foreign market but thei ar silent about the high profit of stock thei complain of the extravag gain of other peopl but thei sai noth of their own the high profit of british stock howev mai contribut toward rais the price of british manufactur in mani case as much and in some perhap more than the high wage of british labour it is in thi manner that the capit of great britain on mai justli sai ha partli been drawn and partli been driven from the greater part of the differ branch of trade of which she ha not the monopoli from the trade of europ in particular and from that of the countri which lie round the mediterranean sea it ha partli been drawn from those branch of trade by the attract of superior profit in the coloni trade in consequ of the continu increas of that trade and of the continu insuffici of the capit which had carri it on on year to carri it on the next it ha partli been driven from them by the advantag which the high rate of profit establish in great britain give to other countri in all the differ branch of trade of which great britain ha not the monopoli as the monopoli of the coloni trade ha drawn from those other branch a part of the british capit which would otherwis have been emploi in them so it ha forc into them mani foreign capit which would never have gone to them had thei not been expel from the coloni trade in those other branch of trade it ha diminish the competit of british capit and therebi rais the rate of british profit higher than it otherwis would have been on the contrari it ha increas the competit of foreign capit and therebi sunk the rate of foreign profit lower than it otherwis would have been both in the on wai and in the other it must evid have subject great britain to a rel disadvantag in all those other branch of trade the coloni trade howev it mai perhap be said is more advantag to great britain than ani other and the monopoli by forc into that trade a greater proport of the capit of great britain than what would otherwis have gone to it ha turn that capit into an employ more advantag to the countri than ani other which it could have found the most advantag employ of ani capit to the countri to which it belong is that which maintain there the greatest quantiti of product labour and increas the most the annual produc of the land and labour of that countri but the quantiti of product labour which ani capit emploi in the foreign trade of consumpt can maintain is exactli in proport it ha been shown in the second book to the frequenc of it return a capit of a thousand pound for exampl emploi in a foreign trade of consumpt of which the return ar made regularli onc in the year can keep in constant employ in the countri to which it belong a quantiti of product labour equal to what a thousand pound can maintain there for a year if the return ar made twice or thrice in the year it can keep in constant employ a quantiti of product labour equal to what two or three thousand pound can maintain there for a year a foreign trade of consumpt carri on with a neighbour is upon that account in gener more advantag than on carri on with a distant countri and for the same reason a direct foreign trade of consumpt as it ha likewis been shown in the second book is in gener more advantag than a roundabout on but the monopoli of the coloni trade so far as it ha oper upon the employ of the capit of great britain ha in all case forc some part of it from a foreign trade of consumpt carri on with a neighbour to on carri on with a more distant countri and in mani case from a direct foreign trade of consumpt to a roundabout on first the monopoli of the coloni trade ha in all case forc some part of the capit of great britain from a foreign trade of consumpt carri on with a neighbour to on carri on with a more distant countri it ha in all case forc some part of that capit from the trade with europ and with the countri which lie round the mediterranean sea to that with the more distant region of america and the west indi from which the return ar necessarili less frequent not onli on account of the greater distanc but on account of the peculiar circumst of those countri new coloni it ha alreadi been observ ar alwai understock their capit is alwai much less than what thei could emploi with great profit and advantag in the improv and cultiv of their land thei have a constant demand therefor for more capit than thei have of their own and in order to suppli the defici of their own thei endeavour to borrow as much as thei can of the mother countri to whom thei ar therefor alwai in debt the most common wai in which the coloni contract thi debt is not by borrow upon bond of the rich peopl of the mother countri though thei sometim do thi too but by run as much in arrear to their correspond who suppli them with good from europ as those correspond will allow them their annual return frequent do not amount to more than a third and sometim not to so great a proport of what thei ow the whole capit therefor which their correspond advanc to them is seldom return to britain in less than three and sometim not in less than four or five year but a british capit of a thousand pound for exampl which is return to great britain onli onc in five year can keep in constant employ onli onefifth part of the british industri which it could maintain if the whole wa return onc in the year and instead of the quantiti of industri which a thousand pound could maintain for a year can keep in constant employ the quantiti onli which two hundr pound can maintain for a year the planter no doubt by the high price which he pai for the good from europ by the interest upon the bill which he grant at distant date and by the commiss upon the renew of those which he grant at near date make up and probabl more than make up all the loss which hi correspond can sustain by thi delai but though he make up the loss of hi correspond he cannot make up that of great britain in a trade of which the return ar veri distant the profit of the merchant mai be as great or greater than in on in which thei ar veri frequent and near but the advantag of the countri in which he resid the quantiti of product labour constantli maintain there the annual produc of the land and labour must alwai be much less that the return of the trade to america and still more those of that to the west indi ar in gener not onli more distant but more irregular and more uncertain too than those of the trade to ani part of europ or even of the countri which lie round the mediterranean sea will readili be allow i imagin by everybodi who ha ani experi of those differ branch of trade secondli the monopoli of the coloni trade ha in mani case forc some part of the capit of great britain from a direct foreign trade of consumpt into a roundabout on among the enumer commod which can be sent to no other market but great britain there ar sever of which the quantiti exce veri much the consumpt of great britain and of which a part therefor must be export to other countri but thi cannot be done without forc some part of the capit of great britain into a roundabout foreign trade of consumpt maryland and virginia for exampl send annual to great britain upward of ninetysix thousand hogshead of tobacco and the consumpt of great britain is said not to exce fourteen thousand upward of eightytwo thousand hogshead therefor must be export to other countri to franc to holland and to the countri which lie round the baltic and mediterranean sea but that part of the capit of great britain which bring those eightytwo thousand hogshead to great britain which reexport them from thenc to those other countri and which bring back from those other countri to great britain either good or monei in return is emploi in a roundabout foreign trade of consumpt and is necessarili forc into thi employ in order to dispos of thi great surplu if we would comput in how mani year the whole of thi capit is like to come back to great britain we must add to the distanc of the american return that of the return from those other countri if in the direct foreign trade of consumpt which we carri on with america the whole capit emploi frequent doe not come back in less than three or four year the whole capit emploi in thi roundabout on is not like to come back in less than four or five if the on can keep in constant employ but a third or a fourth part of the domest industri which could be maintain by a capit return onc in the year the other can keep in constant employ but a fourth or a fifth part of that industri at some of the outport a credit is commonli given to those foreign correspond to whom thei export them tobacco at the port of london inde it is commonli sold for readi monei the rule is weigh and pai at the port of london therefor the final return of the whole roundabout trade ar more distant than the return from america by the time onli which the good mai lie unsold in the warehous where howev thei mai sometim lie long enough but had not the coloni been confin to the market of great britain for the sale of their tobacco veri littl more of it would probabl have come to us than what wa necessari

it should continu much longer mai still occas some degre of distress thi distress howev as it will come on gradual will be felt much less sever than if it had come on all at onc and in the mean time the industri and capit of the countri mai find a new employ and direct so as to prevent thi distress from ever rise to ani consider height the monopoli of the coloni trade therefor so far as it ha turn toward that trade a greater proport of the capit of great britain than what would otherwis have gone to it ha in all case turn it from a foreign trade of consumpt with a neighbour into on with a more distant countri in mani case from a direct foreign trade of consumpt into a roundabout on and in some case from all foreign trade of consumpt into a carri trade it ha in all case therefor turn it from a direct in which it would have maintain a greater quantiti of product labour into on in which it can maintain a much smaller quantiti by suit besid to on particular market onli so great a part of the industri and commerc of great britain it ha render the whole state of that industri and commerc more precari and less secur than if their produc had been accommod to a greater varieti of market we must carefulli distinguish between the effect of the coloni trade and those of the monopoli of that trade the former ar alwai and necessarili benefici the latter alwai and necessarili hurt but the former ar so benefici that the coloni trade though subject to a monopoli and notwithstand the hurt effect of that monopoli is still upon the whole benefici and greatli benefici though a good deal less so than it otherwis would be the effect of the coloni trade in it natur and free state is to open a great though distant market for such part of the produc of british industri as mai exce the demand of the market nearer home of those of europ and of the countri which lie round the mediterranean sea in it natur and free state the coloni trade without draw from those market ani part of the produc which had ever been sent to them encourag great britain to increas the surplu continu by continu present new equival to be exchang for it in it natur and free state the coloni trade tend to increas the quantiti of product labour in great britain but without alter in ani respect the direct of that which had been emploi there befor in the natur and free state of the coloni trade the competit of all other nation would hinder the rate of profit from rise abov the common level either in the new market or in the new employ the new market without draw ani thing from the old on would creat if on mai sai so a new produc for it own suppli and that new produc would constitut a new capit for carri on the new employ which in the same manner would draw noth from the old on the monopoli of the coloni trade on the contrari by exclud the competit of other nation and therebi rais the rate of profit both in the new market and in the new employ draw produc from the old market and capit from the old employ to augment our share of the coloni trade beyond what it otherwis would be is the avow purpos of the monopoli if our share of that trade were to be no greater with than it would have been without the monopoli there could have been no reason for establish the monopoli but whatev forc into a branch of trade of which the return ar slower and more distant than those of the greater part of other trade a greater proport of the capit of ani countri than what of it own accord would go to that branch necessarili render the whole quantiti of product labour annual maintain there the whole annual produc of the land and labour of that countri less than thei otherwis would be it keep down the revenu of the inhabit of that countri below what it would natur rise to and therebi diminish their power of accumul it not onli hinder at all time their capit from maintain so great a quantiti of product labour as it would otherwis maintain but it hinder it from increas so fast as it would otherwis increas and consequ from maintain a still greater quantiti of product labour the natur good effect of the coloni trade howev more than counterbal to great britain the bad effect of the monopoli so that monopoli and altogeth that trade even as it is carri on at present is not onli advantag but greatli advantag the new market and the new employ which ar open by the coloni trade ar of much greater extent than that portion of the old market and of the old employ which is lost by the monopoli the new produc and the new capit which ha been creat if on mai sai so by the coloni trade maintain in great britain a greater quantiti of product labour than what can have been thrown out of employ by the revuls of capit from other trade of which the return ar more frequent if the coloni trade howev even as it is carri on at present is advantag to great britain it is not by mean of the monopoli but in spite of the monopoli it is rather for the manufactur than for the rude produc of europ that the coloni trade open a new market agricultur is the proper busi of all new coloni a busi which the cheap of land render more advantag than ani other thei abound therefor in the rude produc of land and instead of import it from other countri thei have gener a larg surplu to export in new coloni agricultur either draw hand from all other employ or keep them from go to ani other employ there ar few hand to spare for the necessari and none for the ornament manufactur the greater part of the manufactur of both kind thei find it cheaper to purchas of other countri than to make for themselv it is chiefli by encourag the manufactur of europ that the coloni trade indirectli encourag it agricultur the manufactur of europ to whom that trade give employ constitut a new market for the produc of the land and the most advantag of all market the home market for the corn and cattl for the bread and butcher meat of europ is thu greatli extend by mean of the trade to america but that the monopoli of the trade of popul and thrive coloni is not alon suffici to establish or even to maintain manufactur in ani countri the exampl of spain and portug suffici demonstr spain and portug were manufactur countri befor thei had ani consider coloni sinc thei had the richest and most fertil in the world thei have both ceas to be so in spain and portug the bad effect of the monopoli aggrav by other caus have perhap nearli overbalanc the natur good effect of the coloni trade these caus seem to be other monopoli of differ kind the degrad of the valu of gold and silver below what it is in most other countri the exclus from foreign market by improp tax upon export and the narrow of the home market by still more improp tax upon the transport of good from on part of the countri to anoth but abov all that irregular and partial administr of justic which often protect the rich and power debtor from the pursuit of hi injur creditor and which make the industri part of the nation afraid to prepar good for the consumpt of those haughti and great men to whom thei dare not refus to sell upon credit and from whom thei ar altogeth uncertain of repay in england on the contrari the natur good effect of the coloni trade assist by other caus have in a great measur conquer the bad effect of the monopoli these caus seem to be the gener liberti of trade which notwithstand some restraint is at least equal perhap superior to what it is in ani other countri the liberti of export duti free almost all sort of good which ar the produc of domest industri to almost ani foreign countri and what perhap is of still greater import the unbound liberti of transport them from on part of our own countri to ani other without be oblig to give ani account to ani public offic without be liabl to question or examin of ani kind but abov all that equal and imparti administr of justic which render the right of the meanest british subject respect to the greatest and which by secur to everi man the fruit of hi own industri give the greatest and most effectu encourag to everi sort of industri if the manufactur of great britain howev have been advanc as thei certainli have by the coloni trade it ha not been by mean of the monopoli of that trade but in spite of the monopoli the effect of the monopoli ha been not to augment the quantiti but to alter the qualiti and shape of a part of the manufactur of great britain and to accommod to a market from which the return ar slow and distant what would otherwis have been accommod to on from which the return ar frequent and near it effect ha consequ been to turn a part of the capit of great britain from an employ in which it would have maintain a greater quantiti of manufactur industri to on in which it maintain a much smaller and therebi to diminish instead of increas the whole quantiti of manufactur industri maintain in great britain the monopoli of the coloni trade therefor like all the other mean and malign expedi of the mercantil system depress the industri of all other countri but chiefli that of the coloni without in the least increas but on the contrari diminish that of the countri in whose favour it is establish the monopoli hinder the capit of that countri whatev mai at ani particular time be the extent of that capit from maintain so great a quantiti of product labour as it would otherwis maintain and from afford so great a revenu to the industri inhabit as it would otherwis afford but as capit can be increas onli by save from revenu the monopoli by hinder it from afford so great a revenu as it would otherwis afford necessarili hinder it from increas so fast as it would otherwis increas and consequ from maintain a still greater quantiti of product labour and afford a still greater revenu to the industri inhabit of that countri on great origin sourc of revenu therefor the wage of labour the monopoli must necessarili have render at all time less abund than it otherwis would have been by rais the rate of mercantil profit the monopoli discourag the improv of land the profit of improv depend upon the differ between what the land actual produc and what by the applic of a certain capit it can be made to produc if thi differ afford a greater profit than what can be drawn from an equal capit in ani mercantil employ the improv of land will draw capit from all mercantil employ if the profit is less mercantil employ will draw capit from the improv of land whatev therefor rais the rate of mercantil profit either lessen the superior or increas the inferior of the profit of improv and in the on

therebi augment somewhat the gain of our merchant but as it obstruct the natur increas of capit it tend rather to diminish than to increas the sum total of the revenu which the inhabit of the countri

the provinci affair of each coloni might still be regul by it own assembl though the coloni should in thi case have no repres in the british parliament yet if we mai judg by experi there is no probabl that the parliamentari requisit would be unreason the parliament of england ha not upon ani occas shewn the smallest disposit to overburden those part of the empir which ar not repres in parliament the island of guernsei and jersei without ani mean of resist the author of parliament ar more lightli tax than ani part of great britain parliament in attempt to exercis it suppos right whether well

impos what tax he think proper but assess and levi them in the wai he think proper from other he demand a certain sum but leav it to the state of each provinc to assess and levi that sum as thei think

fear that their share of the public burden should ever exce the proper proport to that of their fellowcitizen at home great britain might have just reason to fear that it never would amount to that proper proport the parliament of great britain ha not for some time past had the same establish author in the coloni which the french king ha in those provinc of franc which still enjoi the privileg

answer for the whole burden of the debt contract on account of the war would in thi manner fall as it alwai ha done hitherto upon great britain upon a part of the empir and not upon the whole empir great britain is perhap sinc the world began the onli state which as it ha extend it empir ha onli increas it expens without onc augment it resourc other state have gener disburden themselv upon their

parliamentari requisit that parliament should have some mean of render it requisit immedi effectu in case the coloni assembl should attempt to evad or reject them and what those mean ar it is not veri easi to conceiv and it ha not yet been explain should the parliament of great britain at the same time be ever fulli establish in the right of tax the coloni even independ of the consent of their own

thi and on the other side of the atlant we on thi side the water ar afraid lest the multitud of american repres should overturn the balanc of the constitut and increas too much either the influenc of the crown on the on hand or the forc of the democraci on the other but if the number of american repres were to be in proport to the produc of american taxat the number of peopl to be manag would

their repres in parliament of which the number ought from the first to be consider would easili be abl to protect them from all oppress the distanc could not much weaken the depend of the repres upon

seem to have arisen rather from accid than from ani thing in the natur of those event themselv at the particular time when these discoveri were made the superior of forc happen to be so great on the

countri natur or rather necessarili carri along with it in the mean time on of the princip effect of those discoveri ha been to rais the mercantil system to a degre of splendour and glori which it could never otherwis have attain to it is the object of that system to enrich a great nation rather by trade and manufactur than by the improv and cultiv of land rather by the industri of the town

thei help to support the sumptuou profus of the merchant of cadiz and lisbon even the regul by which each nation endeavour to secur to itself the exclus trade of it own coloni ar frequent more hurt to the countri in favour of which thei ar establish than to those against which thei ar establish the unjust oppress of the industri of other countri fall back if i mai sai so upon the head of the oppressor and crush their industri more than it doe that of those other countri by those regul for exampl the merchant of hamburg must send the linen which he destin for the american market to london and he must bring back from thenc the tobacco which he destin for the german market becaus he can neither send the on directli to america nor bring the other directli from thenc by thi restraint he is probabl oblig to sell the on somewhat cheaper and to bui the other somewhat dearer than he otherwis might have done and hi profit ar probabl somewhat abridg by mean of it in thi trade howev between hamburg and london he certainli receiv the return of hi capit much more quickli than he could possibl have done in the direct trade to america even though we should suppos what is by no mean the case that the payment of america were as punctual as those of london in the trade therefor to which those regul confin the merchant of hamburg hi capit can keep in constant employ a much greater quantiti of german industri than he possibl could have done in the trade from which he is exclud though the on employ therefor mai to him perhap be less profit than the other it cannot be less advantag to hi countri it is quit otherwis with the employ into which the monopoli natur attract if i mai sai so the capit of the london merchant that employ mai perhap be more profit to him than the greater part of other employ but on account of the slow of the return it cannot be more advantag to hi countri after all the unjust attempt therefor of everi countri in europ to engross to itself the whole advantag of the trade of it own coloni no countri ha yet been abl to engross to itself ani thing but the expens of support in time of peac and of defend in time of war the oppress author which it assum over them the inconveni result from the possess of it coloni everi countri ha engross to itself complet the advantag result from their trade it ha been oblig to share with mani other countri at first sight no doubt the monopoli of the great commerc of america natur seem to be an acquisit of the highest valu to the undiscern ey of giddi ambit it natur present itself amidst the confus scrambl of polit and war as a veri dazzl object to fight for the dazzl splendour of the object howev the immens great of the commerc is the veri qualiti which render the monopoli of it hurt or which make on employ in it own natur necessarili less advantag to the countri than the greater part of other employ absorb a much greater proport of the capit of the countri than what would otherwis have gone to it the mercantil stock of everi countri it ha been shown in the second book natur seek if on mai sai so the employ most advantag to that countri if it is emploi in the carri trade the countri to which it belong becom the emporium of the good of all the countri whose trade that stock carri on but the owner of that stock necessarili wish to dispos of as great a part of those good as he can at home he therebi save himself the troubl risk and expens of export and he will upon that account be glad to sell them at home not onli for a much smaller price but with somewhat a smaller profit than he might expect to make by send them abroad he natur therefor endeavour as much as he can to turn hi carri trade into a foreign trade of consumpt if hi stock again is emploi in a foreign trade of consumpt he will for the same reason be glad to dispos of at home as great a part as he can of the home good which he collect in order to export to some foreign market and he will thu endeavour as much as he can to turn hi foreign trade of consumpt into a home trade the mercantil stock of everi countri natur court in thi manner the near and shun the distant employ natur court the employ in which the return ar frequent and shun that in which thei ar distant and slow natur court the employ in which it can maintain the greatest quantiti of product labour in the countri to which it belong or in which it owner resid and shun that in which it can maintain there the smallest quantiti it natur court the employ which in ordinari case is most advantag and shun that which in ordinari case is least advantag to that countri but if in ani on of those distant employ which in ordinari case ar less advantag to the countri the profit should happen to rise somewhat higher than what is suffici to balanc the natur prefer which is given to nearer employ thi superior of profit will draw stock from those nearer employ till the profit of all return to their proper level thi superior of profit howev is a proof that in the actual circumst of the societi those distant employ ar somewhat understock in proport to other employ and that the stock of the societi is not distribut in the properest manner among all the differ employ carri on in it it is a proof that someth is either bought cheaper or sold dearer than it ought to be and that some particular class of citizen is more or less oppress either by pai more or by get less than what is suitabl to that equal which ought to take place and which natur doe take place among all the differ class of them though the same capit never will maintain the same quantiti of product labour in a distant as in a near employ yet a distant employ mayb as necessari for the welfar of the societi as a near on the good which the distant employ deal in be necessari perhap for carri on mani of the nearer employ but if the profit of those who deal in such good ar abov their proper level those good will be sold dearer than thei ought to be or somewhat abov their natur price and all those engag in the nearer employ will be more or less oppress by thi high price their interest therefor in thi case requir that some stock should be withdrawn from those nearer employ and turn toward that distant on in order to reduc it profit to their proper level and the price of the good which it deal in to their natur price in thi extraordinari case the public interest requir that some stock should be withdrawn from those employ which in ordinari case ar more advantag and turn toward on which in ordinari case is less advantag to the public and in thi extraordinari case the natur interest and inclin of men coincid as exactli with the public interest as in all other ordinari case and lead them to withdraw stock from the near and to turn it toward the distant employ it is thu that the privat interest and passion of individu natur dispos them to turn their stock toward the employ which in ordinari case ar most advantag to the societi but if from thi natur prefer thei should turn too much of it toward those employ the fall of profit in them and the rise of it in all other immedi dispos them to alter thi faulti distribut without ani intervent of law therefor the privat interest and passion of men natur lead them to divid and distribut the stock of everi societi among all the differ employ carri on in it as nearli as possibl in the proport which is most agreeabl to the interest of the whole societi all the differ regul of the mercantil system necessarili derang more or less thi natur and most advantag distribut of stock but those which concern the trade to america and the east indi derang it perhap more than ani other becaus the trade to those two great contin absorb a greater quantiti of stock than ani two other branch of trade the regul howev by which thi derang is effect in those two differ branch of trade ar not altogeth the same monopoli is the great engin of both but it is a differ sort of monopoli monopoli of on kind or anoth inde seem to be the sole engin of the mercantil system in the trade to america everi nation endeavour to engross as much as possibl the whole market of it own coloni by fairli exclud all other nation from ani direct trade to them dure the greater part of the sixteenth centuri the portugues endeavour to manag the trade to the east indi in the same manner by claim the sole right of sail in the indian sea on account of the merit of have first found out the road to them the dutch still continu to exclud all other european nation from ani direct trade to their spice island monopoli of thi kind ar evid establish against all other european nation who ar therebi not onli exclud from a trade to which it might be conveni for them to turn some part of their stock but ar oblig to bui the good which that trade deal in somewhat dearer than if thei could import them themselv directli from the countri which produc them but sinc the fall of the power of portug no european nation ha claim the exclus right of sail in the indian sea of which the princip port ar now open to the ship of all european nation except in portug howev and within these few year in franc the trade to the east indi ha in everi european countri been subject to an exclus compani monopoli of thi kind ar properli establish against the veri nation which erect them the greater part of that nation ar therebi not onli exclud from a trade to which it might be conveni for them to turn some part of their stock but ar oblig to bui the good which that trade deal in somewhat dearer than if it wa open and free to all their countrymen sinc the establish of the english east india compani for exampl the other inhabit of england over and abov be exclud from the trade must have paid in the price of the east india good which thei have consum not onli for all the extraordinari profit which the compani mai have made upon those good in consequ of their monopoli but for all the extraordinari wast which the fraud and abus insepar from the manag of the affair of so great a compani must necessarili have occas the absurd of thi second kind of monopoli therefor is much more manifest than that of the first both these kind of monopoli derang more or less the natur distribut of the stock of the societi but thei do not alwai derang it in the same wai monopoli of the first kind alwai attract to the particular trade in which thei ar establish a greater proport of the stock of the societi than what would go to that trade of it own accord monopoli of the second kind mai sometim attract stock toward the particular trade in which thei ar establish and sometim repel it from that trade accord to differ circumst in poor countri thei natur attract toward that trade more stock than would otherwis go to it in rich countri thei natur repel from it a good deal of stock which would otherwis go to it such poor countri as sweden and denmark for exampl would probabl have never sent a singl ship to the east indi had not the trade been subject to an exclus compani the establish of such a compani necessarili encourag adventur their monopoli secur them against all competitor in the home market and thei have the same chanc for foreign market with the trader of other nation their monopoli show them the certainti of a great profit upon a consider quantiti of good and the chanc of a consider profit upon a great quantiti without such extraordinari encourag the poor trader of such poor countri would probabl never have thought of hazard their small capit in so veri distant and uncertain an adventur as the trade to the east indi must natur have appear to them such a rich countri as holland on the contrari would probabl in the case of a free trade send mani more ship to the east indi than it actual doe the limit stock of the dutch east india compani probabl repel from that trade mani great mercantil capit which would otherwis go to it the mercantil capit of holland is so great that it is as it were continu overflow sometim into the public fund of foreign countri sometim into loan to privat trader and adventur of foreign countri sometim into the most roundabout foreign trade of consumpt and sometim into the carri trade all near employ be complet fill up all the capit which can be place in them with ani toler profit be alreadi place in them the capit of holland necessarili flow toward the most distant employ the trade to the east indi if it were altogeth free would probabl absorb the greater part of thi redund capit the east indi offer a market both for the manufactur of europ and for the gold and silver as well as for the sever other product of america greater and more extens than both europ and america put togeth everi derang of the natur distribut of stock is necessarili hurt to the societi in which it take place whether it be by repel from a particular trade the stock which would otherwis go to it or by attract toward a particular trade that which would not otherwis come to it if without ani exclus compani the trade of holland to the east indi would be greater than it actual is that countri must suffer a consider loss by part of it capit be exclud from the employ most conveni for that port and in the same manner if without an exclus compani the trade of sweden and denmark to the east indi would be less than it actual is or what perhap is more probabl would not exist at all those two countri must likewis suffer a consider loss by part of their capit be drawn into an employ which must be more or less unsuit to their present circumst better for them perhap in the present circumst to bui east india good of other nation even though thei should pai somewhat dearer than to turn so great a part of their small capit to so veri distant a trade in which the return ar so veri slow in which that capit can maintain so small a quantiti of product labour at home where product labour is so much want where so littl is done and where so much is to do though without an exclus compani therefor a particular countri should not be abl to carri on ani direct trade to the east indi it will not from thenc follow that such a compani ought to be establish there but onli that such a countri ought not in these circumst to trade directli to the east indi that such compani ar not in gener necessari for carri on the east india trade is suffici demonstr by the experi of the portugues who enjoi almost the whole of it for more than a centuri togeth without ani exclus compani no privat merchant it ha been said could well have capit suffici to maintain factor and agent in the differ port of the east indi in order to provid good for the ship which he might occasion send thither and yet unless he wa abl to do thi the difficulti of find a cargo might frequent make hi ship lose the season for return and the expens of so long a delai would not onli eat up the whole profit of the adventur but frequent occas a veri consider loss thi argument howev if it prove ani thing at all would prove that no on great branch of trade could be carri on without an exclus compani which is contrari to the experi of all nation there is no great branch of trade in which the capit of ani on privat merchant is suffici for carri on all the subordin branch which must be carri on in order to carri on the princip on but when a nation is ripe for ani great branch of trade some merchant natur turn their capit toward the princip and some toward the subordin branch of it and though all the differ branch of it ar in thi manner carri on yet it veri seldom happen that thei ar all carri on by the capit of on privat merchant if a nation therefor is ripe for the east india trade a certain portion of it capit will natur divid itself among all the differ branch of that trade some of it merchant will find it for their interest to resid in the east indi and to emploi their capit there in provid good for the ship which ar to be sent out by other merchant who resid in europ the settlement which differ european nation have obtain in the east indi if thei were taken from the exclus compani to which thei at present belong and put under the immedi protect of the sovereign would render thi resid both safe and easi at least to the merchant of the particular nation to whom those settlement belong if at ani particular time that part of the capit of ani countri which of it own accord tend and inclin if i mai sai so toward the east india trade wa not suffici for carri on all those differ branch of it it would be a proof that at that particular time that countri wa not ripe for that trade and that it would do better to bui for some time even at a higher price from other european nation the east india good it had occas for than to import them itself directli from the east indi what it might lose by the high price of those good could seldom be equal to the loss which it would sustain by the distract of a larg portion of it capit from other employ more necessari or more us or more suitabl to it circumst and situat than a direct trade to the east indi though the european possess mani consider settlement both upon the coast of africa and in the east indi thei have not yet establish in either of those countri such numer and thrive coloni as those in the island and contin of america africa howev as well as sever of the countri comprehend under the gener name of the east indi is inhabit by barbar nation but those nation were by no mean so weak and defenceless as the miser and helpless american and in proport to the natur fertil of the countri which thei inhabit thei were besid much more popul the most barbar nation either of africa or of the east indi were shepherd even the hottentot were so but the nativ of everi part of america except mexico and peru were onli hunter and the differ is veri great between the number of shepherd and that of hunter whom the same extent of equal fertil territori can maintain in africa and the east indi therefor it wa more difficult to displac the nativ and to extend the european plantat over the greater part of the land of the origin inhabit the geniu of exclus compani besid is unfavour it ha alreadi been observ to the growth of new coloni and ha probabl been the princip caus of the littl progress which thei have made in the east indi the portugues carri on the trade both to africa and the east indi without ani exclus compani and their settlement at congo angola and benguela on the coast of africa and at goa in the east indi though much depress by superstit and everi sort of bad govern yet bear some resembl to the coloni of america and ar partli inhabit by portugues who have been establish there for sever gener the dutch settlement at the cape of good hope and at batavia ar at present the most consider coloni which the european have establish either in africa or in the east indi and both those settlement an peculiarli fortun in their situat the cape of good hope wa inhabit by a race of peopl almost as barbar and quit as incap of defend themselv as the nativ of america it is besid the halfwai hous if on mai sai so between europ and the east indi at which almost everi european ship make some stai both in go and return the suppli of those ship with everi sort of fresh provis with fruit and sometim with wine afford alon a veri extens market for the surplu produc of the coloni what the cape of good hope is between europ and everi part of the east indi batavia is between the princip countri of the east indi it li upon the most frequent road from indostan to china and japan and is nearli about midwai upon that road almost all the ship too that sail between europ and china touch at batavia and it is over and abov all thi the centr and princip mart of what is call the countri trade of the east indi not onli of that part of it which is carri on by european but of that which is carri on by the nativ indian and vessel navig by the inhabit of china and japan of tonquin malacca cochinchina and the island of celeb ar frequent to be seen in it port such advantag situat have enabl those two coloni to surmount all the obstacl which the oppress geniu of an exclus compani mai have occasion oppos to their growth thei have enabl batavia to surmount the addit disadvantag of perhap the most unwholesom climat in the world the english and dutch compani though thei have establish no consider coloni except the two abov mention have both made consider conquest in the east indi but in the manner in which thei both govern their new subject the natur geniu of an exclus compani ha shewn itself most distinctli in the spice island the dutch ar said to burn all the spiceri which a fertil season produc beyond what thei expect to dispos of in europ with such a profit as thei think suffici in the island where thei have no settlement thei give a premium to those who collect the young blossom and green leav of the clove and nutmeg tree which natur grow there but which thi savag polici ha now it is said almost complet extirp even in the island where thei have settlement thei have veri much reduc it is said the number of those tree if the produc even of their own island wa much greater than what suit their market the nativ thei suspect might find mean to convei some part of it to other nation and the best wai thei imagin to secur their own monopoli is to take care that no more shall grow than what thei themselv carri to market by differ art of oppress thei have reduc the popul of sever of the molucca nearli to the number which is suffici to suppli with fresh provis and other necessari of life their own insignific garrison and such of their ship as occasion come there for a cargo of spice under the govern even of the portugues howev those island ar said to have been toler well inhabit the english compani have not yet had time to establish in bengal so perfectli destruct a system the plan of their govern howev ha had exactli the same tendenc it ha not been uncommon i am well assur for the chief that is the first clerk or a factori to order a peasant to plough up a rich field of poppi and sow it with rice or some other grain the pretenc wa to prevent a scarciti of provis but the real reason to give the chief an opportun of sell at a better price a larg quantiti of opium which he happen then to have upon hand upon other occas the order ha been revers and a rich field of rice or other grain ha been plough up in order to make room for a plantat of poppi when the chief foresaw that extraordinari profit wa like to be made by opium the servant of the compani have upon sever occas attempt to establish in their own favour the monopoli of some of the most import branch not onli of the foreign but of the inland trade of the countri had thei been allow to go on it is imposs that thei should not at some time or anoth have attempt to restrain the product of the particular articl of which thei had thu usurp the monopoli not onli to the quantiti which thei themselv could purchas but to that which thei could expect to sell with such a profit as thei might think suffici in the cours of a centuri or two the polici of the english compani would in thi manner have probabl prove as complet destruct as that of the dutch noth howev can be more directli contrari to the real interest of those compani consid as the sovereign of the countri which thei have conquer than thi destruct plan in almost all countri the revenu of the sovereign is drawn from that of the peopl the greater the revenu of the peopl therefor the greater the annual produc of their land and labour the more thei can afford to the sovereign it is hi interest therefor to increas as much as possibl that annual produc but if thi is the interest of everi sovereign it is peculiarli so of on whose revenu like that of the sovereign of bengal aris chiefli from a landrent that rent must necessarili be in proport to the quantiti and valu of the produc and both the on and the other must depend upon the extent of the market the quantiti will alwai be suit with more or less exact to the consumpt of those who can afford to pai for it and the price which thei will pai will alwai be in proport to the eager of their competit it is the interest of such a sovereign therefor to open the most extens market for the produc of hi countri to allow the most perfect freedom of commerc in order to increas as much as possibl the number and competit of buyer and upon thi account to abolish not onli all monopoli but all restraint upon the transport of the home produc from on part of the countri to mother upon it export to foreign countri or upon the import of good of ani kind for which it can be exchang he is in thi manner most like to increas both the quantiti and valu of that produc and consequ of hi own share of it or of hi own revenu but a compani of merchant ar it seem incap of consid themselv as sovereign even after thei have becom such trade or bui in order to sell again thei still consid as their princip busi and by a strang absurd regard the charact of the sovereign as but an appendix to that of the merchant as someth which ought to be made subservi to it or by mean of which thei mai be enabl to bui cheaper in india and therebi to sell with a better profit in europ thei endeavour for thi purpos to keep out as much as possibl all competitor from the market of the countri which ar subject to their govern and consequ to reduc at least some part of the surplu produc of those countri to what is bare suffici for suppli their own demand or to what thei can expect to sell in europ with such a profit as thei mai think reason their mercantil habit draw them in thi manner almost necessarili though perhap insens to prefer upon all ordinari occas the littl and transitori profit of the monopolist to the great and perman revenu of the sovereign and would gradual lead them to treat the countri subject to their govern nearli as the dutch treat the molucca it is the interest of the east india compani consid as sovereign that the european good which ar carri to their indian dominion should be sold there as cheap as possibl and that the indian good which ar brought from thenc should bring there as good a price or should be sold there as dear as possibl but the revers of thi is their interest as merchant as sovereign their interest is exactli the same with that of the countri which thei govern as merchant their interest is directli opposit to that interest but if the geniu of such a govern even as to what concern it direct in europ is in thi manner essenti and perhap incur faulti that of it administr in india is still more so that administr is necessarili compos of a council of merchant a profess no doubt extrem respect but which in no countri in the world carri along with it that sort of author which natur overaw the peopl and without forc command their will obedi such a council can command obedi onli by the militari forc with which thei ar accompani and their govern is therefor necessarili militari and despot their proper busi howev is that of merchant it is to sell upon their master account the european good consign to them and to bui in return indian good for the european market it is to sell the on as dear and to bui the other as cheap as possibl and consequ to exclud as much as possibl all rival from the particular market where thei keep their shop the geniu of the administr therefor so far as concern the trade of the compani is the same as that of the direct it tend to make govern subservi to the interest of monopoli and consequ to stunt the natur growth of some part at least of the surplu produc of the countri to what is bare suffici for answer the demand of the compani all the member of the administr besid trade more or less upon their own account and it is in vain to prohibit them from do so noth can be more complet foolish than to expect that the clerk of a great countinghous at ten thousand mile distanc and consequ almost quit out of sight should upon a simpl order from their master give up at onc do ani sort of busi upon their own account abandon for ever all hope of make a fortun of which thei have the mean in their hand and content themselv with the moder salari which those master allow them and which moder as thei ar can seldom be augment be commonli as larg as the real profit of the compani trade can afford in such circumst to prohibit the servant of the compani from trade upon their own account can have scarc ani other effect than to enabl it superior servant under pretenc of execut their master order to oppress such of the inferior on as have had the misfortun to fall under their displeasur the servant natur endeavour to establish the same monopoli in favour of their own privat trade as of the public trade of the compani if thei ar suffer to act as thei could wish thei will establish thi monopoli openli and directli by fairli prohibit all other peopl from trade in the articl in which thei choos to deal and thi perhap is the best and least oppress wai of establish it but if by an order from europ thei ar prohibit from do thi thei will notwithstand endeavour to establish a monopoli of the same kind secretli and indirectli in a wai that is much more destruct to the countri thei will emploi the whole author of govern and pervert the administr of justic in order to harass and ruin those who interfer with them in ani branch of commerc which by mean of agent either conceal or at least not publicli avow thei mai choos to carri on but the privat trade of the servant will natur extend to a much greater varieti of articl than the public trade of the compani the public trade of the compani extend no further than the trade with europ and comprehend a part onli of the foreign trade of the countri but the privat trade of the servant mai extend to all the differ branch both of it inland and foreign trade the monopoli of the compani can tend onli to stunt the natur growth of that part of the surplu produc which in the case of a free trade would be export to europ that of the servant tend to stunt the natur growth of everi part of the produc in which thei choos to deal of what is destin for home consumpt as well as of what is destin for export and consequ to degrad the cultiv of the whole countri and to reduc the number of it inhabit it tend to reduc the quantiti of everi sort of produc even that of the necessari of life whenev the servant of the countri choos to deal in them to what those servant can both afford to bui and expect to sell with such a profit as pleas them from the natur of their situat too the servant must be more dispos to support with rigour sever their own interest against that of the countri which thei govern than their master can be to support their the countri belong to their master who cannot avoid have some regard for the interest of what belong to them but it doe not belong to the servant the real interest of their master if thei were capabl of understand it is the same with that of the countri the interest of everi proprietor of india stock howev is by no mean the same with that of the countri in the govern of which hi vote give him some influencese book v chap part iiand it is from ignor chiefli and the mean of mercantil prejudic that thei ever oppress it but the real interest of the servant is by no mean the same with that of the countri and the most perfect inform would not necessarili put an end to their oppress the regul accordingli which have been sent out from europ though thei have been frequent weak have upon most occas been well mean more intellig and perhap less good mean ha sometim appear in those establish by the servant in india it is a veri singular govern in which everi member of the

indiffer though the whole countri wa swallow up by an earthquak i mean not howev by ani thing which i have here said to throw ani odiou imput upon the gener charact of the servant of the east india

which thei themselv could not well know that thei possess if upon some occas therefor it ha anim them to action of magnanim which could not well have been expect from them we should not wonder if upon other it ha prompt them to exploit of somewhat a differ natur such exclus compani therefor ar nuisanc in everi respect alwai more or less inconveni to the countri in which thei ar establish and destruct to those which have the misfortun to fall under their govern chapter viii conclus of the mercantil system though the encourag of export and the discourag of import ar the two great engin by which the mercantil system propos to enrich everi countri yet with regard to some particular commod it seem to follow an opposit plan to discourag export and to encourag import it ultim object howev it pretend is alwai the same to enrich the countri by an advantag balanc of trade it discourag the export of the materi of manufactur and of the instrument of trade in order to give our own workmen an advantag and to enabl them to undersel those of other nation in all foreign market and by restrain in thi manner the export of a few commod of no great price it propos to occas a much greater and more valuabl export of other it encourag the import of the materi of manufactur in order that our own peopl mai be enabl to work them up more cheapli and therebi prevent a greater and more valuabl import of the manufactur commod i do not observ at least in our statut book ani encourag given to the import of the instrument of trade when manufactur have advanc to a certain pitch of great the fabric of the instrument of trade becom itself the object of a great number of veri import manufactur to give ani particular encourag to the import of such instrument would interfer too much with the interest of those manufactur such import therefor instead of be encourag ha frequent been prohibit thu the import of wool card except from ireland or when brought in as wreck or prize good wa prohibit by the rd of edward iv which prohibit wa renew by the th of elizabeth and ha been continu and render perpetu by subsequ law the import of the materi of manufactur ha sometim been encourag by an exempt from the duti to which other good ar subject and sometim by bounti the import of sheep wool from sever differ countri of cotton wool from all countri of undress flax of the greater part of dye drug of the greater part of undress hide from ireland or the british coloni of seal skin from the british greenland fisheri of pig and bar iron from the british coloni as well as of sever other materi of manufactur ha been encourag by an exempt from all duti if properli enter at the customhous the privat interest of our merchant and manufactur mai perhap have extort from the legislatur these exempt as well as the greater part of our other commerci regul thei ar howev perfectli just and reason and if consist with the necess of the state thei could be extend to all the other materi of manufactur the public would certainli be a gainer the avid of our great manufactur howev ha in some case extend these exempt a good deal beyond what can justli be consid as the rude materi of their work by the th geo ii chap a small duti of onli d the pound wa impos upon the import of foreign brown linen yarn instead of much higher duti to which it had been subject befor viz of d the pound upon sail yarn of s the pound upon all french and dutch yarn and of upon the hundr weight of all spruce or muscovia yarn but our manufactur were not long satisfi with thi reduct by the th of the same king chap the same law which gave a bounti upon the export of british and irish linen of which the price did not exce d the yard even thi small duti upon the import of brown linen yarn wa taken awai in the differ oper howev which ar necessari for the prepar of linen yarn a good deal more industri is emploi than in the subsequ oper of prepar linen cloth from linen yarn to sai noth of the industri of the flaxgrow and flaxdress three or four spinner at least ar necessari in order to keep on weaver in constant employ and more than fourfifth of the whole quantiti of labour necessari for the prepar of linen cloth is emploi in that of linen yarn but our spinner ar poor peopl women commonli scatter about in all differ part of the countri without support or protect it is not by the sale of their work but by that of the complet work of the weaver that our great master manufactur make their profit as it is their interest to sell the complet manufactur as dear so it is to bui the materi as cheap as possibl by extort from the legislatur bounti upon the export of their own linen high duti upon the import of all foreign linen and a total prohibit of the home consumpt of some sort of french linen thei endeavour to sell their own good as dear as possibl by encourag the import of foreign linen yarn and therebi bring it into competit with that which is made by our own peopl thei endeavour to bui the work of the poor spinner as cheap as possibl thei ar as intent to keep down the wage of their own weaver as the earn of the poor spinner and it is by no mean for the benefit of the workmen that thei endeavour either to rais the price of the complet work or to lower that of the rude materi it is the industri which is carri on for the benefit of the rich and the power that is princip encourag by our mercantil system that which is carri on for the benefit of the poor and the indig is too often either neglect or oppress both the bounti upon the export of linen and the exempt from the duti upon the import of foreign yarn which were grant onli for fifteen year but continu by two differ prolong expir with the end of the session of parliament which shall immedi follow the th of june the

that for the import of hemp and undress flax from america for twentyon year from the th june to the th june the term is divid likewis into three period of seven year each and in each of those period the rate of the irish bounti is the same with that of the american it doe not howev like the american bounti extend to the import of undress flax it would have been too great a discourag to the cultiv of that plant in great britain when thi last bounti wa grant the british and irish legislatur were not in much better humour with on anoth than the british and american had been befor but thi boon to ireland it is to be hope ha been grant under more fortun auspic than all those to america the same commod upon which we thu gave bounti when import from america were subject to consider duti when import from ani other countri the interest of our american coloni wa regard as the same with that of the mother countri their wealth wa consid as our wealth whatev monei wa sent out to them it wa said came all back to us by the balanc of trade and we could never becom a farth the poorer by ani expens which we could lai out upon them thei were our own in everi respect and it wa an expens laid out upon the improv of our own properti and for the profit employ of our own peopl it is unnecessari i apprehend at present to sai anyth further in order to expos the folli of a system which fatal experi ha now suffici expos had our american coloni realli been a part of great britain those bounti might have been consid as bounti upon product and would still have been liabl to all the object to which such bounti ar liabl but to no other the export of the materi of manufactur is sometim discourag by absolut prohibit and sometim by high duti our woollen manufactur have been more success than ani other class of workmen in persuad the legislatur that the prosper of the nation depend upon the success and extens of their particular busi thei have not onli obtain a monopoli against the consum by an absolut prohibit of import woollen cloth from ani foreign countri but thei have likewis obtain anoth monopoli against the sheep farmer and grower of wool by a similar prohibit of the export of live sheep and wool the sever of mani of the law which have been enact for the secur of the revenu is veri justli complain of as impos heavi penalti upon action which anteced to the statut that declar them to be crime had alwai been understood to be innoc but the cruellest of our revenu law i will ventur to affirm ar mild and gentl in comparison to some of those which the clamour of our merchant and manufactur ha extort from the legislatur for the support of their own absurd and oppress monopoli like the law of draco these law mai be said to be all written in blood by the th of elizabeth chap the export of sheep lamb or ram wa for the first offenc to forfeit all hi good for ever to suffer a year imprison and then to have hi left hand cut off in a market town upon a market dai to be there nail

ani other countri that the wool of other countri could not without some mixtur of it be wrought up into ani toler manufactur that fine cloth could not be made without it that england therefor if the export of it could be total prevent could monopol to herself almost the whole woollen trade of the world and thu have no rival could sell at what price she pleas and in a short time acquir the most

without spoil and degrad in some degre the fabric of the cloth it ha been shown in the forego part of thi work that the effect of these regul ha been to depress the price of english wool not onli below what it natur would be in the present time but veri much below what it actual wa in the time of edward iii the price of scotch wool when in consequ of the union it becam subject to the same regul is said to have fallen about on half it is observ by the veri accur and intellig author of the memoir of wool the reverend mr john smith that the price of the best english wool in england is gener below what wool of a veri inferior qualiti commonli sell for in the market of amsterdam to depress the price of thi commod below what mai be call it natur and proper price wa the avow purpos of those regul and there seem to be no doubt of their have produc the effect that wa expect from them thi reduct of price it mai perhap be thought by discourag the grow of wool must have reduc veri much the annual produc of that commod though not below what it formerli wa yet below what in the present state of thing it would probabl have been had it in consequ of an open and free market been allow to rise to the natur and proper price i am howev dispos to believ that the quantiti of the annual produc cannot have been much though it mai perhap have been a littl affect by these regul the grow of wool is not the chief purpos for which the sheep farmer emploi hi industri and stock he expect hi profit not so much from the price of the fleec as from that of the carcas and the averag or ordinari price of the latter must even in mani case make up to him whatev defici there mai be in the averag or ordinari price of the former it ha been observ in the forego part of thi work that whatev regul tend to sink the price either of wool or of raw hide below what it natur would be must in an improv and cultiv countri have some tendenc to rais the price of butcher meat the price both of the great and small cattl which ar fed on improv and cultiv land must be suffici to pai the rent which the landlord and the profit which the farmer ha reason to expect from improv and cultiv land if it is not thei will soon ceas to feed them whatev part of thi price therefor is not paid by the wool and the hide must be paid by the carcas the less there is paid for the on the more must be paid for the other in what manner thi price is to be divid upon the differ part of the beast is indiffer to the landlord and farmer provid it is all paid to them in an improv and cultiv countri therefor their interest as landlord and farmer cannot be much affect by such regul though their interest as consum mai by the rise in the price of provis accord to thi reason therefor thi degrad in the price of wool is not like in an improv and cultiv countri to occas ani diminut in the annual produc of that commod except so far as by rais the price of mutton it mai somewhat diminish the demand for and consequ the product of that particular speci of butcher meat it effect howev even in thi wai it is probabl is not veri consider but though it effect upon the quantiti of the annual produc mai not have been veri consider it effect upon the qualiti it mai perhap be thought must necessarili have been veri great the degrad in the qualiti of english wool if not below what it wa in former time yet below what it natur would have been in the present state of improv and cultiv must have been it mai perhap be suppos veri nearli in proport to the degrad of price as the qualiti depend upon the breed upon the pastur and upon the manag and cleanli of the sheep dure the whole progress of the growth of the fleec the attent to these circumst it mai natur enough be imagin can never be greater than in proport to the recomp which the price of the fleec is like to make for the labour and expens which that attent requir it happen howev that the good of the fleec depend in a great measur upon the health growth and bulk of the anim the same attent which is necessari for the improv of the carcas is in some respect suffici for that of the fleec notwithstand the degrad of price english wool is said to have been improv consider dure the cours even of the present centuri the improv might perhap have been greater if the price had been better but the low of price though it mai have obstruct yet certainli it ha not altogeth prevent that improv the violenc of these regul therefor seem to have affect neither the quantiti nor the qualiti of the annual produc of wool so much as it might have been expect to do though i think it probabl that it mai have affect the latter a good deal more than the former and the interest of the grower of wool though it must have been hurt in some degre seem upon the whole to have been much less hurt than could well have been imagin these consider howev will not justifi the absolut prohibit of the export of wool but thei will fulli justifi the imposit of a consider tax upon that export to hurt in ani degre the interest of ani on order of citizen for no other purpos but to promot that of some other is evid contrari to that justic and equal of treatment which the

differ order of citizen is bound to contribut to the support of the sovereign or commonwealth a tax of five or even of ten shill upon the export of everi tod of wool would produc a veri consider revenu to the sovereign it would hurt the interest of the grower somewhat less than the prohibit becaus it would not probabl lower the price of wool quit so much it would afford a suffici advantag to the manufactur becaus though he might not bui hi wool altogeth so cheap as under the prohibit he would still bui it at least five or ten shill cheaper than ani foreign manufactur could bui it besid

the whole expens laid out upon the employ and mainten both of the workmen and of their employ artific manufactur and merchant can augment the revenu and wealth of their societi by parsimoni onli or as

their own subsist their industri annual afford a neat produc of which the augment necessarili augment the revenu and wealth of their societi nation therefor which like franc or england consist in a great measur of proprietor and cultiv can be enrich by industri and enjoy nation on the contrari which like holland and hamburgh ar compos chiefli of merchant artific and manufactur can grow rich onli through parsimoni and privat as the interest of nation so differ circumstanc is veri differ so is likewis the common charact of the peopl in those of the former kind liber frank and good fellowship natur make a part of their common charact in the latter narrow mean and a selfish disposit avers to all social pleasur and enjoy the unproduct class that of merchant artific and manufactur is maintain

cattl which it consum while it is emploi about that work the proprietor and cultiv final pai both the wage of all the workmen of the unproduct class and the profit of all their employ those workmen and their employ ar properli the servant of the proprietor and cultiv thei ar onli servant who work without door as menial servant work within both the on and the other howev ar equal maintain at the expens of the same master the labour of both is equal unproduct it add noth to the valu of the sum total of the rude produc of the land instead of increas the valu of that sum total it is a charg and expens which must be paid out of it the unproduct class howev is not onli us but greatli us to the other two class by mean of the industri of merchant artific and manufactur the proprietor and cultiv can purchas both the foreign good and the manufactur produc of their own countri which thei have occas for with the produc of a much smaller quantiti of their own labour than what thei would be oblig to emploi if thei were to attempt in an awkward and unskil manner either to import the on or to make the other for their own us by mean of the unproduct class the cultiv ar deliv from mani care which would otherwis distract their attent from the cultiv of land the superior of produc which in consequ of thi undivid attent thei ar enabl to rais is fulli suffici to pai the whole expens which the mainten and employ of the unproduct class cost either the proprietor or themselv the industri of merchant artific and manufactur though in it own natur altogeth unproduct yet contribut in thi manner indirectli to increas the produc of the land it increas the product power of product labour by leav it at liberti to confin itself to it proper employ the cultiv of land and the plough goe frequent the easier and the better by mean of the labour of the man whose busi is most remot from the plough it can never be the interest of the proprietor and cultiv to restrain or to discourag in ani respect the industri of merchant artific and manufactur the greater the liberti which thi unproduct class enjoi the greater will be the competit in all the differ trade which compos it and the cheaper will the other two class be suppli both with foreign good and with the manufactur produc of their own countri it can never be the interest of the unproduct class to oppress the other two class it is the surplu produc of the land or what remain after deduct the mainten first of the cultiv and afterward of the proprietor that maintain and emploi the unproduct class the greater thi surplu the greater must likewis be the mainten and employ of that class the establish of perfect justic of perfect liberti and of perfect equal is the veri simpl secret which most effectu secur the highest degre of prosper to all the three class the merchant artific and manufactur of those mercantil state which like holland and hamburgh consist chiefli of thi unproduct class ar in the same manner maintain and emploi altogeth at the expens of the proprietor and cultiv of land the onli differ is that those proprietor and cultiv ar the greater part of them place at a most inconveni distanc from the merchant artific and manufactur whom thei suppli with the materi of their work and the fund of their subsist ar the inhabit of other countri and the subject of other govern such mercantil state howev ar not onli us but greatli us to the inhabit of those other countri thei fill up in some measur a veri import void and suppli the place of the merchant artific and manufactur whom the inhabit of those countri ought to find at home but whom from some defect in their polici thei do not find at home it can never be the interest of those land nation if i mai call them so to discourag or distress the industri of such mercantil state by impos high duti upon their trade or upon the commod which thei furnish such duti by render those commod dearer could serv onli to sink the real valu of the surplu produc of their own land with which or what come to the same thing with the price of which those commod ar purchas such duti could onli serv to discourag the increas of that surplu produc and consequ the improv and cultiv of their own land the most effectu expedi on the contrari for rais the valu of that surplu produc for encourag it increas and consequ the improv and cultiv of their own land would be to allow the most perfect freedom to the trade of all such mercantil nation thi perfect freedom of trade would even be the most effectu expedi for suppli them in due time with all the artific manufactur and merchant whom thei want at home and for fill up in the properest and most advantag manner that veri import void which thei felt there the continu increas of the surplu produc of their land would in due time creat a greater capit than what would be emploi with the ordinari rate of profit in the improv and cultiv of land and the surplu part of it would natur turn itself to the employ of artific and manufactur at home but these artific and manufactur find at home both the materi of their work and the fund of their subsist might immedi even with much less art and skill be abl to work as cheap as the littl artific and manufactur of such mercantil state who had both to bring from a greater distanc even though from want of art and skill thei might not for some time be abl to work as cheap yet find a market at home thei might be abl to sell their work there as cheap as that of the artific and manufactur of such mercantil state which could not be brought to that market but from so great a distanc and as their art and skill improv thei would soon be abl to sell it cheaper the artific and manufactur of such mercantil state therefor would immedi be rival in the market of those land nation and soon after undersold and justl out of it altogeth the cheap of the manufactur of those land nation in consequ of the gradual improv of art and skill would in due time extend their sale beyond the home market and carri them to mani foreign market from which thei would in the same manner gradual justl out mani of the manufactur of such mercantil nation thi continu increas both of the rude and manufactur produc of those land nation would in due time creat a greater capit than could with the ordinari rate of profit be emploi either in agricultur or in manufactur the surplu of thi capit would natur turn itself to foreign trade and be emploi in export to foreign countri such part of the rude and manufactur produc of it own countri as exceed the demand of the home market in the export of the produc of their own countri the merchant of a land nation would have an advantag of the same kind over those of mercantil nation which it artific and manufactur had over the artific and manufactur of such nation the advantag of find at home that cargo and those store and provis which the other were oblig to seek for at a distanc with inferior art and skill in navig therefor thei would be abl to sell that cargo as cheap in foreign market as the merchant of such mercantil nation and with equal art and skill thei would be abl to sell it cheaper thei would soon therefor rival those mercantil nation in thi branch of foreign trade and in due time would justl them out of it altogeth accord to thi liber and gener system therefor the most advantag method in which a land nation can rais up artific manufactur and merchant of it own is to grant the most perfect freedom of trade to the artific manufactur and merchant of all other nation it therebi rais the valu of the surplu produc of it own land of which the continu increas gradual establish a fund which in due time necessarili rais up all the artific manufactur and merchant whom it ha occas for when a land nation on the contrari oppress either by high duti or by prohibit the trade of foreign nation it necessarili hurt it own interest in two differ wai first by rais the price of all foreign good and of all sort of manufactur it necessarili sink the real valu of the surplu produc of it own land with which or what come to the same thing with the price of which it purchas those foreign good and manufactur secondli by give a sort of monopoli of the home market to it own merchant artific and manufactur it rais the rate of mercantil and manufactur profit in proport to that of agricultur profit and consequ either draw from agricultur a part of the capit which had befor been emploi in it or hinder from go to it a part of what would otherwis have gone to it thi polici therefor discourag agricultur in two differ wai first by sink the real valu of it produc and therebi lower the rate of it profit and secondli by rais the rate of profit in all other employ agricultur is render less advantag and trade and manufactur more advantag than thei otherwis would be and everi man is tempt by hi own interest to turn as much as he can both hi capit and hi industri from the former to the latter employ though by thi oppress polici a land nation should be abl to rais up artific manufactur and merchant of it own somewhat sooner than it could do by the freedom of trade a matter howev which is not a littl doubt yet it would rais them up if on mai sai so prematur and befor it wa perfectli ripe for them by rais up too hastili on speci of industri it would depress anoth more valuabl speci of industri by rais up too hastili a speci of industri which duli replac the stock which emploi it togeth with the ordinari profit it would depress a speci of industri which over and abov replac that stock with it profit afford likewis a neat produc a free rent to the landlord it would depress product labour by encourag too hastili that labour which is altogeth barren and unproduct in what manner accord to thi system the sum total of the annual produc of the land is distribut among the three class abov mention and in what manner the labour of the unproduct class doe no more than replac the valu of it own consumpt without increas in ani respect the valu of that sum total is repres by mr quesnai the veri ingeni and profound author of thi system in some arithmet formulari the first of these formulari which by wai of emin he peculiarli distinguish by the name of the econom tabl repres the manner in which he suppos thi distribut take place in a state of the most perfect liberti and therefor of the highest prosper in a state where the annual produc is such as to afford the greatest possibl neat produc and where each class enjoi it proper share of the whole annual produc some subsequ formulari repres the manner in which he suppos thi distribut is made in differ state of restraint and regul in which either the class of proprietor or the barren and unproduct class is more favour than the class of cultiv and in which either the on or the other encroach more or less upon the share which ought properli to belong to thi product class everi such encroach everi violat of that natur distribut which the most perfect liberti would establish must accord to thi system necessarili degrad more or less from on year to anoth the valu and sum total of the annual produc and must necessarili occas a gradual declens in the real wealth and revenu of the societi a declens of which the progress must be quicker or slower accord to the degre of thi encroach accord as that natur distribut which the most perfect liberti would establish is more or less violat those subsequ formulari repres the differ degre of declens which accord to thi system correspond to the differ degre in which thi natur distribut of thing is violat some specul physician seem to have imagin that the health of the human bodi could be preserv onli by a certain precis regimen of diet and exercis of which everi the smallest violat necessarili occas some degre of diseas or disord proportion to the degre of the violat experi howev would seem to shew that the human bodi frequent preserv to all appear at least the most perfect state of health under a vast varieti of differ regimen even under some which ar gener believ to be veri far from be perfectli wholesom but the health state of the human bodi it would seem contain in itself some unknown principl of preserv capabl either of prevent or of correct in mani respect the bad effect even of a veri faulti regimen mr quesnai who wa himself a physician and a veri specul physician seem to have entertain a notion of the same kind concern the polit bodi and to have imagin that it would thrive and prosper onli under a certain precis regimen the exact regimen of perfect liberti and perfect justic he seem not to have consid that in the polit bodi the natur effort which everi man is continu make to better hi own condit is a principl of preserv capabl of prevent and correct in mani respect the bad effect of a polit economi in some degre both partial and oppress such a polit economi though it no doubt retard more or less is not alwai capabl of stop altogeth the natur progress of a nation toward wealth and prosper and still less of make it go backward if a nation could not prosper without the enjoy of perfect liberti and perfect justic there is not in the world a nation which could ever have prosper in the polit bodi howev the wisdom of natur ha fortun made ampl provis for remedi mani of the bad effect of the folli and injustic of man it the same manner as it ha done in the natur bodi for remedi those of hi sloth and intemper the capit error of thi system howev seem to lie in it repres the class of artific manufactur and merchant as altogeth barren and unproduct the follow observ mai serv to shew the improprieti of thi represent first thi class it is acknowledg reproduc annual the valu of it own annual consmnption and continu at least the exist of the stock or capit which maintain and emploi it but upon thi account alon the denomin of barren or unproduct should seem to be veri improperli appli to it we should not call a marriag barren or unproduct though it produc onli a son and a daughter to replac the father and mother and though it did not increas the number of the human speci but onli continu it as it wa befor farmer and countri labour inde over and abov the stock which maintain and emploi them reproduc annual a neat produc a free rent to the landlord as a marriag which afford three children is certainli more product than on which afford onli two so the labour of farmer and countri labour is certainli more product than that of merchant artific and manufactur the superior produc of the on class howev doe not render the other barren or unproduct secondli it seem on thi account altogeth improp to consid artific manufactur and merchant in the same light as menial servant the labour of menial servant doe not continu the exist of the fund which maintain and emploi them their mainten and employ is altogeth at the expens of their master and the work which thei perform is not of a natur to repai that expens that work consist in servic which perish gener in the veri instant of their perform and doe not fix or realiz itself in ani vendibl commod which can replac the valu of their wage and mainten the labour on the contrari of artific manufactur and merchant natur doe fix and realiz itself in some such vendibl commod it is upon thi account that in the chapter in which i treat of product and unproduct labour i have class artific manufactur and merchant among the product labour and menial servant among the barren or unproduct thirdli it seem upon everi supposit improp to sai that the labour of artific manufactur and merchant doe not increas the real revenu of the societi though we should suppos for exampl as it seem to be suppos in thi system that the valu of the daili monthli and yearli consumpt of thi class wa exactli equal to that of it daili monthli and yearli product yet it would not from thenc follow that it labour ad noth to the real revenu to the real valu of the annual produc of the land and labour of the societi an artific for exampl who in the first six month after harvest execut ten pound worth of work though he should in the same time consum ten pound worth of corn and other necessari yet realli add the valu of ten pound to the annual produc of the land and labour of the societi while he ha been consum a halfyearli revenu of ten pound worth of corn and other necessari he ha produc an equal valu of work capabl of purchas either to himself or to some other person an equal halfyearli revenu the valu therefor of what ha been consum and produc dure these six month is equal not to ten but to twenti pound it is possibl inde that no more than ten pound worth of thi valu mai ever have exist at ani on moment of time but if the ten pound worth of corn and other necessari which were consum by the artific had been consum by a soldier or by a menial servant the valu of that part of the annual produc which exist at the end of the six month would have been ten pound less than it actual is in consequ of the labour of the artific though the valu of what the artific produc therefor should not at ani on moment of time be suppos greater than the valu he consum yet at everi moment of time the actual exist valu of good in the market is in consequ of what he produc greater than it otherwis would be when the patron of thi system assert that the consumpt of artific manufactur and merchant is equal to the valu of what thei produc thei probabl mean no more than that their revenu or the fund destin for their consumpt is equal to it but if thei had express themselv more accur and onli assert that the revenu of thi class wa equal to the valu of what thei produc it might readili have occur to the reader that what would natur be save out of thi revenu must necessarili increas more or less the real wealth of the societi in order therefor to make out someth like an argument it wa necessari that thei should express themselv as thei have done and thi argument even suppos thing actual were as it seem to presum them to be turn out to be a veri inconclus on fourthli farmer and countri labour can no more augment without parsimoni the real revenu the annual produc of the land and labour of their societi than artific manufactur and merchant the annual produc of the land and labour of ani societi can be augment onli in two wai either first by some improv in the product power of the us labour actual maintain within it or secondli by some increas in the quantiti of that labour the improv in the product power of us labour depend first upon the improv in the abil of the workman and secondli upon that of the machineri with which he work but the labour of artific and manufactur as it is capabl of be more subdivid and the labour of each workman reduc to a greater simplic of oper than that of farmer and countri labour so it is likewis capabl of both these sort of improv in a much higher degre see book i chap in thi respect therefor the class of cultiv can have no sort of advantag over that of artific and manufactur the increas in the quantiti of us labour actual emploi within ani societi must depend altogeth upon the increas of the capit which emploi it and the increas of that capit again must be exactli equal to the amount of the save from the revenu either of the particular person who manag and direct the employ of that capit or of some other person who lend it to them if merchant artific and manufactur ar as thi system seem to suppos natur more inclin to parsimoni and save than proprietor and cultiv thei ar so far more like to augment the quantiti of us labour emploi within their societi and consequ to increas it real revenu the annual produc of it land and labour fifthli and lastli though the revenu of the inhabit of everi countri wa suppos to consist altogeth as thi system seem to suppos in the quantiti of subsist which their industri could procur to them yet even upon thi supposit the revenu of a trade and manufactur countri must other thing be equal alwai be much greater than that of on without trade or manufactur by mean of trade and manufactur a greater quantiti of subsist can be annual import into a particular countri than what it own land in the actual state of their cultiv could afford the inhabit of a town though thei frequent possess no land of their own yet draw to themselv by their industri such a quantiti of the rude produc of the land of other peopl as suppli them not onli with the materi of their work but with the fund of their subsist what a town alwai is with regard to the countri in it neighbourhood on independ state or countri mai frequent be with regard to other independ state or countri it is thu that holland draw a great part of it subsist from other countri live cattl from holstein and jutland and corn from almost all the differ countri of europ a small quantiti of manufactur produc purchas a great quantiti of rude produc a trade and manufactur countri therefor natur purchas with a small part of it manufactur produc a great part of the rude produc of other countri while on the contrari a countri without trade and manufactur is gener oblig to purchas at the expens of a great part of it rude produc a veri small part of the manufactur produc of other countri the on export what can subsist and accommod but a veri few and import the subsist and accommod of a great number the other export the accommod and subsist of a great number and import that of a veri few onli the inhabit of the on must alwai enjoi a much greater quantiti of subsist than what their own land in the actual state of their cultiv could afford the inhabit of the other must alwai enjoi a much smaller quantiti thi system howev with all it imperfect is perhap the nearest approxim to the truth that ha yet been publish upon the subject of polit economi and is upon that account well worth the consider of everi man who wish to examin with attent the principl of that veri import scienc though in repres the labour which is emploi upon land as the onli product labour the notion which it inculc ar perhap too narrow and confin yet in repres the wealth of nation as consist not in the unconsum rich of monei but in the consum good annual reproduc by the labour of the societi and in repres perfect liberti as the onli effectu expedi for render thi annual reproduct the greatest possibl it doctrin seem to be in everi respect as just as it is gener and liber it follow ar veri numer and as men ar fond of paradox and of appear to understand what surpass the comprehens

foreign trade the industri of the town than to agricultur the industri of the countri so that of other nation ha follow a differ plan and ha been more favour to agricultur than to manufactur and foreign trade the polici of china favour agricultur more than all other employ in china the condit of a labour is said to be as much superior to that of an artific as in most part of europ that of an

thei gener requir the support of foreign trade without an extens foreign market thei could not well flourish either in countri so moder extens as to afford but a narrow home market or in countri where the commun between on provinc and anoth wa so difficult as to render it imposs for the good of ani particular place to enjoi the whole of that home market which the countri could afford the perfect of manufactur industri it must be rememb depend altogeth upon the divis of labour and the degre to which the divis of labour can be introduc into ani manufactur is necessarili regul it ha alreadi been

equal great both countri accordingli though subject occasion to dearth have been famou for their great fertil though both were extrem popul yet in year of moder plenti thei were both abl to export great quantiti of grain to their neighbour the ancient egyptian had a superstiti avers to the sea and as the gentoo religion doe not permit it follow to light a fire nor consequ to dress ani victual upon the water it in effect prohibit them from all distant sea voyag both the egyptian and indian must have depend almost altogeth upon the navig of other nation for the export of their surplu produc and thi depend as it must have confin the market so it must have discourag the increas of thi surplu produc it must have discourag too the increas of the manufactur produc more than that of the rude produc manufactur requir a much more extens market than the most import part of the rude produc of the land a singl shoemak will make more than pair of shoe in the year and hi own famili will not perhap wear out six pair unless therefor he ha the custom of at least such famili as hi own he cannot dispos of the whole product of hi own labour the most numer class of artific will seldom in a larg countri make more than on in or on in a of the whole number of famili contain in it but in such larg countri as franc and england the number of peopl emploi in agricultur ha by some author been comput at a half by other at a third and by no author that i know of at less that a fifth of the whole inhabit of the countri but as the produc of the agricultur of both franc and england is the far greater part of it consum at home each person emploi in it must accord to these comput requir littl more than the custom of on two or at most of four such famili as hi own in order to dispos of the whole produc of hi own labour agricultur therefor can support itself under the discourag of a confin market much better than manufactur in both ancient egypt and indostan inde the confin of the foreign market wa in some measur compens by the conveni of mani inland navig which open in the most advantag manner the whole extent of the home market to everi part of the produc of everi differ district of those countri the great extent of indostan too render the home market of that countri veri great and suffici to support a great varieti of manufactur but the small extent of ancient egypt which wa never equal to england must at all time have render the home market of that countri too narrow for support ani great varieti of manufactur bengal accordingli the provinc of indostan which commonli export the greatest quantiti of rice ha alwai been more remark for the export of a great varieti of manufactur than for that of it grain ancient egypt on the contrari though it export some manufactur fine linen in particular as well as some other good wa alwai most distinguish for it great export of grain it wa long the granari of the roman empir the sovereign of china of ancient egypt and of the

to form in it and as therebi disqualifi it more or less for undergo the fatigu and encount the danger of war such occup were consid as fit onli for slave and the free citizen of the state were prohibit from exercis them even in those state where no such prohibit took place as in rome and athen the great bodi of the peopl were in effect exclud from all the trade which ar now commonli exercis by the lower sort of the inhabit of town such trade were at athen and rome all occupi by the slave of the rich who exercis them for the benefit of their master whose wealth power and protect made it almost imposs for a poor freeman to find a market for hi work when it came into competit with that of the slave of the rich slave howev ar veri seldom invent and all the most import improv either in machineri or in the arrang and distribut of work which facilit and abridg labour have been the discoveri of freemen should a slave propos ani improv of thi kind hi master would be veri apt to consid the propos as the suggest of lazi and of a desir to save hi own labour at the master expens the poor slave instead of reward would probabl meet with much abus perhap with some punish in the manufactur carri on by slave therefor more labour must gener have been emploi to execut the same quantiti of work than in those carri on by freemen the work of the farmer must upon that account gener have been dearer than that of the latter the hungarian mine it is remark by mr montesquieu though not richer have alwai been wrought with less expens and therefor with more profit than the turkish mine in their neighbourhood the turkish mine ar wrought by slave and the arm of those slave ar the onli machin which the turk have ever thought of emploi the hungarian mine ar wrought by freemen who emploi a great deal of machineri by which thei facilit and abridg their own labour from the veri littl that is known about the price of manufactur in the time of the greek and roman it would appear that those of the finer sort were excess dear silk sold for it weight in gold it wa not inde in those time an european manufactur and as it wa all brought from the east indi the distanc of the carriag mai in some measur account for the great of the price the price howev which a ladi it is said would sometim pai for a piec of veri fine linen seem to have been equal extravag and as linen wa alwai either an european or at farthest an egyptian manufactur thi high price can be account for onli by the great expens of the labour which must have been emploi about it and the expens of thi labour again could aris from noth but the awkward of the machineri which is made us of the price of fine woollen too though not quit so extravag seem howev to have been much abov that of the present time some cloth we

rememb contain onli twelv of our avoirdupoi ounc thi high price inde seem to have been princip ow to the dye but had not the cloth themselv been much dearer than ani which ar made in the present time so veri expens a dye would not probabl have been bestow upon them the disproport would have been too great between the valu of the accessori and that of the princip the price mention by the same author plin viiic of some triclinaria a sort of woollen pillow or cushion made us of to lean upon as thei reclin upon their couch at tabl pass all credibl some of them be said to have cost more than other more than thi high price too is not said to have arisen from the dye in the dress of the peopl of fashion of both sex there seem to have been much less varieti it is observ by dr arbuthnot in ancient than in modern time and the veri littl varieti which we find in that of the ancient statu confirm hi observ he infer from thi that their dress must upon the whole have been cheaper than our but the conclus doe not seem to follow when the expens of fashion dress is veri great the varieti must be veri small but when by the improv in the product power of manufactur art and industri the expens of ani on dress come to be veri moder the varieti will natur be veri great the rich not be abl to distinguish themselv by the expens of ani on dress will natur endeavour to do so by the multitud and varieti of their dress the greatest and most import branch of the commerc of everi nation it ha alreadi been observ is that which is carri on between the inhabit of the town and those of the countri the inhabit of the town draw from the countri the rude produc which constitut both the materi of their work and the fund of their subsist and thei pai for thi rude produc by send back to the countri a certain portion of it manufactur and prepar for immedi us the trade which is carri on between these two differ set of peopl consist ultim in a certain quantiti of rude produc exchang for a certain quantiti of manufactur produc the dearer the latter therefor the cheaper the former and whatev tend in ani countri to rais the price of manufactur produc tend to lower that of the rude produc of the land and therebi to discourag agricultur the smaller the quantiti of manufactur produc which ani given quantiti of rude produc or what come to the same thing which the price of ani given

contrari to the veri end which thei propos and indirectli discourag that veri speci of industri which thei mean to promot thei ar so far perhap more inconsist than even the mercantil system that

never been unit but onc under mahomet and hi immedi successor their union which wa more the effect of religi enthusiasm than of conquest wa signal in the same manner if the hunt nation of america should ever becom shepherd their neighbourhood would be much more danger to the european coloni than it is at present in a yet more advanc state of societi among those nation of husbandmen who have littl foreign commerc and no other manufactur but those coars and household on which almost everi privat famili prepar for it own us everi man in the same manner either is a warrior or easili becom such those who live by agricultur gener pass the whole dai in the open air expos to all the inclem of the season the hardi of their ordinari life prepar them for the fatigu of war to some of which their necessari occup bear a great analog the necessari occup of a ditcher prepar him to work in the trench and to fortifi a camp as well as to inclos a field the ordinari pastim of such husbandmen ar the same as those of shepherd and ar in the same manner the imag of war but as husbandmen have less leisur than shepherd thei ar not so frequent emploi in those pastim thei ar soldier but soldier not quit so much master of their exercis such as thei ar howev it seldom cost the sovereign or commonwealth ani expens to prepar them for the field agricultur even in it rudest and lowest state suppos a settlement some sort of fix habit which cannot be abandon without great loss when a nation of mere husbandmen therefor goe to war the whole peopl cannot take the field togeth the old men the women and children at least must remain at home to take care of the habit all the men of the militari ag howev mai take the field and in small nation of thi kind have frequent done so in everi nation the men of the militari ag ar suppos to amount to about a fourth or a fifth part of the whole bodi of the peopl if the campaign too should begin after seedtim and end befor harvest both the husbandman and hi princip labour can be spare from the farm without much loss he trust that the work which must be done in the mean time can be well enough execut by the old men the women and the children he is not unwil therefor to serv without pai dure a short campaign and it frequent cost the sovereign or commonwealth as littl to maintain him in the field as to prepar him for it the citizen of all the differ state of ancient greec seem to have serv in thi manner till after the second persian war and the peopl of peloponnesu till after the peloponnesian war the peloponnesian thucydid observ gener left the field in the summer and return home to reap the harvest the roman peopl under their king and dure the first ag of the republ serv in the same manner it wa not till the seig of veii that thei who staid at home began to contribut someth toward maintain those who went to war in the european monarchi which were found upon the ruin of the roman empir both befor and for some time after the establish of what is properli call the feudal law the great lord with all their immedi depend us to serv the crown at their own expens in the field in the same manner as at home thei maintain themselv by their own revenu and not by ani stipend or pai which thei receiv from the king upon that particular occas in a more advanc state of societi two differ caus contribut to render it altogeth imposs that thei who take the field should maintain themselv at their own expens those two caus ar the progress of manufactur and the improv in the art of war though a husbandman should be emploi in an expedit provid it begin after seedtim and end befor harvest the interrupt of hi busi will not alwai occas ani consider diminut of hi revenu without the intervent of hi labour natur doe herself the greater part of the work which remain to be done but the moment that an artific a smith a carpent or a weaver for exampl quit hi workhous the sole sourc of hi revenu is complet dri up natur doe noth for him he doe all for himself when he take the field therefor in defenc of the public as he ha no revenu to maintain himself he must necessarili be maintain by the public but in a countri of which a great part of the inhabit ar artific and manufactur a great part of the peopl who go to war must be drawn from those class and must therefor be maintain by the public as long as thei ar emploi in it servic when the art of war too ha gradual grown up to be a veri intric and complic scienc when the event of war ceas to be determin as in the first ag of societi by a singl irregular skirmish or battl but when the contest is gener spun out through sever differ campaign each of which last dure the greater part of the year it becom univers necessari that the public should maintain those who serv the public in war at least while thei ar emploi in that servic whatev in time of peac might be the ordinari occup of those who go to war so veri tediou and expens a servic would otherwis be by far too heavi a burden upon them after the second persian war accordingli the armi of athen seem to have been gener compos of mercenari troop consist inde partli of citizen but partli too of foreign and all of them equal hire and paid at the expens of the state from the time of the sieg of veii the armi of rome receiv pai for their servic dure the time which thei remain in the field under the feudal govern the militari servic both of the great lord and of their immedi depend wa after a certain period univers exchang for a payment in monei which wa emploi to maintain those who serv in their stead the number of those who can go to war in proport to the whole number of the peopl is necessarili much smaller in a civil than in a rude state of societi in a civil societi as the soldier ar maintain altogeth by the labour of those who ar not soldier the number of the former can never exce what the latter can maintain over and abov maintain in a manner suitabl to their respect station both themselv and the other offic of govern and law whom thei ar oblig to maintain in the littl agrarian state of ancient greec a fourth or a fifth part of the whole bodi of the peopl consid the themselv as soldier and would sometim it is said take the field among the civil nation of modern europ it is commonli comput that not more than the on hundredth part of the inhabit of ani countri can be emploi as soldier without ruin to the countri which pai the expens of their servic the expens of prepar the armi for the field seem not to have becom consider in ani nation till long after that of maintain it in the field had devolv entir upon the sovereign or commonwealth in all the differ republ of ancient greec to learn hi militari exercis wa a necessari part of educ impos by the state upon everi free citizen in everi citi there seem to have been a public field in which under the protect of the public magistr the young peopl were taught their differ exercis by differ master in thi veri simpl institut consist the whole expens which ani grecian state seem ever to have been at in prepar it citizen for war in ancient rome the exercis of the campu martiu answer the same purpos with those of the gymnasium in ancient greec under the feudal govern the mani public ordin that the citizen of everi district should practis archeri as well as sever other militari exercis were intend for promot the same purpos but do not seem to have promot it so well either from want of interest in the offic entrust with the execut of those ordin or from some other caus thei appear to have been univers neglect and in the progress of all those govern militari exercis seem to have gone gradual into disus among the great bodi of the peopl in the republ of ancient greec and rome dure the whole period of their exist and under the feudal govern for a consider time after their first establish the trade of a soldier wa not a separ distinct trade which constitut the sole or princip occup of a particular class of citizen everi subject of the state whatev might be the ordinari trade or occup by which he gain hi livelihood consid himself upon all ordinari occas as fit likewis to exercis the trade of a soldier and upon mani extraordinari occas as bound to exercis it the art of war howev as it is certainli the noblest of all art so in the progress of improv it necessarili becom on of the most complic among them the state of the mechan as well as some other art with which it is necessarili connect determin the degre of perfect to which it is capabl of be carri at ani particular time but in order to carri it to thi degre of perfect it is necessari that it should becom the sole or princip occup of a particular class of citizen and the divis of labour is as necessari for the improv of thi as of everi other art into other art the divis of labour is natur introduc by the prudenc of individu who find that thei promot their privat interest better by confin themselv to a particular trade than by exercis a great number but it is the wisdom of the state onli which can render the trade of a soldier a particular trade separ and distinct from all other a privat citizen who in time of profound peac and without ani particular encourag from the public should spend the greater part of hi time in militari exercis might no doubt both improv himself veri much in them and amus himself veri well but he certainli would not promot hi own interest it is the wisdom of the state onli which can render it for hi interest to give up the greater part of hi time to thi peculiar occup and state have not alwai had thi wisdom even when their circumst had becom such that the preserv of their exist requir that thei should have it a shepherd ha a great deal of leisur a husbandman in the rude state of husbandri ha some an artific or manufactur ha none at all the first mai without ani loss emploi a great deal of hi time in martial exercis the second mai emploi some part of it but the last cannot emploi a singl hour in them without some loss and hi attent to hi own interest natur lead him to neglect them altogeth those improv in husbandri too which the progress of art and manufactur necessarili introduc leav the husbandman as littl leisur as the artific militari exercis come to be as much neglect by the inhabit of the countri as by those of the town and the great bodi of the peopl becom altogeth unwarlik that wealth at the same time which alwai follow the improv of agricultur and manufactur and which in realiti is no more than the accumul produc of those improv provok the invas of all their neighbour an industri and upon that account a wealthi nation is of all nation the most like to be attack and unless the state take some new measur for the public defenc the natur habit of the peopl render them altogeth incap of defend themselv in these circumst there seem to be but two method by which the state can make ani toler provis for the public defenc it mai either first by mean of a veri rigor polic and in spite of the whole bent of the interest geniu and inclin of the peopl enforc the practic of militari exercis and oblig either all the citizen of the militari ag or a certain number of them to join in some measur the trade of a soldier to whatev other trade or profess thei mai happen to carri on or secondli by maintain and emploi a certain number of citizen in the constant practic of militari exercis it mai render the trade of a soldier a particular trade separ and distinct from all other if the state ha recours to the first of those two expedi it militari forc is said to consist in a militia if to the second it is said to consist in a stand armi the practic of militari exercis is the sole or princip occup of the soldier of a stand armi and the mainten or pai which the state afford them is the princip and ordinari fund of their subsist the practic of militari exercis is onli the occasion occup of the soldier of a militia and thei deriv the princip and ordinari fund of their subsist from some other occup in a militia the charact of the labour artific or tradesman predomin over that of the soldier in a stand armi that of the soldier predomin over everi other charact and in thi distinct seem to consist the essenti differ between those two differ speci of militari forc militia have been of sever differ kind in some countri the citizen destin for defend the state seem to have been exercis onli without be if i mai sai so regiment that is without be divid into separ and distinct bodi of troop each of which perform it exercis under it own proper and perman offic in the republ of ancient greec and rome each citizen as long as he remain at home seem to have practis hi exercis either separ and independ or with such of hi equal as he like best and not to have been attach to ani particular bodi of troop till he wa actual call upon to take the field in other countri the militia ha not onli been exercis but regiment in england in switzerland and i believ in everi other countri of modern europ where ani imperfect militari forc of thi kind ha been establish everi militiaman is even in time of peac attach to a particular bodi of troop which perform it exercis under it own proper and perman offic befor the invent of firearm that armi wa superior in which the soldier had each individu the greatest skill and dexter in the us of their arm strength and agil of bodi were of the highest consequ and commonli determin the fate of battl but thi skill and dexter in the us of their arm could be acquir onli in the same manner as fenc is at present by practis not in great bodi but each man separ in a particular school under a particular master or with hi own particular equal and companion sinc the invent of firearm strength and agil of bodi or even extraordinari dexter and skill in the us of arm though thei ar far from be of no consequ ar howev of less consequ the natur of the weapon though it by no mean put the awkward upon a level with the skil put him more nearli so than he ever wa befor all the dexter and skill it is suppos which ar necessari for us it can be well enough acquir by practis in great bodi regular order and prompt obedi to command ar qualiti which in modern armi ar of more import toward determin the fate of battl than the dexter and skill of the soldier in the us of their arm but the nois of firearm the smoke and the invis death to which everi man feel himself everi moment expos as soon as he come within cannonshot and frequent a long time befor the battl can be well said to be engag must render it veri difficult to maintain ani consider degre of thi regular order and prompt obedi even in the begin of a modern battl in an ancient battl there wa no nois but what aros from the human voic there wa no smoke there wa no invis caus of wound or death everi man till some mortal weapon actual did approach him saw clearli that no such weapon wa near him in these circumst and among troop who had some confid in their own skill and dexter in the us of their arm it must have been a good deal less difficult to preserv some degre of regular and order not onli in the begin but through the whole progress of an ancient battl and till on of the two armi wa fairli defeat but the habit of regular order and prompt obedi to command can be acquir onli by troop which ar exercis in great bodi a militia howev in whatev manner it mai be either disciplin or exercis must alwai be much inferior to a well disciplin and well exercis stand armi the soldier who ar exercis onli onc a week or onc amonth can never be so expert in the us of their arm as those who ar exercis everi dai or everi other dai and though thi circumst mai not be of so much consequ in modern as it wa in ancient time yet the acknowledg superior of the prussian troop ow it is said veri much to their superior expert in their exercis mai satisfi us that it is even at thi dai of veri consider consequ the soldier who ar bound to obei their offic onli onc aweek or onc amonth and who ar at all other time at liberti to manag their own affair their own wai without be in ani respect account to him can never be under the same aw in hi presenc can never have the same disposit to readi obedi with those whose whole life and conduct ar everi dai direct by him and who everi dai even rise and go to bed or at least retir to their quarter accord to hi order in what is call disciplin or in the habit of readi obedi a militia must alwai be still more inferior to a stand armi than it mai sometim be in what is call the manual exercis or in the manag and us of it arm but in modern war the habit of readi and instant obedi is of much greater consequ than a consider superior in the manag of arm those militia which like the tartar or arab militia go to war under the same chieftain whom thei ar accustom to obei in peac ar by far the best in respect for their offic in the habit of readi obedi thei approach nearest to stand armi the highland militia when it serv under it own chieftain had some advantag of the same kind as the highland howev were not wander but stationari shepherd as thei had all a fix habit and were not in peaceabl time accustom to follow their chieftain from place to place so in time of war thei were less will to follow him to ani consider distanc or to continu for ani long time in the field when thei had acquir ani booti thei were eager to return home and hi author wa seldom suffici to detain them in point of obedi thei were alwai much inferior to what is report of the tartar and arab as the highland too from their stationari life spend less of their time in the open air thei were alwai less accustom to militari exercis and were less expert in the us of their arm than the tartar and arab ar said to be a militia of ani kind it must be observ howev which ha serv for sever success campaign in the field becom in everi respect a stand armi the soldier ar everi dai exercis in the us of their arm and be constantli under the command of their offic ar habitu to the same prompt obedi which take place in stand armi what thei were befor thei took the field is of littl import thei necessarili becom in everi respect a stand armi after thei have pass a few campaign in it should the war in america drag out through anoth campaign the american militia mai becom in everi respect a

provid hi ag is not so far advanc as to give suspicion of dotag is everywher more respect than a young man of equal rank fortun and abil among nation of hunter such as the nativ tribe of north america

circumst is the superior of fortun the author of rich howev though great in everi ag of societi is perhap greatest in the rudest ag of societi which admit of ani consider inequ of fortun a tartar chief the increas of whose flock and herd is suffici to maintain a thousand men cannot well emploi that increas in ani other wai than in maintain a thousand men the rude state of hi societi doe not

great measur found upon the contempt which men natur have for the former and upon their vener for the latter as a militari offic submit without reluct to the author of a superior by whom he ha alwai

over some particular territori or district origin both the sovereign and the inferior chief us to exercis thi jurisdict in their own person afterward thei univers found it conveni to deleg it to some substitut bailiff or judg thi substitut howev wa still oblig to account to hi princip or constitu for the profit of the jurisdict whoever read the instruct thei ar to be found in tyrol histori of england which were given to the judg of the circuit in the time of henri ii will see clearli that those judg were a sort of itiner factor sent round the countri for the purpos of levi certain branch of the king revenu in those dai the administr of justic not onli afford a certain revenu to the sovereign but to procur thi revenu seem to have been on of the princip advantag which he propos to obtain by the administr of justic thi scheme of make the administr of justic subservi to the purpos of revenu could scarc fail to be product of sever veri gross abus the person who appli for justic with a larg present in hi hand wa like to get someth more than justic while he who appli for it with a small on wa like to get someth less justic too might frequent be delai in order that thi present might be repeat the amerc besid of the person complain of might frequent suggest a veri strong reason for find him in the wrong even when he had not realli been so that such abus were far from be uncommon the ancient histori of everi countri in europ bear wit when the sovereign or chief exercis hi judici author in hi own person how much soever he might abus it it must have been scarc possibl to get ani redress becaus there could seldom be ani bodi power enough to call him to account when he exercis it by a bailiff inde redress might sometim be had if it wa for hi own benefit onli that the bailiff had been guilti of an act of injustic the sovereign himself might not alwai be unwil to punish him or to oblig him to repair the wrong but if it wa for the benefit of hi sovereign if it wa in order to make court to the person who appoint him and who might prefer him that he had commit ani act of oppress redress would upon most occas be as imposs as if the sovereign had commit it himself in all barbar govern accordingli in all those ancient govern of europ in particular which were found upon the ruin of the roman empir the administr of justic appear for a long time to have been extrem corrupt far from be quit equal and imparti even under the best monarch and altogeth proflig under the worst among nation of shepherd where the sovereign or chief is onli the greatest shepherd or herdsman of the hord or clan he is maintain in the same manner as ani of hi vassal or subject by the increas of hi own herd or flock among those nation of husbandmen who ar but just come out of the shepherd state and who ar not much advanc beyond that state such as the greek tribe appear to have been about the time of the trojan war and our german and scythian ancestor when thei first settl upon the ruin of the western empir the sovereign or chief is in the same manner onli the greatest landlord of the countri and is maintain in the same manner as ani other landlord by a revenu deriv from hi own privat estat or from what in modern europ wa call the demesn of the crown hi subject upon ordinari occas contribut noth to hi support except when in order to protect them from the oppress of some of their fellowsubject thei stand in need of hi author the present which thei make him upon such occas constitut the whole ordinari revenu the whole of the emolu which except perhap upon some veri extraordinari emerg he deriv from hi dominion over them when agamemnon in homer offer to achil for hi friendship the sovereignti of seven greek citi the sole advantag which he mention as like to be deriv from it wa that the peopl would honour him with present as long as such present as long as the emolu of justic or what mai be call the fee of court constitut in thi manner the whole ordinari revenu which the sovereign deriv from hi sovereignti it could not well be expect it could not even decent be propos that he should give them up altogeth it might and it frequent wa propos that he should regul and ascertain them but after thei had been so regul and ascertain how to hinder a person who wa allpow from extend them beyond those regul wa still veri difficult not to sai imposs dure the continu of thi state of thing therefor the corrupt of justic natur result from the arbitrari and uncertain natur of those present scarc admit of ani effectu remedi but when from differ caus chiefli from the continu increas expens of defend the nation against the invas of other nation the privat estat of the sovereign had becom altogeth insuffici for defrai the expens of the sovereignti and when it had becom necessari that the peopl should for their own secur contribut toward thi expens by tax of differ kind it seem to have been veri commonli stipul that no present for the administr of justic should under ani pretenc be accept either by the sovereign or by hi bailiff and substitut the judg those present it seem to have been suppos could more easili be abolish altogeth than effectu regul and ascertain fix salari were appoint to the judg which were suppos to compens to them the loss of whatev might have been their share of the ancient emolu of justic as the tax more than compens to the sovereign the loss of hi justic wa then said to be administ grati justic howev never wa in realiti administ grati in ani countri lawyer and attornei at least must alwai be paid by the parti and if thei were not thei would perform their duti still wors than thei actual perform it the fee annual paid to lawyer and attornei amount in everi court to a much greater sum than the salari of the judg the circumst of those salari be paid by the crown can nowher much diminish the necessari expens of a lawsuit but it wa not so much to diminish the expens as to prevent the corrupt of justic that the judg were prohibit from receiv my present or fee from the parti the offic of judg is in itself so veri honour that men ar will to accept of it though accompani with veri small emolu the inferior offic of justic of peac though attend with a good deal of troubl and in most case with no emolu at all is an object of ambit to the greater part of our countri gentlemen the salari of all the differ judg high and low togeth with the whole expens of the administr and execut of justic even where it is not manag with veri good economi make in ani civil countri but a veri inconsider part of the whole expens of govern the whole expens of justic too might easili be defrai by the fee of court and without expos the administr of justic to ani real hazard of corrupt the public revenu might thu be entir discharg from a certain though perhap but a small incumbr it is difficult to regul the fee of court effectu where a person so power as the sovereign is to share in them and to deriv ani consider part of hi revenu from them it is veri easi where the judg is the princip person who can reap ani benefit from them the law can veri easili oblig the judg to respect the regul though it might not alwai be abl to make the sovereign respect it where the fee of court ar precis regul and ascertain where thei ar paid all at onc at a certain period of everi process into the hand of a cashier or receiv to be by him distribut in certain known proport among the differ judg after the process is decid and not till it is decid there seem to be no more danger of corrupt than when such fee ar

salari paid to them from some other fund it doe not seen necessari that the person or person entrust with the execut power should be charg with the manag of that fund or with the payment of those

scotland aris from the interest of a sum of monei the necessari instabl of such a fund seem howev to render it an improp on for the mainten of an institut which ought to last for ever the separ of the judici from the execut power seem origin to have arisen from the increas busi of the societi in consequ of it increas improv the administr of justic becam so labori and so complic a duti as to requir the undivid attent of the person to whom it wa entrust the person entrust with the execut power not have leisur to attend to the decis of privat caus himself a deputi wa appoint to decid them in hi stead in the progress of the roman great the consul wa too much occupi with the polit affair of the state to attend to the administr of justic a praetor therefor wa appoint to administ it in hi stead in the progress of the european monarchi which were found upon the ruin of the roman empir the sovereign and the great lord came univers to consid the administr of justic as an offic both too labori and too ignobl for them to execut in their own person thei univers therefor discharg themselv of it by appoint a deputi bailiff or judg when the judici is unit to the execut power it is scarc possibl that justic should not frequent be sacrif to what is vulgarli call polit the person entrust with the great interest of the state mai even without ani corrupt view sometim imagin it necessari to sacrific to those interest the right of a privat man but upon the imparti administr of justic depend the liberti of everi individu the sens which he ha of hi own secur in order to make everi individu feel himself perfectli secur in the possess of everi right which belong to him it is not onli necessari that the judici should be separ from the execut power but that it should be render as much as possibl independ of that power the judg should not be liabl to be remov from hi offic accord to the capric of that power the regular payment of hi salari should not depend upon the good will or even upon the good economi of that power part iii of the expens of public work and public institut the third and last duti of the sovereign or commonwealth is that of erect and maintain those public institut and those public work which though thei mai be in the highest degre advantag to a great societi ar howev of such a natur that the profit could never repai the expens to ani individu or small number of individu and which it therefor cannot be expect that ani individu or small number of individu should erect or maintain the perform of thi duti requir too veri differ degre of expens in the differ period of societi after the public institut and public work necessari for the defenc of the societi and for the administr of justic both of which have alreadi been mention the other work and institut of thi kind ar chiefli for facilit the commerc of the societi and those for promot the instruct of the peopl the institut for instruct ar of two kind those for the educ of the youth and those for the instruct of peopl of all ag the consider of the manner in which the expens of those differ sort of public work and institut mai be most properli defrai will divid thi third part of the present chapter into three differ articl articl iof the public work and institut for facilit the commerc of the societi and first of those which ar necessari for facilit commerc in gener that the erect and mainten of the public work which facilit the commerc of ani countri such as good road bridg navig canal harbour etc must requir veri differ degre of expens in the differ period of societi is evid without ani proof the expens of make and maintain the public road of ani countri must evid increas with the annual produc of the land and labour of that countri or with the quantiti and weight of the good which it becom necessari to fetch and carri upon those road the strength of a bridg must be suit to the number and weight of the carriag which ar like to pass over it the depth and the suppli of water for a navig canal must be proport to the number and tonnag of the lighter which ar like to carri good upon it the extent of a harbour to the number of the ship which ar like to take shelter in it it doe not seem necessari that the expens of those public work should be defrai from that public revenu as it is commonli call of which the collect and applic ar in most countri assign to the execut power the greater part of such public work mai easili be so manag as to afford a particular revenu suffici for defrai their own expens without bring ani burden upon the gener revenu of the societi a highwai a bridg a navig canal for exampl mai in most case be both made add maintain by a small toll upon the carriag which make us of them a harbour by a moder portduti upon the tonnag of the ship which load or unload in it the coinag anoth institut for facilit commerc in mani countri not onli defrai it own expens but afford a small revenu or a seignorag to the sovereign the postoffic anoth institut for the same purpos over and abov defrai it own expens afford in almost all countri a veri consider revenu to the sovereign when the carriag which pass over a highwai or a bridg and the lighter which sail upon a navig canal pai toll in proport to their weight or their tonnag thei pai for the mainten of those public work exactli in proport to the wear and tear which thei occas of them it seem scarc possibl to invent a more equit wai of maintain such work thi tax or toll too though it is advanc by the carrier is final paid by the consum to whom it must alwai be charg in the price of the good as the expens of carriag howev is veri much reduc by mean of such public work the good notwithstand the toll come cheaper to the consum than thei could otherwis have done their price not be so much rais by the toll as it is lower by the cheap of the carriag the person who final pai thi tax therefor gain by the applic more than he lose by the payment of it hi payment is exactli in proport to hi gain it is in realiti no more than a part of that gain which he is oblig to give up in order to get the rest it seem imposs to imagin a more equit method of rais a tax when the toll upon carriag of luxuri upon coach postchais etc is made somewhat higher in proport to their weight than upon carriag of necessari us such as cart waggon etc the indol and vaniti of the rich is made to contribut in a veri easi manner to the relief of the poor by render cheaper the transport of heavi good to all the differ part of the countri when highroad bridg canal etc ar in thi manner made and support by the commerc which is carri on by mean of them thei can be made onli where that commerc requir them and consequ where it is proper to make them their expens too their grandeur and magnific must be suit to what that commerc can afford to pai thei must be made consequ as it is proper to make them a magnific highroad cannot be made through a desert countri where there is littl or no commerc or mere becaus it happen to lead to the countri villa of the intend of the provinc or to that of some great lord to whom the intend find it conveni to make hi court a great bridg cannot be thrown over a river at a place where nobodi pass or mere to embellish the view from the window of a neighbour palac thing which sometim happen in countri where work of thi kind ar carri on by ani other revenu than that which thei themselv ar capabl of afford in sever differ part of europ the toll or lockduti upon a canal is the properti of privat person whose privat interest oblig them to keep up the canal if it is not kept in toler order the navig necessarili ceas altogeth and along with it the whole profit which thei can make by the toll if those toll were put under the manag of commission who had themselv no interest in them thei might be less attent to the mainten of the work which produc them the canal of languedoc cost the king of franc and the provinc upward of thirteen million of livr which at twentyeight livr the mark of silver the valu of french monei in the end of the last centuri amount to upward of nine hundr thousand pound sterl when that great work wa finish the most like method it wa found of keep it in constant repair wa to make a present of the toll to riquet the engin who plan and conduct the work those toll constitut at present a veri larg estat to the differ branch of the famili of that gentleman who have therefor a great interest to keep the work in constant repair but had those toll been put under the manag of commission who had no such interest thei might perhap have been dissip in ornament and unnecessari expens while the most essenti part of the work were allow to go to ruin the toll for the mainten of a highroad cannot with ani safeti be made the properti of privat person a highroad though entir neglect doe not becom altogeth impass though a canal doe the proprietor of the toll upon a highroad therefor might neglect altogeth the repair of the road and yet continu to levi veri nearli the same toll it is proper therefor that the toll for the mainten of such a work should be put under the manag of commission or truste in great britain the abus which the truste have commit in the manag of those toll have in mani case been veri justli complain of at mani turnpik it ha been said the monei levi is more than doubl of what is necessari for execut in the completest manner the work which is often execut in a veri slovenli manner and sometim not execut at all the system of repair the highroad by toll of thi kind it must be observ is not of veri long stand we should not wonder therefor if it ha not yet been brought to that degre of perfect of which it seem capabl if mean and improp person ar frequent appoint truste and if proper court of inspect and account have not yet been establish for control their conduct and for reduc the toll to what is bare suffici for execut the work to be done by them the recenc of the institut both account and apolog for those defect of which by the wisdom of parliament the greater part mai in due time be gradual remedi the monei levi at the differ turnpik in great britain is suppos to exce so much what is necessari for repair the road that the save which with proper economi might be made from it have been consid even by some minist as a veri great resourc which might at some time or anoth be appli to the exig of the state govern it ha been said by take the manag of the turnpik into it own hand and by emploi the soldier who would work for a veri small addit to their pai could keep the road in good order at a much less expens than it can be done by truste who have no other workmen to emploi but such as deriv their whole subsist from their wage a great revenu half a million perhap sinc publish the two first edit of thi book i have got good reason to believ that all the turnpik toll levi in great britain do not produc a neat revenu that amount to half a million a sum which under the manag of govern would not be suffici to keep in repair five of the princip road in the kingdom it ha been pretend might in thi manner be gain without lai ani new burden upon the peopl and the turnpik road might be made to contribut to the gener expens of the state in the same manner as the postoffic doe at present that a consider revenu might be gain in thi manner i have no doubt though probabl not near so much as the projector of thi plan have suppos the plan itself howev seem liabl to sever veri import object first if the toll which ar levi at the turnpik should ever be consid as on of the resourc for suppli the exig of the state thei would certainli be augment as those exig were suppos to requir accord to the polici of great britain therefor thei would probabl he augment veri fast the facil with which a great revenu could be drawn from them would probabl encourag administr to recur veri frequent te thi resourc though it mai perhap be more than doubt whether half a million could by ani economi be save out of the present toll it can scarc be doubt but that a million might be save out of them if thei were doubl and perhap two million if thei were tripl i have now good reason to believ that all these conjectur sum ar by much too larg thi great revenu too might be levi without the appoint of a singl new offic to collect and receiv it but the turnpik toll be continu augment in thi manner instead of facilit the inland commerc of the countri as at present would soon becom a veri great incumbr upon it the expens of transport all heavi good from on part of the countri to anoth would soon be so much increas the market for all such good consequ would soon be so much narrow that their product would be in a great measur discourag and the most import branch of the domest industri of the countri annihil altogeth secondli a tax upon carriag in proport to their weight though a veri equal tax when appli to the sole purpos of repair the road is a veri unequ on when appli to ani other purpos or to suppli the common exig of the state when it is appli to the sole purpos abov mention each carriag is suppos to pai exactli for the wear and tear which that carriag occas of the road but when it is appli to ani other purpos each carriag is suppos to pai for more than that wear and tear and contribut to the suppli of some other exig of the state but as the turnpik toll rais the price of good in proport to their weight and not to their valu it is chiefli paid by the consum of coars and bulki not by those of preciou and light commod whatev exig of the state therefor thi tax might be intend to suppli that exig would be chiefli suppli at the expens of the poor not of the rich at the expens of those who ar least abl to suppli it not of those who ar most abl thirdli if govern should at ani time neglect the repar of the highroad it would be still more difficult than it is at present to compel the proper applic of ani part of the turnpik toll a larg revenu might thu be levi upon the peopl without ani part of it be appli to the onli purpos to which a revenu levi in thi manner ought ever to be appli if the mean and poverti of the truste of turnpik road render it sometim difficult at present to oblig them to repair their wrong their wealth and great would render it ten time more so in the case which is here suppos in franc the fund destin for the repar of the highroad ar under the immedi direct of the execut power those fund consist partli in a certain number of dai labour which the countri peopl ar in most part of europ oblig to give to the repar of the highwai and partli in such a portion of the gener revenu of the state as the king choos to spare from hi other expens by the ancient law of franc as well as by that of most other part of europ the labour of the countri peopl wa under the direct of a local or provinci magistraci which had no immedi depend upon the king council but by the present practic both the labour of the countri peopl and whatev other fund the king mai choos to assign for the repar of the highroad in ani particular provinc or gener ar entir under the manag of the intend an offic who is appoint and remov by the king council who receiv hi order from it and is in constant correspond with it in the progress of despot the author of the execut power gradual absorb that of everi other power in the state and assum to itself the manag of everi branch of revenu which is destin for ani public purpos in franc howev the great postroad the road which make the commun between the princip town of the kingdom ar in gener kept in good order and in some provinc ar even a good deal superior to the greater part of the turnpik road of england but what we call the cross road that is the far greater part of the road in the countri ar entir neglect and ar in mani place absolut impass for ani heavi carriag in some place it is even danger to travel on horseback and mule ar the onli convey which can safe be trust the proud minist of an ostentati court mai frequent take pleasur in execut a work of splendour and magnific such as a great highwai which is frequent seen by the princip nobil whose applaus not onli flatter hi vaniti but even contribut to support hi interest at court but to execut a great number of littl work in which noth that can be done can make ani great appear or excit the smallest degre of admir in ani travel and which in short have noth to recommend them but their extrem util is a busi which appear in everi respect too mean and paltri to merit the attent of so great a magistr under such an administr therefor such work ar almost alwai entir neglect in china and in sever other govern of asia the execut power charg itself both with the repar of the highroad and with the mainten of the navig canal in the instruct which ar given to the governor of each provinc those object it is said ar constantli recommend to him and the judgment which the court form of hi conduct is veri much regul by the attent which he appear to have paid to thi part of hi instruct thi branch of public polic accordingli is said to be veri much attend to in all those countri but particularli in china where the highroad and still more the navig canal it is pretend exce veri much everi thing of the same kind which is known in europ the account of those work howev which have been transmit to europ have gener been drawn up by weak and wonder travel frequent by stupid and ly missionari if thei had been examin by more intellig ey and if the account of them had been report by more faith wit thei would not perhap appear to be so wonder the account which bernier give of some work of thi kind in indostan fall veri short of what had been report of them by other travel more dispos to the marvel than he wa it mai too perhap be in those countri as it is in franc where the great road the great commun which ar like to be the subject of convers at the court and in the capit ar attend to and all the rest neglect in china besid in indostan and in sever other govern of asia the revenu of the sovereign aris almost altogeth from a land tax or land rent which rise or fall with the rise and fall of the annual produc of the land the great interest of the sovereign therefor hi revenu is in such countri necessarili and immedi connect with the cultiv of the land with the great of it produc and with the valu of it produc but in order to render that produc both as great and as valuabl as possibl it is necessari to procur to it as extens a market as possibl and consequ to establish the freest the easiest and the least expens commun between all the differ part of the countri which can be done onli by mean of the best road and the best navig canal but the revenu of the sovereign doe not in ani part of europ aris chiefli from a land tax or land rent in all the great kingdom of europ perhap the greater part of it mai ultim depend upon the produc of the land but that depend is neither so immedi nor so evid in europ therefor the sovereign doe not feel himself so directli call upon to promot the increas both in quantiti and valu of the produc of the land or by maintain good road and canal to provid the most extens market for that produc though it should be true therefor what i apprehend is not a littl doubt that in some part of asia thi depart of the public polic is veri properli manag by the execut power there is not the least probabl that dure the present state of thing it could be toler manag by that power in ani part of europ even those public work which ar of such a natur that thei cannot afford ani revenu for maintain themselv but of which the conveni is nearli confin to some particular place or district ar alwai better maintain by a local or provinci revenu under the manag of a local and provinci administr than by the gener revenu of the state of which the execut power must alwai have the manag were the street of london to be light and pave at the expens of the treasuri is there ani probabl that thei would be so well light and pave as thei ar at present or even at so small an expens the expens besid instead of be rais by a local tax upon the inhabit of each particular street parish or district in london would in thi case be defrai out of the gener revenu of the state and would consequ be rais by a tax upon all the inhabit of the kingdom of whom the greater part deriv no sort of benefit from the light and pave of the street of london the abus which sometim creep into the local and provinci administr of a local and provinci revenu how enorm soever thei mai appear ar in realiti howev almost alwai veri trifl in comparison of those which commonli take place in the administr and expenditur of the revenu of a great empir thei ar besid much more easili correct under the local or provinci administr of the justic of the peac in great britain the six dai labour which the countri peopl ar oblig to give to the repar of the highwai is not alwai perhap veri judici appli but it is scarc ever exact with ani circumst of cruelti or oppress in franc under the administr of the intend the applic is not alwai more judici and the exact is frequent the most cruel and oppress such corve as thei ar call make on of the princip instrument of tyranni by which those offic chastis ani parish or communeaut which ha had the misfortun to fall under their displeasur of the public work and institut which ar necessari for facilit particular branch of commerc the object of the public work and institut abov mention is to facilit commerc in gener but in order to facilit some particular branch of it particular institut ar necessari which again requir a particular and extraordinari expens some particular branch of commerc which ar carri on with barbar

barbar nativ it is necessari that the place where thei ar deposit should be in some measur fortifi the disord in the govern of indostan have been suppos to render a like precaut necessari even among that mild and gentl peopl and it wa under pretenc of secur their person and properti from violenc that both the english and french east india compani were allow to erect the first fort which thei

consul who mai both decid accord to their own custom the differ aris among hi own countrymen and in their disput with the nativ mai by mean of hi public charact interfer with more author and afford them a more power protect than thei could expect from ani privat man the interest of commerc have frequent made it necessari to maintain minist in foreign countri where the purpos either of war or allianc would not have requir ani the commerc of the turkei compani first occas the establish of an ordinari ambassador at constantinopl the first english embassi to russia aros altogeth from commerci interest the constant interfer with those interest necessarili occas between the subject of the differ state of europ ha probabl introduc the custom of keep in all neighbour countri ambassador or minist constantli resid even in the time of peac thi custom unknown to ancient time seem not to be older than the end of the fifteenth or begin of the sixteenth centuri that is than the time when commerc first began to extend itself to the greater part of the nation of europ and when thei first began to attend to it interest it seem not unreason that the extraordinari expens which the protect of ani particular branch of commerc mai occas should be defrai by a moder tax upon that particular branch by a moder fine for exampl to be paid by the trader when thei first enter into it or what is more equal by a particular duti of so much per cent upon the good which thei either import into or export out of the particular countri with which it is carri on the protect of trade in gener from pirat and freeboot is said to have given occas to the first institut of the duti of custom but if it wa thought reason to lai a gener tax upon trade in order to defrai the expens of protect trade in gener it should seem equal reason to lai a particular tax upon a particular branch of trade in order to defrai the extraordinari expens of protect that branch the protect of trade in gener ha alwai been consid as essenti to the defenc of the commonwealth and upon that account a necessari part of the duti of the execut power the collect and applic of the gener duti of custom therefor have alwai been left to that power but the protect of ani particular branch of trade is a part of the gener protect of trade a part therefor of the duti of that power and if nation alwai act consist the

greater part of the commerci state of europ particular compani of merchant have had the address to persuad the legislatur to entrust to them the perform of thi part of the duti of the sovereign togeth with all the power which ar necessarili connect with it these compani though thei mai perhap have been us for the first introduct of some branch of commerc by make at their own expens an experi which the state might not think it prudent to make have in the longrun prove univers either burdensom or useless and have either mismanag or confin the trade when those compani do not trade upon a joint

is alwai to rais the rate of their own profit as high as thei can to keep the market both for the good which thei export and for those which thei import as much understock as thei can which can be done onli by restrain the competit or by discourag new adventur from enter into the trade a fine even of twenti pound besid though it mai not perhap be suffici to discourag ani man from enter into the turkei trade with an intent to continu in it mai be enough to discourag a specul merchant from hazard a singl adventur in it in all trade the regular establish trader even though not incorpor natur

enabl a state to maintain such minist regul compani it wa observ by sir josiah child though thei had frequent support public minist had never maintain ani fort or garrison in the countri to which thei trade wherea jointstock compani frequent had and in realiti the former seem to be much more unfit for thi sort of servic than the latter first the director of a regul compani have no particular interest in the prosper of the gener trade of the compani for the sake of which such fort and garrison ar maintain the decai of that gener trade mai even frequent contribut to the advantag of their own privat trade as by diminish the number of their competitor it mai enabl them both to bui cheaper and to sell dearer the director of a jointstock compani on the contrari have onli their share in the profit which ar made upon the common stock commit to their manag have no privat trade of their own of which the interest can be separ from that of the gener trade of the compani their privat interest is connect with the prosper of the gener trade of the compani and with the mainten of the fort and garrison which ar necessari for it defenc thei ar more like therefor to have that continu

with the mainten of all the british fort and garrison that lie between cape blanc and the cape of good hope and afterward with that of those onli which lie between cape roug and the cape of good hope the act which establish thi compani the rd of georg ii c seem to have had two distinct object in view first to restrain effectu the oppress and monopol spirit which is natur to the director of a regul

ha been allot to them by parliament gener about for the proper applic of thi sum the committe is oblig to account annual to the cursitor baron of exchequ which account is afterward to be laid befor

jointstock compani establish either by royal charter or by act of parliament ar differ in sever respect not onli from regul compani but from privat copartneri first in a privat copartneri no partner

hi share to anoth person and therebi introduc a new member the valu of a share in a joint stock is alwai the price which it will bring in the market and thi mai be either greater or less in ani

fortun in a jointstock compani on the contrari each partner is bound onli to the extent of hi share the trade of a jointstock compani is alwai manag by a court of director thi court inde is frequent

troubl and front risk beyond a limit sum encourag mani peopl to becom adventur in jointstock compani who would upon no account hazard their fortun in ani privat copartneri such compani therefor commonli draw to themselv much greater stock than ani privat copartneri can boast of the trade stock of the south sea compani at on time amount to upward of thirtythre million eight hundr thousand pound the divid capit of the bank of england amount at present to ten million seven hundr and eighti thousand pound the director of such compani howev be the manag rather of other peopl monei than of their own it cannot well be expect that thei should watch over it with the same anxiou vigil with which the partner in a privat copartneri frequent watch over their own like the steward of a rich man thei ar apt to consid attent to small matter as not for their master honour and veri easili give themselv a dispens from have it neglig and profus therefor must alwai prevail more or less in the manag of the affair of such a compani it is upon thi account that jointstock compani for foreign trade have seldom been abl to maintain the competit against privat adventur thei have accordingli veri seldom succeed without an exclus privileg and frequent have not succeed with on without an exclus privileg thei have commonli mismanag the trade with an exclus privileg thei have both mismanag and confin it the royal african compani the predecessor of the present african compani had an exclus privileg by charter but as that charter had not been confirm by act of parliament the trade in consequ of the declar of right wa soon after the revolut laid open to all hi majesti subject the hudson bai compani ar as to their legal right in the same situat as the royal african compani their exclus charter ha not been confirm by act of parliament the south sea compani as long as thei continu to be a trade compani had an exclus privileg confirm by act of parliament as have likewis the present unit compani of merchant trade to the east indi the royal african compani soon found that thei could not maintain the competit against privat adventur whom notwithstand the declar of right thei continu for some time to call interlop and to persecut as such in howev the privat adventur were subject to a duti of ten per cent upon almost all the differ branch of their trade to be emploi by the compani in the mainten of their fort and garrison but notwithstand thi heavi tax the compani were still unabl to maintain the competit their stock and credit gradual declin in their debt had becom so great that a particular act of parliament wa thought necessari both for their secur and for that of their creditor it wa enact that the resolut of twothird of these creditor in number and valu should bind the rust both with regard to the time which should be allow to the compani for the payment of their debt and with regard to ani other agreement which it might be thought proper to make with them concern those debt in their affair were in so great disord that thei were altogeth incap of maintain their fort and garrison the sole purpos and pretext of their institut from that year till their final dissolut the parliament judg it necessari to allow the annual sum of for that purpos in after have been for mani year loser by the trade of carri negro to the west indi thei at last resolv to give it up

but their success in thi more confin trade wa not greater than in their former extens on their affair continu to go gradual to declin till at last be in everi respect a bankrupt compani thei were dissolv by act of parliament and their fort and garrison vest in the present regul compani of merchant trade to africa befor the erect of the royal african compani there had been three other jointstock compani success establish on after anoth for the african trade thei were all equal unsuccess thei all howev had exclus charter which though not confirm by act of parliament were in those dai suppos to convei a real exclus privileg the hudson bai compani befor their misfortun in the late war had been much more fortun than the royal african compani their necessari expens is much smaller the whole number of peopl whom thei maintain in their differ settlement and habit which thei have honour with the name of fort is said not to exce a hundr and twenti person thi number howev is suffici to prepar beforehand the cargo of fur and other good necessari for load their ship which on account of the ic can seldom remain abov six or eight week in those sea thi advantag of have a cargo readi prepar could not for sever year be acquir by privat adventur and without it there seem to be no possibl of trade to hudson bai the moder capit of the compani which it is said doe not exce on hundr and ten thousand pound mai besid be suffici to enabl them to engross the whole or almost the whole trade and surplu produc of the miser though extens countri comprehend within their charter no privat adventur accordingli have ever attempt to trade to that countri in competit with them thi compani therefor have alwai enjoi an exclus trade in fact though thei mai have no right to it in law over and abov all thi the moder capit of thi compani is said to be divid among a veri small number of proprietor but a jointstock compani consist of a small number of proprietor with a moder capit approach veri nearli to the natur of a privat copartneri and mai be capabl of nearli the same degre of vigil and attent it is not to be wonder at therefor if in consequ of these differ advantag the hudson bai compani had befor the late war been abl to carri on their trade with a consider degre of success it doe not seem probabl howev that their profit ever approach to what the late mr dobb imagin them a much more sober and judici writer mr anderson author of the histor and chronolog deduct of commerc veri justli observ that upon examin the account which mr dobb himself ha given for sever year togeth of their export and import and upon make proper allow for their extraordinari risk and expens it doe not appear that their profit deserv to be envi or that thei can much if at all exce the ordinari profit of trade the south sea compani never had ani fort or garrison to maintain and therefor were entir exempt from on great expens to which other jointstock compani for foreign trade ar subject but thei had an immens capit divid among an immens number of proprietor it wa natur to be expect therefor that folli neglig and profus should prevail in the whole manag of their affair the knaveri and extravag of their stockjob project ar suffici known and the explic of them would be foreign to the present subject their mercantil project were not much better conduct the first trade which thei engag in wa that of suppli the spanish west indi with negro of which in consequ of what wa call the assiento contract grant them by the treati of utrecht thei had the exclus privileg but as it wa not expect that much profit could be made by thi trade both the portugues and french compani who had enjoi it upon the same term befor them have been ruin by it thei were allow as compens to send annual a ship of a certain burden to trade directli to the spanish west indi of the ten voyag which thi annual ship wa allow to make thei ar said to have gain consider by on that of the royal carolin in and to have been loser more or less by almost all the rest their ill success wa imput by their factor and agent to the extort and oppress of the spanish govern but wa perhap princip ow to the profus and depred of those veri factor and agent some of whom ar said to have acquir great fortun even in on year in the compani petit the king that thei might be allow to dispos of the trade and tonnag of their annual ship on account of the littl profit which thei made by it and to accept of such equival as thei could obtain from the king of spain in thi compani had undertaken the whale fisheri of thi inde thei had no monopoli but as long as thei carri it on no other british subject appear to have engag in it of the eight voyag which their ship made to greenland thei were gainer by on and loser by all the rest after their eighth and last voyag when thei had sold their ship store and utensil thei found that their whole loss upon thi branch capit and interest includ amount to upward of in thi compani petit the parliament to be allow to divid their immens capit of more than thirtythre million eight hundr thousand pound the whole of which had been lent to govern into two equal part the on half or upward of to be put upon the same foot with other govern annuiti and not to be subject to the debt contract or loss incur by the director of the compani in the prosecut of their mercantil project the other half to remain as befor a trade stock and to be subject to those debt and loss the petit wa too reason not to be grant in thei again petit the parliament that threefourth of their trade stock might be turn into annuiti stock and onli onefourth remain as trade stock or expos to the hazard aris from the bad manag of their director both their annuiti and trade stock had by thi time been reduc more than two million each by sever differ payment from govern so that thi fourth amount onli to in all the demand of the compani upon the king of spain in consequ of the assiento contract were by the treati of aixlachapel given up for what wa suppos an equival an end wa put to their trade with the spanish west indi the remaind of their trade stock wa turn into an annuiti stock and the compani ceas in everi respect to be a trade compani it ought to be observ that in the trade which the south sea compani carri on by mean of their annual ship the onli trade by which it ever wa expect that thei could make ani consider profit thei were not without competitor either in the foreign or in the home market at carthagena porto bello and la vera cruz thei had to encount the competit of the spanish merchant who brought from cadiz to those market european good of the same kind with the outward cargo of their ship and in england thei had to encount that of the english merchant who import from cadiz good of the spanish west indi of the same kind with the inward cargo the good both of the spanish and english merchant inde were perhap subject to higher duti but the loss occas by the neglig profus and malvers of the servant of the compani had probabl been a tax much heavier than all those duti that a jointstock compani should be abl to carri on successfulli ani branch of foreign trade when privat adventur can come into ani sort of open and fair competit with them seem contrari to all experi the old english east india compani wa establish in by a charter from queen elizabeth in the first twelv voyag which thei fit out for india thei appear to have trade as a regul compani with separ stock though onli in the gener ship of the compani in thei unit into a joint stock their charter wa exclus and though not confirm by act of parliament wa in those dai suppos to convei a real exclus privileg for mani year therefor thei were not much disturb by interlop their capit which never exceed and of which wa a share wa not so exorbit nor their deal so extens as to afford either a pretext for gross neglig and profus or a cover to gross malvers notwithstand some extraordinari loss occas partli by the malic of the dutch east india compani and partli by other accid thei carri on for mani year a success trade but in process of time when the principl of liberti were better understood it becam everi dai more and more doubt how far a royal charter not confirm by act of parliament could convei an exclus privileg upon thi question the decis of the court of justic were not uniform but vari with the author of govern and the humour of the time interlop multipli upon them and toward the end of the reign of charl ii through the whole of that of jame ii and dure a part of that of william iii reduc them to great distress in a propos wa made to parliament of advanc two million to govern at eight per cent provid the subscrib were erect into a new east india compani with exclus privileg the old east india compani offer seven hundr thousand pound nearli the amount of their capit at four per cent upon the same condit but such wa at that time the state of public credit that it wa more conveni for govern to borrow two million at eight per cent than seven hundr thousand pound at four the propos of the new subscrib wa accept and a new east india compani establish in consequ the old east india compani howev had a right to continu their trade till thei had at the same time in the name of their treasur subscrib veri artfulli three hundr and fifteen thousand pound into the stock of the new by a neglig in the express of the act of parliament which vest the east india trade in the subscrib to thi loan of two million it did not appear evid that thei were all oblig to unit into a joint stock a few privat trader whose subscript amount onli to seven thousand two hundr pound insist upon the privileg of trade separ upon their own stock and at their own risk the old east india compani had a right to a separ trade upon their own stock till and thei had likewis both befor and after that period a right like that or other privat trader to a separ trade upon the which thei had subscrib into the stock of the new compani the competit of the two compani with the privat trader and with on anoth is said to have well nigh ruin both upon a subsequ occas in when a propos wa made to parliament for put the trade under the manag of a regul compani and therebi lai it in some measur open the east india compani in opposit to thi propos repres in veri strong term what had been at thi time the miser effect as thei thought them of thi competit in india thei said it rais the price of good so high that thei were not worth the bui and in england by overstock the market it sunk their price so low that no profit could be made by them that by a more plenti suppli to the great advantag and conveni of the public it must have reduc veri much the price of india good in the english market cannot well be doubt but that it should have rais veri much their price in the indian market seem not veri probabl as all the extraordinari demand which that competit could occas must have been but as a drop of water in the immens ocean of indian commerc the increas of demand besid though in the begin it mai sometim rais the price of good never fail to lower it in the longrun it encourag product and therebi increas the competit of the produc who in order to undersel on anoth have recours to new divis or labour and new improv of art which might never otherwis have been thought of the miser effect of which the compani complain were the cheap of consumpt and the encourag given to product precis the two effect which it is the great busi of polit economi to promot the competit howev of which thei gave thi dole account had not been allow to be of long continu in the two compani were in some measur unit by an indentur tripartit to which the queen wa the third parti and in thei were by act of parliament perfectli consolid into on compani by their present name of the unit compani of merchant trade to the east indi into thi act it wa thought worth while to insert a claus

languag wa connect with everi part of that classic learn which though at first princip cultiv by cathol and italian happen to come into fashion much about the same time that the doctrin of the reform were set on foot in the greater part of univers therefor that languag wa taught previou to the studi of philosophi and as soon as the student had made some progress in the latin the hebrew languag have no connect with classic learn and except the holi scriptur be the languag of not a singl book in ani esteem the studi of it did not commonli commenc till after that of philosophi and when the student had enter upon the studi of theologi origin the first rudiment both of the greek and latin languag were taught in univers and in some univers thei still continu to be so in other it is expect that the student should have previous acquir at least the rudiment of on or both of those languag of which the studi continu to make everywher a veri consider part of univers educ the ancient greek philosophi wa divid into three great branch physic or natur philosophi ethic or moral philosophi and logic thi gener divis seem perfectli agreeabl to the natur of thing the great phenomena of natur

pretend to give an account of the origin and revolut of the great system of the univers but in the univers of europ where philosophi wa taught onli as subservi to theologi it wa natur to dwell longer upon these two chapter than upon ani other of the scienc thei were gradual more and more extend and were divid into mani inferior chapter till at last the doctrin of spirit of which so littl can be known came to take up as much room in the system of philosophi as the doctrin of bodi of which so much can be known the doctrin concern those two subject were consid as make two distinct scienc what ar call metaphys or pneumat were set in opposit to physic and were cultiv not onli as the more sublim but for the purpos of a particular profess as the more us scienc of the two the proper subject of experi and observ a subject in which a care attent is capabl of make so mani us discoveri wa almost entir neglect the subject in which after a veri few simpl and almost obviou truth the most care attent can discov noth but obscur and uncertainti and can consequ produc noth but subtleti and sophism wa greatli cultiv when those two scienc had thu been set in opposit to on anoth the comparison between them natur gave birth to a third to what wa call ontolog or the scienc which treat of the qualiti and attribut which were common to both the subject of the other two scienc but if subtleti and sophism compos the greater part of the metaphys or pneumat of the school thei compos the whole of thi cobweb scienc of ontolog which wa likewis sometim call metaphys wherein consist the happi and perfect of a man consid not onli as an individu but as the member of a famili of a state and of the great societi of mankind wa the object which the ancient moral philosophi propos to investig in that philosophi the duti of human life were treat of as subservi to the happi and perfect of human life but when moral as well as natur philosophi came to be taught onli as subservi to theologi the duti of human life were treat of as chiefli subservi to the happi of a life to come in the ancient philosophi the perfect of virtu wa repres as necessarili product to the person who possess it of the most perfect happi in thi life in the modern philosophi it wa frequent repres as gener or rather as almost alwai inconsist with ani degre of happi in thi life and heaven wa to be earn onli by penanc and mortif by the auster and abas of a monk not by the liber gener and spirit conduct of a man casuistri and an ascet moral made up in most case the greater part of the moral philosophi of the school by far the most import of all the differ branch of philosophi becam in thi manner by far the most corrupt such therefor wa the common cours of philosoph educ in the greater part of the univers in europ logic wa taught first ontolog came in the second place pneumatolog comprehend the doctrin concern the natur of the human soul and of the deiti in the third in the fourth follow a debas system of moral philosophi which wa consid as immedi connect with the doctrin of pneumatolog with the immort of the human soul and with the reward and punish which from the justic of the deiti were to be expect in a life to come a short and superfici system of physic usual conclud the cours the alter which the univers of europ thu introduc into the ancient cours of philosophi were all meant for the educ of ecclesiast and to render it a more proper introduct to the studi of theologi but the addit quantiti of subtleti and sophistri the casuistri and ascet moral which those alter introduc into it certainli did not render it more for the educ of gentlemen or men of the world or more like either to improv the understand or to mend the heart thi cours of philosophi is what still continu to be taught in the greater part of the univers of europ with more or less dilig accord as the constitut of each particular univers happen to render dilig more or less necessari to the teacher in some of the richest and best endow univers the tutor content themselv with teach a few unconnect shred and parcel of thi corrupt cours and even these thei commonli teach veri neglig and superfici the improv which in modern time have been made in sever differ branch of philosophi have not the greater part of them been made in univers though some no doubt have the greater part of univers have not even been veri forward to adopt those improv after thei were made and sever of those learn societi have chosen to remain for a long time the sanctuari in which explod system and obsolet prejudic found shelter and protect after thei had been hunt out of everi other corner of the world in gener the richest and best endow univers have been slowest in adopt those improv and the most avers to permit ani consider chang in the establish plan of educ those improv were more easili introduc into some of the poorer univers in which the teacher depend upon their reput for the greater part of their subsist were oblig to pai more attent to the current opinion of the world but though the public school and univers of europ were origin intend onli for the educ of a particular profess that of churchmen and though thei were not alwai veri dilig in instruct their pupil even in the scienc which were suppos necessari for that profess yet thei gradual drew to themselv the educ of almost all other peopl particularli of almost all gentlemen and men of fortun no better method it seem could be fallen upon of spend with ani advantag the long interv between infanc and that period of life at which men begin to appli in good earnest to the real busi of the world the busi which is to emploi them dure the remaind of their dai the greater part of what is taught in school and univers howev doe not seem to be the most proper prepar for that busi in england it becom everi dai more and more the custom to send young peopl to travel in foreign countri immedi upon their leav school and without send them to ani univers our young peopl it is said gener return home much improv by their travel a young man who goe abroad at seventeen or eighteen and return home at oneandtwenti return three or four year older than he wa when he went abroad and at that ag it is veri difficult not to improv a good deal in three or four year in the cours of hi travel he gener acquir some knowledg of on or two foreign languag a knowledg howev which is seldom suffici to enabl him either to speak or write them with proprieti in other respect he commonli return home more conceit more unprincipl more dissip and more incap of my seriou applic either to studi or to busi than he could well have becom in so short a time had he live at home by travel so veri young by spend in the most frivol dissip the most previou year of hi life at a distanc from the inspect and control of hi parent and relat everi us habit which the earlier part of hi educ might have had some tendenc to form in him instead of be rivet and confirm is almost necessarili either weaken or effac noth but the discredit into which the univers ar allow themselv to fall could ever have brought into reput so veri absurd a practic as that of travel at thi earli period of life by send hi son abroad a father deliv himself at least for some time from so disagre an object as that of a son unemploi neglect and go to ruin befor hi ey such have been the effect of some of the modern institut for educ differ plan and differ institut for educ seem to have taken place in other ag and nation in the republ of ancient greec everi free citizen wa instruct under the direct of the public magistr in gymnast exercis and in music by gymnast exercis it wa intend to harden hi bodi to sharpen hi courag and to prepar him for the fatigu and danger of war and as the greek militia wa by all account on of the best that ever wa in the world thi part of their public educ must have answer complet the purpos for which it wa intend by the other part music it wa propos at least by the philosoph and historian who have given us an account of those institut to human the mind to soften the temper and to dispos it for perform all the social and moral duti of public and privat life in ancient rome the exercis of the campu martiu answer the same purpos as those of the gymnasium in ancient greec and thei seem to have answer it equal well but among the roman there wa noth which correspond to the music educ of the greek the moral of the roman howev both in privat and public life seem to have been not onli equal but upon the whole a good deal superior to those of the greek that thei were superior in privat life we have the express testimoni of polybiu and of dionysiu of halicarnassu two author well acquaint with both nation and the whole tenor of the greek and roman histori bear wit to the superior of the public moral of the roman the good temper and moder of contend faction seem to be the most essenti circumst in the public moral of a free peopl but the faction of the greek were almost alwai violent and sanguinari wherea till the time of the gracchi no blood had ever been shed in ani roman faction and from the time of the gracchi the roman republ mai be consid as in realiti dissolv notwithstand therefor the veri respect author of plato aristotl and polybiu and notwithstand the veri ingeni reason by which mr montesquieu endeavour to support that author it seem probabl that the music educ of the greek had no great effect in mend their moral sinc without ani such educ those of the roman were upon the whole superior the respect of those ancient sage for the institut of their ancestor had probabl dispos them to find much polit wisdom in what wa perhap mere an ancient custom continu without interrupt from the earliest period of those societi to the time in which thei had arriv at a consider degre of refin music and danc ar the great amus of almost all barbar nation and the great accomplish which ar suppos to fit ani man for entertain hi societi it is so at thi dai among the negro on the coast of africa it wa so among the ancient celt among the ancient scandinavian and as we mai learn from homer among the ancient greek in the time preced the trojan war when the greek tribe had form themselv into littl republ it wa natur that the studi of those accomplish should for a long time make a part of the public and common educ of the peopl the master who instruct the young peopl either in music or in militari exercis do not seem to have been paid or even appoint by the state either in rome or even at athen the greek republ of whose law and custom we ar the best inform the state requir that everi free citizen should fit himself for defend it in war and should upon that account learn hi militari exercis but it left him to learn them of such master as he could find and it seem to have advanc noth for thi purpos but a public field or place of exercis in which he should practis and perform them in the earli ag both of the greek and roman republ the other part of educ seem to have consist in learn to read write and account accord to the arithmet of the time these accomplish the richer citizen seem frequent to have acquir at home by the assist of some domest pedagogu who wa gener either a slave or a freedman and the poorer citizen in the school of such master as made a trade of teach for hire such part of educ howev were abandon altogeth to the care of the parent or guardian of each individu it doe not appear that the state ever assum ani inspect or direct of them by a law of solon inde the children were acquit from maintain those parent who had neglect to instruct them in some profit trade or busi in the progress of refin when philosophi and rhetor came into fashion the better sort of peopl us to send their children to the school of philosoph and rhetorician in order to be instruct in these fashion scienc but those school were not support by the public thei were for a long time bare toler by it the demand for philosophi and rhetor wa for a long time so small that the first profess teacher of either could not find constant employ in ani on citi but were oblig to travel about from place to place in thi manner live zeno of elea protagora gorgia hippia and mani other as the demand increas the school both of philosophi and rhetor becam stationari first in athen and afterward in sever other citi the state howev seem never to have encourag them further than by assign to some of them a particular place to teach in which wa sometim done too by privat donor the state seem to have assign the academi to plato the lyceum to aristotl and the portico to zeno of citta the founder of the stoic but epicuru bequeath hi garden to hi own school till about the time of marcu antoninu howev no teacher appear to have had ani salari from the public or to have had ani other emolu but what aros from the honorariu or fee of hi scholar the bounti which that philosoph emperor as we learn from lucian bestow upon on of the teacher of philosophi probabl last no longer than hi own life there wa noth equival to the privileg of graduat and to have attend ani of those school wa not necessari in order to be permit to practis ani particular trade or profess if the opinion of their own util could not draw scholar to them the law neither forc anybodi to go to them nor reward anybodi for have gone to them the teacher had no jurisdict over their pupil nor ani other author besid that natur author which superior virtu and abil never fail to procur from young peopl toward those who ar entrust with ani part of their educ at rome the studi of the civil law made a part of the educ not of the greater part of the citizen but of some particular famili the young peopl howev who wish to acquir knowledg in the law had no public school to go to and had no other method of studi it than by frequent the compani of such of their relat and friend as were suppos to understand it it is perhap worth while to remark that though the law of the twelv tabl were mani of them copi from those of some ancient greek republ yet law never seem to have grown up to be a scienc in ani republ of ancient greec in rome it becam a scienc veri earli and gave a consider degre of illustr to those citizen who had the reput of understand it in the republ of ancient greec particularli in athen the ordinari court of justic consist of numer and therefor disorderli bodi of peopl who frequent decid almost at random or as clamour faction and partyspirit happen to determin the ignomini of an unjust decis when it wa to be divid among five hundr a thousand or fifteen hundr peopl for some of their court were so veri numer could not fall veri heavi upon ani individu at rome on the contrari the princip court of justic consist either of a singl judg or of a small number of judg whose charact especi as thei deliber alwai in public could not fail to be veri much affect by ani rash or unjust decis in doubt case such court from their anxieti to avoid blame would natur endeavour to shelter themselv under the exampl or preced of the judg who had sat befor them either in the same or in some other court thi attent to practic and preced necessarili form the roman law into that regular and orderli system in which it ha been deliv down to us and the like attent ha had the like effect upon the law of everi other countri where such attent ha taken place the superior of charact in the roman over that of the greek so much remark by polybiu and dionysiu of halicarnassu wa probabl more ow to the better constitut of their court of justic than to ani of the circumst to which those author ascrib it the roman ar said to have been particularli distinguish for their superior respect to an oath but the peopl who were accustom to make oath onli befor some dilig and well inform court of justic would natur be much more attent to what thei swore than thei who were accustom to do the same thing befor mobbish and disorderli assembl the abil both civil and militari of the greek and roman will readili be allow to have been at least equal to those of ani modern nation our prejudic is perhap rather to overr them but except in what relat to militari exercis the state seem to have been at no pain to form those great abil for i cannot be induc to believ that the music educ of the greek could be of much consequ in form them master howev had been found it seem for instruct the better sort of peopl among those nation in everi art and scienc in which the circumst of their societi render it necessari or conveni for them to be instruct the demand for such instruct produc what it alwai produc the talent for give it and the emul which an unrestrain competit never fail to excit appear to have brought that talent to a veri high degre of perfect in the attent which the ancient philosoph excit in the empir which thei acquir over the opinion and principl of their auditor in the faculti which thei possess of give a certain tone and charact to the conduct and convers of those auditor thei appear to have been much superior to ani modern teacher in modern time the dilig of public teacher is more or less corrupt by the circumst which render them more or less independ of their success and reput in their particular profess their salari too put the privat teacher who would pretend to come into competit with them in the same state with a merchant who attempt to trade without a bounti in competit with those who trade with a consider on if he sell hi good at nearli the same price he cannot have the same profit and poverti and beggari at least if not bankruptci and ruin will infal be hi lot if he attempt to sell them much dearer he is like to have so few custom that hi circumst will not be much mend the privileg of graduat besid ar in mani countri necessari or at least extrem conveni to most men of learn profess that is to the far greater part of those who have occas for a learn educ but those privileg can be obtain onli by attend the lectur of the public teacher the most care attend upon the ablest instruct of ani privat teacher cannot alwai give ani titl to demand them it is from these differ caus that the privat teacher of ani of the scienc which ar commonli taught in univers is in modern time gener consid as in the veri lowest order of men of letter a man of real abil can scarc find out a more humili or a more unprofit employ to turn them to the endow of school and colleg have in thi manner not onli corrupt the dilig of public teacher but have render it almost imposs to have ani good privat on were there no public institut for educ no system no scienc would be taught for which there wa not some demand or which the circumst of the time did not render it either necessari or conveni or at least fashion to learn a privat teacher could never find hi account in teach either an explod and antiqu system of a scienc acknowledg to be us or a scienc univers believ to be a mere useless and pedant heap of sophistri and nonsens such system such scienc can subsist nowher but in those incorpor societi for educ whose prosper and revenu ar in a great measur independ of their industri were

soon as thei ar abl to work thei must appli to some trade by which thei can earn their subsist that trade too is gener so simpl and uniform as to give littl exercis to the understand while at the same time their labour is both so constant and so sever that it leav them littl leisur and less inclin to appli to or even to think of ani thing els but though the common peopl cannot in ani civil societi be so well instruct as peopl of some rank and fortun the most essenti part of educ howev to read write and account can be acquir at so earli a period of life that the greater part even of those who ar to be bred to the lowest occup have time to acquir them befor thei can be emploi in those occup for a veri small expens the public can facilit can encourag and can even impos upon almost the whole bodi of the peopl the necess of acquir those most essenti part of educ the public can facilit thi acquisit by establish in everi parish or district a littl school where children mayb taught for a reward so moder that even a common labour mai afford it the master be partli but not wholli paid by the public becaus if he wa wholli or even princip paid by it he would soon learn to neglect hi busi in scotland the establish of such parish school ha taught almost the whole common peopl to read and a veri great proport of them to write and account in england the establish of chariti school ha had an effect of the same kind though not so univers becaus the establish is not so univers if in those littl school the book by which the children ar taught to read were a littl more instruct than thei commonli ar and if instead of a littl smatter in latin which the children of the common peopl ar sometim taught there and which can scarc ever be of ani us to them thei were instruct in the elementari part of geometri and mechan the literari educ of thi rank of peopl would perhap be as complet as can be there is scarc a common trade which doe not afford some opportun of appli to it the principl of geometri and mechan and which would not therefor gradual exercis and improv the common peopl in those principl the necessari introduct to the most sublim as well as to the most us scienc the public can encourag the acquisit of those most essenti part of educ by give small premium and littl badg of distinct to the children of the common peopl who excel in them the public can impos upon almost the whole bodi of the peopl the necess of acquir the most essenti part of educ by oblig everi man to undergo an examin or probat in them befor he can obtain the freedom in ani corpor or be allow to set up ani trade either in a villag or town corpor it wa in thi manner by facilit the acquisit of their militari and gymnast exercis by encourag it and even by impos upon the whole bodi of the peopl the necess of learn those exercis that the greek and roman republ maintain the martial spirit of their respect citizen thei facilit the acquisit of those exercis by appoint a certain place for learn and practis them and by grant to certain master the privileg of teach in that place those master do not appear to have had either salari or exclus privileg of ani kind their reward consist altogeth in what thei got from their scholar and a citizen who had learnt hi exercis in the public gymnasia had no sort of legal advantag over on who had learnt them privat provid the latter had learn them equal well those republ encourag the acquisit of those exercis by bestow littl premium and badg of distinct upon those who excel in them to have gain a prize in the olymp isthmian or nemaean game gave

the necess of learn those exercis without which he could not be fit for that servic that in the progress of improv the practic of militari exercis unless govern take proper pain to support it goe gradual to decai and togeth with it the martial spirit of the great bodi of the peopl the exampl of modern europ suffici demonstr but the secur of everi societi must alwai depend more or less upon the martial spirit of the great bodi of the peopl in the present time inde that martial spirit alon and unsupport by a welldisciplin stand armi would not perhap be suffici for the defenc and secur of ani societi but where everi citizen had the spirit of a soldier a smaller stand armi would sure be requisit that spirit besid would necessarili diminish veri much the danger to liberti whether real or imaginari which ar commonli apprehend from a stand armi as it would veri much facilit the oper of that armi against a foreign invad so it would obstruct them as much if unfortun thei should ever be direct against the constitut of the state the ancient institut of greec and rome seem to have been much more effectu for maintain the martial spirit of the great bodi of the peopl than the establish of what ar call the militia of modern time thei were much more simpl when thei were onc establish thei execut themselv and it requir littl or no attent from govern to maintain them in the most perfect vigour wherea to maintain even in toler execut the complex regul of ani modern militia requir the continu and pain attent of govern without which thei ar constantli fall into total neglect and disus the influenc besid of the ancient institut wa much more univers by mean of them the whole bodi of the peopl wa complet instruct in the us of arm wherea it is but a veri small part of them who can ever be so instruct by the regul of ani modern militia except perhap that of switzerland but a coward a man incap either of defend or of reveng himself evid want on of the most essenti part of the charact of a man he is as much mutil and deform in hi mind as anoth is in hi bodi who is either depriv of some of it most essenti member or ha lost the us of them he is evid the more wretch and miser of the two becaus happi and miseri which resid altogeth in the mind must necessarili depend more upon the health or unhealth the mutil or entir state of the mind than upon that of the bodi even though the martial spirit of the peopl were of no us toward the defenc of the societi yet to prevent that sort of mental mutil deform and wretched which cowardic necessarili involv in it from spread themselv through the great bodi of the peopl would still deserv the most seriou attent of govern in the same manner as it would deserv it most seriou attent to prevent a leprosi or ani other loathsom and offens diseas though neither mortal nor danger from spread itself among them though perhap no other public good might result from such attent besid the prevent of so great a public evil the same thing mai be said of the gross ignor and stupid which in a civil societi seem so frequent to benumb the understand of all the inferior rank of peopl a man without the proper us of the intellectu faculti of a man is if possibl more contempt than even a coward and seem to be mutil and deform in a still more essenti part of the charact of human natur though the state wa to deriv no advantag from the instruct of the inferior rank of peopl it would still deserv it attent that thei should not be altogeth uninstruct the state howev deriv no inconsider advantag from their instruct the more thei ar

thei ar more dispos to examin and more capabl of see through the interest complaint of faction and sedit and thei ar upon that account less apt to be misl into ani wanton or unnecessari opposit to the

of the present ag ar of such a natur that while thei promot the interest of the societi thei ar also us or agreeabl to some individu and in that case the constant rule of the magistr except perhap on

must receiv daili increas from their increas practic studi and attent but if we consid the matter more close we shall find that thi interest dilig of the clergi is what everi wise legisl will studi to

establish for the priest and that in realiti the most decent and advantag composit which he can make with the spiritu guid is to bribe their indol by assign state salari to their profess and render it superflu for them to be farther activ than mere to prevent their flock from strai in quest of new pastor and in thi manner ecclesiast establish though commonli thei aros at first from religi view prove in the end advantag to the polit interest of societi but whatev mai have been the good or bad effect of the independ provis of the clergi it ha perhap been veri seldom bestow upon them from ani

wa gener that he should silenc and subdu all their adversari and their second that he should bestow an independ provis on themselv as thei had gener contribut a good deal to the victori it seem not unreason that thei should have some share in the spoil thei were weari besid of humour the peopl and of depend upon their capric for a subsist in make thi demand therefor thei consult their own eas and comfort without troubl themselv about the effect which it might have in futur time upon the influenc and author of their order the civil magistr who could compli with their demand onli by give them someth which he would have chosen much rather to take or to keep to himself wa seldom veri forward to grant it necess howev alwai forc him to submit at last though frequent not till after mani

probabl have dealt equal and imparti with all the differ sect and have allow everi man to choos hi own priest and hi own religion as he thought proper there would and in thi case no doubt have been a great multitud of religi sect almost everi differ congreg might probabl have had a littl sect by itself or have entertain some peculiar tenet of it own each teacher would no doubt have felt himself under the necess of make the utmost exert and of us everi art both to preserv and to increas the number of hi discipl but as everi other teacher would have felt himself under the same necess the success of no on teacher or sect of teacher could have been veri great the interest and activ zeal of religi teacher can be danger and troublesom onli where there is either but on sect toler in the

where the societi is divid into two or three hundr or perhap into as mani thousand small sect of which no on could be consider enough to disturb the public tranquil the teacher of each sect see themselv surround on all side with more adversari than friend would be oblig to learn that candour and moder which ar so seldom to be found among the teacher of those great sect whose tenet be support by the civil magistr ar held in vener by almost all the inhabit of extens kingdom and empir and who therefor see noth round them but follow discipl and humbl admir the teacher of each littl sect find themselv almost alon would be oblig to respect those of almost everi other sect and the concess which thei would mutual find in both conveni and agreeabl to make on to anoth might in time probabl reduc the doctrin of the greater part of them to that pure and ration religion free from everi mixtur of absurd impostur or fanatic such as wise men have in all ag of the world wish to see establish but such as posit law ha perhap never yet establish and probabl never will establish in ani countri becaus with regard to religion posit law alwai ha been and probabl alwai will be more or less

to peopl of their condit the disord and extravag of sever year on the contrari will not alwai ruin a man of fashion and peopl of that rank ar veri apt to consid the power of indulg in some degre of

such excess with but a small degre of disapprob and censur them either veri slightli or not at all almost all religi sect have begun among the common peopl from whom thei have gener drawn their

the sect in littl religi sect accordingli the moral of the common peopl have been almost alwai remark regular and orderli gener much more so than in the establish church the moral of those littl sect inde have frequent been rather disagre rigor and unsoci there ar two veri easi and effectu remedi howev by whose joint oper the state might without violenc correct whatev wa unsoci or disagre rigor in the moral of all the littl sect into which the countri wa divid the first of those remedi is the studi of scienc and philosophi which the state might render almost univers among all peopl of middl or more than middl rank and fortun not by give salari to teacher in order to make them neglig and idl but by institut some sort of probat even in the higher and more difficult scienc to be undergon by everi person befor he wa permit to exercis ani liber profess or befor he could be receiv as a candid for ani honour offic of trust or profit if the state impos upon thi order of men the necess of learn it would have no occas to give itself ani troubl about provid them with proper teacher thei would soon find better teacher for themselv than ani whom the state could provid for them scienc is the great antidot to the poison of enthusiasm and superstit and where all the superior rank of peopl were secur from it the inferior rank could not be much expos to it the second of those remedi is the frequenc and gaieti of public divers the state by encourag that is by give entir liberti to all those who from their own interest would attempt without scandal or indec to amus and divert the peopl by paint poetri music danc by all sort of dramat represent and exhibit would easili dissip in the greater part of them that melancholi and gloomi humour which is almost alwai the nurs of popular superstit and enthusiasm public divers have alwai been the object of dread and hatr to all the fanat promot of those popular frenzi the gaieti and good humour which those divers inspir were altogeth inconsist with that temper of mind which wa fittest for their purpos or which thei could best work upon dramat represent besid frequent expos their artific to public ridicul and sometim even to public execr were upon that account more than all other divers the object of their peculiar abhorr in a countri where the law favour the teacher of no on religion more than those of anoth it would not be necessari that ani of them should have ani particular or immedi depend upon the sovereign or execut power or that he should have anyth to do either in appoint or in dismiss them from their offic in such a situat he would have no occas to give himself ani concern about them further than to keep the peac among them in the same manner as among the rest of hi subject that is to hinder them from persecut abus or oppress on anoth but it is quit otherwis in countri where there is an establish or govern religion the sovereign can in thi case never be secur unless he ha the mean of influenc in a consider degre the greater part of the teacher of that religion the clergi of everi establish church constitut a great incorpor thei can act in concert and pursu their interest upon on plan and with on spirit as much as if thei were under the direct of on man and thei ar frequent too under such direct their interest as an incorpor bodi is never the same with that of the sovereign and is sometim directli opposit to it their great interest is to maintain their author with the peopl and thi author depend upon the suppos certainti and import of the whole doctrin which thei inculc and upon the suppos necess of adopt everi part of it with the most implicit faith in order to avoid etern miseri should the sovereign have the imprud to appear either to derid or doubt himself of the most trifl part of their doctrin or from human attempt to protect those who did either the on or the other the punctili honour of a clergi who have no sort of depend upon him is immedi provok to proscrib him as a profan person and to emploi all the terror of religion in order to oblig the peopl to transfer their allegi to some more orthodox and obedi princ should he oppos ani of their pretens or usurp the danger is equal great the princ who have dare in thi manner to rebel against the church over and abov thi crime of rebellion have gener been charg too with the addit crime of heresi notwithstand their solemn protest of their faith and humbl submiss to everi tenet which she thought proper to prescrib to them but the author of religion is superior to everi other author the fear which it suggest conquer all other fear when the author teacher of religion propag through the great bodi of the peopl doctrin subvers of the author of the sovereign it is by violenc onli or by the forc of a stand

peopl which must almost alwai be the case thei ar like to be soon corrupt by those veri doctrin the revolut which the turbul of the greek clergi wa continu occas at constantinopl as long as the eastern empir subsist the convuls which dure the cours of sever centuri the turbul of the roman clergi wa continu occas in everi part of europ suffici demonstr how precari and insecur must alwai be the situat of the sovereign who ha no proper mean of influenc the clergi of the establish and govern religion of hi countri articl of faith as well as all other spiritu matter it is evid enough ar not within the proper depart of a tempor sovereign who though he mai be veri well qualifi for protect is seldom suppos to be so for instruct the peopl with regard to such matter therefor hi author can seldom be suffici to counterbal the unit author of the clergi of the establish church the public tranquil howev and hi own secur mai frequent depend upon the doctrin which thei mai think proper to propag concern such matter as he can seldom directli oppos their decis therefor with proper weight and author it is necessari that he should be abl to influenc it and he can influenc it onli by the fear and expect which he mai excit in the greater part of the individu of the order those fear and expect mai consist in the fear of depriv or other punish and in the expect of further prefer in all christian church the benefic of the clergi ar a sort of freehold which thei enjoi not dure pleasur but dure life or good behaviour if thei held them by a more precari tenur and were liabl to be turn out upon everi slight disoblig either of the sovereign or of hi minist it would perhap be imposs for them to maintain their author with the peopl who would then consid them as mercenari depend upon the court in the sincer of whose instruct thei could no longer have ani confid but should the sovereign attempt irregularli and by violenc to depriv ani number of clergymen of their freehold on account perhap of their have propag with more than ordinari zeal some factiou or sediti doctrin he would onli render by such persecut both them and their doctrin ten time more popular and therefor ten time more troublesom and danger than thei had been befor fear is in almost all case a wretch instrument of govermn and ought in particular never to be emploi against ani order of men who have the smallest pretens to independ to attempt to terrifi them serv onli to irrit their bad humour and to confirm them in an opposit which more gentl usag perhap might easili induc them either to soften or to lai asid altogeth the violenc which the french govern usual emploi in order to oblig all their parliament or sovereign court of justic to enregist ani unpopular edict veri seldom succeed the mean commonli emploi howev the imprison of all the refractori member on would think were forcibl enough the princ of the hous of stuart sometim emploi the like mean in order to influenc some of the member of the parliament of england and thei gener found them equal intract the parliament of england is now manag in anoth manner and a veri small experi which the duke of choiseul made about twelv year ago upon the parliament of pari demonstr suffici that all the parliament of franc might have been manag still more easili in the same manner that experi wa not pursu for though manag and persuas ar alwai the easiest and safest instrument of govern as forc and violenc ar the worst and the most danger yet such it seem is the natur insol of man that he almost alwai disdain to us the good instrument except when he cannot or dare not us the bad on the french govern could and durst us forc and therefor disdain to us manag and persuas but there is no order of men it appear i believ from the experi

despot from that of the gentl and mild govern of pari to that of the violent and furiou govern of constantinopl but though thi order of men can scarc ever be forc thei mai be manag as easili as ani other and the secur of the sovereign as well as the public tranquil seem to depend veri much upon the mean which he ha of manag them and those mean seem to consist altogeth in the prefer which he ha to bestow upon them in the ancient constitut of the christian church the bishop of each dioces wa elect by the joint vote of the clergi and of the peopl of the episcop citi the peopl did not long retain their right of elect and while thei did retain it thei almost alwai act under the influenc of the clergi who in such spiritu matter appear to be their natur guid the clergi howev soon grew weari of the troubl of manag them and found it easier to elect their own bishop themselv the abbot in the same manner wa elect by the monk of the monasteri at least in the greater part of abbaci all the inferior ecclesiast benefic comprehend within the dioces were collat by the bishop who bestow them upon such ecclesiast as he thought proper all church prefer were in thi manner in the dispos of the church the sovereign though he might have some indirect influenc in those elect and though it wa sometim usual to ask both hi consent to elect and hi approb of the elect yet had no direct or suffici mean of manag the clergi the ambit of everi clergyman natur led him to pai court not so much to hi sovereign as to hi own order from which onli he could expect prefer through the greater part of europ the pope gradual drew to himself first the collat of almost all bishopr and abbaci or of what were call consistori benefic and afterward by variou machin and pretenc of the greater part of inferior benefic comprehend within each dioces littl more be left to the bishop than what wa bare necessari to give him a decent author with hi own clergi by thi arrang the condit of the sovereign wa still wors than it had been befor the clergi of all the differ countri of europ were thu form into a sort of spiritu armi dispers in differ quarter inde but of which all the movement and oper could now be direct by on head and conduct upon on uniform plan the clergi of each particular countri might be consid as a particular detach of that armi of which the oper could easili be support and second by all the other detach quarter in the differ countri round about each detach wa not onli independ of the sovereign of the countri in which it wa quarter and by which it wa maintain but depend upon a foreign sovereign who could at ani time turn it arm against the sovereign of that particular countri and support them by the arm of all the other detach those arm were the most formid that can well be imagin in the ancient state of europ befor the establish of art and manufactur the wealth of the clergi gave them the same sort of influenc over the common peopl which that of the great baron gave them over their respect vassal tenant and retain in the great land estat which the mistaken pieti both of princ and privat person had bestow upon the church jurisdict were establish of the same kind with those of the great baron and for the same reason in those great land estat the clergi or their bailiff could easili keep the peac without the support or assist either of the king or of ani other person and neither the king nor ani other person could keep the peac there without the support and assist of the clergi the jurisdict of the clergi therefor in their particular baroni or manor were equal independ and equal exclus of the author of the king court as those of the great tempor lord the tenant of the clergi were like those of the great baron almost all tenant at will entir depend upon their immedi lord and therefor liabl to be call out at pleasur in order to fight in ani quarrel in which the clergi might think proper to engag them over and abov the rent of those estat the clergi possess in the tith a veri larg portion of the rent of all the other estat in everi kingdom of europ the revenu aris from both those speci of rent were the greater part of them paid in kind in corn wine cattl poultri etc the quantiti exceed greatli what the clergi could themselv consum and there were neither art nor manufactur for the produc of which thei could exchang the surplu the clergi could deriv advantag from thi immens surplu in no other wai than by emploi it as the great baron emploi the like surplu of their revenu in the most profus hospit and in the most extens chariti both the hospit and the chariti of the ancient clergi accordingli ar said to have been veri great thei not onli maintain almost the whole poor of everi kingdom but mani knight and gentlemen had frequent no other mean of subsist than by travel about from monasteri to monasteri under pretenc of devot but in realiti to enjoi the hospit of the clergi the retain of some particular prelat were often as numer as those of the greatest laylord and the retain of all the clergi taken togeth were perhap more numer than those of all the laylord there wa alwai much more union among the clergi than among the laylord the former were under a regular disciplin and subordin to the papal author the latter were under no regular disciplin or subordin but almost alwai equal jealou of on anoth and of the king though the tenant and retain of the clergi therefor had both togeth been less numer than those of the great laylord and their tenant were probabl much less numer yet their union would have render them more formid the hospit and chariti of the clergi too not onli gave them the command of a great tempor forc but increas veri much the weight of their spiritu weapon those virtu procur them the highest respect and vener among all the inferior rank of peopl of whom mani were constantli and almost all occasion fed by them everyth belong or relat to so popular an order it possess it privileg it doctrin necessarili appear sacr in the ey of the common peopl and everi violat of them whether real or pretend the highest act of sacrilegi wicked and profan in thi state of thing if the sovereign frequent found it difficult to resist the confederaci of a few of the great nobil we cannot wonder that he should find it still more so to resist the unit forc of the clergi of hi own dominion support by that of the clergi of all the neighbour dominion in such circumst the wonder is not that he wa sometim oblig to yield but that he ever wa abl to resist the privileg of the clergi in those ancient time which to us who live in the present time appear the most absurd their total exempt from the secular jurisdict for exampl or what in england wa call the benefit of clergi were the natur or rather the necessari consequ of thi state of thing how danger must it have been for the sovereign to attempt to punish a clergyman for ani crime whatev if hi order were dispos to protect him and to repres either the proof as insuffici for convict so holi a man or the punish as too sever to be inflict upon on whose person had been render sacr by religion the sovereign could in such circumst do no better than leav him to be tri by the ecclesiast court who for the honour of their own order were interest to restrain as much as possibl everi member of it from commit enorm crime or even from give occas to such gross scandal as might disgust the mind of the peopl in the state in which thing were through the greater part of europ dure the tenth eleventh twelfth and thirteenth centuri and for some time both befor and after that period the constitut of the church of rome mai be consid as the most formid combin that ever wa form against the author and secur of civil govern as well as against the liberti reason and happi of mankind which can flourish onli where civil govern is abl to protect them in that constitut the grossest delus of superstit were support in such a manner by the privat interest of so great a number of peopl as put them out of all danger from ani assault of human reason becaus though human reason might perhap have been abl to unveil even to the ey of the common peopl some of the delus of superstit it could never have dissolv the ti of privat interest had thi constitut been attack by no other enemi but the feebl effort of human reason it must have endur for ever but that immens and wellbuilt fabric which all the wisdom and virtu of man could never have shaken much less have overturn wa by the natur cours of thing first weaken and afterward in part destroi and is now like in the cours of a few centuri more perhap to crumbl into ruin altogeth the gradual improv of art manufactur and commerc the same caus which destroi the power of the great baron destroi in the same manner through the greater part of europ the whole tempor manufactur and commerc the clergi like the great baron found someth for which thei could exchang their rude produc and therebi discov the

import that a veri consider degre of inequ it appear i believ from the experi of all nation is not near so great an evil as a veri small degre of uncertainti everi tax ought to be levi at the time or in the manner in which it is most like to be conveni for the contributor to pai it a tax upon the rent of land or of hous payabl at the same term at which such rent ar usual paid is levi at the time

some landlord instead of a rent in monei requir a rent in kind in corn cattl poultri wine oil etc other again requir a rent in servic such rent ar alwai more hurt to the tenant than benefici to the

chang is like both to discourag cultiv and to give new opportun for abus in the collect of the public revenu which ha fallen veri much below what it wa said to have been when it first fell under the manag of the compani the servant of the compani mai perhap have profit by the chang but at the expens it is probabl both of their master and of the countri tax upon the rent of hous the rent of a hous mai be distinguish into two part of which the on mai veri properli be call the buildingr the other is commonli call the groundrent the buildingr is the interest or profit of the capit expend in build the hous in order to put the trade of a builder upon a level with other trade it is necessari that thi rent should be suffici first to pai him the same interest which he would have got for hi capit if he had lent it upon good secur and secondli to keep the hous in constant repair or what come to the same thing to replac within a certain term of year the capit which had been emploi in build it the buildingr or the ordinari profit of build is therefor everywher regul by the ordinari interest of monei where the market rate of interest is four per cent the rent of a hous which over and abov pai the groundrent afford six or six and ahalf per cent upon the whole expens of build mai perhap afford a suffici profit to the builder where the market rate of interest is five per cent it mai perhap requir seven or seven and a half per cent if in proport to the interest of monei the trade of the builder afford at ani time much greater profit than thi it will soon draw so much capit from other trade as will reduc the profit to it proper level if it afford at ani time much less than thi other trade will soon draw so much capit from it as will again rais that profit whatev part of the whole rent of a hous is over and abov what is suffici for afford thi reason profit natur goe to the groundrent and where the owner of the ground and the owner of the build ar two differ person is in most case complet paid to the former thi surplu rent is the price which the inhabit of the hous pai for some real or suppos advantag of the situat in countri hous at a distanc from ani great town where there is plenti of ground to chuse upon the groundrent is scarc anyth or no more than what the ground which the hous stand upon would pai if emploi in agricultur in countri villa in the neighbourhood of some great town it is sometim a good deal higher and the peculiar conveni or beauti of situat is there frequent veri well paid for groundrent ar gener highest in the capit and in those particular part of it where there happen to be the greatest demand for hous whatev be the reason of that demand whether for trade and busi for pleasur and societi or for mere vaniti and fashion a tax upon houser payabl by the tenant and proport to the whole rent of each hous could not for ani consider time at least affect the buildingr if the builder did not get hi reason profit he would be oblig to quit the trade which by rais the demand for build would in a short time bring back hi profit to it proper level with that of other trade neither would such a tax fall altogeth upon the groundrent but it would divid itself in such a manner as to fall partli upon the inhabit of the hous and partli upon the owner of the ground let us suppos for exampl that a particular person judg that he can afford for houser all expens of sixti pound ayear and let us suppos too that a tax of four shill in the pound or of onefifth payabl by the inhabit is laid upon houser a hous of sixti pound rent will in that case cost him seventytwo pound ayear which is twelv pound more than he think he can afford he will therefor content himself with a wors hous or a hous of fifti pound rent which with the addit ten pound that he must pai for the tax will make up the sum of sixti pound ayear the expens which he judg he can afford and in order to pai the tax he will give up a part of the addit conveni which he might have had from a hous of ten pound ayear more rent he will give up i sai a part of thi addit conveni for he will seldom be oblig to give up the whole but will in consequ of the tax get a better hous for fifti pound ayear than he could have got if there had been no tax for as a tax of thi kind by take awai thi particular competitor must diminish the competit for hous of sixti pound rent so it must likewis diminish it for those of fifti pound rent and in the same manner for those of all other rent except the lowest rent for which it would for some time increas the competit but the rent of everi class of hous for which the competit wa diminish would necessarili be more or less reduc as no part of thi reduct howev could for ani consider time at least affect the buildingr the whole of it must in the longrun necessarili fall upon the groundrent the final payment of thi tax therefor would fall partli upon the inhabit of the hous who in order to pai hi share would be oblig to give up a part of hi conveni and partli upon the owner of the ground who in order to pai hi share would be oblig to give up a part of hi revenu in what proport thi final payment would be divid between them it is not perhap veri easi to ascertain the divis would probabl be veri differ in differ circumst and a tax of thi kind might accord to those differ circumst affect veri unequ both the inhabit of the hous and the owner of the ground the inequ with which a tax of thi kind might fall upon the owner of differ groundrent would aris altogeth from the accident inequ of thi divis but the inequ with which it might fall upon the inhabit of differ hous would aris not onli from thi but from anoth caus the proport of the expens of houser to the whole expens of live is differ in the differ degre of fortun it is perhap highest in the highest degre and it diminish gradual through the inferior degre so as in gener to be lowest in the lowest degre the necessari of life occas the great expens of the poor thei find it difficult to get food and the greater part of their littl revenu is spent in get it the luxuri and vaniti of life occas the princip expens of the rich and a magnific hous embellish and set off to the best advantag all the other luxuri and vaniti which thei possess a tax upon houser therefor would in gener fall heaviest upon the rich and in thi sort of inequ there would not perhap be ani thing veri unreason it is not veri unreason that the rich should contribut to the public expens not onli in proport to their revenu but someth more than in that proport the rent of hous though it in some respect resembl the rent of land is in on respect essenti differ from it the rent of land is paid for the us of a product subject the land which pai it produc it the rent of hous is paid for the us of an unproduct subject neither the hous nor the ground which it stand upon produc anyth the person who pai the rent therefor must draw it from some other sourc of revenu distinct from and independ of thi subject a tax upon the rent of hous so far as it fall upon the inhabit must be drawn from the same sourc as the rent itself and must be paid from their revenu whether deriv from the wage of labour the profit of stock or the rent of land so far as it fall upon the inhabit it is on of those tax which fall not upon on onli but indiffer upon all the three differ sourc of revenu and is in everi respect of the same natur as a tax upon ani other sort of consum commod in gener there is not perhap ani on articl of expens or consumpt by which the liber or narrow of a man whole expens can be better judg of than by hi houser a proport tax upon thi particular articl of expens might perhap produc a more consider revenu than ani which ha hitherto been drawn from it in ani part of europ if the tax inde wa veri high the greater part of peopl would endeavour to evad it as much as thei could by content themselv with smaller hous and by turn the greater part of their expens into some other channel the rent of hous might easili be ascertain with suffici accuraci by a polici of the same kind with that which would be necessari for ascertain the ordinari rent of land hous not inhabit ought to pai no tax a tax upon them would fall altogeth upon the proprietor who would thu be tax for a subject which afford him neither conveni nor revenu hous inhabit by the proprietor ought to be rate not accord to the expens which thei might have cost in build but accord to the rent which an equit arbitr might judg them like to bring if leas to a tenant if rate accord to the expens which thei might have cost in build a tax of three or four shill in the pound join with other tax would ruin almost all the rich and great famili of thi and i believ of everi other civil countri whoever will examin with attent the differ town and countri hous of some of the richest and greatest famili in thi countri will find that at the rate of onli six and ahalf or seven per cent upon the origin expens of build their houser is nearli equal to the whole neat rent of their estat it is the accumul expens of sever success gener laid out upon object of great beauti and magnific inde but in proport to what thei cost of veri small exchang valu sinc the first public of thi book a tax nearli upon the abovement principl ha been impos groundrent ar a still more proper subject of taxat than the rent of hous a tax upon groundrent would not rais the rent of hous it would fall altogeth upon the owner of the groundrent who act alwai as a monopolist and exact the greatest rent which can be got for the us of hi ground more or less can be got for it accord as the competitor happen to be richer or poorer or can afford to gratifi their fanci for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expens in everi countri the greatest number of rich competitor is in the capit and it is there accordingli that the highest groundrent ar alwai to be found as the wealth of those competitor would in no respect be increas by a tax upon groundrent thei would not probabl be dispos to pai more for the us of the ground whether the tax wa to be advanc by the inhabit or by the owner of the ground would be of littl import the more the inhabit wa oblig to pai for the tax the less he would inclin to pai for the ground so that the final payment of the tax would fall altogeth upon the owner of the groundrent the groundrent of uninhabit hous ought to pai no tax both groundrent and the ordinari rent of land ar a speci of revenu which the owner in mani case enjoi without ani care or attent of hi own though a part of thi revenu should be taken from him in order to defrai the expens of the state no discourag will therebi be given to ani sort of industri the annual produc of the land and labour of the societi the real wealth and revenu of the great bodi of the peopl might be the same after such a tax as befor groundrent and the ordinari rent of land ar therefor perhap the speci of revenu which can best bear to have a peculiar tax impos upon them groundrent seem in thi respect a more proper subject of peculiar taxat than even the ordinari rent of land the ordinari rent of land is in mani case ow partli at least to the attent and good manag of the landlord a veri heavi tax might discourag too much thi attent and good manag groundrent so far as thei exce the ordinari rent of land ar altogeth ow to the good govern of the sovereign which by protect the industri either of the whole peopl or of the inhabit of some particular place enabl them to pai so much more than it real valu for the ground which thei build their hous upon or to make to it owner so much more than compens for the loss which he might sustain by thi us of it noth can be more reason than that a fund which ow it exist to the good govern of the state should be tax peculiarli or should contribut someth more than the greater part of other fund toward the support of that govern though in mani differ countri of europ tax have been impos upon the rent of hous i do not know of ani in which groundrent have been consid as a separ subject of taxat the contriv of tax have probabl found some difficulti in ascertain what part of the rent ought to be consid as groundrent and what part ought to be consid as buildingr it should not howev seem veri difficult to distinguish those two part of the rent from on anoth in great britain the rent of hous is suppos to be tax in the same proport as the rent of land by what is call the annual land tax the valuat accord to which each differ parish and district is assess to thi tax is alwai the same it wa origin extrem unequ and it still continu to be so through the greater part of the kingdom thi tax fall still more lightli upon the rent of hous than upon that of land in some few district onli which were origin rate high and in which the rent of hous have fallen consider the land tax of three or four shill in the pound is said to amount to an equal proport of the real rent of hous unten hous though by law subject to the tax ar in most district exempt from it by the favour of the assessor and thi exempt sometim occas some littl variat in the rate of particular hous though that of the district is alwai the same improv of rent by new build repair etc go to the discharg of the district which occas still further variat in the rate of particular hous in the provinc of holland memoir concern le droit etc p everi hous is tax at two and ahalf per cent of it valu without ani regard either to the rent which it actual pai or to the circumst of it be tenant or unten there seem to be a hardship in oblig the proprietor to pai a tax for an unten hous from which he can deriv no revenu especi so veri heavi a tax in holland where the market rate of interest doe not exce three per cent two and ahalf per cent upon the whole valu of the hous must in most case amount to more than a third of the buildingr perhap of the whole rent the valuat inde accord to which the hous ar rate though veri unequ is said to be alwai below the real valu when a hous is rebuilt improv or enlarg there is a new valuat and the tax is rate accordingli the contriv of the sever tax which in england have at differ time been impos upon hous seem to have imagin that there wa some great difficulti in ascertain with toler exact what wa the real rent of everi hous thei have regul their tax therefor accord to some more obviou circumst such as thei had probabl imagin would in most case bear some proport to the rent the first tax of thi kind wa hearthmonei or a tax of two shill upon everi hearth in order to ascertain how mani hearth were in the hous it wa necessari that the taxgather should enter everi room in it thi odiou visit render the tax odiou soon after the revolut therefor it wa abolish as a badg of slaveri the next tax of thi kind wa a tax of two shill upon everi dwellinghous inhabit a hous with ten window to pai four shill more a hous with twenti window and upward to pai eight shill thi tax wa afterward so far alter that hous with twenti window and with less than thirti were order to pai ten shill and those with thirti window and upward to pai twenti shill the number of window can in most case be count from the outsid and in all case without enter everi room in the hous the visit of the taxgather therefor wa less offens in thi tax than in the hearthmonei thi tax wa afterward repeal and in the room of it wa establish the windowtax which ha undergon two sever alter and augment the window tax as it stand at present januari over and abov the duti of three shill upon everi hous in england and of on shill upon everi hous in scotland lai a duti upon everi window which in england augment gradual from twopenc the lowest rate upon hous with not more than seven window to two shill the highest rate upon hous with twentyf window and upward the princip object to all such tax is their inequ an inequ of the worst kind as thei must frequent fall much heavier upon the poor than upon the rich a hous of ten pound rent in a countri town mai sometim have more window than a hous of five hundr pound rent in london and though the inhabit of the former is like to be a much poorer man than that of the latter yet so far as hi contribut is regul by the window tax he must contribut more to the support of the state such tax ar therefor directli contrari to the first of the four maxim abov mention thei do not seem to offend much against ani of the other three the natur tendenc of the window tax and of all other tax upon hous is to lower rent the more a man pai for the tax the less it is evid he can afford to pai for the rent sinc the imposit of the window tax howev the rent of hous have upon the whole risen more or less in almost everi town and villag of great britain with which i am acquaint such ha been almost everywher the increas of the demand for hous that it ha rais the rent more than the window tax could sink them on of the mani proof of the great prosper of the countri and of the increas revenu of it inhabit had it not been for the tax rent would probabl have risen still higher articl iitax upon profit or upon the revenu aris from stock the revenu or profit aris from stock natur divid itself into two part that which pai the interest and which belong to the owner of the stock and that surplu part which is over and abov what is necessari for pai the interest thi latter part of profit is evid a subject not taxabl directli it is the compens and in most case it is no more than a veri moder compens for the risk and troubl of emploi the stock the employ must have thi compens otherwis he cannot consist with hi own interest continu the employ if he wa tax directli therefor in proport to the whole profit he would be oblig either to rais the rate of hi profit or to charg the tax upon the interest of monei that is to pai less interest if he rais the rate of hi profit in proport to the tax the whole tax though it might be advanc by him would be final paid by on or other of two differ set of peopl accord to the differ wai in which he might emploi the stock of which he had the manag if he emploi it as a farm stock in the cultiv of land he could rais the rate of hi profit onli by retain a greater portion or what come to the same thing the price of a greater portion of the produc of the land and as thi could be done onli by a reduct of rent the final payment of the tax would fall upon the landlord if he emploi it as a mercantil or manufactur stock he could rais the rate of hi profit onli by rais the price of hi good in which case the final payment of the tax would fall altogeth upon the consum of those good if he did not rais the rate of hi profit he would be oblig to charg the whole tax upon that part of it which wa allot for the interest of monei he could afford less interest for whatev stock he borrow and the whole weight of the tax would in thi case fall ultim upon the interest of monei so far as he could not reliev himself from the tax in the on wai he would be oblig to reliev himself in the other the interest of monei seem at first sight a subject equal capabl of be tax directli as the rent of land like the rent of land it is a neat produc which remain after complet compens the whole risk and troubl of emploi the stock as a tax upon the rent of land cannot rais rent becaus the neat produc which remain after replac the stock of the farmer togeth with hi reason profit cannot be greater after the tax than befor it so for the same reason a tax upon the interest of monei could not rais the rate of interest the quantiti of stock or monei in the countri like the quantiti of land be suppos to remain the same after the tax as befor it the ordinari rate of profit it ha been shewn in the first book is everywher regul by the quantiti of stock to be emploi in proport to the quantiti of the employ or of the busi which must be done by it but the quantiti of the employ or of the busi to be done by stock could neither be increas nor diminish by ani tax upon the interest of monei if the quantiti of the stock to be emploi therefor wa neither increas nor diminish by it the ordinari rate of profit would necessarili remain the same but the portion of thi profit necessari for compens the risk and troubl of the employ would likewis remain the same that risk and troubl be in no respect alter the residu therefor that portion which belong to the owner of the stock and which pai the interest of monei would necessarili remain the same too at first sight therefor the interest of monei seem to be a subject as fit to be tax directli as the rent of land there ar howev two differ circumst which render the interest of monei a much less proper subject of direct taxat than the rent of land first the quantiti and valu of the land which ani man possess can never be a secret and can alwai be ascertain with great exact but the whole amount of the capit stock which he possess is almost alwai a secret and can scarc ever be ascertain with toler exact it is liabl besid to almost continu variat a year seldom pass awai frequent not a month sometim scarc a singl dai in which it doe not rise or fall more or less an inquisit into everi man privat circumst and an inquisit which in order to accommod the tax to them watch over all the fluctuat of hi fortun would be a sourc of such continu and endless vexat as no person could support secondli land is a subject which cannot be remov wherea stock easili mai the proprietor of land is necessarili a citizen of the particular countri in which hi estat li the proprietor of stock is properli a citizen of the world and is not necessarili attach to ani particular countri he would be apt to abandon the countri in which he wa expos to a vexati inquisit in order to be assess to a burdensom tax and would remov hi stock to some other countri where he could either carri on hi busi or enjoi hi fortun more at hi eas by remov hi stock he would put an end to all the industri which it had maintain in the countri which he left stock cultiv land stock emploi labour a tax which tend to drive awai stock from ani particular countri would so far tend to dry up everi sourc of revenu both to the sovereign and to the societi not onli the profit of stock but the rent of land and the wage of labour would necessarili be more or less diminish by it remov the nation accordingli who have attempt to tax the revenu aris from stock instead of ani sever inquisit of thi kind have been oblig to content themselv with some veri loos and therefor more or less arbitrari estim the extrem inequ and uncertainti of a tax assess in thi manner can be compens onli by it extrem moder in consequ of which everi man find himself rate so veri much below hi real revenu that he give himself littl disturb though hi neighbour should be rate somewhat lower by what is call the land tax in england it wa intend that the stock should be tax in the same proport as land when the tax upon land wa at four shill in the pound or at onefifth of the suppos rent it wa intend that stock should be tax at onefifth of the suppos interest when the present annual land tax wa first impos the legal rate of interest wa six per cent everi hundr pound stock accordingli wa suppos to be tax at twentyfour shill the fifth part of six pound sinc the legal rate of interest ha been reduc to five per cent everi hundr pound stock is suppos to be tax at twenti shill onli the sum to be rais by what is call the land tax wa divid between the countri and the princip town the greater part of it wa laid upon the countri and of what wa laid upon the town the greater part wa assess upon the hous what remain to be assess upon the stock or trade of the town for the stock upon the land wa not meant to be tax wa veri much below the real valu of that stock or trade whatev inequ therefor there might be in the origin assess gave littl disturb everi parish and district still continu to be rate for it land it hous and it stock accord to the origin assess and the almost univers prosper of the countri which in most place ha rais veri much the valu of all these ha render those inequ of still

and the price of provis therefor remain the same a direct tax upon the wage of labour can have no other effect than to rais them somewhat higher than the tax let us suppos for exampl that in a

such a tax might occas in the wage of countri labour would be advanc by the farmer who in order to maintain the same number of labour as befor would be oblig to emploi a greater capit in order to get back thi greater capit togeth with the ordinari profit of stock it would be necessari that he should retain a larger portion or what come to the same thing the price of a larger portion of the produc of the land and consequ that he should pai less rent to the landlord the final payment of thi rise of wage therefor would in thi case fall upon the landlord togeth with the addit profit of the farmer

the silk manufactur in england could greatli undersel those of both franc and itali there would be no occas to prohibit the import of foreign silk and velvet the cheap of their good would secur to our

ought not to be so great as to reduc in ani respect the price of those liquor spirit liquor might remain as dear as ever while at the same time the wholesom and invigor liquor of beer and al might be consider reduc in their price the peopl might thu be in part reliev from on of the burden of which thei at present complain the most while at the same time the revenu might be consider augment the object of dr daven to thi alter in the present system of excis duti seem to be without foundat those object ar that the tax instead of divid itself as at present pretti equal upon the profit of the maltster upon that of the brewer and upon that of the retail would so far as it affect profit fall altogeth upon that of the maltster that the maltster could not so easili get back the amount of the

for ani consider time the rate of profit in ani particular trade which must alwai keep it level with other trade in the neighbourhood the present duti upon malt beer and al do not affect the profit of the dealer in those commod who all get back the tax with an addit profit in the enhanc price of their good a tax inde mai render the good upon which it is impos so dear as to diminish the consumpt of them but the consumpt of malt is in malt liquor and a tax of eighteen shill upon the quarter of malt could not well render those liquor dearer than the differ tax amount to twentyfour or twentyf shill do at present those liquor on the contrari would probabl becom cheaper and the consumpt of them would be more like to increas than to diminish it is not veri easi to understand why it should be more difficult for the maltster to get back eighteen shill in the advanc price of hi malt than it is at present for the brewer to get back twentyfour or twentyf sometim thirti shill in that of hi liquor the maltster inde instead of a tax of six shill would be oblig to advanc on of eighteen shill upon everi quarter of malt but the brewer is at present oblig to advanc a tax of twentyfour or twentyf

maltster doe not alwai keep in hi granari a stock of malt which it will requir a longer time to dispos of than the stock of beer and al which the brewer frequent keep in hi cellar the former therefor mai frequent get the return of hi monei as soon as the latter but whatev inconveni might aris to the maltster from be oblig to advanc a heavier tax it could easili be remedi by grant him a few month longer credit than is at present commonli given to the brewer noth could reduc the rent and profit of barlei land which did not reduc the demand for barlei but a chang of system which reduc the duti upon a quarter of malt brew into beer and al from twentyfour and twentyf shill to eighteen shill would be more like to increas than diminish that demand the rent and profit of barlei land besid must alwai be nearli equal to those of other equal fertil and equal well cultiv land if thei were less some part of the barlei land would soon be turn to some other purpos and if thei were greater more

open a new field for specul of thi kind and the return front those island have of late been as irregular and uncertain as those from the great island of jamaica it is not therefor the poverti of the coloni which occas in the greater part of them the present scarciti of gold and silver monei their great demand for activ and product stock make it conveni for them to have as littl dead stock as possibl and dispos them upon that account to content themselv with a cheaper though less commodi instrument of commerc than gold and silver thei ar therebi enabl to convert the valu of that gold and silver into the instrument of trade into the materi of cloth into household furnitur and into the iron work necessari for build and extend their settlement and plantat in those branch of busi which cannot be transact without gold and silver monei it appear that thei can alwai find the necessari quantiti of those metal and if thei frequent do not find it their failur is gener the effect not of their necessari poverti but of their unnecessari and excess enterpris it is not becaus thei ar poor that their payment ar irregular and uncertain but becaus thei ar too eager to becom excess rich

purchas activ and product stock for dead stock in transact their domest busi thei would be oblig to emploi a costli instead of a cheap instrument of commerc and the expens of purchas thi costli

an aristocraci not found like that of scotland in the natur and respect distinct of birth and fortun but in the most odiou of all distinct those of religi and polit prejudic distinct which more than ani other anim both the insol of the oppressor and the hatr and indign of the oppress and which commonli render the inhabit of the same countri more hostil to on anoth than those of differ countri

point of happi and tranquil gain consider by a union with great britain it would at least deliv them from those rancour and virul faction which ar insepar from small democraci and which have so frequent divid the affect of their peopl and disturb the tranquil of their govern in their form so nearli democrat in the case of a total separ from great britain which unless prevent by a union of thi kind seem veri like to take place those faction would be ten time more virul than ever befor the commenc of the present disturb the coerciv power of the mothercountri had alwai been abl to restrain those faction from break out into ani thing wors than gross brutal and insult if that coerciv power were entir taken awai thei would probabl soon break out into open violenc and bloodsh in all great countri which ar unit under on uniform govern the spirit of parti commonli prevail less in the remot provinc than in the centr of the empir the distanc of those provinc from the capit from

unanim at present unknown in ani part of the british empir both ireland and the coloni inde would be subject to heavier tax than ani which thei at present pai in consequ howev of a dilig and faith applic of the public revenu toward the discharg of the nation debt the greater part of those tax might not be of long continu and the public revenu of great britain might soon be reduc to what wa necessari for maintain a moder peaceestablish the territori acquisit of the east india compani the undoubt right of the crown that is of the state and peopl of great britain might be render anoth sourc of revenu more abund perhap than all those alreadi mention those countri ar repres as more fertil more extens and in proport to their extent much richer and more popul than great britain in order to draw a great revenu from them it would not probabl be necessari to introduc ani new system of taxat into countri which ar alreadi suffici and more than suffici tax it might perhap be more proper to lighten than to aggrav the burden of those unfortun countri and to endeavour to draw a revenu from them not by impos new tax but by prevent the embezzl and misappl of the greater part of those which thei alreadi pai if it should be found impractic for great britain to draw ani consider augment of revenu from ani of the resourc abov mention the onli resourc which can remain to her is a diminut of her expens in the mode of collect and in that of expend the public revenu though in both there mai be still room for improv great britain seem to be at least as econom as ani of her neighbour the militari establish which she maintain for her own defenc in time of peac is more moder than that of ani european state which can pretend to rival her either in wealth or in power none of these articl therefor seem to admit of ani consider reduct of expens the expens of the peaceestablish of the coloni wa befor the commenc of the present disturb veri consider and is an expens which mai and if no revenu can be drawn from them ought certainli to be save altogeth thi constant expens in time of peac though veri great is insignific in comparison with what the defenc of the coloni ha cost us in time of war the last war which wa undertaken altogeth on account of the coloni cost great britain it ha alreadi been observ upward of nineti million the spanish war of wa princip undertaken on their account in which and in the french war that wa the consequ of it great britain spent upward of forti million a great part of which ought justli to be charg to the coloni in those two war the coloni cost great britain much more than doubl the sum which the nation debt amount to befor the commenc of the first of them had it not been for those war that debt might and probabl would by thi time have been complet paid and had it not been for the coloni the former of those war might not and the latter certainli would not have been undertaken it wa becaus the coloni were suppos to be provinc of the british empir that thi expens wa laid out upon them but countri which contribut neither revenu nor militari forc toward the support of the empir cannot be consid as provinc thei mai perhap be consid as appendag as a sort of splendid and shewi equipag of the empir but if the empir can no longer support the expens of keep up thi equipag it ought certainli to lai it down and if it cannot rais it revenu in proport to it expens it ought at least to accommod it expens to it revenu if the coloni notwithstand their refus to submit to british tax ar still to be consid as provinc of the british empir their defenc in some futur war mai cost great britain as great an expens as it ever ha done in ani former war the ruler of great britain have for more than a centuri past amus the peopl with the imagin that thei possess a great empir on the west side of the atlant thi empir howev ha hitherto exist in imagin onli it ha hitherto been not an empir but the project of an empir not a gold mine but the project of a gold mine a project which ha cost which continu to cost and which if pursu in the same wai as it ha been hitherto is like to cost immens expens without be like to bring ani profit for the effect of the monopoli of the coloni trade it ha been shewn ar to the great bodi of the peopl mere loss instead of profit it is sure now time that our ruler should either realiz thi golden dream in which thei have been indulg themselv perhap as well as the peopl or that thei should awak from it themselv and endeavour to awaken the peopl if the project cannot be complet it ought to be given up if ani of the provinc of the british empir cannot be made to contribut toward the support of the whole empir it is sure time that great britain should free herself from the expens of defend those provinc in time of war and of support ani part of their civil or militari establish in time of peac and endeavour to accommod her futur view and design to the real mediocr of her circumst
