fend for what he meant to do with it and whether he were mad the master tri to explain the matter but he wa realli half dead with fatigu and all that i could make out amongst her scold wa a tale of hi see it starv and houseless and as good as dumb in the street of liverpool where he pick it up and inquir for it owner not a soul knew to whom it belong he said and hi monei and time be both limit he thought it better to take it home with him at onc than run into vain expens there becaus he wa determin he would not leav it as he found it well the conclus wa that my mistress grumbl herself calm and mr earnshaw told me to wash it and give it clean thing and let it sleep with the children hindlei and cathi content themselv with look and listen till peac wa restor then both began search their

refus to have it in bed with them or even in their room and i had no more sens so i put it on the land of the stair hope it might be gone on the morrow by chanc or els attract by hear hi voic it crept to mr earnshaw door and there he found it on quit hi chamber inquiri were made as to how it got there i wa oblig to confess and in recompens for my cowardic and inhuman wa sent out of the hous thi wa heathcliff first introduct to the famili on come back a few dai afterward for i did not consid my banish perpetu i found thei had christen him heathcliff it wa the name of a son who di in childhood and it ha serv him ever sinc both for christian and surnam miss cathi and he were now veri thick but hindlei hate him and to sai the truth i did the same and we plagu and went on with him shamefulli for i wasnt reason enough to feel my injustic and the mistress never put in a word on hi behalf when she saw him wrong he seem a sullen patient child harden perhap to illtreat he would stand hindlei blow without wink or shed a tear and my pinch move him onli to draw in a breath and open hi ey as if he had hurt himself by accid and nobodi wa to blame thi endur made old earnshaw furiou when he discov hi son persecut the poor fatherless child as he call him he took to heathcliff strang believ all he said for that matter he said preciou littl and gener the truth and pet him up far abov cathi who wa too mischiev and wayward for a favourit so from the veri begin he bred bad feel in the hous and at mr earnshaw death which happen in less than two year after the young master had learn to regard hi father as an oppressor rather than a friend and heathcliff as a usurp of hi parent affect and hi privileg and he grew bitter with brood over these injuri i sympathis a while but when the children fell ill of the measl and i had to tend them and take on me the care of a woman at onc i chang my idea heathcliff wa danger sick and while he lai at the worst he would have me constantli by hi pillow i suppos he felt i did a good deal for him and he hadnt wit to guess that i wa compel to do it howev i will sai thi he wa the quietest child that ever nurs watch over the differ between him and the other forc me to be less partial cathi and her brother harass me terribl he wa as uncomplain as a lamb though hard not gentl made him give littl troubl he got through and the doctor affirm it wa in a great measur ow to me and prais me for my care i wa vain of hi commend and soften toward the be by whose mean i earn them and thu hindlei lost hi last alli still i couldnt dote on heathcliff and i wonder often what my master saw to admir so much in the sullen boi who never to my recollect repaid hi indulg by ani sign of gratitud he wa not insol to hi benefactor he wa simpli insens though know perfectli the hold he had on hi heart and consciou he had onli to speak and all the hous would be oblig to bend to hi wish as an instanc i rememb mr earnshaw onc bought a coupl of colt at the parish fair and gave the lad each on heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discov it he said to hindlei you must exchang hors with me i dont like mine and if you wont i shall tell your father of the three thrash youv given me thi week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder hindlei put out hi tongu and cuf him over the ear youd better do it at onc he persist escap to the porch thei were in the stabl you will have to and if i speak of these blow youll get them again with interest off dog cri hindlei threaten him with an iron weight us for weigh potato and hai throw it he repli stand still and then ill tell how you boast that you would turn me out of door as soon as he di and see whether he will not turn you out directli hindlei threw it hit him on the breast and down he fell but stagger up immedi breathless and white and had not i prevent it he would have gone just so to the master and got full reveng by let hi condit plead for him intim who had caus it take my colt gipsi then said young earnshaw and i prai that he mai break your neck take him and be damn you beggarli interlop and wheedl my father out of all he ha onli afterward show him what you ar imp of satanand take that i hope hell kick out your brain heathcliff had gone to loos the beast and shift it to hi own stall he wa pass behind it when hindlei finish hi speech by knock him under it feet and without stop to examin whether hi hope were fulfil ran awai as fast as he could i wa surpris to wit how coolli the child gather himself up and went on with hi intent exchang saddl and all and then sit down on a bundl of hai to overcom the qualm which the violent blow occas befor he enter the hous i persuad him easili to let me lai the blame of hi bruis on the hors he mind littl what tale wa told sinc he had what he want he complain so seldom inde of such stir as these that i realli thought him not vindict i wa deceiv complet as you will hear chapter v in the cours of time mr earnshaw began to fail he had been activ and healthi yet hi strength left him suddenli and when he wa confin to the chimneycorn he grew grievous irrit a noth vex him and suspect slight of hi author nearli threw him into fit thi wa especi to be remark if ani on attempt to impos upon or domin over hi favourit he wa painfulli jealou lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seem to have got into hi head the notion that becaus he like heathcliff all hate and long to do him an illturn it wa a disadvantag to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humour hi partial and that humour wa rich nourish to the child pride and black temper still it becam in a manner necessari twice or thrice hindlei manifest of scorn while hi father wa near rous the old man to a furi he seiz hi stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it at last our curat we had a curat then who made the live answer by teach the littl linton and earnshaw and farm hi bit of land himself advis that the young man should be sent to colleg and mr earnshaw agre though with a heavi spirit for he saidhindlei wa nought and would never thrive as where he wander i hope heartili we should have peac now it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfort by hi own good deed i fanci the discont of ag and diseas aros from hi famili disagr as he would have it that it did realli you know sir it wa in hi sink frame we might have got on toler notwithstand but for two peoplemiss cathi and joseph the servant you saw him i daresai up yonder he wa and is yet most like the wearisomest selfright pharise that ever ransack a bibl to rake the promis to himself and fling the curs to hi neighbour by hi knack of sermonis and piou discours he contriv to make a great impress on mr earnshaw and the more feebl the master becam the more influenc he gain he wa relentless in worri him about hi soul concern and about rule hi children rigidli he encourag him to regard hindlei as a reprob and night after night he regularli grumbl out a long string of tale against heathcliff and catherin alwai mind to flatter earnshaw weak by heap the heaviest blame on the latter certainli she had wai with her such as i never saw a child take up befor and she put all of us past our patienc fifti time and often in a dai from the hour she came downstair till the hour she went to bed we had not a minut secur that she wouldnt be in mischief her spirit were alwai at highwat mark her tongu alwai goingsing laugh and plagu everybodi who would not do the same a wild wick slip she wasbut she had the bonniest ey the sweetest smile and lightest foot in the parish and after all i believ she meant no harm for when onc she made you cry in good earnest it seldom happen that she would not keep you compani and oblig you to be quiet that you might comfort her she wa much too fond of heathcliff the greatest punish we could invent for her wa to keep her separ from him yet she got chide more than ani of us on hi account in plai she like exceedingli to act the littl mistress us her hand freeli and command her companion she did so to me but i would not bear slap and order and so i let her know now mr earnshaw did not understand joke from hi children he had alwai been strict and grave with them and catherin on her part had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in hi ail condit than he wa in hi prime hi peevish reproof waken in her a naughti delight to provok him she wa never so happi as when we were all scold her at onc and she defi us with her bold sauci look and her readi word turn joseph religi curs into ridicul bait me and do just what her father hate mostshow how her pretend insol which he thought real had more power over heathcliff than hi kind how the boi would do her bid in anyth and hi onli when it suit hi own inclin after behav as badli as possibl all dai she sometim came fondl to make it up at night nai cathi the old man would sai i cannot

under other and favour circumst mr heathcliff i believ had not treat him physic ill thank to hi fearless natur which offer no temptat to that cours of oppress he had none of the timid suscept that

keeper never led a singl step toward virtu or guard by a singl precept against vice and from what i heard joseph contribut much to hi deterior by a narrowmind partial which prompt him to flatter and pet him as a boi becaus he wa the head of the old famili and as he had been in the habit of accus catherin earnshaw and heathcliff when children of put the master past hi patienc and compel him to seek solac in drink by what he term their offald wai so at present he laid the whole burden of hareton fault on the shoulder of the usurp of hi properti if the lad swore he wouldnt correct him nor howev culpabl he behav it gave joseph satisfact appar to watch him go the worst length he allow that the lad wa ruin that hi soul wa abandon to perdit but then he reflect that heathcliff must answer for it hareton blood would be requir at hi hand and there lai immens consol in that thought joseph had instil into him a pride of name and of hi lineag he would had he dare have foster hate between

or bad and he is yet thi howev is not make progress with my stori miss cathi reject the peaceoff of the terrier and demand her own dog charli and phoenix thei came limp and hang their head and we set out for home sadli out of sort everi on of us i could not wring from my littl ladi how she had spent the dai except that as i suppos the goal of her pilgrimag wa peniston crag and she arriv without adventur to the gate of the farmhous when hareton happen to issu forth attend by some canin follow who attack her train thei had a smart battl befor their owner could separ them that form an introduct catherin told hareton who she wa and where she wa go and ask him to show her the wai final beguil him to accompani her he open the mysteri of the fairi cave and twenti other queer place but be in disgrac i wa not favour with a descript of the interest object she saw i could gather howev that her guid had been a favourit till she hurt hi feel by address him as a servant and heathcliff housekeep hurt her by call him her cousin then the languag he had held to her rankl in her heart she who wa alwai love and darl and queen and angel with everybodi at the grang to be insult so shockingli by a

advanc for the lad she didnt thank him still he felt gratifi that she had accept hi assist and ventur to stand behind as she examin them and even to stoop and point out what struck hi fanci in certain old pictur which thei contain nor wa he daunt by the sauci style in which she jerk the page from hi finger he content himself with go a bit farther back and look at her instead of the book she continu read or seek for someth to read hi attent becam by degre quit centr in the studi of her thick silki curl her face he couldnt see and she couldnt see him and perhap not quit awak to what he did but

restrain himself from hi sundai occup no longer he talk now freeli enough and she present saw fit to retreat to her solitud but the frost had set in and in spite of her pride she wa forc to condescend to our compani more and more howev i took care there should be no further scorn at my good natur ever sinc iv been as stiff as herself and she ha no lover or liker among us and she doe not deserv on for let them sai the least word to her and shell curl back without respect of ani on shell snap at the master himself and as good as dare him to thrash her and the more hurt she get the more venom she grow at first on hear thi account from zillah i determin to leav my situat take a cottag and get catherin to come and live with me but mr heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up

oclock i deem it proper though unsummon to carri a candl and hi supper to him he wa lean against the ledg of an open lattic but not look out hi face wa turn to the interior gloom the fire had smoulder to ash the room wa fill with the damp mild air of the cloudi even and so still that not onli the murmur of the beck down gimmerton wa distinguish but it rippl and it gurgl over the pebbl or through the larg stone which it could not cover i utter an ejacul of discont at see the dismal grate and commenc shut the casement on after anoth till i came to hi must i close thi i ask in order to rous him

the candl horizont be quick and bring anoth i hurri out in a foolish state of dread and said to josephth master wish you to take him a light and rekindl the fire for i dare not go in myself again just then joseph rattl some fire into the shovel and went but he brought it back immedi with the suppertrai in hi other hand explain that mr heathcliff wa go to bed and he want noth to eat till morn we heard him mount the stair directli he did not proce to hi ordinari chamber but turn into that with the panel bed it window as i mention befor is wide enough for anybodi to get through and it struck me that he plot anoth midnight excurs of which he had rather we had no suspicion is he a ghoul or a vampir i muse i had read of such hideou incarn demon and then i set myself to reflect how i had tend him in infanc and watch him grow to youth and follow him almost through hi whole cours and what absurd nonsens it wa to yield to that sens of horror but where did he come from the littl dark thing harbour by a good man to hi bane mutter superstit as i doze into unconsci and i began half dream to weari myself with imagin some fit parentag for him and repeat my wake medit i track hi exist over

matter discuss but he spoke rapidli and turn hi head continu asid and had the same excit express even more exagger when joseph quit the room he took hi seat in the place he gener chose and i put a basin of coffe befor him he drew it nearer and then rest hi arm on the tabl and look at the opposit wall as i suppos survei on particular portion up and down with glitter restless ey and with such eager interest that he stop breath dure half a minut togeth come now i exclaim push some bread against hi hand eat and drink that while it is hot it ha been wait near an hour he didnt notic me and yet

and tell me ar we by ourselv of cours wa my answer of cours we ar still i involuntarili obei him as if i wa not quit sure with a sweep of hi hand he clear a vacant space in front among the breakfast thing and leant forward to gaze more at hi eas now i perceiv he wa not look at the wall for when i regard him alon it seem exactli that he gaze at someth within two yard distanc and whatev it wa it commun appar both pleasur and pain in exquisit extrem at least the anguish yet raptur express of hi counten suggest that idea the fanci object wa not fix either hi ey pursu it with unweari dilig and even in speak to me were never wean awai i vainli remind him of hi protract abstin from food if he stir to touch anyth in complianc with my entreati if he stretch hi hand out to get a piec of bread hi finger clench befor thei reach it and remain on the tabl forget of their aim i sat a model of patienc try to attract hi absorb attent from it engross specul till he grew irrit and got up ask why i would not allow him to have hi own time in take hi meal and sai that on the next occas i neednt wait i might set the thing down and go have utter these word he left the hous slowli saunter down the garden path and disappear through the gate the hour crept anxious by anoth even came i did not retir to rest till late and when i did i could not sleep he return after midnight and instead of go to bed shut himself into the room beneath i listen and toss about and final dress and descend it wa too irksom to lie there harass my brain with a hundr idl misgiv i distinguish mr heathcliff step restlessli measur the floor and he frequent broke the silenc by a deep inspir resembl a groan he mutter detach word also the onli on i could catch wa the name of catherin coupl with some wild term of
