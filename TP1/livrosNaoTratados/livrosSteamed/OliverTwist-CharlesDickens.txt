that we shall have extrem difficulti in get to the bottom of thi mysteri unless we can bring thi man monk upon hi knee that can onli be done by stratagem and by catch him when he is not surround by these peopl for suppos he were apprehend we have no proof against him he is not even so far as we know or as the fact appear to us concern with the gang in ani of their robberi if he were not discharg it is veri unlik that he could receiv ani further punish than be commit to prison as a rogu and vagabond and of cours ever afterward hi mouth would be so obstin close that he might as well for our

kindest intent but realli do not discuss the point my dear young ladi prai said mr brownlow interrupt rose as she wa about to speak the promis shall be kept i dont think it will in the slightest degre interfer with our proceed but befor we can resolv upon ani precis cours of action it will be necessari to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out thi monk on the understand that
