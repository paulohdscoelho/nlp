i came to myself and becam convalesc i wa so weak and emaci that a medic board determin that not a dai should be lost in send me back to england i wa dispatch accordingli in the troopship oront and land a month later on portsmouth jetti with my health irretriev ruin but with permiss from a patern govern to spend the next nine month in attempt to improv it i had neither kith nor kin in england and wa therefor as free as airor as free as an incom of eleven shill and sixpenc a dai will permit a man to be under such circumst i natur gravit to london that great cesspool into which all the lounger and idler of the empir ar irresist drain there i stai for some time at a privat hotel in the strand lead a comfortless meaningless exist and spend such monei as i had consider more freeli than i ought so alarm did the state of my financ becom that i soon realiz that i must either leav the metropoli and rustic somewher in the countri or that i must make a complet alter in my style of live choos the latter altern i began by make up my mind to leav the hotel and to take up my quarter in some less pretenti and less expens domicil on the veri dai that i had come to thi conclus i wa stand at the criterion bar when some on tap me on the shoulder and turn round i recogn young stamford who had been a dresser under me at bart the sight of a friendli face in the great wilder of london is a pleasant thing inde to a lone man in old dai stamford had never been a particular croni of mine but now i hail him with enthusiasm and he in hi turn appear to be delight to see me in the exuber of my joi i ask him to lunch with me at the holborn and we start off togeth in a hansom whatev have you been do with yourself watson he ask in undisguis wonder as we rattl through the crowd london street you ar as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut i gave him a short sketch of my adventur and had hardli conclud it by the time that we reach our destin poor devil he said commiseratingli after he had listen to my misfortun what ar you up to now look for lodg i answer try to solv the problem as to whether it is possibl to get comfort room at a reason price that s a strang thing remark my companion you ar the second man todai that ha us that express to me and who wa the first i ask a fellow who is work at the chemic laboratori up at the hospit he wa bemoan himself thi morn becaus he could not get someon to go halv with him in some nice room which he had found and which were too much for hi purs by jove i cri if he realli want someon to share the room and the expens i am the veri man for him i should prefer have a partner to be alon young stamford look rather strang at me over hi wineglass you don t know sherlock holm yet he said perhap you would not care for him as a constant companion why what is there against him oh i didn t sai there wa anyth against him he is a littl queer in hi ideasan enthusiast in some branch of scienc as far as i know he is a decent fellow enough a medic student i suppos said i noi have no idea what he intend to go in for i believ he is well up in anatomi and he is a firstclass chemist but as far as i know he ha never taken out ani systemat medic class hi studi ar veri desultori and eccentr but he ha amass a lot of outofth wai knowledg which would astonish hi professor did you never ask him what he wa go in for i ask no he is not a man that it is easi to draw out though he can be commun enough when the fanci seiz him i should like to meet him i said if i am to lodg with anyon i should prefer a man of studiou and quiet habit i am not strong enough yet to stand much nois or excit i had enough of both in afghanistan to last me for the remaind of my natur exist how could i meet thi friend of your he is sure to be at the laboratori return my companion he either avoid the place for week or els he work there from morn to night if you like we shall drive round togeth after luncheon certainli i answer and the convers drift awai into other channel as we made our wai to the hospit after leav the holborn stamford gave me a few more particular about the gentleman whom i propos to take as a fellowlodg you mustn t blame me if you don t get on with him he said i know noth more of him than i have learn from meet him occasion in the laboratori you propos thi arrang so you must not hold me respons if we don t get on it will be easi to part compani i answer it seem to me stamford i ad look hard at my companion that you have some reason for wash your hand of the matter is thi fellow s temper so formid or what is it don t be mealymouth about it it is not easi to express the inexpress he answer with a laugh holm is a littl too scientif for my tastesit approach to coldblooded i could imagin hi give a friend a littl pinch of the latest veget alkaloid not out of malevol you understand but simpli out of a spirit of inquiri in order to have an accur idea of the effect to do him justic i think that he would take it himself with the same readi he appear to have a passion for definit and exact knowledg veri right too ye but it mai be push to excess when it come to beat the subject in the dissectingroom with a stick it is certainli take rather a bizarr shape beat the subject ye to verifi how far bruis mai be produc after death i saw him at it with my own ey and yet you sai he is not a medic student no heaven know what the object of hi studi ar but here we ar and you must form your own impress about him as he spoke we turn down a narrow lane and pass through a small sidedoor which open into a wing of the great hospit it wa familiar ground to me and i need no guid as we ascend the bleak stone staircas and made our wai down the long corridor with it vista of whitewash wall and duncolour door near the further end a low arch passag branch awai from it and led to the chemic laboratori thi wa a lofti chamber line and litter with countless bottl broad low tabl were scatter about which bristl with retort testtub and littl bunsen lamp with their blue flicker flame there wa onli on student in the room who wa bend over a distant tabl absorb in hi work at the sound of our step he glanc round and sprang to hi feet with a cry of pleasur i ve found it i ve found it he shout to my companion run toward us with a testtub in hi hand i have found a reagent which is precipit by hoemoglobin and by noth els had he discov a gold mine greater delight could not have shone upon hi featur dr watson mr sherlock holm said stamford introduc us how ar you he said cordial grip my hand with a strength for which i should hardli have given him credit you have been in afghanistan i perceiv how on earth did you know that i ask in astonish never mind said he chuckl to himself the question now is about hoemoglobin no doubt you see the signific of thi discoveri of mine it is interest chemic no doubt i answer but practic why man it is the most practic medicoleg discoveri for year don t you see that it give us an infal test for blood stain come over here now he seiz me by the coatsleev in hi eager and drew me over to the tabl at which he had been work let us have some fresh blood he said dig a long bodkin into hi finger and draw off the result drop of blood in a chemic pipett now i add thi small quantiti of blood to a litr of water you perceiv that the result mixtur ha the appear of pure water the proport of blood cannot be more than on in a million i have no doubt howev that we shall be abl to obtain the characterist reaction as he spoke he threw into the vessel a few white crystal and then ad some drop of a transpar fluid in an instant the content assum a dull mahogani colour and a brownish dust wa precipit to the bottom of the glass jar ha ha he cri clap hi hand and look as delight as a child with a new toi what do you think of that it seem to be a veri delic test i remark beauti beauti the old guiacum test wa veri clumsi and uncertain so is the microscop examin for blood corpuscl the latter is valueless if the stain ar a few hour old now thi appear to act as well whether the blood is old or new had thi test been invent there ar hundr of men now walk the earth who would long ago have paid the penalti of their crime inde i murmur crimin case ar continu hing upon that on point a man is suspect of a crime month perhap after it ha been commit hi linen or cloth ar examin and brownish stain discov upon them ar thei blood stain or mud stain or rust stain or fruit stain or what ar thei that is a question which ha puzzl mani an expert and why becaus there wa no reliabl test now we have the sherlock holm test and there will no longer be ani difficulti hi ey fairli glitter as he spoke and he put hi hand over hi heart and bow as if to some applaud crowd conjur up by hi imagin you ar to be congratul i remark consider surpris at hi enthusiasm there wa the case of von bischoff at frankfort last year he would certainli have been hung had thi test been in exist then there wa mason of bradford and the notori muller and lefevr of montpelli and samson of new orlean i could name a score of case in which it would have been decis you seem to be a walk calendar of crime said stamford with a laugh you might start a paper on those line call it the polic new of the past veri interest read it might be made too remark sherlock holm stick a small piec of plaster over the prick on hi finger i have to be care he continu turn to me with a smile for i dabbl with poison a good deal he held out hi hand as he spoke and i notic that it wa all mottl over with similar piec of plaster and discolour with strong acid we came here on busi said stamford sit down on a high threeleg stool and push anoth on in my direct with hi foot my friend here want to take dig and as you were complain that you could get no on to go halv with you i thought that i had better bring you togeth sherlock holm seem delight at the idea of share hi room with me i have my ey on a suit in baker

includ violinplai in your categori of row he ask anxious it depend on the player i answer a wellplai violin is a treat for the godsa badlyplai on oh that s all right he cri with a merri laugh i think we mai consid the thing as settledthat is if the room ar agreeabl to you when shall we see them call for me here at noon tomorrow and we ll go togeth and settl everyth he answer all rightnoon exactli said i shake hi hand we left him work among hi chemic and we walk togeth toward my hotel by the wai i ask suddenli stop and turn upon stamford how the deuc did he know that i had come from afghanistan my companion smile an enigmat smile that s just hi littl peculiar he said a good mani peopl have want to know how he find thing out oh a mysteri is it i cri rub my hand thi is veri piquant i am much oblig to you for bring us togeth the proper studi of mankind is man you know you must studi him then stamford said as he bade me goodby you ll find him a knotti problem though i ll wager he learn more about you than you about him goodby goodby i answer and stroll on to my hotel consider interest in my new acquaint chapter ii the scienc of deduct we met next dai as he had arrang and inspect the room at no b baker street of which he had spoken at our meet thei consist of a coupl of comfort bedroom and a singl larg airi sittingroom cheerfulli furnish and illumin by two broad window so desir in everi wai were the apart and so moder did the term seem when divid between us that the bargain wa conclud upon the spot and we at onc enter into possess that veri even i move my thing round from the hotel and on the follow morn sherlock holm follow me with sever box and portmanteau for a dai or two we were busili emploi in unpack and lai out our properti to the best advantag that done we gradual began to settl down and to accommod ourselv to our new surround holm wa certainli not a difficult man to live with he wa quiet in hi wai and hi habit were regular it wa rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invari breakfast and gone out befor i rose in the morn sometim he spent hi dai at the chemic laboratori sometim in the dissectingroom and occasion in long walk which appear to take him into the lowest portion of the citi noth could exce hi energi when the work fit wa upon him but now and again a reaction would seiz him and for dai on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sittingroom hardli utter a word or move a muscl from morn to night on these occas i have notic such a dreami vacant express in hi ey that i might have suspect him of be addict to the us of some narcot had not the temper and cleanli of hi whole life forbidden such a notion as the week went by my interest in him and my curios as to hi aim in life gradual deepen and increas hi veri person and appear were such as to strike the attent of the most casual observ in height he wa rather over six feet and so excess lean that he seem to be consider taller hi ey were sharp and pierc save dure those interv of torpor to which i have allud and hi thin hawklik nose gave hi whole express an air of alert and decis hi chin too had the promin and squar which mark the man of determin hi hand were invari blot with ink and stain with chemic yet he wa possess of extraordinari delicaci of touch as i frequent had occas to observ when i watch him manipul hi fragil philosoph instrument the reader mai set me down as a hopeless busybodi when i confess how much thi man stimul my curios and how often i endeavour to break through the retic which he show on all that concern himself befor pronounc judgment howev be it rememb how objectless wa my life and how littl there wa to engag my attent my health forbad me from ventur out unless the weather wa exception genial and i had no friend who would call upon me and break the monotoni of my daili exist under these circumst i eagerli hail the littl mysteri which hung around my companion and spent much of my time in endeavour to unravel it he wa not studi medicin he had himself in repli to a question confirm stamford s opinion upon that point neither did he appear to have pursu ani cours of read which might fit him for a degre in scienc or ani other recogn portal which would give him an entranc into the learn world yet hi zeal for certain studi wa remark and within eccentr limit hi knowledg wa so extraordinarili ampl and minut that hi observ have fairli astound me sure no man would work so hard or attain such precis inform unless he had some definit end in view desultori reader ar seldom remark for the exact of their learn no man burden hi mind with small matter unless he ha some veri good reason for do so hi ignor wa as remark as hi knowledg of contemporari literatur philosophi and polit he appear to know next to noth upon my quot thoma carlyl he inquir in the naivest wai who he might be and what he had done my surpris reach a climax howev when i found incident that he wa ignor of the copernican theori and of the composit of the solar system that ani civil human be in thi nineteenth centuri should not be awar that the earth travel round the sun appear to be to me such an extraordinari fact that i could hardli realiz it you appear to be astonish he said smile at my express of surpris now that i do know it i shall do my best to forget it to forget it you see he explain i consid that a man s brain origin is like a littl empti attic and you have to stock it with such furnitur as you choos a fool take in all the lumber of everi sort that he come across so that the knowledg which might be us to him get crowd out or at best is jumbl up with a lot of other thing so that he ha a difficulti in lai hi hand upon it now the skil workman is veri care inde as to what he take into hi brainatt he will have noth but the tool which mai help him in do hi work but of these he ha a larg assort and all in the most perfect order it is a mistak to think that that littl room ha elast wall and can distend to ani extent depend upon it there come a time when for everi addit of knowledg you forget someth that you knew befor it is of the highest import therefor not to have useless fact elbow out the us on but the solar system i protest what the deuc is it to me he interrupt impati you sai that we go round the sun if we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of differ to me or to my work i wa on the point of ask him what that work might be but someth in hi manner show me that the question would be an unwelcom on i ponder over our short convers howev and endeavour to draw my deduct from it he said that he would acquir no knowledg which did not bear upon hi object therefor all the knowledg which he possess wa such as would be us to him i enumer in my own mind all the variou point upon which he had shown me that he wa exception wellinform i even took a pencil and jot them down i could not help smile at the document when i had complet it it ran in thi wai sherlock holmeshi limit knowledg of literaturenil

far in my list i threw it into the fire in despair if i can onli find what the fellow is drive at by reconcil all these accomplish and discov a call which need them all i said to myself i mai as well give up the attempt at onc i see that i have allud abov to hi power upon the violin these were veri remark but as eccentr as all hi other accomplish that he could plai piec and difficult piec i knew well becaus at my request he ha plai me some of mendelssohn s lieder and other favourit when left to himself howev he would seldom produc ani music or attempt ani recogn air lean back in hi armchair of an even he would close hi ey and scrape carelessli at the fiddl which wa thrown across hi knee sometim the chord were sonor and melancholi occasion thei were fantast and cheer clearli thei reflect the thought which possess him but whether the music aid those thought or whether the plai wa simpli the result of a whim or fanci wa more than i could determin i might have rebel against these exasper solo had it not been that he usual termin them by plai in quick success a whole seri of my favourit air as a slight compens for the trial upon my patienc dure the first week or so we had no caller and i had begun to think that my companion wa as friendless a man as i wa myself present howev i found that he had mani acquaint and those in the most differ class of societi there wa on littl sallow ratfac darkei fellow who wa introduc to me as mr lestrad and who came three or four time in a singl week on morn a young girl call fashion dress and stai for half an hour or more the same afternoon brought a greyhead seedi visitor look like a jew pedlar who appear to me to be much excit and who wa close follow by a slipshod elderli woman on anoth occas an old whitehair gentleman had an interview with my companion and on anoth a railwai porter in hi velveteen uniform when ani of these nondescript individu put in an appear sherlock holm us to beg for the us of the sittingroom and i would retir to my bedroom he alwai apolog to me for put me to thi inconveni i have to us thi room as a place of busi he said and these peopl ar my client again i had an opportun of ask him a point blank question and again my delicaci prevent me from forc anoth man to confid in me i imagin at the time that he had some strong reason for not allud to it but he soon dispel the idea by come round to the subject of hi own accord it wa upon the th of march as i have good reason to rememb that i rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that sherlock holm had not yet finish hi breakfast the landladi had becom so accustom to my late habit that my place had not been laid nor my coffe prepar with the unreason petul of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intim that i wa readi then i pick up a magazin from the tabl and attempt to while awai the time with it while my companion munch silent at hi toast on of the articl had a pencil mark at the head and i natur began to run my ey through it it somewhat ambiti titl wa the book of life and it attempt to show how much an observ man might learn by an accur and systemat examin of all that came in hi wai it struck me as be a remark mixtur of shrewd and of absurd the reason wa close and intens but the deduct appear to me to be farfetch and exagger the writer claim by a momentari express a twitch of a muscl or a glanc of an ey to fathom a man s inmost thought deceit accord to him wa an imposs in the case of on train to observ and analysi hi conclus were as infal as so mani proposit of euclid so startl would hi result appear to the uniniti that until thei learn the process by which he had arriv at them thei might well consid him as a necromanc from a drop of water said the writer a logician could infer the possibl of an atlant or a niagara without have seen or heard of on or the other so all life is a great chain the natur of which is known whenev we ar shown a singl link of it like all other art the scienc of deduct and analysi is on which can onli be acquir by long and patient studi nor is life long enough to allow ani mortal to attain the highest possibl perfect in it befor turn to those moral and mental aspect of the matter which present the greatest difficulti let the enquir begin by master more elementari problem let him on meet a fellowmort learn at a glanc to distinguish the histori of the man and the trade or profess to which he belong pueril as such an exercis mai seem it sharpen the faculti of observ and teach on where to look and what to look for by a man s finger nail by hi coatsleev by hi boot by hi trouser knee by the callos of hi forefing and thumb by hi express by hi shirt cuffsbi each of these thing a man s call is plainli reveal that all unit should fail to enlighten the compet enquir in ani case is almost inconceiv what ineff twaddl i cri slap the magazin down on the tabl i never read such rubbish in my life what is it ask sherlock holm why thi articl i said point at it with my egg spoon as i sat down to my breakfast i see that you have read it sinc you have mark it i don t deni that it is smartli written it irrit me though it is evid the theori of some armchair lounger who evolv all these neat littl paradox in the seclus of hi own studi it is not practic i should like to see him clap down in a third class carriag on the underground and ask to give the trade of all hi fellowtravel i would lai a thousand to on against him you would lose your monei sherlock holm remark calmli as for the articl i wrote it myself you ye i have a turn both for observ and for deduct the theori which i have express there and which appear to you to be so chimer ar realli extrem practicalso practic that i depend upon them for my bread and chees and how i ask involuntarili well i have a trade of my own i suppos i am the onli on in the world i m a consult detect if you can understand what that is here in london we have lot of govern detect and lot of privat on when these fellow ar at fault thei come to me and i manag to put them on the right scent thei lai all the evid befor me and i am gener abl by the help of my knowledg of the histori of crime to set them straight there is a strong famili resembl about misde and if you have all the detail of a thousand at your finger end it is odd if you can t unravel the thousand and first lestrad is a wellknown detect he got himself into a fog recent over a forgeri case and that wa what brought him here and these other peopl thei ar mostli sent on by privat inquiri agenc thei ar all peopl who ar in troubl about someth and want a littl enlighten i listen to their stori thei listen to my comment and then i pocket my fee but do you mean to sai i said that without leav your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make noth of although thei have seen everi detail for themselv quit so i have a kind of intuit that wai now and again a case turn up which is a littl more complex then i have to bustl about and see thing with my own ey you see i have a lot of special knowledg which i appli to the problem and which facilit matter wonderfulli those rule of deduct laid down in that articl which arous your scorn ar invalu to me in practic work observ with me is second natur you appear to be surpris when i told you on our first meet that you had come from afghanistan you were told no doubt noth of the sort i knew you came from afghanistan from long habit the train of thought ran so swiftli through my mind that i arriv at the conclus without be consciou of intermedi step there were such step howev the train of reason ran here is a gentleman of a medic type but with the air of a militari man clearli an armi doctor then he ha just come from the tropic for hi face is dark and that is not the natur tint of hi skin for hi wrist ar fair he ha undergon hardship and sick as hi haggard face sai clearli hi left arm ha been injur he hold it in a stiff and unnatur manner where in the tropic could an english armi doctor have seen much hardship and got hi arm wound clearli in afghanistan the whole train of thought did not occupi a second i then remark that you came from afghanistan and you were astonish it is simpl enough as you explain it i said smile you remind me of edgar allen poe s dupin i had no idea that such individu did exist outsid of stori sherlock holm rose and lit hi pipe no doubt you think that you ar compliment me in compar me to dupin he observ now in my opinion dupin wa a veri inferior fellow that trick of hi of break in on hi friend thought with an apropo remark after a quarter of an hour s silenc is realli veri showi and superfici he had some analyt geniu no doubt but he wa by no mean such a phenomenon as poe appear to imagin have you read gaboriau s work i ask doe lecoq come up to your idea of a detect sherlock holm snif sardon lecoq wa a miser bungler he said in an angri voic he had onli on thing to recommend him and that wa hi energi that book made me posit ill the question wa how to identifi an unknown prison i could have done it in twentyfour hour lecoq took six month or so it might be made a textbook for detect to teach them what to avoid i felt rather indign at have two charact whom i had admir treat in thi cavali style i walk over to the window and stood look out into the busi street thi fellow mai be veri clever i said to myself but he is certainli veri conceit there ar no crime and no crimin in these dai he said querul what is the us of have brain in our profess i know well that i have it in me to make my name famou no man live or ha ever live who ha brought the same amount of studi and of natur talent to the detect of crime which i have done and what is the result there is no crime to detect or at most some bungl villaini with a motiv so transpar that even a scotland yard offici can see through it i wa still annoi at hi bumptiou style of convers i thought it best to chang the topic i wonder what that fellow is look for i ask point to a stalwart plainlydress individu who wa walk slowli down the other side of the street look anxious at the number he had a larg blue envelop in hi hand and wa evid the bearer of a messag you mean the retir sergeant of marin said sherlock holm brag and bounc thought i to myself he know that i cannot verifi hi guess the thought had hardli pass through my mind when the man whom we were watch caught sight of the number on our door and ran rapidli across the roadwai we heard a loud knock a deep voic below and heavi step ascend the stair for mr sherlock holm he said step into the room and hand my friend the letter here wa an opportun of take the conceit out of him he littl thought of thi when he made that random shot mai i ask my lad i said in the blandest voic what your trade mai be commissionair sir he said gruffli uniform awai for repair and you were i ask with a slightli malici glanc at my companion a sergeant sir royal marin light infantri sir no answer right sir he click hi heel togeth rais hi hand in a salut and wa gone chapter iii the lauriston garden mysteri i confess that i wa consider startl by thi fresh proof of the practic natur of my companion s theori my respect for hi power of analysi increas wondrous there still remain some lurk suspicion in my mind howev that the whole thing wa a prearrang episod intend to dazzl me though what earthli object he could have in take me in wa past my comprehens when i look at him he had finish read the note and hi ey had assum the vacant lacklustr express which show mental abstract how in the world did you deduc that i ask deduc what said he petulantli why that he wa a retir sergeant of marin i have no time for trifl he answer brusqu then with a smile excus my rude you broke the thread of my thought but perhap it is as well so you actual were not abl to see that that man wa a sergeant of marin no inde it wa easier to know it than to explain why i knew it if you were ask to prove that two and two made four you might find some difficulti and yet you ar quit sure of the fact even across the street i could see a great blue anchor tattoo on the back of the fellow s hand that smack of the sea he had a militari carriag howev and regul side whisker there we have the marin he wa a man with some amount of selfimport and a certain air of command you must have observ the wai in which he held hi head and swung hi cane a steadi respect middleag man too on the face of himal fact which led me to believ that he had been a sergeant wonder i ejacul commonplac said holm though i thought from hi express that he wa pleas at my evid surpris and admir i said just now that there were no crimin it appear that i am wronglook at thi he threw me over the note which the commissionair had brought why i cri as i cast my ey over it

threefoot brick wall with a fring of wood rail upon the top and against thi wall wa lean a stalwart polic constabl surround by a small knot of loafer who crane their neck and strain their ey in the vain hope of catch some glimps of the proceed within i had imagin that sherlock holm would at onc have hurri into the hous and plung into a studi of the mysteri noth appear to be further from hi

in the hall reappear upon the scene rub hi hand in a pompou and selfsatisfi manner mr gregson he said i have just made a discoveri of the highest import and on which would have been overlook had i not made a care examin of the wall the littl man s ey sparkl as he spoke and he wa evid in a state of suppress exult at have score a point against hi colleagu come here he said bustl back into the room the atmospher of which felt clearer sinc the remov of it ghastli inmat now stand there he struck a match on hi boot and held it up against the wall look at that he said triumphantli i have remark that the paper had fallen awai in part in thi particular corner of the room a larg piec had peel off leav a yellow squar of coars plaster across thi bare space there wa scrawl in bloodr letter a singl word rach what do you think of that cri the detect with the air of a showman exhibit hi show thi wa overlook becaus it wa in the darkest corner of the room and no on thought of look there the murder ha written it with hi or her own blood see thi smear where it ha trickl down the wall that dispos of the idea of suicid anyhow why wa that corner chosen to write it on i will tell you see that candl on the mantelpiec it wa lit at the time and if it wa lit thi corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall and what doe it mean now that you have found it ask gregson in a depreciatori voic mean why it mean that the writer wa go to put the femal name rachel but wa disturb befor he or she had time to finish you mark my word when thi case come to be clear up you will find that a woman name rachel ha someth to do with it it s all veri well for you to laugh mr sherlock holm you mai be veri smart and clever but the old hound is the best when all is said and done i realli beg your pardon said my companion who had ruffl the littl man s temper by burst into an explos of laughter you certainli have the credit of be the first of us to find thi out and as you sai it bear everi mark of have been written by the other particip in last night s mysteri i have not had time to examin thi room yet but with your permiss i shall do so now as he spoke he whip a tape measur and a larg round magnifi glass from hi pocket with these two implement he trot noiselessli about the room sometim stop occasion kneel and onc ly flat upon hi face so engross wa he with hi occup that he appear to have forgotten our presenc for he chatter awai to himself under hi breath the whole time keep up a run fire of exclam groan whistl and littl cri suggest of encourag and of hope as i watch him i wa irresist remind of a pureblood welltrain foxhound as it dash backward and forward through the covert whine in it eager until it come across the lost scent for twenti minut or more he continu hi research measur with the most exact care the distanc between mark which were entir invis to me and occasion appli hi tape to the wall in an equal incomprehens manner in on place he gather up veri carefulli a littl pile of grei dust from the floor and pack it awai in an envelop final he examin with hi glass the word upon the wall go over everi letter of it with the most minut exact thi done he appear to be satisfi for he replac hi tape and hi glass in hi pocket thei sai that geniu is an infinit capac for take pain he remark with a smile it s a veri bad definit but it doe appli to detect work gregson and lestrad had watch the manoeuvr of their amateur companion with consider curios and some contempt thei evid fail to appreci the fact which i had begun to realiz that sherlock holm smallest action were all direct toward some definit and practic end what do you think of it sir thei both ask it would be rob you of the credit of the case if i wa to presum to help you remark my friend you ar do so well now that it would be a piti for anyon to interfer there wa a world of sarcasm in hi voic as he spoke if you will let me know how your investig go he continu i shall be happi to give you ani help i can in the meantim i should like to speak to the constabl who found the bodi can you give me hi name and address lestrad glanc at hi notebook john ranc he said he is off duti now you will find him at audlei court kennington park gate holm took a note of the address come along doctor he said we shall go and look him up i ll tell you on thing which mai help you in the case he continu turn to the two detect there ha been murder done and the murder wa a man he wa more than six feet high wa in the prime of life had small feet for hi height wore coars squareto boot and smoke a trichinopoli cigar he came here with hi victim in a fourwheel cab which wa drawn by a hors with three old shoe and on new on on hi off fore leg in all probabl the murder had a florid face and the fingernail of hi right hand were remark long these ar onli a few indic but thei mai assist you lestrad and gregson glanc at each other with an incredul smile if thi man wa murder how wa it done ask the former poison said sherlock holm curtli and strode off on other thing lestrad he ad turn round at the door rach is the german for reveng so don t lose your time look for miss rachel with which parthian shot he walk awai leav the two rival openmouth behind him chapter iv what john ranc had to tell it wa on o clock when we left no lauriston garden sherlock holm led me to the nearest telegraph offic whenc he dispatch a long telegram he then hail a cab and order the driver to take us to the address given us by lestrad there is noth like first hand evid he remark as a matter of fact my mind is entir made up upon the case but still we mai as well learn all that is to be learn you amaz me holm said i sure you ar not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particular which you gave there s no room for a mistak he answer the veri first thing which i observ on arriv there wa that a cab had made two rut with it wheel close to the curb now up to last night we have had no rain for a week so that those wheel which left such a deep impress must have been there dure the night there were the mark of the hors s hoof too the outlin of on of which wa far more clearli cut than that of the other three show that that wa a new shoe sinc the cab wa there after the rain began and wa not there at ani time dure the morningi have gregson s word for thatit follow that it must have been there dure the night and therefor that it brought those two individu to the hous that seem simpl enough said i but how about the other man s height why the height of a man in nine case out of ten can be told from the length of hi stride it is a simpl calcul enough though there is no us my bore you with figur i had thi fellow s stride both on the clai outsid and on the dust within then i had a wai of check my calcul when a man write on a wall hi instinct lead him to write about the level of hi own ey now that write wa just over six feet from the ground it wa child s plai and hi ag i ask well if a man can stride four and ahalf feet without the smallest effort he can t be quit in the sere and yellow that wa the breadth of a puddl on the garden walk which he had evid walk across patentleath boot had gone round and squareto had hop over there is no mysteri about it at all i am simpli appli to ordinari life a few of those precept of observ and deduct which i advoc in that articl is there anyth els that puzzl you the finger nail and the trichinopoli i suggest the write on the wall wa done with a man s forefing dip in blood my glass allow me to observ that the plaster wa slightli scratch in do it which would not have been the case if the man s nail had been trim i gather up some scatter ash from the floor it wa dark in colour and flakeysuch an ash as is onli made by a trichinopoli i have made a special studi of cigar ashesin fact i have written a monograph upon the subject i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glanc the ash of ani known brand either of cigar or of tobacco it is just in such detail that the skill detect differ from the gregson and lestrad type and the florid face i ask ah that wa a more dare shot though i have no doubt that i wa right you must not ask me that at the present state of the affair i pass my hand over my brow my head is in a whirl i remark the more on think of it the more mysteri it grow how came these two menif there were two meninto an empti hous what ha becom of the cabman who drove them how could on man compel anoth to take poison where did the blood come from what wa the object of the murder sinc robberi had no part in it how came the woman s ring there abov all why should the second man write up the german word rach befor decamp i confess that i cannot see ani possibl wai of reconcil all these fact my companion smile approvingli you sum up the difficulti of the situat succinctli and well he said there is much that is still obscur though i have quit made up my mind on the main fact as to poor lestrad s discoveri it wa simpli a blind intend to put the polic upon a wrong track by suggest social and secret societi it wa not done by a german the a if you notic wa print somewhat after the german fashion now a real german invari print in the latin charact so that we mai safe sai that thi wa not written by on but by a clumsi imit who overdid hi part it wa simpli a ruse to divert inquiri into a wrong channel i m not go to tell you much more of the case doctor you know a conjuror get no credit when onc he ha explain hi trick and if i show you too much of my method of work you will come to the conclus that i am a veri ordinari individu after all i shall never do that i answer you have brought detect as near an exact scienc as it ever will be brought in thi world my companion flush up with pleasur at my word and the earnest wai in which i utter them i had alreadi observ that he wa as sensit to flatteri on the score of hi art as ani girl could be of her beauti i ll tell you on other thing he said patent leather and squareto came in the same cab and thei walk down the pathwai togeth as friendli as possiblearminarm in all probabl when thei got insid thei walk up and down the roomor rather patentleath stood still while squareto walk up and down i could read all that in the dust and i could read that as he walk he grew more and more excit that is shown by the increas length of hi stride he wa talk all the while and work himself up no doubt into a furi then the tragedi occur i ve told you all i know myself now for the rest is mere surmis and conjectur we have a good work basi howev on which to start we must hurri up for i want to go to hall s concert to hear norman neruda thi afternoon thi convers had occur while our cab had been thread it wai through a long success of dingi street and dreari bywai in the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenli came to a stand that s audlei court in there he said point to a narrow slit in the line of deadcolour brick you ll find me here when you come back audlei court wa not an attract local the narrow passag led us into a quadrangl pave with flag and line by sordid dwell we pick our wai among group of dirti children and through line of discolour linen until we came to number the door of which wa decor with a small slip of brass on which the name ranc wa engrav on enquiri we found that the constabl wa in bed and we were shown into a littl front parlour to await hi come he appear present look a littl irrit at be disturb in hi slumber i made my report at the offic he said holm took a halfsovereign from hi pocket and plai with it pensiv we thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lip he said i shall be most happi to tell you anyth i can the constabl answer with hi ey upon the littl golden disk just let us hear it all in your own wai as it occur ranc sat down on the horsehair sofa and knit hi brow as though determin not to omit anyth in hi narr i ll tell it ye from the begin he said my time is from ten at night to six in the morn at eleven there wa a fight at the white hart but bar that all wa quiet enough on the beat at on o clock it began to rain and i met harri murcherhim who ha the holland grove beatand we stood togeth at the corner of henrietta street atalkin presentlymayb about two or a littl afteri thought i would take a look round and see that all wa right down the brixton road it wa preciou dirti and lone not a soul did i meet all the wai down though a cab or two went past me i wa a strollin down thinkin between ourselv how uncommon handi a four of gin hot would be when suddenli the glint of a light caught my ey in the window of that same hous now i knew that them two hous in lauriston garden wa empti on account of him that own them who won t have the drain seen to though the veri last tenant what live in on of them di o typhoid fever i wa knock all in a heap therefor at see a light in the window and i suspect as someth wa wrong when i got to the door you stop and then walk back to the garden gate my companion interrupt what did you do that for ranc gave a violent jump and stare at sherlock holm with the utmost amaz upon hi featur why that s true sir he said though how you come to know it heaven onli know ye see when i got up to the door it wa so still and so lonesom that i thought i d be none the wors for some on with me i ain t afear of anyth on thi side o the grave but i thought that mayb it wa him that di o the typhoid inspect the drain what kill him the thought gave me a kind o turn and i walk back to the gate to see if i could see murcher s lantern but there wasn t no sign of him nor of anyon els there wa no on in the street not a livin soul sir nor as much as a dog then i pull myself togeth and went back and push the door open all wa quiet insid so i went into the room where the light wa aburnin there wa a candl flickerin on the mantelpiecea red wax oneand by it light i saw ye i know all that you saw you walk round the room sever time and you knelt down by the bodi and then you walk through and tri the kitchen door and then john ranc sprang to hi feet with a frighten face and suspicion in hi ey where wa you hid to see all that he cri it seem to me that you know a deal more than you should holm laugh and threw hi card across the tabl to the constabl don t get arrest me for the murder he said i am on of the hound and not the wolf mr gregson or mr lestrad will answer for that go on though what did you do next ranc resum hi seat without howev lose hi mystifi express i went back to the gate and sound my whistl that brought murcher and two more to the spot wa the street empti then well it wa as far as anybodi that could be of ani good goe what do you mean the constabl s featur broaden into a grin i ve seen mani a drunk chap in my time he said but never anyon so cryin drunk as that cove he wa at the gate when i came out aleanin up agin the rail and asingin at the pitch o hi lung about columbin s newfangl banner or some such stuff he couldn t stand far less help what sort of a man wa he ask sherlock holm john ranc appear to be somewhat irrit at thi digress he wa an uncommon drunk sort o man he said he d ha found hisself in the station if we hadn t been so took up hi facehi dressdidn t you notic them holm broke in impati i should think i did notic them see that i had to prop him upm and murcher between us he wa a long chap with a red face the lower part muffl round that will do cri holm what becam of him we d enough to do without lookin after him the policeman said in an aggriev voic i ll wager he found hi wai home all right how wa he dress a brown overcoat had he a whip in hi hand a whipno he must have left it behind mutter my companion you didn t happen to see or hear a cab after that no there s a halfsovereign for you my companion said stand up and take hi hat i am afraid ranc that you will never rise in the forc that head of your should be for us as well as ornament you might have gain your sergeant s stripe last night the man whom you held in your hand is the man who hold the clue of thi mysteri and whom we ar seek there is no us of argu about it now i tell you that it is so come along doctor we start off for the cab togeth leav our inform incredul but obvious uncomfort the blunder fool holm said bitterli as we drove back to our lodg just to think of hi have such an incompar bit of good luck and not take advantag of it i am rather in the dark still it is true that the descript of thi man talli with your idea of the second parti in thi mysteri but why should he come back to the hous after leav it that is not the wai of crimin the ring man the ring that wa what he came back for if we have no other wai of catch him we can alwai bait our line with the ring i shall have him doctori ll lai you two to on that i have him i must thank you for it all i might not have gone but for you and so have miss the finest studi i ever came across a studi in scarlet eh why shouldn t we us a littl art jargon there s the scarlet thread of murder run through the colourless skein of life and our duti is to unravel it and isol it and expos everi inch of it and now for lunch and then for norman neruda her attack and her bow ar splendid what s that littl thing of chopin s she plai so magnific tralalaliraliralai lean back in the cab thi amateur bloodhound carol awai like a lark while i medit upon the manysided of the human mind chapter v our advertis bring a visitor our morn s exert had been too much for my weak health and i wa tire out in the afternoon after holm departur for the concert i lai down upon the sofa and endeavour to get a coupl of hour sleep it wa a useless attempt my mind had been too much excit by all that had occur and the strangest fanci and surmis crowd into it everi time that i close my ey i saw befor me the distort baboonlik counten of the murder man so sinist wa the impress which that face had produc upon me that i found it difficult to feel anyth but gratitud for him who had remov it owner from the world if ever human featur bespok vice of the most malign type thei were certainli those of enoch j drebber of cleveland still i recogn that justic must be done and that the deprav of the victim wa no condon in the ey of the law the more i thought of it the more extraordinari did my companion s hypothesi that the man had been poison appear i rememb how he had snif hi lip and had no doubt that he had detect someth which had given rise to the idea then again if not poison what had caus the man s death sinc there wa neither wound nor mark of strangul but on the other hand whose blood wa that which lai so thickli upon the floor there were no sign of a struggl nor had the victim ani weapon with which he might have wound an antagonist as long as all these question were unsolv i felt that sleep would be no easi matter either for holm or myself hi quiet selfconfid manner convinc me that he had alreadi form a theori which explain all the fact though what it wa i could not for an instant conjectur he wa veri late in returningso late that i knew that the concert could not have detain him all the time dinner wa on the tabl befor he appear it wa magnific he said as he took hi seat do you rememb what darwin sai about music he claim that the power of produc and appreci it exist among the human race long befor the power of speech wa arriv at perhap that is why we ar so subtli influenc by it there ar vagu memori in our soul of those misti centuri when the world wa in it childhood that s rather a broad idea i remark on s idea must be as broad as natur if thei ar to interpret natur he answer what s the matter you re not look quit yourself thi brixton road affair ha upset you to tell the truth it ha i said i ought to be more caseharden after my afghan experi i saw my own comrad hack to piec at maiwand without lose my nerv i can understand there is a mysteri about thi which stimul the imagin where there is no imagin there is no horror have you seen the even paper no it give a fairli good account of the affair it doe not mention the fact that when the man wa rais up a woman s wed ring fell upon the floor it is just as well it doe not why look at thi advertis he answer i had on sent to everi paper thi morn immedi after the affair he threw the paper across to me and i glanc at the place indic it wa the first announc in the found column in brixton road thi morn it ran a plain gold wed ring found in the roadwai between the white hart tavern and holland grove appli dr watson b baker street between eight and nine thi even excus my us your name he said if i us my own some of these dunderhead would recogn it and want to meddl in the affair that is all right i answer but suppos anyon appli i have no ring oh ye you have said he hand me on thi will do veri well it is almost a facsimil and who do you expect will answer thi advertis why the man in the brown coatour florid friend with the squar toe if he doe not come himself he will send an accomplic would he not consid it as too danger not at all if my view of the case is correct and i have everi reason to believ that it is thi man would rather risk anyth than lose the ring accord to my notion he drop it while stoop over drebber s bodi and did not miss it at the time after leav the hous he discov hi loss and hurri back but found the polic alreadi in possess ow to hi own folli in leav the candl burn he had to pretend to be drunk in order to allai the suspicion which might have been arous by hi appear at the gate now put yourself in that man s place on think the matter over it must

on to the platform i heard them ask for the liverpool train and the guard answer that on had just gone and there would not be anoth for some hour stangerson seem to be put out at that but drebber wa rather pleas than otherwis i got so close to them in the bustl that i could hear everi word that pass between them drebber said that he had a littl busi of hi own to do and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him hi companion remonstr with him and remind him that thei had resolv to stick togeth drebber answer that the matter wa a delic on and that he must go alon i could not catch what stangerson said to that but the other burst out swear and remind him that he wa noth more than hi paid servant and that he must not presum to dictat to him on that the secretari gave it up as a bad job and simpli bargain with him that if he miss the last train he should rejoin him at hallidai s privat hotel to which drebber answer that he would be back on the platform befor eleven and made hi wai out of the station the moment for which i had wait so long had at last come i had my enemi within my power togeth thei could protect each other but singli thei were at my merci i did not act howev with undu precipit my plan were alreadi form there is no satisfact in vengeanc unless the offend ha time to realiz who it is that strike him and why retribut ha come upon him i had my plan arrang by which i should have the opportun of make the man who had wrong me understand that hi old sin had found him out it chanc that some dai befor a gentleman who had been engag in look over some hous in the brixton road had drop the kei of on of them in my carriag it wa claim that same even and return but in the interv i had taken a mould of it and had a duplic construct by mean of thi i had access to at least on spot in thi great citi where i could reli upon be free from interrupt how to get drebber to that hous wa the difficult problem which i had now to solv he walk down the road and went into on or two liquor shop stai for nearli halfanhour in the last of them when he came out he stagger in hi walk and wa evid pretti well on there wa a hansom just in front of me and he hail it i follow it so close that the nose of my hors wa within a yard of hi driver the whole wai we rattl across waterloo bridg and through mile of street until to my astonish we found ourselv back in the terrac in which he had board i could not imagin what hi intent wa in return there but i went on and pull up my cab a hundr yard or so from the hous he enter it and hi hansom drove awai give me a glass of water if you pleas my mouth get dry with the talk i hand him the glass and he drank it down that s better he said well i wait for a quarter of an hour or more when suddenli there came a nois like peopl struggl insid the hous next moment the door wa flung open and two men appear on of whom wa drebber and the other wa a young chap whom i had never seen befor thi fellow had drebber by the collar and when thei came to the head of the step he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road you hound he cri shake hi stick at him i ll teach you to insult an honest girl he wa so hot that i think he would have thrash drebber with hi cudgel onli that the cur stagger awai down the road as fast as hi leg would carri him he ran as far as the corner and then see my cab he hail me and jump in drive me to hallidai s privat hotel said he when i had him fairli insid my cab my heart jump so with joi that i fear lest at thi last moment my aneur might go wrong i drove along slowli weigh in my own mind what it wa best to do i might take him right out into the countri and there in some desert lane have my last interview with him i had almost decid upon thi when he solv the problem for me the craze for drink had seiz him again and he order me to pull up outsid a gin palac he went in leav word that i should wait for him there he remain until close time and when he came out he wa so far gone that i knew the game wa in my own hand don t imagin that i intend to kill him in cold blood it would onli have been rigid justic if i had done so but i could not bring myself to do it i had long determin that he should have a show for hi life if he chose to take advantag of it among the mani billet which i have fill in america dure my wander life i wa onc janitor and sweeper out of the laboratori at york colleg on dai the professor wa lectur on poision and he show hi student some alkaloid as he call it which he had extract from some south american arrow poison and which wa so power that the least grain meant instant death i spot the bottl in which thi prepar wa kept and when thei were all gone i help myself to a littl of it i wa a fairli good dispens so i work thi alkaloid into small solubl pill and each pill i put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison i determin at the time that when i had my chanc my gentlemen should each have a draw out of on of these box while i at the pill that remain it would be quit as deadli and a good deal less noisi than fire across a handkerchief from that dai i had alwai my pill box about with me and the time had now come when i wa to us them it wa nearer on than twelv and a wild bleak night blow hard and rain in torrent dismal as it wa outsid i wa glad withinso glad that i could have shout out from pure exult if ani of you gentlemen have ever pine for a thing and long for it dure twenti long year and then suddenli found it within your reach you would understand my feel i lit a cigar and puf at it to steadi my nerv but my hand were trembl and my templ throb with excit as i drove i could see old john ferrier and sweet luci look at me out of the dark and smile at me just as plain as i see you all in thi room all the wai thei were ahead of me on on each side of the hors until i pull up at the hous in the brixton road there wa not a soul to be seen nor a sound to be heard except the drip of the rain when i look in at the window i found drebber all huddl togeth in a drunken sleep i shook him by the arm it s time to get out i said all right cabbi said he i suppos he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mention for he got out without anoth word and follow me down the garden i had to walk besid him to keep him steadi for he wa still a littl topheavi when we came to the door i open it and led him into the front room i give you my word that all the wai the father and the daughter were walk in front of us it s infern dark said he stamp about we ll soon have a light i said strike a match and put it to a wax candl which i had brought with me now enoch drebber i continu turn to him and hold the light to my own face who am i he gaze at me with blear drunken ey for a moment and then i saw a horror spring up in them and convuls hi whole featur which show me that he knew me he stagger back with a livid face and i saw the perspir break out upon hi brow while hi teeth chatter in hi head at the sight i lean my back against the door and laugh loud and long i had alwai known that vengeanc would be sweet but i had never hope for the content of soul which now possess me you dog i said i have hunt you from salt lake citi to st petersburg and you have alwai escap me now at last your wander have come to an end for either you or i shall never see tomorrow s sun rise he shrunk still further awai as i spoke and i could see on hi face that he thought i wa mad so i wa for the time the puls in my templ beat like sledgehamm and i believ i would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gush from my nose and reliev me what do you think of luci ferrier now i cri lock the door and shake the kei in hi face punish ha been slow in come but it ha overtaken you at last i saw hi coward lip trembl as i spoke he would have beg for hi life but he knew well that it wa useless would you murder me he stammer there is no murder i answer who talk of murder a mad dog what merci had you upon my poor darl when you drag her from her slaughter father and bore her awai to your accurs and shameless harem it wa not i who kill her father he cri but it wa you who broke her innoc heart i shriek thrust the box befor him let the high god judg between us choos and eat there is death in on and life in the other i shall take what you leav let us see if there is justic upon the earth or if we ar rule by chanc he cower awai with wild cri and prayer for merci but i drew my knife and held it to hi throat until he had obei me then i swallow the other and we stood face on anoth in silenc for a minut or more wait to see which wa to live and which wa to die shall i ever forget the look which came over hi face when the first warn pang told him that the poison wa in hi system i laugh as i saw it and held luci s marriag ring in front of hi ey it wa but for a moment for the action of the alkaloid is rapid a spasm of pain contort hi featur he threw hi hand out in front of him stagger and then with a hoars cry fell heavili upon the floor i turn him over with my foot and place my hand upon hi heart there wa no movement he wa dead the blood had been stream from my nose but i had taken no notic of it i don t know what it wa that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it perhap it wa some mischiev idea of set the polic upon a wrong track for i felt lightheart and cheer i rememb a german be found in new york with rach written up abov him and it wa argu at the time in the newspap that the secret societi must have done it i guess that what puzzl the new yorker would puzzl the

he wa to answer for the life he had taken so long befor i describ drebber s death to him and i gave him the same choic of the poison pill instead of grasp at the chanc of safeti which that offer him he sprang from hi bed and flew at my throat in selfdef i stab him to the heart it would have been the same in ani case for provid would never have allow hi guilti hand to pick out anyth but the poison

secret he said but i don t get other peopl into troubl i saw your advertis and i thought it might be a plant or it might be the ring which i want my friend volunt to go and see i think you ll own he did it smartli not a doubt of that said holm heartili now gentlemen the inspector remark grave the form of the law must be compli with on thursdai the prison will be brought befor the magistr and your attend will be requir until then i will be respons for him he rang the bell as he spoke and jefferson hope wa led off by a coupl of warder while my friend and i made our wai out of the station and took a cab back to baker street chapter vii the conclus we had all been warn to appear befor the magistr upon the thursdai but when the thursdai came there wa no occas for our testimoni a higher judg had taken the matter in hand and jefferson hope had been summon befor a tribun where strict justic would be mete out to him on the veri night after hi captur the aneur burst and he wa found in the morn stretch upon the floor of the cell with a placid smile upon hi face as though he had been abl in hi dy moment to look back upon a us life and on work well done gregson and lestrad will be wild about hi death holm remark as we chat it over next even where will their grand advertis be now i don t see that thei had veri much to do with hi captur i answer what you do in thi world is a matter of no consequ return my companion bitterli the question is what can you make peopl believ that you have done never mind he continu more brightli after a paus i would not have miss the investig for anyth there ha been no better case within my recollect simpl as it wa there were sever most instruct point about it simpl i ejacul well realli it can hardli be describ as otherwis said sherlock holm smile at my surpris the proof of it intrins simplic is that without ani help save a few veri ordinari deduct i wa abl to lai my hand upon the crimin within three dai that is true said i i have alreadi explain to you that what is out of the common is usual a guid rather than a hindranc in solv a problem of thi sort the grand thing is to be abl to reason backward that is a veri us accomplish and a veri easi on but peopl do not practis it much in the everydai affair of life it is more us to reason forward and so the other come to be neglect there ar fifti who can reason synthet for on who can reason analyt i confess said i that i do not quit follow you i hardli expect that you would let me see if i can make it clearer most peopl if you describ a train of event to them will tell you what the result would be thei can put those event togeth in their mind and argu from them that someth will come to pass there ar few peopl howev who if you told them a result would be abl to evolv from their own inner conscious what the step were which led up to that result thi power is what i mean when i talk of reason backward or analyt i understand said i now thi wa a case in which you were given the result and had to find everyth els for yourself now let me endeavour to show you the differ step in my reason to begin at the begin i approach the hous as you know on foot and with my mind entir free from all impress i natur began by examin the roadwai and there as i have alreadi explain to you i saw clearli the mark of a cab which i ascertain by inquiri must have been there dure the night i satisfi myself that it wa a cab and not a privat carriag by the narrow gaug of the wheel the ordinari london growler is consider less wide than a gentleman s brougham thi wa the first point gain i then walk slowli down the garden path which happen to be compos of a clai soil peculiarli suitabl for take impress no doubt it appear to you to be a mere trampl line of slush but to my train ey everi mark upon it surfac had a mean there is no branch of detect scienc which is so import and so much neglect as the art of trace footstep happili i have alwai laid great stress upon it and much practic ha made it second natur to me i saw the heavi footmark of the constabl but i saw also the track of the two men who had first pass through the garden it wa easi to tell that thei had been befor the other becaus in place their mark had been entir obliter by the other come upon the top of them in thi wai my second link wa form which told me that the nocturn visitor were two in number on remark for hi height as i calcul from the length of hi stride and the other fashion dress to judg from the small and eleg impress left by hi boot on enter the hous thi last infer wa confirm my wellboot man lai befor me the tall on then had done the murder if murder there wa there wa no wound upon the dead man s person but the agit express upon hi face assur me that he had foreseen hi fate befor it came upon him men who die from heart diseas or ani sudden natur caus never by ani chanc exhibit agit upon their featur have snif the dead man s lip i detect a slightli sour smell and i came to the conclus that he had had poison forc upon him again i argu that it had been forc upon him from the hatr and fear express upon hi face by the method of exclus i had arriv at thi result for no other hypothesi would meet the fact do not imagin that it wa a veri unheard of idea the forcibl administr of poison is by no mean a new thing in crimin annal the case of dolski in odessa and of leturi in montpelli will occur at onc to ani toxicologist and now came the great question as to the reason why robberi had not been the object of the murder for noth wa taken wa it polit then or wa it a woman that wa the question which confront me i wa inclin from the first to the latter supposit polit assassin ar onli too glad to do their work and to fly thi murder had on the contrari been done most deliber and the perpetr had left hi track all over the room show that he had been there all the time it must have been a privat wrong and not a polit on which call for such a method reveng when the inscript wa discov upon the wall i wa more inclin than ever to my opinion the thing wa too evid a blind when the ring wa found howev it settl the question clearli the murder had us it to remind hi victim of some dead or absent woman it wa at thi point that i ask gregson whether he had enquir in hi telegram to cleveland as to ani particular point in mr drebber s former career he answer you rememb in the neg i then proceed to make a care examin of the room which confirm me in my opinion as to the murder s height and furnish me with the addit detail as to the trichinopoli cigar and the length of hi nail i had alreadi come to the conclus sinc there were no sign of a struggl that the blood which cover the floor had burst from the murder s nose in hi excit i could perceiv that the track of blood coincid with the track of hi feet it is seldom that ani man unless he is veri fullblood break out in thi wai through emot so i hazard the opinion that the crimin wa probabl a robust and ruddyfac man event prove that i had judg correctli have left the hous i proceed to do what gregson had neglect i telegraph to the head of the polic at cleveland limit my enquiri to the circumst connect with the marriag of enoch drebber the answer wa conclus it told me that drebber had alreadi appli for the protect of the law against an old rival in love name jefferson hope and that thi same hope wa at present in europ i knew now that i held the clue to the mysteri in my hand and all that remain wa to secur the murder i had alreadi determin in my own mind that the man who had walk into the hous with drebber wa none other than the man who had driven the cab the mark in the road show me that the hors had wander on in a wai which would have been imposs had there been anyon in charg of it where then could the driver be unless he were insid the hous again it is absurd to suppos that ani sane man would carri out a deliber crime under the veri ey as it were of a third person who wa sure to betrai him lastli suppos on man wish to dog anoth through london what better mean could he adopt than to turn cabdriv all these consider led me to the irresist conclus that jefferson hope wa to be found among the jarvei of the metropoli if he had been on there wa no reason to believ that he had ceas to be on the contrari from hi point of view ani sudden chang would be like to draw attent to himself he would probabl for a time at least continu to perform hi duti there wa no reason to suppos that he wa go under an assum name why should he chang hi name in a countri where no on knew hi origin on i therefor organ my street arab detect corp and sent them systemat to everi cab proprietor in london until thei ferret out the man that i want how well thei succeed and how quickli i took advantag of it ar still fresh in your recollect the murder of stangerson wa an incid which wa entir unexpect but which could hardli in ani case have been prevent through it as you know i came into possess of the pill the exist of which i had alreadi surmis you see the whole thing is a chain of logic sequenc without a break or flaw it is wonder i cri your merit should be publicli recogn you should publish an account of the case if you won t i will for you you mai do what you like doctor he answer see here he continu hand a paper over to me look at thi it wa the echo for the dai and the paragraph to which he point wa devot to the case in question the public it said have lost a sensat treat through the sudden death of the man hope who wa suspect of the murder of mr enoch drebber and of mr joseph stangerson the detail of the case will probabl be never known now though we ar inform upon good author that the crime wa the result of an old stand and romant feud in which love and mormon bore a part it seem that both the victim belong in their younger dai to the latter dai saint and hope the deceas prison hail also from salt lake citi if the case ha had no other effect it at least bring out in the most strike manner the effici of our detect polic forc and will serv as a lesson to all foreign that thei will do wise to settl their feud at home and not to carri them on to british soil it is an open secret that the credit of thi smart captur belong entir to the wellknown scotland yard offici messr lestrad and gregson the man wa apprehend it appear in the room of a certain mr sherlock holm who ha himself as an amateur shown some talent in the detect line and who with such instructor mai hope in time to attain to some degre of their skill it is expect that a testimoni of some sort will be present to the two offic as a fit recognit of their servic didn t i tell you so when we start cri sherlock holm with a laugh that s the result of all our studi in scarlet to get them a testimoni never mind i answer i
