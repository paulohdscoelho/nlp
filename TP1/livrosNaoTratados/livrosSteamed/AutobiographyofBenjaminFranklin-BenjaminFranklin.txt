daili with hi clout shoon the interest human and vividli told stori of on of the wisest and most us live in our own histori and perhap in ani histori in franklin autobiographi is offer not so much a

off block island our peopl set about catch cod and haul up a great mani hitherto i had stuck to my resolut of not eat anim food and on thi occas i considerd with my master tryon the take everi fish as a kind of unprovok murder sinc none of them had or ever could do us ani injuri that might justifi the slaughter all thi seem veri reason but i had formerli been a great lover of fish and when thi came hot out of the fryingpan it smelt admir well i balancd some time between principl and inclin till i recollect that when the fish were open i saw smaller fish taken out of their stomach then thought i if you eat on anoth i dont see why we maynt eat you so i dind upon cod veri heartili and continu to eat with other peopl return onli now and then occasion to a veget diet so conveni a thing is it to be a reason creatur sinc it enabl on to find or make a reason for everyth on ha a mind to do v earli friend in philadelphia keimer and i livd on a pretti good familiar foot and agre toler well for he suspect noth of my set up he retain a great deal of hi old enthusiasm and lovd argument we therefor had mani disput i us to work him so with my socrat method and had trepannd him so often by question appar so distant from ani point we had in hand and yet by degre led to the point and brought him into difficulti and contradict that at last he grew ridicul cautiou and would hardli answer me the most common question without ask first what do you intend to infer from that howev it gave him so high an opinion of my abil in the confut wai that he serious propos my be hi colleagu in a project he had of set up a new sect he wa to preach the doctrin and i wa to confound all oppon when he came to explain with me upon the doctrin i found sever conundrum which i object to unless i might have my wai a littl too and introduc some of mine keimer wore hi beard at full length becaus somewher in the mosaic law it is said thou shalt not mar the corner of thy beard he likewis kept the seventh dai sabbath and these two point were essenti with him i dislikd both but agre to admit them upon condit of hi adopt the doctrin of us no anim food i doubt said he my constitut will not bear that i assurd him it would and that he would be the better for it he wa usual a great glutton and i promis myself some divers in half starv him he agre to try the practic if i would keep him compani i did so and we held it for three month we had our victual dressd and brought to us regularli by a woman in the neighborhood who had from me a list of forti dish to be prepard for us at differ time in all which there wa neither fish flesh nor fowl and the whim suit me the better at thi time from the cheap of it not cost us abov eighteenp sterl each per week i have sinc kept sever lent most strictli leav the common diet for that and that for the common abruptli without the least inconveni so that i think there is littl in the advic of make those chang by easi gradat i went on pleasantli but poor keimer suffer grievous tire of the project longd for the fleshpot of egypt and orderd a roast pig he invit me and two women friend to dine with him but it be brought too soon upon tabl he could not resist the temptat and at the whole befor we came i had made some courtship dure thi time to miss read i had a great respect and affect for her and had some reason to believ she had the same for me but as i wa about to take a long voyag and we were both veri young onli a littl abov eighteen it wa thought most prudent by her mother to prevent our go too far at present as a marriag if it wa to take place would be more conveni after my return when i should be as i expect set up in my busi perhap too she thought my expect not so well found as i imagin them to be my chief acquaint at thi time were charl osborn joseph watson and jame ralph all lover of read the two first were clerk to an emin scriven or conveyanc in the town charl brockden the other wa clerk to a merchant watson wa a piou sensibl young man of great integr the other rather more lax in their principl of religion particularli ralph who as well as collin had been unsettl by me for which thei both made me suffer osborn wa sensibl candid frank sincer and affection to hi friend but in literari matter too fond of critic ralph wa ingeni genteel in hi manner and extrem eloqu i think i never knew a prettier talker both of them were great admir of poetri and began to try their hand in littl piec mani pleasant walk we four had togeth on sundai into the wood near schuylkil where we read to on anoth and conferrd on what we read illustr mani pleasant walk we four had togeth ralph wa inclind to pursu the studi of poetri not doubt but he might becom emin in it and make hi fortun by it alleg that the best poet must when thei first began to write make as mani fault as he did osborn dissuad him assurd him he had no geniu for poetri and advisd him to think of noth beyond the busi he wa bred to that in the mercantil wai tho he had no stock he might by hi dilig and punctual recommend himself to employ as a factor and in time acquir wherewith to trade on hi own account i approvd the amus on self with poetri now and then so far as to improv on languag but no farther on thi it wa proposd that we should each of us at our next meet produc a piec of our own compos in order to improv by our mutual observ critic and correct as languag and express were what we had in view we exclud all consider of invent by agre that the task should be a version of the eighteenth psalm which describ the descent of a deiti when the time of our meet drew nigh ralph call on me first and let me know hi piec wa readi i told him i had been busi and have littl inclin had done noth he then showd me hi piec for my opinion and i much approvd it as it appeard to me to have great merit now sai he osborn never will allow the least merit in anyth of mine but make critic out of mere envi he is not so jealou of you i wish therefor you would take thi piec and produc it as your i will pretend not to have had time and so produc noth we shall then see what he will sai to it it wa agre and i immedi transcribd it that it might appear in my own hand we met watson perform wa read there were some beauti in it but mani defect osborn wa read it wa much better ralph did it justic remark some fault but applaud the beauti he himself had noth to produc i wa backward seem desir of be excus had not had suffici time to correct etc but no excus could be admit produc i must it wa read and repeat watson and osborn gave up the contest and joind in applaud it ralph onli made some critic and proposd some amend but i defend my text osborn wa against ralph and told him he wa no better a critic than poet so he dropt the argument as thei two went home togeth osborn express himself still more strongli in favor of what he thought my product have restraind himself befor as he said lest i should think it flatteri but who would have imagind said he that franklin had been capabl of such a perform such paint such forc such fire he ha even improvd the origin in hi common convers he seem to have no choic of word he hesit and blunder and yet good god how he write when we next met ralph discov the trick we had plaid him and osborn wa a littl laugh at thi transact fix ralph in hi resolut of becom a poet i did all i could to dissuad him from it but he continu scribbl vers till pope cure him he becam howev a pretti good prose writer more of him hereaft but as i mai not have occas again to mention the other two i shall just remark here that watson di in my arm a few year after much lament be the best of our set osborn went to the west indi where he becam an emin lawyer and made monei but di young he and i had made a seriou agreement that the on who happend first to die should if possibl make a friendli visit to the other and acquaint him how he found thing in that separ state but he never fulfilld hi promis in on of the later edit of the dunciad occur the follow line silenc ye wolv while ralph to cynthia howl and make night hideousansw him ye owl to thi the poet add the follow note jame ralph a name insert after the first edit not known till he writ a swearingpiec call sawnei veri abus of dr swift mr gai and myself vi first visit to london the governor seem to like my compani had me frequent to hi hous and hi set me up wa alwai mentiond as a fix thing i wa to take with me letter recommendatori to a number of hi friend besid the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessari monei for purchas the press and type paper etc for these letter i wa appoint to call at differ time when thei were to be readi but a futur time wa still name thu he went on till the ship whose departur too had been sever time postpon wa on the point of sail then when i calld to take my leav and receiv the letter hi secretari dr bard came out to me and said the governor wa extrem busi in write but would be down at newcastl befor the ship and there the letter would be deliv to me ralph though marri and have on child had determin to accompani me in thi voyag it wa thought he intend to establish a correspond and obtain good to sell on

read i left philadelphia in the ship which anchord at newcastl the governor wa there but when i went to hi lodg the secretari came to me from him with the civillest messag in the world that he could not then see me be engag in busi of the utmost import but should send the letter to me on board wish me heartili a good voyag and a speedi return etc i return on board a littl puzzl but still not doubt mr andrew hamilton a famou lawyer of philadelphia had taken passag in the same ship for himself and son and with mr denham a quaker merchant and messr onion and russel master of an iron work in

wa that it must fail there be alreadi two printer in the place keimer and bradford but dr baird whom you and i saw mani year after at hi nativ place st andrew in scotland gave a contrari opinion for the industri of that franklin sai he is superior to anyth i ever saw of the kind i see him still at work when i go home from club and he is at work again befor hi neighbor ar out of bed thi struck the

i mention thi industri the more particularli and the more freeli tho it seem to be talk in my own prais that those of my poster who shall read it mai know the us of that virtu when thei see it effect in my favour throughout thi relat georg webb who had found a femal friend that lent him wherewith to purchas hi time of keimer now came to offer himself as a journeyman to us we could not then emploi him but i foolishli let him know as a secret that i soon intend to begin a newspap and might then have work for him my hope of success as i told him were found on thi that the then onli newspap print by bradford wa a paltri thing wretchedli managd no wai entertain and yet wa profit to him i therefor thought a good paper would scarc fail of good encourag i request webb not to mention it but he told it to keimer who immedi to be beforehand with me publish propos for print on himself on which webb wa to be employd i resent thi and to counteract them as i could not yet begin our paper i wrote sever piec of entertain for bradford paper under the titl of the busi bodi which breintnal continud some month by thi mean the attent of the publick wa fix on that paper and keimer propos which we burlesqud and ridiculd were disregard he began hi paper howev and after carri it on three quarter of a year with at most onli nineti subscrib he offer it to me for a trifl and i have been readi some time to go on with it took it in hand directli and it provd in a few year extrem profit to me i perceiv that i am apt to speak in the singular number though our partnership still continud the reason mai be that in fact the whole manag of the busi lai upon me meredith wa no compositor a poor pressman and seldom sober my friend lament my connect with him but i wa to make the best of it illustr i see him still at work when i go home from club our first paper made a quit differ appear from ani befor in the provinc a better type and better print but some spirit remark of my write on the disput then go on between governor burnet and the massachusett assembl struck the princip peopl occas the paper and the manag of it to be much talkd of and in a few week brought them all to be our subscrib their exampl wa followd by mani and our number went on grow continu thi wa on of the first good effect of my have learnt a littl to scribbl anoth wa that the lead men see a newspap now in the hand of on who could also handl a pen thought it conveni to oblig and encourag me bradford still print the vote and law and other publick busi he had print an address of the hous to the governor in a coars blunder manner we reprint it elegantli and correctli and sent on to everi member thei were sensibl of the differ it strengthen the hand of our friend in the hous and thei vote us their printer for the year ensu among my friend in the hous i must not forget mr hamilton befor mention who wa then return from england and had a seat in it he interest himself for me strongli in that instanc as he did in mani other afterward continu hi patronag till hi death i got hi son onc marg note mr vernon about thi time put me in mind of the debt i owd him but did not press me i wrote him an ingenu letter of acknowledg cravd hi forbear a littl longer which he allowd me and as soon as i wa abl i paid the princip with interest and mani thank so that erratum wa in some degre correct but now anoth difficulti came upon me which i had never the least reason to expect mr meredith father who wa to have paid for our printinghous accord to the expect given me wa abl to advanc onli on hundr pound currenc which had been paid and a hundr more wa due to the merchant who grew impati and sud us all we gave bail but saw that if the monei could not be raisd in time the suit must soon come to a judgment and execut and our hope prospect must with us be ruin as the press and letter must be sold for payment perhap at half price in thi distress two true friend whose kind i have never forgotten nor ever shall forget while i can rememb ani thing came to me separ unknown to each other and without ani applic from me offer each of them to advanc me all the monei that should be necessari to enabl me to take the whole busi upon myself if that should be practic but thei did not like my continu the partnership with meredith who as thei said wa often seen drunk in the street and plai at low game in alehous much to our discredit these two friend were william coleman and robert grace i told them i could not propos a separ while ani prospect remaind of the meredith fulfil their part of our agreement becaus i thought myself under great oblig to them for what thei had done and would do if thei could but if thei final faild in their perform and our partnership must be dissolvd i should then think myself at liberti to accept the assist of my friend thu the matter rest for some time when i said to my partner perhap your father is dissatisfi at the part you have undertaken in thi affair of our and is unwil to advanc for you and me what he would for you alon if that is the case tell me and i will resign the whole to you and go about my busi no said he my father ha realli been disappoint and is realli unabl and i am unwil to distress him farther i see thi is a busi i am not fit for i wa bred a farmer and it wa a folli in me to come to town and put myself at thirti year of ag an apprentic to learn a new trade mani of our welsh peopl ar go to settl in north carolina where land is cheap i am inclind to go with them and follow my old employ you mai find friend to assist you if you will take the debt of

account that had been given of that countri the climat the soil husbandri etc for in those matter he wa veri judici i print them in the paper and thei gave great satisfact to the publick as soon as he wa gone i recurrd to my two friend and becaus i would not give an unkind prefer to either i took half of what each had offer and i want of on and half of the other paid off the compani debt and went on with the busi in my own name advertis that the partnership wa dissolv i think thi wa in or about the year viii busi success and first public servic about thi time there wa a cry among the peopl for more paper monei onli fifteen thousand pound be extant in the provinc and that soon to be sunk the wealthi inhabit opposd ani addit be against all paper currenc from an apprehens that it would depreci as it had done in new england to the prejudic of all creditor we had discussd thi point in our junto where i wa on the side of an addit be persuad that the first small sum struck in had done much good by increas the trade employ and number of inhabit in the provinc sinc i now saw all the old hous inhabit and mani new on build wherea i rememb well that when i first walkd about the street of

three hundr and fifti thousand pound trade build and inhabit all the while increas tho i now think there ar limit beyond which the quantiti mai be hurt paper monei is a promis to pai it face valu in gold or silver when a state or nation issu more such promis than there is a likelihood of it be abl to redeem the paper repres the promis depreci in valu befor the success of the coloni in the revolut

of great us yet some inconveni occur for want of due care of them the collect after about a year wa separ and each took hi book home again and now i set on foot my first project of a public natur that for a subscript librari i drew up the propos got them put into form by our great scriven brockden and by the help of my friend in the junto procur fifti subscrib of forti shill each to begin with and ten shill a year for fifti year the term our compani wa to continu we afterward obtaind a charter the compani be increas to on hundr thi wa the mother of all the north american subscript librari now so numer it is becom a great thing itself and continu increas these librari have improv the gener convers of the american made the common tradesmen and farmer as intellig as most gentlemen from other

busi till now to think of compli with the request thei contain it might too be much better done if i were at home among my paper which would aid my memori and help to ascertain date but my return be uncertain and have just now a littl leisur i will endeavour to recollect and write what i can if i live to get home it mai there be correct and improvd not have ani copi here of what is alreadi written i know not whether an account is given of the mean i us to establish the philadelphia public librari which from a small begin is now becom so consider though i rememb to have come down to near the time of that transact i will therefor begin here with an account of it which mai be struck out if found to have been alreadi given at the time i establishd myself in pennsylvania there wa not a good booksel shop in ani of the coloni to the southward of boston in new york and philada the printer were inde station thei sold onli paper etc almanac ballad and a few common schoolbook those who lovd read were oblig to send for their book from england the member of the junto had each a few we had left the alehous where we first met and hire a room to hold our club in i proposd that we should all of us bring our book to that room where thei would not onli be readi to consult in our confer but becom a common benefit each of us be at liberti to borrow such as he wishd to read at home thi wa accordingli done and for some time content us find the advantag of thi littl collect i proposd to render the benefit from book more common by commenc a public subscript librari i drew a sketch of the plan and rule that would be necessari and got a skil conveyanc mr charl brockden to put the whole in form of articl of agreement to be subscrib by which each subscrib engagd to pai a certain sum down for the first purchas of book and an annual contribut for increas them so few were the reader at that time in philadelphia and the major of us so poor that i wa not abl with great industri to find more than fifti person mostli young tradesmen will to pai down for thi purpos forti shill each and ten shill per annum on thi littl fund we began the book were import the librari wa open on dai in the week for lend to the subscrib on their promissori note to pai doubl the valu if not duli return the institut soon manifest it util wa imit by other town and in other provinc the librari were augment by donat read becam fashion and our peopl have no publick amus to divert their attent from studi becam better acquaint with book and in a few year were observd by stranger to be better instruct and more intellig than peopl of the same rank gener ar in other countri when we were about to sign the abov mention articl which were to be bind on us our heir etc for fifti year mr brockden the scriven said to us you ar young men but it is scarc probabl that ani of you will live to see the expir of the term fixd in the instrument a number of us howev ar yet live but the instrument wa after a few year render null by a charter that incorpor and gave perpetu to the compani the object and reluct i met with in solicit the subscript made me soon feel the improprieti of present on self as the propos of ani us project that might be supposd to rais on reput in the smallest degre abov that of on neighbour when on ha need of their assist to accomplish that project i therefor put myself as much as i could out of sight and state it as a scheme of a number of friend who had request me to go about and propos it to such as thei thought lover of read in thi wai my affair went on more smoothli and i ever after practisd it on such occas and from my frequent success can heartili recommend it the present littl sacrific of your vaniti will afterward be ampli repaid if it remain a while uncertain to whom the merit belong someon more vain than yourself will be encourag to claim it and then even envi will be dispos to do you justic by pluck those assum feather and restor them to their right owner thi librari afford me the mean of improv by constant studi for which i set apart an hour or two each dai and thu repaird in some degre the loss of the learn educ my father onc intend for me read wa the onli amus i allowd myself i spent no time in tavern game or frolick of ani kind and my industri in my busi continud as indefatig as it wa necessari i wa indebt for my printinghous i had a young

seldom attend ani public worship i had still an opinion of it proprieti and of it util when rightli conduct and i regularli paid my annual subscript for the support of the onli presbyterian minist or

franklin express a differ view about the duti of attend church later at length he took for hi text that vers of the fourth chapter of philippian final brethren whatsoev thing ar true honest just pure love or of good report if there be ani virtu or ani prais think on these thing and i imagind in a sermon on such a text we could not miss of have some moral but he confind himself to five point onli as meant by the apostl viz keep holi the sabbath dai be dilig in read the holi scriptur attend duli the publick worship partak of the sacrament pai a due respect to god minist these might be all good

me so much pain attent and my fault in it vex me so much and i made so littl progress in amend and had such frequent relaps that i wa almost readi to give up the attempt and content myself with a faulti charact in that respect like the man who in bui an ax of a smith my neighbour desir to have the whole of it surfac as bright as the edg the smith consent to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel he turnd while the smith pressd the broad face of the ax hard and heavili on the stone which made the turn of it veri fatigu the man came everi now and then from the wheel to see how

a kind of fopperi in moral which if it were known would make me ridicul that a perfect charact might be attend with the inconveni of be envi and hate and that a benevol man should allow a few fault in

i found myself incorrig with respect to order and now i am grown old and my memori bad i feel veri sensibl the want of it but on the whole tho i never arriv at the perfect i had been so ambiti of

have seem to the eighteenth centuri a system of moral seem to us noth more vital than a collect of the precept of good sens and sound conduct what redeem it from petti in thi book is the scope of power and of us to be seen in franklin himself who set these standard up in all serious and candor for hi own life see galatian chapter v for the christian plan of moral perfect it will be remarkd that tho my scheme wa not wholli without religion there wa in it no mark of ani of the distinguish tenet of ani particular sect i had purpos avoid them for be fulli persuad of the util and excel of my

littl comment on each virtu in which i would have shown the advantag of possess it and the mischief attend it opposit vice and i should have call my book the art of virtu becaus it would have shown the mean and manner of obtain virtu which would have distinguish it from the mere exhort to be good that doe not instruct and indic the mean but is like the apostl man of verbal chariti who onli without show to the nake and hungri how or where thei might get cloth or victual exhort them to be fed and clothedjam ii noth so like to make a man fortun as virtuemarg note but it so happen that my intent of write and publish thi comment wa never fulfil i did inde from time to time put down short hint of the sentiment reason etc to be made us of in it some of which i have still by me but the necessari close attent to privat busi in the earlier part of my life and public busi sinc have occas my postpon it for it be connect in my mind with a great and extens project that requir the whole man to execut and which an unforeseen success of emploi prevent my attend to it ha hitherto remaind unfinishd in thi piec it wa my design to explain and enforc thi doctrin that viciou action ar not hurt becaus thei ar forbidden but forbidden becaus thei ar hurt the natur of man alon consid that it wa therefor everyon interest to be virtuou who wishd to be happi even in thi world and i should from thi circumst there be alwai in the world a number of rich merchant nobil state and princ who have need of honest instrument for the manag of their affair and such be so rare have endeavour to convinc young person that no qualiti were so like to make a poor man fortun as those of probiti and integr my list of virtu containd at first but twelv but a quaker friend have kindli inform me that i wa gener thought proud that my pride showd itself frequent in convers that i wa not content with be in the right when discuss ani point but wa overbear and rather insol of which he convincd me by mention sever instanc i determin endeavour to cure myself if i could of thi vice or folli among the rest and i ad humil to my list give an extens mean to the word i cannot boast of much success in acquir the realiti of thi virtu but i had a good deal with regard to the appear of it i made it a rule to forbear all direct contradict to the sentiment of other and all posit assert of my own i even forbid myself agreeabl to the old law of our junto the us of everi word or express in the languag that import a fixd opinion such as certainli undoubtedli etc and i adopt instead of them i conceiv i apprehend or i imagin a thing to be so or so or it so appear to me at present when anoth assert someth that i thought an error i denyd myself the pleasur of contradict him abruptli and of show immedi some absurd in hi proposit and in answer i began by observ that in certain case or circumst hi opinion would be right but in the present case there appeard or seemd to me some differ etc i soon found the advantag of thi chang in my manner the convers i engagd in went on more pleasantli the modest wai in which i proposd my opinion procurd them a readier recept and less contradict i had less mortif when i wa found to be in the wrong and i more easili prevaild with other to give up their mistak and join with me when i happen to be in the right and thi mode which i at first put on with some violenc to natur inclin becam at length so easi and so habitu to me that perhap for these fifti year past no on ha ever heard a dogmat express escap me and to thi habit after my charact of integr i think it princip ow that i had earli so much weight with my fellowcitizen when i propos new institut or alter in the old and so much influenc in public council when i becam a member for i wa but a bad

such thought as occurrd to me respect it most of these ar lost but i find on purport to be the substanc of an intend creed contain as i thought the essenti of everi known religion and be free of everyth that might shock the professor of ani religion it is expressd in these word viz that there is on god who made all thing that he govern the world by hi provid that he ought to be worship by ador prayer and thanksgiv but that the most accept servic of god is do good to man that the soul is immort and that god will certainli reward virtu and punish vice either here or hereaft my idea at that time were that the sect should be begun and spread at first among young and singl men onli that each person to be initi should not onli declar hi assent to such creed but should have exercis himself with the thirteen week examin and practic of the virtu as in the beforementiond model that the exist of such a societi should be kept a secret till it wa becom consider to prevent solicit for

free as be by the gener practic and habit of the virtu free from the dominion of vice and particularli by the practic of industri and frugal free from debt which expos a man to confin and a speci of slaveri to hi creditor thi is as much as i can now recollect of the project except that i commun it in part to two young men who adopt it with some enthusiasm but my then narrow circumst and the

thought that there is some inconsist in our common mode of teach languag we ar told that it is proper to begin first with the latin and have acquird that it will be more easi to attain those modern languag which ar derivd from it and yet we do not begin with the greek in order more easili to acquir the latin it is true that if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircas without us the step you will more easili gain them in descend but certainli if you begin with the lowest you will with more eas ascend to the top and i would therefor offer it to the consider of those who superintend the educ of our youth whether sinc mani of those who begin with the latin quit the same after spend some year without have made ani great profici and what thei have learnt becom almost useless so that their time ha been lost it would not have been better to have begun with the french proceed to the italian etc for tho after spend the same time thei should quit the studi of languag and never arriv

public affair i began now to turn my thought a littl to public affair begin howev with small matter the citi watch wa on of the first thing that i conceivd to want regul it wa manag by the constabl of the respect ward in turn the constabl warn a number of housekeep to attend him for the night those who chose never to attend paid him six shill a year to be excusd which wa supposd to be for hire substitut but wa in realiti much more than wa necessari for that purpos and made the constableship a place of profit and the constabl for a littl drink often got such ragamuffin about him as a watch that respect housekeep did not choos to mix with walk the round too wa often neglect and most of the night spent in tippl i thereupon wrote a paper to be read in junto repres these irregular but insist more particularli on the inequ of thi sixshil tax of the constabl respect the circumst of those who paid it sinc a poor widow housekeep all whose properti to be guard by the watch did not perhap exce the valu of fifti pound paid as much as the wealthiest merchant who had thousand of pound worth of good in hi store on the whole i propos as a more effectu watch the hire of proper men to serv constantli in that busi and as a more equit wai of support the charg the levi a tax that should be proportiond to the properti thi idea be approvd by the junto wa commun to the other club but as aris in each of them and though the plan wa not immedi carri into execut yet by prepar the mind of peopl for the chang it pave the wai for the law obtain a few year after when the member of our club were grown into more influenc about thi time i wrote a paper first to be read in junto but it wa afterward publishd on the differ accid and careless by which hous were set on fire with caution against them and mean propos of avoid them thi wa much spoken of as a us piec and gave rise to a project which soon follow it of form a compani for the more readi extinguish of fire and mutual assist in remov and secur of good when in danger associ in thi scheme were present found amount to thirti our articl of agreement obligd everi member to keep alwai in good order and fit for us a certain number of leather bucket with strong bag and basket for pack and transport of good which were to be brought to everi fire and we agre to meet onc a month and spend a social even togeth in discours and commun such idea as occur to us upon the subject of fire as might be us in our conduct on such occas the util of thi institut soon appear and mani more desir to be admit than we thought conveni for on compani thei were advis to form anoth which wa accordingli done and thi went on on new compani be form after anoth till thei becam so numer as to includ most of the inhabit who were men of properti and now at the time of my write thi tho upward of fifti year sinc it establish that which i first form call the union fire compani still subsist and flourish tho the first member ar all deceasd but myself and on who is older by a year than i am the small fine that have been paid by member for absenc at the monthli meet have been applyd to the purchas of fireengin ladder firehook and other us implement for each compani so that i question whether there is a citi in the world better provid with the mean of put a stop to begin conflagr and in fact sinc these institut the citi ha never lost by fire more than on or two hous at a time and the flame have often been extinguish befor the hous in which thei began ha been half consum illustr the flame have often been extinguish in arriv among us from ireland the reverend mr whitefield who had made himself remark there as an itiner preacher he wa at first permit to preach in some of our church but the clergi take a dislik to him soon refusd

hous and ground were vest in truste expressli for the us of ani preacher of ani religi persuas who might desir to sai someth to the peopl at philadelphia the design in build not be to accommod ani

larg collect for hi eloqu had a wonder power over the heart and purs of hi hearer of which i myself wa an instanc i did not disapprov of the design but as georgia wa then destitut of materi and workmen and it wa propos to send them from philadelphia at a great expens i thought it would have been better to have built the hous here and brought the children to it thi i advisd but he wa resolut in hi first project reject my counsel and i therefor refusd to contribut i happen soon after to attend on of hi sermon in the cours of which i perceiv he intend to finish with a collect and i silent resolv he should get noth from me i had in my pocket a hand of copper monei three or four silver dollar and five pistol in gold as he proceed i began to soften and conclud to give the copper anoth stroke of hi oratori made me ashamd of that and determind me to give the silver and he finishd so admir that i emptyd my pocket wholli into the collector dish gold and all at thi sermon there wa also on of our club who be of my sentiment respect the build in georgia and suspect a collect might be intend had by precaut empti hi pocket befor he came from home toward the conclus of the discours howev he felt a strong desir to give and applyd to a neighbour who stood near him to borrow some monei for the purpos the applic wa unfortun made to perhap the onli man in the compani who had the firm not to be affect by the preacher hi answer wa at ani other time friend hopkinson i would lend to thee freeli but not now for thee seem to be out of thy right sens some of mr whitefield enemi affect to

when thei receiv ani favour to shift the burden of the oblig from off their own shoulder and place it in heaven i had contrivd to fix it on earth the last time i saw mr whitefield wa in london when he consult me about hi orphan hous concern and hi purpos of appropri it to the establish of a colleg he had a loud and clear voic and articul hi word and sentenc so perfectli that he might be heard and understood at a great distanc especi as hi auditori howev numer observd the most exact silenc he preachd on even from the top of the courthous step which ar in the middl of marketstreet and on the west side of secondstreet which cross it at right angl both street were filld with hi hearer to a consider distanc be among the hindmost in marketstreet i had the curios to learn how far he could be heard by retir backward down the street toward the river and i found hi voic distinct till i came near frontstreet when some nois in that street obscurd it imagin then a semicircl of which my distanc should be the radiu and that it were filld with auditor to each of whom i allowd two squar feet i comput that he might well be heard by more than thirti thousand thi reconcild me to the newspap

gave great advantag to hi enemi unguard express and even erron opinion deliv in preach might have been afterward explaind or qualifid by suppos other that might have accompanid them or thei might have been denyd but litera scripta manet critic attackd hi write violent and with so much appear of reason as to diminish the number of hi votari and prevent their increas so that i am of opinion if he had never written anyth he would have left behind him a much more numer and import sect and hi reput might in that case have been still grow even after hi death as there be noth of hi write on which to

prepar with which the hous had long been harassd thei might have been pleasd if i would voluntarili have left them but thei did not care to displac me on account mere of my zeal for the associ and thei could not well give anoth reason inde i had some caus to believ that the defens of the countri wa not disagre to ani of them provid thei were not requird to assist in it and i found that a much greater number of them than i could have imagin tho against offens war were clearli for the defens mani pamphlet pro and con were publishd on the subject and some by good quaker in favour of defens which i believ convincd most of their younger peopl a transact in our fire compani gave me some insight into their prevail sentiment it had been proposd that we should encourag the scheme for build a batteri by lai out the present stock then about sixti pound in ticket of the lotteri by our rule no monei could be disposd of till the next meet after the propos the compani consist of thirti member of which twentytwo were quaker and eight onli of other persuas we eight punctual attend the meet but tho we thought that some of the quaker would join us we were by no mean sure of a major onli on quaker mr jame morri appeard to oppos the measur he express much sorrow that it had ever been proposd as he said friend were all against it and it would creat such discord as might break up the compani we told him that we saw no reason for that we were the minor and if friend were against the measur and outvot us we must and should agreeabl to the usag of all societi submit when the hour for busi arrivd it wa movd to put the vote he allowd we might then do it by the rule but as he could assur us that a number of member intend to be present for the purpos of oppos it it would be but candid to allow a littl time for their appear while we were disput thi a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desird to speak with me i went down and found thei were two of our quaker member thei told me there were eight of them assembl at a tavern just by that thei were determind to come and vote with us if there should be occas which thei hopd would not be the case and desird we would not call for their assist if we could do without it as their vote for such a measur might embroil them with their elder and friend be thu secur of a major i went up and after a littl seem hesit agre to a delai of anoth hour thi mr morri allowd to be extreamli fair not on of hi oppos friend appeard at which he expressd great surpriz and at the expir of the hour we carrid the resolut eight to on and as of the twentytwo quaker eight were readi to vote with us and thirteen by their absenc manifest that thei were not inclind to oppos the measur i afterward estim the proport of quaker sincer against defens as on to twentyon onli for these were all regular member of that societi and in good reput among them and had due notic of what wa proposd at that meet the honor and learn mr logan who had alwai been of that sect wa on who wrote an address to them declar hi approb of defens war and support hi opinion by mani strong argument he put into my hand sixti pound to be laid out in lotteri ticket for the batteri with direct to appli what prize might be drawn wholli to that servic he told me the follow anecdot of hi old master william penn respect defens he came over from england when a young man with that proprietari and as hi secretari it wa wartim and their ship wa chasd by an arm vessel supposd to be an enemi their captain prepard for defens but told william penn and hi compani of quaker that he did not expect their assist and thei might retir into the cabin which thei did except jame logan who chose to stai upon deck and wa quarterd to a gun the supposd enemi provd a friend so there wa no fight but when the secretari went down to commun the intellig william penn rebukd him sever for stai upon deck and undertak to assist in defend the vessel contrari to the principl of friend especi as it had not been requir by the captain thi reproof be befor all the compani piqud the secretari who answerd i be thy servant why did thee not order me to come down but thee wa will enough that i should stai and help to fight the ship when thee thought there wa danger jame logan came to america with william penn in and wa the busi agent for the penn famili he bequeath hi valuabl librari preserv at hi countri seat senton to the citi of philadelphiasmyth my be mani year in the assembl the major of which were constantli quaker gave me frequent opportun of see the embarrass given them by their principl against war whenev applic wa made to them by order of the crown to grant aid for militari purpos thei were unwil to offend govern on the on hand by a direct refus and their friend the bodi of the quaker on the other by complianc contrari to their principl henc a varieti of evas to avoid compli and mode of disguis the complianc when it becam unavoid the common mode at last wa to grant monei under the phrase of it be for the king us and never to inquir how it wa appli but if the demand wa not directli from the crown that phrase wa found not so proper and some other wa to be invent as when powder wa want i think it wa for the garrison at louisburg and the govern of new england solicit a grant of some from pennsylvania which wa much urgd on the hous by governor thoma thei could not grant monei to bui powder becaus that wa an ingredi of war but thei vote an aid to new england of three thousand pound to be put into the hand of the governor and appropri it for the purchas of bread flour wheat or other grain some of the council desir of give the hous still further embarrass advisd the governor not to accept provis as not be the thing he had demand but he replid i shall take the monei for i understand veri well their mean other grain is gunpowd which he accordingli bought and thei never object to it see the votesmarg note it wa in allus to thi fact that when in our fire compani we fear the success of our propos in favour of the lotteri and i had said to my friend mr syng on of our member if we fail let us move the purchas of a fireengin with the monei the quaker can have no object to that and then if you nomin me and i you as a committe for that purpos we will bui a great gun which is certainli a fireengin i see sai he you have improvd by be so long in the assembl your equivoc project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain these embarrass that the quaker sufferd from have establishd and publish it as on of their principl that no kind of war wa law and which be onc publish thei could not afterward howev thei might chang their mind easili get rid of remind me of what i think a more prudent conduct in anoth sect among us that of the dunker i wa acquaint with on of it founder michael welfar soon after it appeard he complaind to me that thei were grievous calumni by the zealot of other persuas and chargd with abomin principl and practic to which thei were utter stranger i told him thi had alwai been the case with new sect and that to put a stop to such abus i imagind it might be well to publish the articl of their belief and the rule of their disciplin he said that it had been proposd among them but not agre to for thi reason when we were first drawn togeth as a societi sai he it had pleas god to enlighten our mind so far as to see that some doctrin which we onc esteem truth were error and that other which we had esteem error were real truth from time to time he ha been pleas to afford us farther light and our principl have been improv and our error diminish now we ar not sure that we ar arriv at the end of thi progress and at the perfect of spiritu or theolog knowledg and we fear that if we should onc print our confess of faith we should feel ourselv as if bound and confind by it and perhap be unwil to receiv further improv and our successor still more so as conceiv what we their elder and founder had done to be someth sacr never to be depart from thi modesti in a sect is perhap a singular instanc in the histori of mankind everi other sect suppos itself in possess of all truth and that those who differ ar so far in the wrong like a man travel in foggi weather those at some distanc befor him on the road he see wrap up in the fog as well as those behind him and also the peopl in the field on each side but near him all appear clear tho in truth he is as much in the fog as ani of them to avoid thi kind of embarrass the quaker have of late year been gradual declin the public servic in the assembl and in the magistraci choos rather to quit their power than their principl in order of time i should have mention befor that have in invent an open stove for the better warm of room and at the same time save fuel as the fresh air admit wa warm in enter i made a present of the model to mr robert grace on of my earli friend who have an ironfurnac found the cast of the plate for these stove a profit thing as thei were grow in demand to promot that demand i wrote and publish a pamphlet entitl an account of the newinv pennsylvania fireplac wherein their construct and manner of oper is particularli explain their advantag abov everi other method of warm room demonstr and all object that have been rais against the us of them answer and obviat etc thi pamphlet had a good effect govr thoma wa so pleasd with the construct of thi stove as describ in it that he offer to give me a patent for the sole vend of them for a term of year but i declind it from a principl which ha ever weigh with me on such occas viz that as we enjoi great advantag from the invent of other we should be glad of an opportun to serv other by ani invent of our and thi we should do freeli and gener the franklin stove is still in us warwick furnac chester counti pennsylvania across the schuylkil river from pottstown an ironmong in london howev assum a good deal of my pamphlet and work it up into hi own and make some small chang in the machin which rather hurt it oper got a patent for it there and made as i wa told a littl fortun by it and thi is not the onli instanc of patent taken out for my invent by other tho not alwai with the same success which i never contest as have no desir of profit by patent myself and hate disput the us of these fireplac in veri mani hous both of thi and the neighbour coloni ha been and is a great save of wood to the inhabit xiii public servic and duti peac be conclud and the associ busi therefor at an end i turnd my thought again to the affair of establish an academi the first step i took wa to associ in the design a number of activ friend of whom the junto furnish a good part the next wa to write and publish a pamphlet entitl propos relat to the educ of youth in pennsylvania thi i distribut among the princip inhabit grati and as soon as i could suppos their mind a littl prepar by the perus of it i set on foot a subscript for open and support an academi it wa to be paid in quota yearli for five year by so divid it i judgd the subscript might be larger and i believ it wa so amount to no less if i rememb right than five thousand pound in the introduct to these propos i state their public not as an act of mine but of some publickspirit gentlemen avoid as much as i could accord to my usual rule the present myself to the publick as the author of ani scheme for their benefit the subscrib to carri the project into immedi execut chose out of their number twentyfour truste and appoint mr franci then attorneygener and myself to draw up constitut for the govern of the academi which be done and sign a hous wa hire master engagd and the school open i think in the same year tench franci uncl of sir philip franci emigr from england to maryland and becam attornei for

for a piec of ground properli situat with intent to build when provid threw into our wai a larg hous readi built which with a few alter might well serv our purpos thi wa the build befor mention erect by the hearer of mr whitefield and wa obtain for us in the follow manner it is to be note that the contribut to thi build be made by peopl of differ sect care wa taken in the nomin of truste in whom the build and ground wa to be vest that a predomin should not be given to ani sect lest in time that predomin might be a mean of appropri the whole to the us of such sect contrari to the origin intent it wa therefor that on of each sect wa appoint viz on churchofengland man on presbyterian on baptist on moravian etc those in case of vacanc by death were to fill it by elect from among the contributor the moravian happend not to pleas hi colleagu and on hi death thei resolv to have no other of that sect the difficulti then wa how to avoid have two of some other sect by mean of the new choic sever person were name and for that reason not agre to at length on mentiond me with the observ that i wa mere an honest man and of no sect at all which prevail with them to chuse me the enthusiasm which exist when the hous wa built had long sinc abatd and it truste had not been abl to procur fresh contribut for pai the groundrent and discharg some other debt the build had occasiond

more pleasur or wherein after think of it i more easili excusd myself for have made some us of cun it wa about thi time that anoth projector the rev gilbert tennent came to me with a request that i would assist him in procur a subscript for erect a new meetinghous it wa to be for the us of a congreg he had gather among the presbyterian who were origin discipl of mr whitefield unwil to make

will give anyth or not and show them the list of those who have given and lastli do not neglect those who you ar sure will give noth for in some of them you mai be mistaken he laughd and thankd me and said he would take my advic he did so for he askd of everybodi and he obtaind a much larger sum than he expect with which he erect the capaci and veri eleg meetinghous that stand in archstreet gilbert tennent came to america with hi father rev william tennent and taught for a time in the log colleg from which sprang the colleg of new jerseysmyth our citi tho laid out with a beauti regular the street larg straight and cross each other at right angl had the disgrac of suffer those street to remain long unpavd and in wet weather the wheel of heavi carriag ploughd them into a quagmir so that it wa difficult to cross them and in dry weather the dust wa offens i had livd near what wa calld the jersei market and saw with pain the inhabit wade in mud while purchas their provis a strip of ground down the middl of that market wa at length pavd with brick so that be onc in the market thei had firm foot but were often over shoe in dirt to get there by talk and write on the subject i wa at length instrument in get the street pavd with stone between the market and the brickd footpav that wa on each side next the hous thi for some time gave an easi access to the market dryshod but the rest of the street not be pavd whenev a carriag came out of the mud upon thi pavement it shook off and left it dirt upon it and it wa soon coverd with mire which wa not removd the citi as yet have no scaveng after some inquiri i found a poor industri man who wa will to undertak keep the pavement clean by sweep it twice a week carri off the dirt from befor all the neighbour door for the sum of sixpenc per month to be paid by each hous i then wrote and print a paper set forth the advantag to the neighbourhood that might be obtaind by thi small expens the greater eas in keep our hous clean so much dirt not be brought in by peopl feet the benefit to the shop by more custom etc etc as buyer could more easili get at them and by not have in windi weather the dust blown in upon their good etc etc i sent on of these paper to each hous and in a dai or two went round to see who would subscrib an agreement to pai these sixpenc it wa unanim signd and for a time well execut all the inhabit of the citi were delight with the cleanli of the pavement that surround the market it be a conveni to all and thi raisd a gener desir to have all the street pave and made the peopl more will to submit to a tax for that purpos after some time i drew a bill for pave the citi and brought it into the assembl it wa just befor i went to england in and did not pass till i wa gone and then with an alter in the mode of assess which i thought not for the better but with an addit provis for light as well as pave the street which wa a great improv it wa by a privat person the late mr john clifton hi give a sampl of the util of lamp by place on at hi door that the peopl were first impressd with the idea of enlight all the citi the honour of thi public benefit ha also been ascribd to me but it belong truli to that gentleman i did but follow hi exampl and have onli some merit to claim respect the form of our lamp as differ from the globe lamp we were at first supplyd with from london those we found inconveni in these respect thei admit no air below the smoke therefor did not readili go out abov but circul in the globe lodgd on it insid and soon obstruct the light thei were intend to afford give besid the daili troubl of wipe them clean and an accident stroke on on of them would demolish it and render it total useless i therefor suggest the compos them of four flat pane with a long funnel abov to draw up the smoke and crevic admit air below to facilit the ascent of the smoke by thi mean thei were kept clean and did not grow dark in a few hour as the london lamp do but continud bright till morn and an accident stroke would gener break but a singl pane easili repaird i have sometim wonderd that the london did not from the effect hole in the bottom of the globe lamp usd at vauxhal have in keep them clean learn to have such hole in their street lamp but these hole be made for anoth purpos viz to commun flame more suddenli to the wick by a littl flax hang down thro them the other us of let in air seem not to have been thought of and therefor after the lamp have been lit a few hour the street of london ar veri poorli illumin see vote vauxhal garden onc a popular and fashion london resort situat on the thame abov lambeth the garden were close in but thei will alwai be rememb becaus of sir roger de coverlei visit to them in the spectat and from the descript in smollett humphri clinker and thackerai vaniti fair the mention of these improv put me in mind of on i proposd when in london to dr fothergil who wa among the best men i have known and a great promot of us project i had observd that the street when dry were never swept and the light dust carri awai but it wa sufferd to accumul till wet weather reducd it to mud and then after ly some dai so deep on the pavement that there wa no cross but in path kept clean by poor peopl with broom it wa with great labour rakd togeth and thrown up into cart open abov the side of which suffer some of the slush at everi jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall sometim to the annoy of footpasseng the reason given for not sweep the dusti street wa that the dust would fly into the window of shop and hous illustr a poor woman sweep my pavement with a birch broom an accident occurr had instruct me how much sweep might be done in a littl time i found at my door in cravenstreet on morn a poor woman sweep my pavement with a birch broom she appear veri pale and feebl as just come out of a fit of sick i askd who employd her to sweep there she said nobodi but i am veri poor and in distress and i sweep befor gentlefolks door and hope thei will give me someth i bid her sweep the whole street clean and i would give her a shill thi wa at nine oclock at she came for the shill from the slow i saw at first in her work i could scarc believ that the work wa done so soon and sent my servant to examin it who report that the whole street wa swept perfectli clean and all the dust placd in the gutter which wa in the middl and the next rain washd it quit awai so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectli clean a short street near chare cross london i then judgd that if that feebl woman could sweep such a street in three hour a strong activ man might have done it in half the time and here let me remark the conveni of have but on gutter in such a narrow street run down it middl instead of two on on each side near the footwai for where all the rain that fall on a street run from the side and meet in the middl it form there a current strong enough to wash awai all the mud it meet with but when divid into two channel it is often too weak to cleans either and onli make the mud it find more fluid so that the wheel of carriag and feet of hors throw and dash it upon the footpav which is therebi render foul and slipperi and sometim splash it upon those who ar walk my propos commun to the good doctor wa as follow for the more effectu clean and keep clean the street of london and westminst it is propos that the sever watchmen be contract with to have the dust swept up in dry season and the mud rakd up at other time each in the sever street and lane of hi round that thei be furnishd with broom and other proper instrument for these purpos to be kept at their respect stand readi to furnish the poor peopl thei mai emploi in the servic that in the dry summer month the dust be all swept up into heap at proper distanc befor the shop and window of hous ar usual open when the scaveng with closecov cart shall also carri it all awai that the mud when rakd up be not left in heap to be spread abroad again by the wheel of carriag and trampl of hors but that the scaveng be provid with bodi of cart not placd high upon wheel but low upon slider with lattic bottom which be coverd with straw will retain the mud thrown into them and permit the water to drain from it wherebi it will becom much lighter water make the greatest part of it weight these bodi of cart to be placd at conveni distanc and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrow thei remain where placd till the mud is draind and then hors brought to draw them awai i have sinc had doubt of the practic of the latter part of thi propos on account of the narrow of some street and the difficulti of place the drainingsl so as not to encumb too much the passag but i am still of opinion that the former requir the dust to be swept up and carryd awai befor the shop ar open is veri practic in the summer when the dai ar long for in walk thro the strand and fleetstreet on morn at seven oclock i observd there wa not on shop open tho it had been daylight and the sun up abov three hour the inhabit of london chuse voluntarili to live much by candlelight and sleep by sunshin and yet often complain a littl absurdli of the duti on candl and the high price of tallow some mai think these trifl matter not worth mind or relat but when thei consid that tho dust blown into the ey of a singl person or into a singl shop on a windi dai is but of small import yet the great number of the instanc in a popul citi and it frequent repetit give it weight and consequ perhap thei will not censur veri sever those who bestow some attent to affair of thi seemingli low natur human felic is produc not so much by great piec of good fortun that seldom happen as by littl advantag that occur everi dai thu if you teach a poor young man to shave

luckili for me a few dai befor the battl and he returnd me immedi an order on the paymast for the round sum of on thousand pound leav the remaind to the next account i consid thi payment as good luck have never been abl to obtain that remaind of which more hereaft thi gener wa i think a brave man and might probabl have made a figur as a good offic in some european war but he had too much selfconfid too high an opinion of the valid of regular troop and too mean a on of both american and indian georg croghan our indian interpret joind him on hi march with on hundr of those peopl who

hi intend progress after take fort duquesn sai he i am to proce to niagara and have taken that to frontenac if the season will allow time and i suppos it will for duquesn can hardli detain me abov three or four dai and then i see noth that can obstruct my march to niagara have befor revolvd in my mind the long line hi armi must make in their march by a veri narrow road to be cut for them thro the wood and bush and also what i had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundr french who invad the iroquoi countri i had conceivd some doubt and some fear for the event of the campaign but i venturd onli to sai to be sure sir if you arriv well befor duquesn with these fine troop so well provid with artilleri that place not yet complet fortifi and as we hear with no veri strong garrison can probabl make but a short resist the onli danger i apprehend of obstruct to your march is from ambuscad of indian who by constant practic ar dexter in lai and execut them and the slender line near four mile long which your armi must make mai expos it to be attackd by surpris in it flank and to be cut like a thread into sever piec which from their distanc cannot come up in time to support each other pittsburg kingston at the eastern end of lake ontario he smild at my ignor and replyd these savag mai inde be a formid enemi to your raw american militia but upon the king regular and disciplind troop sir it is imposs thei should make ani impress i wa consciou of an improprieti in my disput with a militari man in matter of hi profess and said no more the enemi howev did not take the advantag of hi armi which i apprehend it long line of march exposd it to but let it advanc without interrupt till within nine mile of the place and then when more in a bodi for it had just pass a river where the front had halt till all were come over and in a more open part of the wood than ani it had passd attackd it advanc guard by heavi fire from behind tree and bush which wa the first intellig the gener

them were kill and then be seizd with a panick the whole fled with precipit illustr the onli danger i apprehend of obstruct to your march is from ambuscad of indian the waggon took each a hors out of hi team and scamperd their exampl wa immedi follow by other so that all the waggon provis artilleri and store were left to the enemi the gener be wound wa brought off with difficulti hi secretari mr shirlei wa kill by hi side and out of eightysix offic sixtythre were kill or wound and seven hundr and fourteen men kill out of eleven hundr these eleven hundr had been pick men from the whole armi the rest had been left behind with colonel dunbar who wa to follow with the heavier part of the store provis and baggag the flyer not be pursud arrivd at dunbar camp and the panick thei brought with them instantli seizd him and all hi peopl and tho he had now abov on thousand men and the enemi who had beaten braddock did not at most exce four hundr indian and french togeth instead of proceed and endeavour to recov some of the lost honour he order all the store ammunit etc to be destroyd that he might have more hors to assist hi flight toward the settlement and less lumber to remov he wa there met with request from the governor of virginia maryland and pennsylvania that he would post hi troop on the frontier so as to afford some protect to the inhabit but he continu hi hasti march thro all the countri not think himself safe till he arriv at philadelphia where the inhabit could protect him thi whole transact gave us american the first suspicion that our exalt idea of the prowess of british regular had not been well found other account of thi expedit and defeat mai be found in fisk washington and hi countri or lodg georg washington vol in their first march too from their land till thei got beyond the settlement thei had plunder and strip the inhabit total ruin some poor famili besid insult abus and confin the peopl if thei remonstr thi wa enough to put us out of conceit of such defend if we had realli want ani how differ wa the conduct of our french friend in who dure a march thro the most inhabit part of our countri from rhode island to virginia near seven hundr mile occas not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig a chicken or even an appl captain orm who wa on of the gener aidsdecamp and be grievous wound wa brought off with him and continud with him to hi death which happend in a few dai told me that he wa total silent all the first dai and at night onli said who would have thought it that he wa silent again the follow dai sai onli at last we shall better know how to deal with them anoth time and dyd in a few minut after the secretari paper with all the gener order instruct and correspond fall into the enemi hand thei select and translat into french a number of the articl which thei print to prove the hostil intent of the british court befor the declar of war among these i saw some letter of the gener to the ministri speak highli of the

he be at philadelphia on hi retreat or rather flight i applyd to him for the discharg of the servant of three poor farmer of lancast counti that he had enlist remind him of the late gener order on that head he promis me that if the master would come to him at trenton where he should be in a few dai on hi march to new york he would there deliv their men to them thei accordingli were at the expens and troubl of go to trenton and there he refusd to perform hi promis to their great loss and disappoint as soon as the loss of the waggon and hors wa gener known all the owner came upon me for the valuat which i had given bond to pai their demand gave me a great deal of troubl my acquaint them that the monei wa readi in the paymast hand but that order for pai it must first be obtain from gener shirlei and my assur them that i had applyd to that gener by letter but he be at a distanc an answer could not soon be receivd and thei must have patienc all thi wa not suffici to satisfi and some began to sue me gener shirlei at length reliev me from thi terribl situat by appoint commission to examin the claim and order payment thei amount to near twenti thousand pound which to pai would

where a fort wa thot more immedi necessari the moravian procurd me five waggon for our tool store baggag etc just befor we left bethlehem eleven farmer who had been driven from their plantat by the indian came to me request a suppli of firearm that thei might go back and fetch off their cattl i gave them each a gun with suitabl ammunit we had not marchd mani mile befor it began to rain and it continu rain all dai there were no habit on the road to shelter us till we arrivd near night at the hous of a german where and in hi barn we were all huddl togeth as wet as water could make us it wa well we were not attackd in our march for our arm were of the most ordinari sort and our men could not keep their gun lock dry the indian ar dexter in contriv for that purpos which we had not thei met

of a spark struck from flint and steel into powder prime in an open pan illustr we had not marchd mani mile befor it began to rain the next dai be fair we continud our march and arrivd at the desol gnadenhut there wa a sawmil near round which were left sever pile of board with which we soon hut ourselv an oper the more necessari at that inclement season as we had no tent our first work wa to buri more effectu the dead we found there who had been half interrd by the countri peopl the next morn our fort wa plannd and markd out the circumfer measur four hundr and fiftyf feet which would requir as mani palisad to be made of tree on with anoth of a foot diamet each our ax of which we had seventi were immedi set to work to cut down tree and our men be dexter in the us of them great despatch wa made see the tree fall so fast i had the curios to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine in six minut thei had it upon the ground and i found it of fourteen inch diamet each pine made three palisad of eighteen feet long point at on end while these were prepar our other men dug a trench all round of three feet deep in which the palisad were to be plant and our waggon the bodi be taken off and the fore and hind wheel separ by take out the pin which unit the two part of the perch we had ten carriag with two hors each to bring the palisad from the wood to the spot when thei were set up our carpent built a stage illustr our ax were immedi set to work to cut down tree of board all round within about six feet high for the men to stand on when to fire thro the loophol we had on swivel gun which we mount on on of the angl and fird it as soon as fixd to let the indian know if ani were within hear that we had such piec and thu our fort if such a magnific name mai be given to so miser a stockad wa finishd in a week though it raind so hard everi other dai that the men could not work here the pole connect the front and rear wheel of a wagon thi gave me occas to observ that when men ar employd thei ar best contentd for on the dai thei work thei were goodnaturd and cheer and with the conscious of have done a good dai work thei spent the even jollili but on our idl dai thei were mutin and quarrelsom find fault with their pork the bread etc and in continu illhumour which put me in mind of a seacaptain whose rule it wa to keep hi men constantli at work and when hi mate onc told him that thei had done everyth and there wa noth further to emploi them about oh sai he make them scour the anchor thi kind of fort howev contempt is a suffici defens against indian who have no cannon find ourselv now post secur and have a place to retreat to on occas we venturd out in parti to scour the adjac countri we met with no indian but we found the place on the neighbour hill where thei had lain to watch our proceed there wa an art in their contriv of those place that seem worth mention it be winter a fire wa necessari for them but a common fire on the surfac of the ground would by it light have discoverd their posit at a distanc thei had therefor dug hole in the ground about three feet diamet and somewhat deeper we saw where thei had with their hatchet cut off the charcoal from the side of burnt log ly in the wood with these coal thei had made small fire in the bottom of the hole and we observd among the weed and grass the print of their bodi made by their lai all round with their leg hang down in the hole to keep their feet warm which with them is an essenti point thi kind of fire so managd could not discov them either by it light flame spark or even smoke it appeard that their number wa not great and it seem thei saw we were too mani to be attack by them with prospect of advantag we had for our chaplain a zealou presbyterian minist mr beatti who complain to me that the men did not gener attend hi prayer and exhort when thei enlist thei were promis besid pai and provis a gill of rum a dai which wa punctual servd out to them half in the morn and the other half in the even and i observ thei were as punctual in attend to receiv it upon which i said to mr beatti it is perhap below the digniti of your profess to act as steward of the rum but if you were to deal it out and onli just after prayer you would have them all about you he like the thot undertook the offic and with the help of a few hand to measur out the liquor execut it to satisfact and never were prayer more gener and more punctual attend so that i thought thi method prefer to the punish inflict by some militari law for nonattend on divin servic i had hardli finishd thi busi and got my fort well stord with provis when i receivd a letter from the governor acquaint me that he had calld the assembl and wish my attend there if the postur of affair on the frontier wa such that my remain there wa no longer necessari my friend too of the assembl press me by their letter to be if possibl at the meet and my three intend fort be now compleat and the inhabit content to remain on their farm under that protect i resolv to return the more willingli as a new england offic colonel clapham experienc in indian war be on a visit to our establish consent to accept the command i gave him a commiss and parad the garrison had it read befor them and introducd him to them as an offic who from hi skill in militari affair wa much more fit to command them than myself and give them a littl exhort took my leav i wa escort as far as bethlehem where i rest a few dai to recov from the fatigu i had undergon the first night be in a good bed i could hardli sleep it wa so differ from my hard lodg on the floor of our hut at gnaden wrapt onli in a blanket or two while at bethlehem i inquird a littl into the practic of the moravian some of them had accompani me and all were veri kind to me i found thei workd for a common stock at at common tabl and slept in common dormitori great number togeth in the dormitori i observ loophol at certain distanc all along just under the ceil which i thought judici place for chang of air i wa at their church where i wa entertaind with good musick the organ be accompani with violin hautboi flute clarinet etc i understood that their sermon were not usual preach to mix congreg of men women and children as is our common practic but that thei assembl sometim the marri men at other time their wive then the young men the young women and the littl children each divis by itself the sermon i heard wa to the latter who came in and were placd in row on bench the boi under the conduct of a young man their tutor and the girl conduct by a young woman the discours seemd well adapt to their capac and wa deliv in a pleas familiar manner coax them as it were to be good thei behavd veri orderli but look pale and unhealthi which made me suspect thei were kept too much within door or not allowd suffici exercis i inquird concern the moravian marriag whether the report wa true that thei were by lot i wa told that lot were usd onli in particular case that gener when a young man found himself disposd to marri he informd the elder of hi class who consult the elder ladi that governd the young women as these elder of the differ sex were well acquaint with the temper and disposit of their respect pupil thei could best judg what match were suitabl and their judgment were gener acquiescd in but if for exampl it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equal proper for the young man the lot wa then recur to i object if the match ar not made by the mutual choic of the parti some of them mai chanc to be veri unhappi and so thei mai answerd my inform if you let the parti chuse for themselv which inde i could not deni be return to philadelphia i found the associ went on swimmingli the inhabit that were not quaker have pretti gener come into it form themselv into compani and chose their captain lieuten and ensign accord to the new law dr b visit me and gave me an account of the pain he had taken to spread a gener good like to the law and ascrib much to those endeavour i had had the vaniti to ascrib all to my dialogu howev not know but that he might be in the right i let him enjoi hi opinion which i take to be gener the best wai in such case the offic meet chose me to be colonel of the regiment which i thi time accept i forget how mani compani we had but we parad about twelv hundr welllook men with a compani of artilleri who had been furnish with six brass fieldpiec which thei had becom so expert in the us of as to fire twelv time in a minut the first time i review my regiment thei accompani me to my hous and would salut me with some round fire befor my door which shook down and broke sever glass of my electr apparatu and my new honour prove not much less brittl for all our commiss were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in england dure thi short time of my colonelship be about to set out on a journei to virginia the offic of my regiment took it into their head that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town as far as the lower ferri just as i wa get on horseback thei came to my door between thirti and forti mount and all in their uniform i had not been previous acquaint with the project or i should have prevent it be natur avers to the assum of state on ani occas and i wa a good deal chagrind at their appear as i could not avoid their accompani me what made it wors wa that as soon as we began to move thei drew their sword and rode with them nake all the wai somebodi wrote an account of thi to the proprietor and it gave him great offens no such honour had been paid him when in the provinc nor to ani of hi governor and he said it wa onli proper to princ of the blood royal which mai be true for aught i know who wa and still am ignor of the etiquett in such case thi silli affair howev greatli increas hi rancour against me which wa befor not a littl on account of my conduct in the assembl respect the exempt of hi estat from taxat which i had alwai opposd veri warmli and not without sever reflect on hi mean and injustic of contend for it he accus me to the ministri as be the great obstacl to the king servic prevent by my influenc in the hous the proper form of the bill for rais monei and he instanc thi parad with my offic as a proof of my have an intent to take the govern of the provinc out of hi hand by forc he also appli to sir everard fawken the postmastergener to depriv me of my offic but it had no other effect than to procur from sir everard a gentl admonit notwithstand the continu wrangl between the governor and the hous in which i as a member had so larg a share there still subsist a civil intercours between that gentleman and myself and we never had ani person differ i have sometim sinc thought that hi littl or no resent against me for the answer it wa known i drew up to hi messag might be the effect of profession habit and that be bred a lawyer he might consid us both as mere advoc for contend client in a suit he for the proprietari and i for the assembl he would therefor sometim call in a friendli wai to advis with me on difficult point and sometim tho not often take my advic we act in concert to suppli braddock armi with provis and when the shock new arriv of hi defeat the governor sent in hast for me to consult with him on measur for prevent the desert of the back counti i forget now the advic i gave but i think it wa that dunbar should be written to and prevaild with if possibl to post hi troop on the frontier for their protect till by reinforc from the coloni he might be abl to proce on the expedit and after my return from the frontier he would have had me undertak the conduct of such an expedit with provinci troop for the reduct of fort duquesn dunbar and hi men be otherwis emploi and he propos to commiss me as gener i had not so good an opinion of my militari abil as he professd to have and i believ hi profess must have exceed hi real sentiment but probabl he might think that my popular would facilit the rais of the men and my influenc in assembl the grant of monei to pai them and that perhap without tax the proprietari estat find me not so forward to engag as he expect the project wa dropt and he soon after left the govern be supersed by captain denni xviii scientif experi befor i proce in relat the part i had in public affair under thi

showd me some electr experi thei were imperfectli performd as he wa not veri expert but be on a subject quit new to me thei equal surprisd and pleas me soon after my return to philadelphia our librari compani receivd from mr p collinson fellow of the royal societi of london a present of a glass tube with some account of the us of it in make such experi i eagerli seiz the opportun of repeat what i had seen at boston and by much practic acquir great readi in perform those also which we had an account of from england ad a number of new on i sai much practic for my hous wa continu full for some time with peopl who came to see these new wonder the royal societi of london for improv natur knowledg wa found in and hold the foremost place among english societi for the advanc of scienc to divid a littl thi incumbr among my friend i caus a number of similar tube to be blown at our glasshous with which thei furnishd themselv so that we had at length sever perform among these the princip wa mr kinnerslei an ingeni neighbour who be out of busi i encourag to undertak show the experi for monei and drew up for him two lectur in which the experi were rangd in such order and accompani with such explan in such method as that the forego should assist in comprehend the follow he procurd an eleg apparatu for the purpos in which all the littl machin that i had roughli made for myself were nice formd by instrumentmak hi lectur were well attend and gave great satisfact and after some time he went thro the coloni exhibit them in everi capit town and pickd up some monei in the west india island inde it wa with difficulti the experi could be made from the gener moistur of the air obligd as we were to mr collinson for hi present of the tube etc i thought it right he should be informd of our success in us it and wrote him sever letter contain account of our experi he got them read in the royal societi where thei were not at first thought worth so much notic as to be print in their transact on paper which i wrote for mr kinnerslei on the same of lightn with electr i sent to dr mitchel an acquaint of mine and on of the member also of that societi who wrote me word that it had been read but wa laugh at by the connoisseur the paper howev be shown to dr fothergil he thought them of too much valu to be stifl and advisd the print of them mr collinson then gave them to cave for

between two person write in differ languag might be lengthen greatli by mistransl and thenc misconcept of on anoth mean much of on of the abb s letter be found on an error in the translat i conclud to

the event gave me no caus to repent my silenc for my friend m le roi of the royal academi of scienc took up my caus and refut him my book wa translat into the italian german and latin languag and the

of ani that howev i had no person enmiti to the proprietari and that whenev the public measur he proposd should appear to be for the good of the peopl no on should espous and forward them more zealous than myself my past opposit have been found on thi that the measur which had been urg were evid intend to serv the proprietari interest with great prejudic to that of the peopl that i wa much oblig to

afterward publishd but between us person no enmiti aros we were often togeth he wa a man of letter had seen much of the world and wa veri entertain and pleas in convers he gave me the first inform that my old friend ja ralph wa still aliv that he wa esteemd on of the best polit writer in england had been emploi in the disput between princ freder and the king and had obtaind a pension of three

with the privileg of the peopl but with the servic of the crown resolvd to petit the king against them and appoint me their agent to go over to england to present and support the petit the hous had sent up a bill to the governor grant a sum of sixti thousand pound for the king us ten thousand pound of which wa subject to the order of the then gener lord loudoun which the governor absolut refusd to pass in complianc with hi instruct i had agre with captain morri of the packet at new york for my passag and my store were put on board when lord loudoun arrivd at philadelphia expressli as he told me to endeavour an accommod between the governor and assembl that hi majesti servic might not be obstruct by their dissens accordingli he desird the governor and myself to meet him that he might hear what wa to be said on both side we met and discuss the busi in behalf of the assembl i urg all the variou argument that mai be found in the public paper of that time which were of my write and ar print with the minut of the assembl and the governor plead hi instruct the bond he had given to observ them and hi ruin if he disobeyd yet seem not unwil to hazard himself if lord loudoun would advis it thi hi lordship did not chuse to do though i onc thought i had nearli prevaild with him to do it but final he rather chose to urg the complianc of the assembl and he entreat me to us my endeavour with them for that purpos declar that he would spare none of the king troop for the defens of our frontier and that if we did not continu to provid for that defens ourselv thei must remain exposd to the enemi i acquaint the hous with what had passd and present them with a set of resolut i had drawn up declar our right and that we did not relinquish our claim to those right but onli suspend the exercis of them on thi occas thro forc against which we protest thei at length agre to drop that bill and frame anoth conform to the proprietari instruct thi of cours the governor passd and i wa then at liberti to proce on my voyag but in the meantim the packet had sail with my seastor which wa some loss to me and my onli recompens wa hi lordship thank for my servic all the credit of obtain the accommod fall to hi share he set out for new york befor me and as the time for dispatch the packetboat wa at hi disposit and there were two then remain there on of which he said wa to sail veri soon i request to know the precis time that i might not miss her by ani delai of mine hi answer wa i have given out that she is to sail on saturdai next but i mai let you know entr nou that if you ar there by mondai morn you will be in time but do not delai longer by some accident hindranc at a ferri it wa mondai noon befor i arriv and i wa much afraid she might have sail as the wind wa fair but i wa soon made easi by the inform that she wa still in the harbor and would not move till the next dai on would imagin that i wa now on the veri point of depart for europ i thought so but i wa not then so well acquaint with hi lordship charact of which indecis wa on of the strongest featur i shall give some instanc it wa about the begin of april that i came to new york and i think it wa near the end of june befor we saild there were then two of the packetboat which had been long in port but were detain for the gener letter which were alwai to be readi tomorrow anoth packet arrivd she too wa detaind and befor we saild a fourth wa expect our wa the first to be dispatchd as have been there longest passeng were engag in all and some extrem impati to be gone and the merchant uneasi about their letter and the order thei had given for insur it be war time for fall good but their anxieti availd noth hi lordship letter were not readi and yet whoever wait on him found him alwai at hi desk pen in hand and conclud he must need write abundantli go myself on morn to pai my respect i found in hi antechamb on inni a messeng of philadelphia who had come from thenc express with a packet from governor denni for the gener he deliv to me some letter from my friend there which occasiond my inquir when he wa to return and where he lodgd that i might send some letter by him he told me he wa orderd to call tomorrow at nine for the gener answer to the governor and should set off immedi i put my letter into hi hand the same dai a fortnight after i met him again in the same place so you ar soon returnd inni returnd no i am not gone yet how so i have call here by order everi morn these two week past for hi lordship letter and it is not yet readi is it possibl when he is so great a writer for i see him constantli at hi escritoir ye sai inni but he is like st georg on the sign alwai on horseback and never ride on thi observ of the messeng wa it seem well found for when in england i understood that mr pitt gave it as on reason for remov thi gener and send gener amherst and wolf that the minist never heard from him and could not know what he wa do william pitt first earl of chatham a great english statesman and orat under hi abl administr england won canada from franc he wa a friend of america at the time of our revolut thi daili expect of sail and all the three packet go down to sandi hook to join the fleet there the passeng thought it best to be on board lest by a sudden order the ship should sail and thei be left behind there if i rememb right we were about six week consum our seastor and obligd to procur more at length the fleet saild the gener and all hi armi on board bound to louisburg with the intent to besieg and take that fortress all the packetboat in compani order to attend the gener ship readi to receiv hi dispatch when thei should be readi we were out five dai befor we got a letter with leav to part and then our ship quit the fleet and steer for england the other two packet he still detain carri them with him to halifax where he stai some time to exercis the men in sham attack upon sham fort then alter hi mind as to besieg louisburg and return to new york with all hi troop togeth with the two packet abov mention and all their passeng dure hi absenc the french and savag had taken fort georg on the frontier of that provinc and the savag had massacr mani of the garrison after capitul i saw afterward in london captain bonnel who command on of those packet he told me that when he had been detaind a month he acquaint hi lordship that hi ship wa grown foul to a degre that must necessarili hinder her fast sail a point of consequ for a packetboat and request an allow of time to heav her down and clean her bottom he wa ask how long time that would requir he answer three dai the gener repli if you can do it in on dai i give leav otherwis not for you must certainli sail the dai after tomorrow so he never obtaind leav though detain afterward from dai to dai dure full three month i saw also in london on of bonnel passeng who wa so enragd against hi lordship for deceiv and detain him so long at new york and then carri him to halifax and back again that he swore he would sue him for damag whether he did or not i never heard but as he repres the injuri to hi affair it wa veri consider on the whole i wonderd much how such a man came to be intrust with so import a busi as the conduct of a great armi but have sinc seen more of the great world and the mean of obtain and motiv for give place my wonder is diminish gener shirlei on whom the command of the armi devolv upon the death of braddock would in my opinion if continu in place have made a much better campaign than that of loudoun in which wa frivol expens and disgrac to our nation beyond concept for tho shirlei wa not a bred soldier he wa sensibl and sagaci in himself and attent to good advic from other capabl of form judici plan and quick and activ in carri them into execut loudoun instead of defend the coloni with hi great armi left them total exposd while he parad idli at halifax by which mean fort georg wa lost besid he derangd all our mercantil oper and distressd our trade by a long embargo on the export of provis on pretenc of keep suppli from be obtaind by the enemi but in realiti for beat down their price in favour of the contractor in whose profit it wa said perhap from suspicion onli he had a share and when at length the embargo wa taken off by neglect to send notic of it to charlestown the carolina fleet wa detaind near three month longer wherebi their bottom were so much damag by the worm that a great part of them founder in their passag home thi relat illustr the corrupt that character english public life in the eighteenth centuri see page it wa gradual overcom in the earli part of the next centuri shirlei wa i believ sincer glad of be reliev from so burdensom a charg as the conduct of an armi must be to a man unacquaint with militari busi i wa at the entertain given by the citi of new york to lord loudoun on hi take upon him the command shirlei tho therebi supersed wa present also there wa a great compani of offic citizen and stranger and some chair have been borrow in the neighborhood there wa on among them veri low which fell to the lot of mr shirlei perceiv it as i sat by him i said thei have given you sir too low a seat no matter sai he mr franklin i find a low seat the easiest while i wa as afor mentiond detaind at new york i receivd all the account of the provis etc that i had furnishd to braddock some of which account could not sooner be obtaind from the differ person i had employd to assist in the busi i present them to lord loudoun desir to be paid the balanc he causd them to be regularli examin by the proper offic who after compar everi articl with it voucher certifi them to be right and the balanc due for which hi lordship promisd to give me an order on the paymast thi wa howev put off from time to time and tho i calld often for it by appoint i did not get it at length just befor my departur he told me he had on better consider conclud not to mix hi account with those of hi predecessor and you sai he when in england have onli to exhibit your account at the treasuri and you will be paid immedi i mentiond but without effect the great and unexpect expens i had been put to by be detaind so long at new york as a reason for my desir to be present paid and on my observ that it wa not right i should be put to ani further troubl or delai in obtain the monei i had advancd as i charg no commiss for my servic o sir sai he you must not think of persuad us that you ar no gainer we understand better those affair and know that everi on concern in suppli the armi find mean in the do it to fill hi own pocket i assurd him that wa not my case and that i had not pocket a farth but he appeard clearli not to believ me and inde i have sinc learnt that immens fortun ar often made in such employ as to my balanc i am not paid it to thi dai of which more hereaft our captain of the paquet had boast much befor we sail of the swift of hi ship unfortun when we came to sea she prove the dullest of ninetysix sail to hi no small mortif after mani conjectur respect the caus when we were near anoth ship almost as dull as our which howev gaind upon us the captain order all hand to come aft and stand as near the ensign staff as possibl we were passeng includ about forti person while we stood there the ship mend her pace and soon left her neighbour far behind which provd clearli what our captain suspect that she wa load too much by the head the cask of water it seem had been all placd forward these he therefor orderd to be movd further aft on which the ship recoverd her charact and prove the best sailer in the fleet the captain said she had onc gone at the rate of thirteen knot which is account thirteen mile per hour we had on board as a passeng captain kennedi of the navi who contend that it wa imposs and that no ship ever sail so fast and that there must have been some error in the divis of the loglin or some mistak in heav the log a wager ensud between the two captain to be decid when there should be suffici wind kennedi thereupon examind rigor the loglin and be satisfid with that he determind to throw the log himself accordingli some dai after when the wind blew veri fair and fresh and the captain of the paquet lutwidg said he believd she then went at the rate of thirteen knot kennedi made the experi and ownd hi wager lost a piec of wood shape and weight so as to keep it stabl when in the water to thi is attach a line knot at regular distanc by these devic it is possibl to tell the speed of a ship the abov fact i give for the sake of the follow observ it ha been remarkd as an imperfect in the art of shipbuild that it can never be known till she is tri whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer for that the model of a goodsail ship ha been exactli followd in a new on which ha provd on the contrari remark dull i apprehend that thi mai partli be occasiond by the differ opinion of seamen respect the mode of lade rig and sail of a ship each ha hi system and the same vessel laden by the judgment and order of on captain shall sail better or wors than when by the order of anoth besid it scarc ever happen that a ship is formd fit for the sea and saild by the same person on man build the hull anoth rig her a third lade and sail her no on of these ha the advantag of know all the idea and experi of the other and therefor cannot draw just conclus from a combin of the whole even in the simpl oper of sail when at sea i have often observd differ judgment in the offic who command the success watch the wind be the same on would have the sail trimmd sharper or flatter than anoth so that thei seemd to have no certain rule to govern by yet i think a set of experi might be institut first to determin the most proper form of the hull for swift sail next the best dimens and properest place for the mast then the form and quantiti of sail and their posit as the wind mai be and lastli the disposit of the lade thi is an ag of experi and i think a set accur made and combind would be of great us i am persuad therefor that er long some ingeni philosoph will undertak it to whom i wish success illustr sail ship we were sever time chasd in our passag but outsaild everi thing and in thirti dai had sound we had a good observ and the captain judgd himself so near our port falmouth that if we made a good run in the night we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morn and by run in the night might escap the notic of the enemi privat who often cruisd near the entranc of the channel accordingli all the sail wa set that we could possibl make and the wind be veri fresh and fair we went right befor it and made great wai the captain after hi observ shapd hi cours as he thought so as to pass wide of the scilli isl but it seem there is sometim a strong indraught set up st georg channel which deceiv seamen and caus the loss of sir cloudeslei shovel squadron thi indraught wa probabl the caus of what happen to us we had a watchman placd in the bow to whom thei often call look well out befor there and he as often answer ay ay but perhap had hi ey shut and wa half asleep at the time thei sometim answer as is said mechan for he did not see a light just befor us which had been hid by the studdingsail from the man at the helm and from the rest of the watch but by an accident yaw of the ship wa discoverd and occasiond a great alarm we be veri near it the light appear to me as big as a cartwheel it wa midnight and our captain fast asleep but captain kennedi jump upon deck and see the danger order the ship to wear round all sail stand an oper danger to the mast but it carri us clear and we escap shipwreck for we were run right upon the rock on which the lighthous wa erect thi deliver impress me strongli with the util of lighthous and made me resolv to encourag the build more of them in america if i should live to return there in the morn it wa found by the sound etc that we were near our port but a thick fog hid the land from our sight about nine oclock the fog began to rise and seemd to be lift up from the water like the curtain at a playhous discov underneath the town of falmouth the vessel in it harbor and the field that surround it thi wa a most pleas spectacl to those who had been so long without ani other prospect than the uniform view of a vacant ocean and it gave us the more pleasur as we were now free from the anxieti which the state of war occasiond i set out immedi with my son for london and we onli stopt a littl by the wai to view stoneheng on salisburi plain and lord pembrok hous and garden with hi veri curiou antiqu at wilton we arriv in london the th of juli a celebr prehistor ruin probabl of a templ built by the earli briton near salisburi england it consist of inner and outer circl of enorm stone some of which ar connect by stone slab here termin the autobiographi as publish by wm templ franklin and hi successor what follow wa written in the last year of dr franklin life and wa never befor print in englishmr bigelow note in hi edit of as soon as i wa settl in a lodg mr charl had provid for me i went to visit dr fothergil to whom i wa strongli recommend and whose counsel respect my proceed i wa advisd to obtain he wa against an immedi complaint to govern and thought the proprietari should first be person applid to who might possibl be inducd by the interposit and persuas of some privat friend to accommod matter amic i then wait on my old friend and correspond mr peter collinson who told me that john hanburi the great virginia merchant had request to be inform when i should arriv that he might carri me to lord granvil who wa then presid of the council and wish to see me as soon as possibl i agre to go with him the next morn accordingli mr hanburi call for me and took me in hi carriag to that nobleman who receivd me with great civil and after some question respect the present state of affair in america and discours thereupon he said to me you american have wrong idea of the natur of your constitut you contend that the king instruct to hi governor ar not law and think yourselv at liberti to regard or disregard them at your own discret but those instruct ar not like the pocket instruct given to a minist go abroad for regul hi conduct in some trifl point of ceremoni thei ar first drawn up by judg learn in the law thei ar then consid debat and perhap amend in council after which thei ar sign by the king thei ar then so far as thei relat to you the law of the land for the king is the legisl of the coloni i told hi lordship thi wa new doctrin to me i had alwai understood from our charter that our law were to be made by our assembl to be present inde to the king for hi royal assent but that be onc given the king could not repeal or alter them and as the assembl could not make perman law without hi assent so neither could he make a law for them without their he assurd me i wa total mistaken i did not think so howev and hi lordship convers have a littl alarmd me as to what might be the sentiment of the court concern us i wrote it down as soon as i returnd to my lodg i recollect that about year befor a claus in a bill brought into parliament by the ministri had proposd to make the king instruct law in the coloni but the claus wa thrown out by the common for which we ador them as our friend and friend of liberti till by their conduct toward us in it seemd that thei had refusd that point of sovereignti to the king onli that thei might reserv it for themselv georg granvil or grenvil as english premier from to he introduc the direct taxat of the american coloni and ha sometim been call the immedi caus of the revolut thi whole passag show how hopelessli diverg were the english and american view on the relat between the mother countri and her coloni grenvil here made clear that the american were to have no voic in make or amend their law parliament and the king were to have absolut power over the coloni no wonder franklin wa alarm by thi new doctrin with hi keen insight into human natur and hi consequ knowledg of american charact he foresaw the inevit result of such an attitud on the part of england thi convers with grenvil make these last page of the autobiographi on of it most import part after some dai dr fothergil have spoken to the proprietari thei agre to a meet with me at mr t penn hous in spring garden the convers at first consist of mutual declar of disposit to reason accommod but i suppos each parti had it own idea of what should be meant by reason we then went into consider of our sever point of complaint which i enumer the proprietari justifyd their conduct as well as thei could and i the assembl we now appear veri wide and so far from each other in our opinion as to discourag all hope of agreement howev it wa conclud that i should give them the head of our complaint in write and thei promisd then to consid them i did so soon after but thei put the paper into the hand of their solicitor ferdinand john pari who manag for them all their law busi in their great suit with the neighbour proprietari of maryland lord baltimor which had subsist year and wrote for them all their paper and messag in their disput with the assembl he wa a proud angri man and as i had occasion in the answer of the assembl treat hi paper with some sever thei be realli weak in point of argument and haughti in express he had conceiv a mortal enmiti to me which discov itself whenev we met i declind the proprietari propos that he and i should discuss the head of complaint between our two selv and refusd treat with anyon but them thei then by hi advic put the paper into the hand of the attornei and solicitorgener for their opinion and counsel upon it where it lai unansw a year want eight dai dure which time i made frequent demand of an answer from the proprietari but without obtain ani other than that thei had not yet receiv the opinion of the attornei and solicitorgener what it wa when thei did receiv it i never learnt for thei did not commun it to me but sent a long messag to the assembl drawn and sign by pari recit my paper complain of it want of formal as a rude on my part and give a flimsi justif of their conduct ad that thei should be will to accommod matter if the assembl would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpos intim therebi that i wa not such illustr we now appear veri wide and so far from each other in our opinion as to discourag all hope of agreement the want of formal or rude wa probabl my not have addressd the paper to
