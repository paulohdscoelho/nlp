provid that it is quit incred the wind shook some blossom from the tree and the heavi lilacbloom with their cluster star move to and fro in the languid air a grasshopp began to chirrup by the wall and like a blue thread a long thin dragonfli float past on it brown gauz wing lord henri felt as if he could hear basil hallward heart beat and wonder what wa come the stori is simpli thi said the painter after some time two month ago i went to a crush at ladi brandon you know we poor artist have to show ourselv in societi from time to time just to remind the public that we ar not savag with an even coat and a white tie as you told me onc anybodi even a stockbrok can gain a reput for be civil well after i had been in the room about ten minut talk to huge overdress dowag and tediou academician i suddenli becam consciou that some on wa look at me i turn halfwai round and saw dorian grai for the first time when our ey met i felt that i wa grow pale a curiou sensat of terror came over me i knew that i had come face to face with some on whose mere person wa so fascin that if i allow it to do so it would absorb my whole natur my whole soul my veri art itself i did not want ani extern influenc in my life you know yourself harri how independ i am by natur i have alwai been my own master had at least alwai been so till i met dorian grai thenbut i dont know how to explain it to you someth seem to tell me that i wa on the verg of a terribl crisi in my life i had a strang feel that fate had in store for me exquisit joi and exquisit sorrow i grew afraid and turn to quit the room it wa not conscienc that made me do so it wa a sort of cowardic i take no credit to myself for try to escap conscienc and cowardic ar realli the same thing basil conscienc is the tradenam of the firm that is all i dont believ that harri and i dont believ you do either howev whatev wa my motiveand it mai have been pride for i us to be veri proudi certainli struggl to the door there of cours i stumbl against ladi brandon you ar not go to run awai so soon mr hallward she scream out you know her curious shrill voic ye she is a peacock in everyth but beauti said lord henri pull the daisi to bit with hi long nervou finger i could not get rid of her she brought me up to royalti and peopl with star and garter and elderli ladi with gigant tiara and parrot nose she spoke of me as her dearest friend i had onli met her onc befor but she took it into her head to lioniz me i believ some pictur of mine had made a great success at the time at least had been chatter about in the penni newspap which is the nineteenthcenturi standard of immort suddenli i found myself face to face with the young man whose person had so strang stir me we were quit close almost touch our ey met again it wa reckless of me but i ask ladi brandon to introduc me to him perhap it wa not so reckless after all it wa simpli inevit we would have spoken to each other without ani introduct i am sure of that dorian told me so afterward he too felt that we were destin to know each other and how did ladi brandon describ thi wonder young man ask hi companion i know she goe in for give a rapid preci of all her guest i rememb her bring me up to a trucul and redfac old gentleman cover all over with order and ribbon and hiss into my ear in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectli audibl to everybodi in the room the most astound detail i simpli fled i like to find out peopl for myself but ladi brandon treat her guest exactli as an auction treat hi good she either explain them entir awai or tell on everyth about them except what on want to know poor ladi brandon you ar hard on her harri said hallward listlessli my dear fellow she tri to found a salon and onli succeed in open a restaur how could i admir her but tell me what did she sai about mr dorian grai oh someth like charm boypoor dear mother and i absolut insepar quit forget what he doesafraid hedoesnt do anythingoh ye plai the pianoor is it the violin dear mr grai neither of us could help laugh and we becam friend at onc laughter is not at all a bad begin for a friendship and it is far the best end for on said the young lord pluck anoth daisi hallward shook hi head you dont understand what friendship is harri he murmuredor what enmiti is for that matter you like everi on that is to sai you ar indiffer to everi on how horribl unjust of you cri lord henri tilt hi hat back and look up at the littl cloud that like ravel skein of glossi white silk were drift across the hollow turquois of the summer sky ye horribl unjust of you i make a great differ between peopl i choos my friend for their good look my acquaint for their good charact and my enemi for their good intellect a man cannot be too care in the choic of hi enemi i have not got on who is a fool thei ar all men of some intellectu power and consequ thei all appreci me is that veri vain of me i think it is rather vain i should think it wa harri but accord to your categori i must be mere an acquaint my dear old basil you ar much more than an acquaint and much less than a friend a sort of brother i suppos oh brother i dont care for brother my elder brother wont die and my younger brother seem never to do anyth els harri exclaim hallward frown my dear fellow i am not quit seriou but i cant help detest my relat i suppos it come from the fact that none of us can stand other peopl have the same fault as ourselv i quit sympath with the rage of the english democraci against what thei call the vice of the upper order the mass feel that drunken stupid and immor should be their own special properti and that if ani on of us make an ass of himself he is poach on their preserv when poor southwark got into the divorc court their indign wa quit magnific and yet i dont suppos that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctli i dont agre with a singl word that you have said and what is more harri i feel sure you dont either lord henri stroke hi point brown beard and tap the toe of hi patentleath boot with a tassel eboni cane how english you ar basil that is the second time you have made that observ if on put forward an idea to a true englishmanalwai a rash thing to dohe never dream of consid whether the idea is right or wrong the onli thing he consid of ani import is whether on believ it oneself now the valu of an idea ha noth whatsoev to do with the sincer of the man who express it inde the probabl ar that the more insincer the man is the more pure intellectu will the idea be as in that case it will not be colour by either hi want hi desir or hi prejudic howev i dont propos to discuss polit sociolog or metaphys with you i like person better than principl and i like person with no principl better than anyth els in the world tell me more about mr dorian grai how often do you see him everi dai i couldnt be happi if i didnt see him everi dai he is absolut necessari to me how extraordinari i thought you would never care for anyth but your art he is all my art to me now said the painter grave i sometim think harri that there ar onli two era of ani import in the world histori the first is the appear of a new medium for art and the second is the appear of a new person for art also what the invent of oilpaint wa to the venetian the face of antin wa to late greek sculptur and the face of dorian grai will some dai be to me it is not mere that i paint from him draw from him sketch from him of cours i have done all that but he is much more to me than a model or a sitter i wont tell you that i am dissatisfi with what i have done of him or that hi beauti is such that art cannot express it there is noth that art cannot express and i know that the work i have done sinc i met dorian grai is good work is the best work of my life but in some curiou wayi wonder will you understand mehi person ha suggest to me an entir new manner in art an entir new mode of style i see thing differ i think of them differ i can now recreat life in a wai that wa hidden from me befor a dream of form in dai of thoughtwho is it who sai that i forget but it is what dorian grai ha been to me the mere visibl presenc of thi ladfor he seem to me littl more than a lad though he is realli over twentyhi mere visibl presenceah i wonder can you realiz all that that mean unconsci he defin for me the line of a fresh school a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romant spirit all the perfect of the spirit that is greek the harmoni of soul and bodyhow much that is we in our mad have separ the two and have invent a realism that is vulgar an ideal that is void harri if you onli knew what dorian grai is to me you rememb that landscap of mine for which agnew offer me such a huge price but which i would not part with it is on of the best thing i have ever done and why is it so becaus while i wa paint it dorian grai sat besid me some subtl influenc pass from him to me and for the first time in my life i saw in the plain woodland the wonder i had alwai look for and alwai miss basil thi is extraordinari i must see dorian grai hallward got up from the seat and walk up and down the garden after some time he came back harri he said dorian grai is to me simpli a motiv in art you might see noth in him i see everyth in him he is never more present in my work than when no imag of him is there he is a suggest as i have said of a new manner i find him in the curv of certain line in the loveli and subtleti of certain colour that is all then why wont you exhibit hi portrait ask lord henri becaus without intend it i have put into it some express of all thi curiou artist idolatri of which of cours i have never care to speak to him he know noth about it he shall never know anyth about it but the world might guess it and i will not bare my soul to their shallow pry ey my heart shall never be put under their microscop there is too much of myself in the thing harrytoo much of myself poet ar not so scrupul as you ar thei know how us passion is for public nowadai a broken heart will run to mani edit i hate them for it cri hallward an artist should creat beauti thing but should put noth of hi own life into them we live in an ag when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiographi we have lost the abstract sens of beauti some dai i will show the world what it is and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of dorian grai i think you ar wrong basil but i wont argu with you it is onli the intellectu lost who ever argu tell me is dorian grai veri fond of you the painter consid for a few moment he like me he answer after a paus i know he like me of cours i flatter him dreadfulli i find a strang pleasur in sai thing to him that i know i shall be sorri for have said as a rule he is charm to me and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand thing now and then howev he is horribl thoughtless and seem to take a real delight in give me pain then i feel harri that i have given awai my whole soul to some on who treat it as if it were a flower to put in hi coat a bit of decor to charm hi vaniti an ornament for a summer dai dai in summer basil ar apt to linger murmur lord henri perhap you will tire sooner than he will it is a sad thing to think of but there is no doubt that geniu last longer than beauti that account for the fact that we all take such pain to overeduc ourselv in the wild struggl for exist we want to have someth that endur and so we fill our mind with rubbish and fact in the silli hope of keep our place the thoroughli wellinform manthat is the modern ideal and the mind of the thoroughli wellinform man is a dread thing it is like a bricabrac shop all monster and dust with everyth price abov it proper valu i think you will tire first all the same some dai you will look at your friend and he will seem to you to be a littl out of draw or you wont like hi tone of colour or someth you will bitterli reproach him in your own heart and serious think that he ha behav veri badli to you the next time he call you will be perfectli cold and indiffer it will be a great piti for it will alter you what you have told me is quit a romanc a romanc of art on might call it and the worst of have a romanc of ani kind is that it leav on so unromant harri dont talk like that as long as i live the person of dorian grai will domin me you cant feel what i feel you chang too often ah my dear basil that is exactli why i can feel it those who ar faith know onli the trivial side of love it is the faithless who know love tragedi and lord henri struck a light on a dainti silver case and began to smoke a cigarett with a selfconsci and satisfi air as if he had sum up the world in a phrase there wa a rustl of chirrup sparrow in the green lacquer leav of the ivi and the blue cloudshadow chase themselv across the grass like swallow how pleasant it wa in the garden and how delight other peopl emot weremuch more delight than their idea it seem to him on own soul and the passion of on friendsthos were the fascin thing in life he pictur to himself with silent amus the tediou luncheon that he had miss by stai so long with basil hallward had he gone to hi aunt he would have been sure to have met lord goodbodi there and the whole convers would have been about the feed of the poor and the necess for model lodginghous each class would have preach the import of those virtu for whose exercis there wa no necess in their own live the rich would have spoken on the valu of thrift and the idl grown eloqu over the digniti of labour it wa charm to have escap all that as he thought of hi aunt an idea seem to strike him he turn to hallward and said my dear fellow i have just rememb rememb what harri where i heard the name of dorian grai where wa it ask hallward with a slight frown dont look so angri basil it wa at my aunt ladi agatha she told me she had discov a wonder young man who wa go to help her in the east end and that hi name wa dorian grai i am bound to state that she never told me he wa goodlook women have no appreci of good look at least good women have not she said that he wa veri earnest and had a beauti natur i at onc pictur to myself a creatur

no mr dorian grai is in the studio sir said the butler come into the garden you must introduc me now cri lord henri laugh the painter turn to hi servant who stood blink in the sunlight ask mr grai to wait parker i shall be in in a few moment the man bow and went up the walk then he look at lord henri dorian grai is my dearest friend he said he ha a simpl and a beauti natur your aunt wa quit right in what she said of him dont spoil him dont try to influenc him your influenc would be bad the world is wide and ha mani marvel peopl in it dont take awai from me the on person who give to my art whatev charm it possess my life as an artist depend on him mind harri i trust you he spoke veri slowli and the word seem wrung out of him almost against hi will what nonsens you talk said lord henri smile and take hallward by the arm he almost led him into the hous chapter as thei enter thei saw dorian grai he wa seat at the piano with hi back to them turn over the page of a volum of schumann forest scene you must lend me these basil he cri i want to learn them thei ar perfectli charm that entir depend on how you sit todai dorian oh i am tire of sit and i dont want a lifes portrait of

agatha black book at present answer dorian with a funni look of penit i promis to go to a club in whitechapel with her last tuesdai and i realli forgot all about it we were to have plai a duet togetherthre duet i believ i dont know what she will sai to me i am far too frighten to call oh i will make your peac with my aunt she is quit devot to you and i dont think it realli matter about your not be there the audienc probabl thought it wa a duet when aunt agatha sit down to the piano she make quit enough nois for two peopl that is veri horrid to her and not veri nice to me answer dorian laugh lord henri look at him ye he wa certainli wonderfulli handsom with hi fine curv scarlet lip hi frank blue ey hi crisp gold hair there wa someth in hi face that made on trust him at onc all the candour of youth wa there as well as all youth passion puriti on felt that he had kept himself unspot from the world no wonder basil hallward worship him you ar too charm to go in for philanthropi mr grayfar too charm and lord henri flung himself down on the divan and open hi cigarettecas the painter had been busi mix hi colour and get hi brush readi he wa look worri and when he heard lord henri last remark he glanc at him hesit for a moment and then said harri i want to finish thi pictur todai would you think it awfulli rude of me if i ask you to go awai lord henri smile and look at dorian grai am i to go mr grai he ask oh pleas dont lord henri i see that basil is in on of hi sulki mood and i cant bear him when he sulk besid i want you to tell me why i should not go in for philanthropi i dont know that i shall tell you that mr grai it is so tediou a subject that on would have to talk serious about it but i certainli shall not run awai now that you have ask me to stop you dont realli mind basil do you you have often told me that you like your sitter to have some on to chat to hallward bit hi lip if dorian wish it of cours you must stai dorian whim ar law to everybodi except

am nearli alwai at home at five oclock write to me when you ar come i should be sorri to miss you basil cri dorian grai if lord henri wotton goe i shall go too you never open your lip while you ar paint and it is horribl dull stand on a platform and try to look pleasant ask him to stai i insist upon it stai harri to oblig dorian and to oblig me said hallward gaze intent at hi pictur it is quit true i never talk when i am work and never listen either and it must be dreadfulli tediou for my unfortun sitter i beg you to stai but what about my man at the orlean the painter laugh i dont think there will be ani difficulti about that sit down again harri and now dorian get up on the platform and dont move about too much or pai ani attent to what lord henri sai he ha a veri bad influenc over all hi friend with the singl except of myself dorian grai step up on the dai with the air of a young greek martyr and made a littl moue of discont to lord henri to whom he had rather taken a fanci he wa so unlik basil thei made a delight contrast and he had such a beauti voic after a few moment he said to him have you realli a veri bad influenc lord henri as bad as basil sai there is no such thing as a good influenc mr grai all influenc is immoralimmor from the scientif point of view why becaus to influenc a person is to give him on own soul he doe not think hi natur thought or burn with hi natur passion hi virtu ar not real to him hi sin if there ar such thing as sin ar borrow he becom an echo of some on els music an actor of a part that ha not been written for him the aim of life is selfdevelop to realiz on natur perfectlythat is what each of us is here for peopl ar afraid of themselv nowadai thei have forgotten the highest of all duti the duti that on ow to on self of cours thei

the terror of god which is the secret of religionthes ar the two thing that govern us and yet just turn your head a littl more to the right dorian like a good boi said the painter deep in hi work and consciou onli that a look had come into the lad face that he had never seen there befor and yet continu lord henri in hi low music voic and with that grace wave of the hand that wa alwai so characterist of him and that he had even in hi eton dai i believ that if on man were to live out hi life fulli and complet were to give form to everi feel express to everi thought realiti to everi dreami believ that the world would gain such a fresh impuls of joi that we would forget all the maladi of mediaev and return to the hellen idealto someth finer richer than the hellen ideal it mai be but the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself the mutil of the savag ha it tragic surviv in the selfdeni that mar our live we ar punish for our refus everi impuls that we strive to strangl brood in the mind and poison us the bodi sin onc and ha done with it sin for action is a mode of purif noth remain then but the recollect of a pleasur or the luxuri of a regret the onli wai to get rid of a temptat is to yield to it resist it and your soul grow sick with long for the thing it ha forbidden to itself with desir for what it monstrou law have made monstrou and unlaw it ha been said that the great event of the world take place in the brain it is in the brain and the brain onli that the great sin of the world take place also you mr grai you yourself with your roser youth and your rosewhit boyhood you have had passion that have made you afraid thought that have fill you with terror daydream and sleep dream whose mere memori might stain your cheek with shame stop falter dorian grai stop you bewild me i dont know what to sai there is some answer to you but i cannot find it dont speak let me think or rather let me try not to think for nearli ten minut he stood there motionless with part lip and ey strang bright he wa dimli consciou that entir fresh influenc were at work within him yet thei seem to him to have come realli from himself the few word that basil friend had said to himword spoken by chanc no doubt and with wil paradox in themhad touch some secret chord that had never been touch befor but that he felt wa now vibrat and throb to curiou puls music had stir him like

larg goldtop bottl that stood on the tabl it must be if you sai it and now i am off imogen is wait for me dont forget about tomorrow goodby as he left the room lord henri heavi eyelid droop and he began to think certainli few peopl had ever interest him so much as dorian grai and yet the lad mad ador of some on els caus him not the slightest pang of annoy or jealousi he wa pleas by it it made him a more interest studi he had been alwai enthral by the method of natur scienc but the ordinari subjectmatt of that scienc had seem to him trivial and of no import and so he had begun by vivisect himself as he had end by vivisect other human lifethat appear to him the on thing worth investig compar to it there wa noth els of ani valu it wa true that as on watch life in it curiou crucibl of pain and pleasur on could not wear over on face a mask of glass nor keep the sulphur fume from troubl the brain and make the imagin turbid with monstrou fanci and misshapen dream there were poison so subtl that to know their properti on had to sicken of them there were maladi so strang that on had to pass through them if on sought to understand their natur and yet what a great reward on receiv how wonder the whole world becam to on to note the curiou hard logic of passion and the emot colour life of the intellectto observ where thei met and where thei separ at what point thei were in unison and at what point thei were at discordther wa a delight in that what matter what the cost wa on could never pai too high a price for ani sensat he wa consciousand the thought brought a gleam of pleasur into hi brown agat eyesthat it wa through certain word of hi music word said with music utter that dorian grai soul had turn to thi white girl and bow in worship befor her to a larg extent the lad wa hi own creation he had made him prematur that wa someth ordinari peopl wait till life disclos to them it secret but to the few to the elect the mysteri of life were reveal befor the veil wa drawn awai sometim thi wa the effect of art and chiefli of the art of literatur which dealt immedi with the passion and the intellect but now and then a complex person took the place and assum the offic of art wa inde in it wai a real work of art life have it elabor masterpiec just as poetri ha or sculptur or paint ye the lad wa prematur he wa gather hi harvest while it wa yet spring the puls and passion of youth were in him but he wa becom selfconsci it wa delight to watch him with hi beauti face and hi beauti soul he wa a thing to wonder at it wa no matter how it all end or wa destin to end he wa like on of those graciou figur in a pageant or a plai whose joi seem to be remot from on but whose sorrow stir on sens of beauti and whose wound ar like red rose soul and bodi bodi and soulhow mysteri thei were there wa anim in the soul and the bodi had it moment of spiritu the sens could refin and the intellect could degrad who could sai where the fleshli impuls ceas or the psychic impuls began how shallow were the arbitrari definit of ordinari psychologist and yet how difficult to decid between the claim of the variou school wa the soul a shadow seat in the hous of sin or wa the bodi realli in the soul as giordano bruno thought the separ of spirit from matter wa a mysteri and the union of spirit with matter wa a mysteri also he began to wonder whether we could ever make psycholog so absolut a scienc that each littl spring of life would be reveal to us as it wa we alwai misunderstood ourselv and rare understood other experi wa of no ethic valu it wa mere the name men gave to their mistak moralist had as a rule regard it as a mode of warn had claim for it a certain ethic efficaci in the format of charact had prais it as someth that taught us what to follow and show us what to avoid but

the dim arrest light that struggl through the creamcolour silk blind the face appear to him to be a littl chang the express look differ on would have said that there wa a touch of cruelti in the mouth it wa certainli strang he turn round and walk to the window drew up the blind the bright dawn flood the room and swept the fantast shadow into duski corner where thei lai shudder but the strang express that he had notic in the face of the portrait seem to linger there to be more intensifi even the quiver ardent sunlight show him the line of cruelti round the mouth as clearli as if he had

wa no doubt that the whole express had alter it wa not a mere fanci of hi own the thing wa horribl appar he threw himself into a chair and began to think suddenli there flash across hi mind what he had said in basil hallward studio the dai the pictur had been finish ye he rememb it perfectli he had utter a mad wish that he himself might remain young and the portrait grow old that hi own beauti might be untarnish and the face on the canva bear the burden of hi passion and hi sin that the paint imag might be sear with the line of suffer and thought and that he might keep all the delic bloom and loveli of hi then just consciou boyhood sure hi wish had not been fulfil such thing were imposs it seem monstrou even to think of them and yet there wa the pictur befor him with the touch of cruelti in the mouth cruelti had he been cruel it wa the girl fault not hi he had dream of her as a great artist had given hi love to her becaus he had thought her great then she had disappoint him she had been shallow and unworthi and yet a feel of infinit regret came over him as he thought of her ly at hi feet sob like a littl child he rememb with what callous he had watch her why had he been made like that why had such a soul been given to him but he had suffer also dure the three terribl hour that the plai had last he had live centuri of pain aeon upon aeon of tortur hi life wa well worth her she had mar him for a moment if he had wound her for an ag besid women were better suit to bear sorrow than men thei live on their emot thei onli thought of their emot when thei took lover it wa mere to have some on with whom thei could have scene lord henri had told him that and lord henri knew what women were why should he troubl about sibyl vane she wa noth to him now but the pictur what wa he to sai of that it held the secret of hi life and told hi stori it had taught him to love hi own beauti would it teach him to loath hi own soul would he ever look at it again no it wa mere an illus wrought on the troubl sens the horribl night that he had pass had left phantom behind it suddenli there had fallen upon hi brain that tini scarlet speck that make men mad the pictur had not chang it wa folli to think so yet it wa watch him with it beauti mar face and it cruel smile it bright hair gleam in the earli sunlight it blue ey met hi own a sens of infinit piti not for himself but for the paint imag of himself came over him it had alter alreadi and would alter more it gold would wither into grei it red and white rose would die for everi sin that he commit a stain would fleck and wreck it fair but he would not sin the pictur chang or unchang would be to him the visibl emblem of conscienc he would resist temptat he would not see lord henri ani morewould not at ani rate listen to those subtl poison theori that in basil hallward garden had first stir within him the passion for imposs thing he would go back to sibyl vane make her amend marri her try to love her again ye it wa hi duti to do so she must have suffer more than he had poor child he had been selfish and cruel to her the fascin that she had exercis over him would return thei would be happi togeth hi life with her would be beauti and pure he got up from hi chair and drew a larg screen right in front of the portrait shudder as he glanc at it how horribl he murmur to himself and he walk across to the window and open it when he step out on to the grass he drew a deep breath the fresh morn air seem to drive awai all hi sombr passion he thought onli of sibyl a faint echo of hi love came back to him he repeat her name over and over again the bird that were sing in the dewdrench garden seem to be tell the flower about her chapter it wa long past noon when he awok hi valet had crept sever time on tipto into the room to see if he wa stir and had wonder what made hi young master sleep so late final hi bell sound and victor came in softli with a cup of tea and a pile of letter on a small trai of old sevr china and drew back the olivesatin curtain with their shimmer blue line that hung in front of the three tall window monsieur ha well slept thi morn he said smile what oclock is it victor ask dorian grai drowsili on hour and a quarter monsieur how late it wa he sat up and have sip some tea turn over hi letter on of them wa from lord henri and had been brought by hand that morn he hesit for a moment and then put it asid the other he open listlessli thei contain the usual collect of card invit to dinner ticket for privat view programm of chariti concert and the like that ar shower on fashion young men everi morn dure the season there wa a rather heavi bill for a chase silver louisquinz toiletset that he had not yet had the courag to send on to hi guardian who were extrem oldfashion peopl and did not realiz that we live in an ag when unnecessari thing ar our onli necess and there were sever veri courteous word commun from jermyn street moneylend offer to advanc ani sum of monei at a moment notic and at the most reason rate of interest after about ten minut he got up and throw on an elabor dressinggown of silkembroid cashmer wool pass into the onyxpav bathroom the cool water refresh him after hi long sleep he seem to have forgotten all that he had gone through a dim sens of have taken part in some strang tragedi came to him onc or twice but there wa the unreal of a dream about it as soon as he wa dress he went into the librari and sat down to a light french breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round tabl close to the open window it wa an exquisit dai the warm air seem laden with spice a bee flew in and buzz round the bluedragon bowl that fill with sulphuryellow rose stood befor him he felt perfectli happi suddenli hi ey fell on the screen that he had place in front of the portrait and he start too cold for monsieur ask hi valet put an omelett on the tabl i shut the window dorian shook hi head i am not cold he murmur wa it all true had the portrait realli chang or had it been simpli hi own imagin that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of joi sure a paint canva could not alter the thing wa absurd it would serv as a tale to tell basil some dai it would make him smile and yet how vivid wa hi recollect of the whole thing first in the dim twilight and then in the bright dawn he had seen the touch of cruelti round the warp lip he almost dread hi valet leav the room he knew that when he wa alon he would have to examin the portrait he wa afraid of certainti when the coffe and cigarett had been brought and the man turn to go he felt a wild desir to tell him to remain as the door wa close behind him he call him back the man stood wait for hi order dorian look at him for a moment i am not at home to ani on victor he said with a sigh the man bow and retir then he rose from the tabl lit a cigarett and flung himself down on a luxuri cushion couch that stood face the screen the screen wa an old on of gilt spanish leather stamp and wrought with a rather florid louisquatorz pattern he scan it curious wonder if ever befor it had conceal the secret of a man life should he move it asid after all why not let it stai there what wa the us of know if the thing wa true it wa terribl if it wa not true why troubl about it but what if by some fate or deadlier chanc ey other than hi spi behind and saw the horribl chang what should he do if basil hallward came and ask to look at hi own pictur basil would be sure to do that no the thing had to be examin and at onc anyth would be better than thi dread state of doubt he got up and lock both door at least he would be alon when he look upon the mask of hi shame then he drew the screen asid and saw himself face to face it wa perfectli true the portrait had alter as he often rememb afterward and alwai with no small wonder he found himself at first gaze at the portrait with a feel of almost scientif interest that such a chang should have taken place wa incred to him and yet it wa a fact wa there some subtl affin between the chemic atom that shape themselv into form and colour on the canva and the soul that wa within him could it be that what that soul thought thei realizedthat what it dream thei made true or wa there some other more terribl reason he shudder and felt afraid and go back to the couch lai there gaze at the pictur in sicken horror on thing howev he felt that it had done for him it had made him consciou how unjust how cruel he had been to sibyl vane it wa not too late to make repar for that she could still be hi wife hi unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influenc would be transform into some nobler passion and the portrait that basil hallward had paint of him would be a guid to him through life would be to him what holi is to some and conscienc to other and the fear of god to us all there were opiat for remors drug that could lull the moral sens to sleep but here wa a visibl symbol of the degrad of sin here wa an everpres sign of the ruin men brought upon their soul three oclock struck and four and the halfhour rang it doubl chime but dorian grai did not stir he wa try to gather up the scarlet thread of life and to weav them into a pattern to find hi wai through the sanguin labyrinth of passion through which he wa wander he did not know what to do or what to think final he went over to the tabl and wrote a passion letter to the girl he had love implor her forgiv and accus himself of mad he cover page after page with wild word of sorrow and wilder word of pain there is a luxuri in selfreproach when we blame ourselv we feel that no on els ha a right to blame us it is the confess not the priest that give us absolut when dorian had finish the letter he felt that he had been forgiven suddenli there came a knock to the door and he heard lord henri voic outsid my dear boi i must see you let me in at onc i cant bear your shut yourself up like thi he made no answer at

you would have been wretch of cours you would have treat her kindli on can alwai be kind to peopl about whom on care noth but she would have soon found out that you were absolut indiffer to her and when a woman find that out about her husband she either becom dreadfulli dowdi or wear veri smart bonnet that some other woman husband ha to pai for i sai noth about the social mistak which would have been abjectwhich of cours i would not have allowedbut i assur you that in ani case the whole thing would have been an absolut failur i suppos it would mutter the lad walk up and down the room and look

made too late mine certainli were good resolut ar useless attempt to interfer with scientif law their origin is pure vaniti their result is absolut nil thei give us now and then some of those luxuri steril emot that have a certain charm for the weak that is all that can be said for them thei ar simpli chequ that men draw on a bank where thei have no account harri cri dorian grai come over and sit down besid him why is it that i cannot feel thi tragedi as much as i want to i dont think i am heartless do you you have done too mani foolish thing dure the last fortnight to be entitl to give yourself that name dorian answer lord henri with hi sweet melancholi smile the lad frown i dont like that explan harri he rejoin but i am glad you dont think i am heartless i am noth of the kind i know i am not and yet i must admit that thi thing that ha happen doe not affect me as it should it seem to me to be simpli like a wonder end to a wonder plai it ha all the terribl beauti of a greek tragedi a tragedi in which i took a great part but by which i have not been wound it is an interest question said lord henri who found an exquisit pleasur in plai on the lad unconsci egot an extrem interest question i fanci that the true explan is thi it often happen that the real tragedi of life occur in such an inartist manner that thei hurt us by their crude violenc their absolut incoher their absurd want of mean their entir lack of style thei affect us just as vulgar affect us thei give us an impress of sheer brute forc and we revolt against that sometim howev a tragedi that possess artist element of beauti cross our live if these element of beauti ar real the whole thing simpli appeal to our sens of dramat effect suddenli we find that we ar no longer the actor but the spectat of the plai or rather we ar both we watch ourselv and the mere wonder of the spectacl enthral us in the present case what is it that ha realli happen some on ha kill herself for love of you i wish that i had ever had such an experi it would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life the peopl who have ador mether have not been veri mani but there have been somehav alwai insist on live on long after i had ceas to care for them or thei to care for me thei have becom stout and tediou and when i meet them thei go in at onc for reminisc that aw memori of woman what a fear thing it is and what an utter intellectu stagnat it reveal on should absorb the colour of life but on should never rememb it detail detail ar alwai vulgar i must sow poppi in my garden sigh dorian there is no necess rejoin hi companion life ha alwai poppi in her hand of cours now and then thing linger i onc wore noth but violet all through on season as a form of artist mourn for a romanc that would not die ultim

ladi hampshir i found myself seat at dinner next the ladi in question and she insist on go over the whole thing again and dig up the past and rake up the futur i had buri my romanc in a bed of asphodel she drag it out again and assur me that i had spoil her life i am bound to state that she at an enorm dinner so i did not feel ani anxieti but what a lack of tast she show the on charm of the past is that it is the past but women never know when the curtain ha fallen thei alwai want a sixth act and as soon as the interest of the plai is entir over thei propos to continu it if thei were allow their own wai everi comedi would have a tragic end and everi tragedi would culmin in a farc thei ar charmingli artifici but thei have no sens of art you ar more fortun than i am i assur you dorian that not on of the women i have known would have done for me what sibyl vane did for you ordinari women alwai consol themselv some of them do it by go in for sentiment colour never trust a woman who wear mauv whatev her ag mai be or a woman over thirtyf who is fond of pink ribbon it alwai mean that thei have a histori other find a great consol in suddenli discov the good qualiti of

she plai that dread last scene had she curs him as she di no she had di for love of him and love would alwai be a sacrament to him now she had aton for everyth by the sacrific she had made of her life he would not think ani more of what she had made him go through on that horribl night at the theatr when he thought of her it would be as a wonder tragic figur sent on to the world stage to show the suprem realiti of love a wonder tragic figur tear came to hi ey as he rememb her childlik look and winsom fanci wai and shy tremul grace he brush them awai hastili and look again at the pictur he felt that the time had realli come for make hi choic or had hi choic alreadi been made ye life had decid that for himlif and hi own infinit curios about life etern youth infinit passion pleasur subtl and secret wild joi and wilder sinsh wa to have all these thing the portrait wa to bear the burden of hi shame that wa all a feel of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecr that wa in store for the fair face on the canva onc in boyish mockeri of narcissu he had kiss or feign to kiss those paint lip that now smile so cruelli at him morn after morn he had sat befor the portrait wonder at it beauti almost enamour of it as it seem to him at time wa it to alter now with everi mood to which he yield wa it to becom a monstrou and loathsom thing to be hidden awai in a lock room to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touch to brighter gold the wave wonder of it hair the piti of it the piti of it for a moment he thought of prai that the horribl sympathi that exist between him and the pictur might ceas it had chang in answer to a prayer perhap in answer to a prayer it might remain unchang and yet who that knew anyth about life would surrend the chanc of remain alwai young howev

power if the pictur wa to alter it wa to alter that wa all why inquir too close into it for there would be a real pleasur in watch it he would be abl to follow hi mind into it secret place thi portrait would be to him the most magic of mirror as it had reveal to him hi own bodi so it would reveal to him hi own soul and when winter came upon it he would still be stand where spring trembl on the verg of summer when the blood crept from it face and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden ey he would keep the glamour of boyhood not on blossom of hi loveli would ever fade not on puls

bead of perspir there he felt that he wa on the brink of a horribl danger you told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it he cri why have you chang your mind you peopl who go in for be consist have just as mani mood as other have the onli differ is that your mood ar rather meaningless you cant have forgotten that you assur me most solemnli that noth in the world would induc you to send it to ani exhibit you told harri exactli the same thing he stop suddenli and a gleam of light came into hi ey he rememb that lord henri had said to him onc half serious and half in jest if you want to have a strang quarter of an hour get basil to tell you why he wont exhibit your pictur he told me why he wouldnt and it wa a revel to me ye perhap basil too had hi secret he would ask him and try basil he said come over quit close and look him straight in the face we have each of us a secret let me know your and i shall tell you mine what wa your reason for refus to exhibit my pictur the painter shudder in spite of himself dorian if i told you you might like me less than you do and you would certainli laugh at me i could not bear your do either of those two thing if you wish me never to look at your pictur again i am content i have alwai you to look at if you wish the best work i have ever done to be hidden from the world i am satisfi your friendship is dearer to me than ani fame or reput no basil you must tell me insist dorian grai i think i have a right to know hi feel of terror had pass awai and curios had taken it place he wa determin to find out basil hallward mysteri let us sit down dorian said the painter look troubl let us sit down and just answer me on question have you notic in the pictur someth curioussometh that probabl at first did not strike you but that reveal itself to you suddenli basil cri the lad clutch the arm of hi chair with trembl hand and gaze at him with wild startl ey i see you did dont speak wait till you hear what i have to sai dorian from the moment i met you your person had the most extraordinari influenc over me i wa domin soul brain and power by you you becam to me the visibl incarn of that unseen ideal whose memori haunt us artist like an exquisit dream i worship you i grew jealou of everi on to whom you spoke i want to have you all to myself i wa onli happi when i wa with you when you were awai from me you were still present in my art of cours i never let you know anyth about thi it would have been imposs you would not have understood it i hardli understood it myself i onli knew that i had seen perfect face to face and that the world had becom wonder to my eyestoo wonder perhap for in such mad worship there is peril the peril of lose them no less than the peril of keep them week and week went on and i grew more and more absorb in you then came a new develop i had drawn you as pari in dainti armour and as adoni with huntsman cloak and polish boarspear crown with heavi lotusblossom you had sat on the prow of adrian barg gaze across the green turbid nile you had lean over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water silent silver the marvel of your own face and it had all been what art should beunconsci ideal and remot on dai a fatal dai i sometim think i determin to paint a wonder portrait of you as you actual ar not in the costum of dead ag but in your own dress and in your own time whether it wa the realism of the method or the mere wonder of your own person thu directli present to me without mist or veil i cannot tell but i know that as i work at it everi flake and film of colour seem to me to reveal my secret i grew afraid that other would know of my idolatri i felt dorian that i had told too much that i had put too much of myself into it then it wa that i resolv never to allow the pictur to be exhibit you were a littl annoi but then you did not realiz all that it meant to me harri to whom i talk about it laugh at me but i did not mind that when the pictur wa finish and i sat alon with it i felt that i wa right well after a few dai the thing left my studio and as soon as i had got rid of the intoler fascin of it presenc it seem to me that i had been foolish in imagin that i had seen anyth in it more than that you were extrem goodlook and that i could paint even now i cannot help feel that it is a mistak to think that the passion on feel in creation is ever realli shown in the work on creat art is alwai more abstract than we fanci form and colour tell us of form and colourthat is all it often seem to me that art conceal the artist far more complet than it ever reveal him and so when i got thi offer from pari i determin to make your portrait the princip thing in my exhibit it never occur to me that you would refus i see now that you were right the pictur cannot be shown you must not be angri with me dorian for what i have told you as i said to harri onc you ar made to be worship dorian grai drew a long breath the colour came back to hi cheek and a smile plai about hi lip the peril wa over he wa safe for the time yet he could not help feel infinit piti for the painter who had just made thi strang confess to him and wonder if he himself would ever be so domin by the person of a friend lord henri had the charm of be veri danger but that wa all he wa too clever and too cynic to be realli fond of would there ever be some on who would fill him with a strang idolatri wa that on of the thing that life had in store it is extraordinari to me dorian said hallward that you should have seen thi in the portrait did you realli see it i saw someth in it he answer someth that seem to me veri curiou well you dont mind my look at the thing now dorian shook hi head you must not ask me that basil i could not possibl let you stand in front of that pictur you will some dai sure never well perhap you ar right and now goodby dorian you have been the on person in my life who ha realli influenc my art whatev i have done that is good i ow to you ah you dont know what it cost me to tell you all that i have told you my dear basil said dorian what have you told me simpli that you felt that you admir me too much that is not even a compliment it wa not intend as a compliment it wa a confess now that i have made it someth seem to have gone out of me perhap on should never put on worship into word it wa a veri disappoint confess why what did you expect dorian you didnt see anyth els in the pictur did you there wa noth els to see no there wa noth els to see why do you ask but you mustnt talk about worship it is foolish you and i ar friend basil and we must alwai remain so you have got harri said the painter sadli oh harri cri the lad with a rippl of laughter harri spend hi dai in sai what is incred and hi even in do what is improb just

bee that wrought in silver and take up the volum flung himself into an armchair and began to turn over the leav after a few minut he becam absorb it wa the strangest book that he had ever read it seem to him that in exquisit raiment and to the delic sound of flute the sin of the world were pass in dumb show befor him thing that he had dimli dream of were suddenli made real to him thing of which he had never dream were gradual reveal it wa a novel without a plot and with onli on charact be inde simpli a psycholog studi of a certain young parisian who spent hi life try to realiz in the nineteenth

mere artifici those renunci that men have unwis call virtu as much as those natur rebellion that wise men still call sin the style in which it wa written wa that curiou jewel style vivid and obscur at onc full of argot and of archaism of technic express and of elabor paraphras that character the work of some of the finest artist of the french school of symbolist there were in it metaphor as monstrou as orchid and as subtl in colour the life of the sens wa describ in the term of mystic philosophi on hardli knew at time whether on wa read the spiritu ecstasi of some mediaev saint or the morbid confess of a modern sinner it wa a poison book the heavi odour of incens seem to cling about it page and to troubl the brain the mere cadenc of the sentenc the subtl monotoni of their music so

thei pass into the diningroom chapter for year dorian grai could not free himself from the influenc of thi book or perhap it would be more accur to sai that he never sought to free himself from it he procur from pari no less than nine largepap copi of the first edit and had them bound in differ colour so that thei might suit hi variou mood and the chang fanci of a natur over which he seem at time to have almost entir lost control the hero the wonder young parisian in whom the romant and the scientif tempera were so strang blend becam to him a kind of prefigur type of himself and inde the whole

under an assum name and in disguis it wa hi habit to frequent he would think of the ruin he had brought upon hi soul with a piti that wa all the more poignant becaus it wa pure selfish but moment such as these were rare that curios about life which lord henri had first stir in him as thei sat togeth in the garden of their friend seem to increas with gratif the more he knew the more he desir to know he had mad hunger that grew more raven as he fed them yet he wa not realli reckless at ani rate in hi relat to societi onc or twice everi month dure the winter and on each wednesdai even while the

to elabor some new scheme of life that would have it reason philosophi and it order principl and find in the spiritu of the sens it highest realiz the worship of the sens ha often and with much justic been decri men feel a natur instinct of terror about passion and sensat that seem stronger than themselv and that thei ar consciou of share with the less highli organ form of exist but it appear to dorian grai that the true natur of the sens had never been understood and that thei had remain savag and anim mere becaus the world had sought to starv them into submiss or to kill them by pain instead of aim at make them element of a new spiritu of which a fine instinct for beauti wa to be the domin characterist as he look back upon man move through histori he wa haunt by a feel of loss so

hous wa absolut quiet no on wa about for a few second he stood bend over the balustrad and peer down into the black seeth well of dark then he took out the kei and return to the room lock himself in as he did so the thing wa still seat in the chair strain over the tabl with bow head and hump back and long fantast arm had it not been for the red jag tear in the neck and the clot black pool that wa

ly on hi right side with on hand underneath hi cheek he look like a boi who had been tire out with plai or studi the man had to touch him twice on the shoulder befor he woke and as he open hi ey a faint smile pass across hi lip as though he had been lost in some delight dream yet he had not dream at all hi night had been untroubl by ani imag of pleasur or of pain but youth smile without ani reason it is on of it chiefest charm he turn round and lean upon hi elbow began to sip hi chocol the mellow novemb sun came stream into the room the sky wa bright and there wa a genial warmth in the air it wa almost like a morn in mai gradual the event of the preced night crept with silent bloodstain feet into hi brain and reconstruct themselv there with terribl distinct he winc at the memori of all that he had suffer and for a moment the same curiou feel of loath for basil hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him and he grew cold with passion the dead man wa still sit there too and in the sunlight now how horribl that wa such hideou thing were for the dark not for the dai he felt that if he brood on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad there were sin whose fascin wa more in the memori than in the do of them strang triumph that gratifi the pride more than the passion and gave to the intellect a quicken sens of joi greater than ani joi thei brought or could ever bring to the sens but thi wa not on of them it wa a thing to be driven out of the mind to be drug with poppi to be strangl lest it might strangl on itself when the halfhour struck he pass hi hand across hi forehead and then got up hastili and dress himself with even more than hi usual care give a good deal of attent to the choic of hi neckti and scarfpin and

put hi silk scarf round hi throat as he stroll home smoke hi cigarett two young men in even dress pass him he heard on of them whisper to the other that is dorian grai he rememb how pleas he us to be when he wa point out or stare at or talk about he wa tire of hear hi own name now half the charm of the littl villag where he had been so often late wa that no on knew who he wa he had often told the girl whom he had lure to love him that he wa poor and she had believ him he had told her onc that he wa wick and she had laugh at him and answer that wick peopl were alwai veri old and veri ugli what a laugh she hadjust like a thrush sing and how pretti she had been in her cotton dress and her larg hat she knew noth but she had everyth that he had lost when he reach home he found hi servant wait up for him he sent him to bed and threw himself down on the sofa in the librari and began to think over some of the thing that lord henri had said to him wa it realli true that on could never chang he felt a wild long for the unstain puriti of hi boyhoodhi rosewhit boyhood as lord henri had onc call it he knew that he had tarnish himself fill hi mind with corrupt and given horror to hi fanci that he had been an evil influenc to other and had experienc a terribl joi in be so and that of the live that had cross hi own it had been the fairest and the most full of promis that he had brought to shame but wa it all irretriev wa there no hope for him ah in what a monstrou moment of pride and passion he had prai that the portrait should bear the burden of hi dai and he keep the unsulli splendour of etern youth all hi failur had been due to that better for him that each sin of hi life had brought it sure swift penalti along with it there wa purif in punish not forgiv us our sin but smite us for our iniqu should be the prayer of man to a most just god the curious carv mirror that lord henri had given to him so mani year ago now wa stand on the tabl and the whitelimb cupid laugh round it as of old he took it up as he had done on that night of horror when he had first note the chang in the fatal pictur and with wild teardim ey look into it polish shield onc some on who had terribl love him had written to him a mad letter end with these idolatr word the world is chang becaus you ar made of ivori and gold the curv of your lip rewrit histori the phrase came back to hi memori and he repeat them over and over to himself then he loath hi own beauti and fling the mirror on the floor crush it into silver splinter beneath hi heel it wa hi beauti that had ruin him hi beauti and the youth that he had prai for but for those two thing hi life might have been free from stain hi beauti had been to him but a mask hi youth but a mockeri what wa youth at best a green an unrip time a time of shallow mood and sickli thought why had he worn it liveri youth had spoil him it wa better not to think of the past noth could alter that it wa of himself and of hi own futur that he had to think jame vane wa hidden in a nameless grave in selbi churchyard alan campbel had shot himself on night in hi laboratori but had not reveal the secret that he had been forc to know the excit such as it wa over basil hallward disappear would soon pass awai it wa alreadi wane he wa perfectli safe there nor inde wa it the death of basil hallward that weigh most upon hi mind it wa the live death of hi own soul that troubl him basil had paint the portrait that had mar hi life he could not forgiv him that it wa the portrait that had done everyth basil had said thing to him that were unbear and that he had yet born with patienc the murder had been simpli the mad of a moment as for alan campbel hi suicid had been hi own act he had chosen to do it it wa noth to him a new life that wa what he want that wa what he wa wait for sure he had begun it alreadi he had spare on innoc thing at ani rate he would never again tempt innoc he would be good as he thought of hetti merton he began to wonder if the portrait in the lock room had chang sure it wa not still so horribl as it had been perhap if hi life becam pure he would be abl to expel everi sign of evil passion from the face perhap the sign of evil had alreadi gone awai he would go and look he took the lamp from the tabl and crept upstair as he unbar the door a smile of joi flit across hi strang younglook face and linger for a moment about hi lip ye he would be good and the hideou thing that he had hidden awai would no longer be a terror to him he felt as if the load had been lift from him alreadi he went in quietli lock the door behind him as wa hi custom and drag the purpl hang from the portrait a cry of pain and indign broke from him he could see no chang save that in the ey there wa a look of cun and in the mouth the curv wrinkl of the hypocrit the thing wa still loathsomemor loathsom if possibl than beforeand the scarlet dew that spot the hand seem brighter and more like blood newli spill then he trembl had it been mere vaniti that had made him do hi on good deed or the desir for a new sensat as lord henri had hint with hi mock laugh or that passion to act a part that sometim make us do thing finer than we ar ourselv or perhap all these and why wa the red stain larger than it had been it seem to have crept like a horribl diseas over the wrinkl finger there wa blood on the paint feet as though the thing had drippedblood even on the hand that had not held the knife confess did it mean that he wa to confess to give himself up and be put to death he laugh he felt that the idea wa monstrou besid even if he did confess who would believ him there wa no trace of the murder man anywher everyth belong to him had been destroi he himself had burn what had been belowstair the world would simpli sai that he wa mad thei would shut him up if he persist in hi stori yet it wa hi duti to confess to suffer public shame and to make public aton there wa a god who call upon men to tell their sin to earth as well as to heaven noth that he could do would cleans him till he had told hi own sin hi sin he shrug hi shoulder the death of basil hallward seem veri littl to him he wa think of hetti merton for it wa an unjust mirror thi mirror of hi soul that he wa look at vaniti curios hypocrisi had there been noth more in hi renunci than that there had been someth more at least he thought so but who could tell no there had been noth more through vaniti he had spare her in hypocrisi he had worn the mask of good for curios sake he had tri the denial of self he recogn that now but thi murderwa it to dog him all hi life wa he alwai to be burden by hi past wa he realli to confess never there wa onli on bit of evid left against him the pictur itselfthat wa evid he would destroi it why had he kept it so long onc it had given him pleasur to watch it chang and grow old of late he had felt no such pleasur it had kept him awak at night when he had been awai he had been fill with terror lest other ey should look upon it it had brought melancholi across hi passion it mere memori had mar mani moment of joi it had been like conscienc to him ye it had been conscienc he would destroi it he look round and saw the knife that had stab basil hallward he had clean it mani time till there wa no stain left upon it it wa bright and glisten as it had kill the painter so it would kill the painter work and all that that meant it would kill the past and when that wa dead he would be free it would kill thi monstrou soullif and without it hideou warn he would be at peac he seiz the thing and stab the pictur with it there wa a cry heard and a crash the cry wa so horribl in it agoni that the frighten servant woke and crept out of their room two gentlemen who were pass in the squar below stop and look up at the great hous thei walk on till thei met a policeman and brought him back the man rang the bell sever time but there wa no answer except for a light in on of the top window the hous wa all
