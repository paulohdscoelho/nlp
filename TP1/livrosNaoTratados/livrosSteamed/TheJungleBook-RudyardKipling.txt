veri grate to shere khan shall i tell him of your gratitud said tabaqui out snap father wolf out and hunt with thy master thou hast done harm enough for on night i go said tabaqui quietli ye can hear shere khan below in the thicket i might have save myself the messag father wolf listen and below in the vallei that ran down to a littl river he heard the dry angri snarli singsong whine of a tiger who ha caught noth and doe not care if all the jungl know it the fool said father wolf to begin a night s work with that nois doe he think that our buck ar like hi fat waingunga bullock h sh it is neither bullock nor buck he hunt tonight said mother wolf it is man the whine had chang to a sort of hum purr that seem to come from everi quarter of the compass it wa the nois that bewild woodcutt and gypsi sleep in the open and make them run sometim into the veri mouth of the tiger man said father wolf show all hi white teeth faugh ar there not enough beetl and frog in the tank that he must eat man and on our ground too the law of the jungl which never order anyth without a reason forbid everi beast to eat man except when he is kill to show hi children how to kill and then he must hunt outsid the hunt ground of hi pack or tribe the real reason for thi is that mankil mean sooner or later the arriv of white men on eleph with gun and hundr of brown men with gong and rocket and torch then everybodi in the jungl suffer the reason the beast give among themselv is that man is the weakest and most defenseless of all live thing and it is unsportsmanlik to touch him thei sai tooand it is truethat maneat becom mangi and lose their teeth the purr grew louder and end in the fullthroat aaarh of the tiger s charg then there wa a howlan untigerish howlfrom shere khan he ha miss said mother wolf what is it father wolf ran out a few pace and heard shere khan mutter and mumbl savag as he tumbl about in the scrub the fool ha had no more sens than to jump at a woodcutt s campfir and ha burn hi feet said father wolf with a grunt tabaqui is with him someth is come uphil said mother wolf twitch on ear get readi the bush rustl a littl in the thicket and father wolf drop with hi haunch under him readi for hi leap then if you had been watch you would have seen the most wonder thing in the worldth wolf check in midspr he made hi bound befor he saw what it wa he wa jump at and then he tri to stop himself the result wa that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet land almost where he left ground man he snap a man s cub look directli in front of him hold on by a low branch stood a nake brown babi who could just walka soft and as dimpl a littl atom as ever came to a wolf s cave at night he look up into father wolf s face and laugh is that a man s cub said mother wolf i have never seen on bring it here a wolf accustom to move hi own cub can if necessari mouth an egg without break it and though father wolf s jaw close right on the child s back not a tooth even scratch the skin as he laid it down among the cub how littl how nake andhow bold said mother wolf softli the babi wa push hi wai between the cub to get close to the warm hide ahai he is take hi meal with the other and so thi is a man s cub now wa there ever a wolf that could boast of a man s cub among her children i have heard now and again of such a thing but never in our pack or in my time said father wolf he is altogeth without hair and i could kill him with a touch of my foot but see he look up and is not afraid the moonlight wa block out of the mouth of the cave for shere khan s great squar head and shoulder were thrust into the entranc tabaqui behind him wa squeak my lord my lord it went in here shere khan doe us great honor said father wolf but hi ey were veri angri what doe shere khan need my quarri a man s cub went thi wai said shere khan it parent have run off give it to me shere khan had jump at a woodcutt s campfir as father wolf had said and wa furiou from the pain of hi burn feet but father wolf knew that the mouth of the cave wa too narrow for a tiger to come in by even where he wa shere khan s shoulder and forepaw were cramp for want of room as a man s would be if he tri to fight in a barrel the wolv ar a free peopl said father wolf thei take order from the head of the pack and not from ani stripe cattlekil the man s cub is oursto kill if we choos ye choos and ye do not choos what talk is thi of choos by the bull that i kill am i to stand nose into your dog s den for my fair due it is i shere khan who speak the tiger s roar fill the cave with thunder mother wolf shook herself clear of the cub and sprang forward her ey like two green moon in the dark face the blaze ey of shere khan and it is i raksha the demon who answer the man s cub is mine lungrimin to me he shall not be kill he shall live to run with the pack and to hunt with the pack and in the end look you hunter of littl nake cubsfrogeaterfishkillerh shall hunt thee now get henc or by the sambhur that i kill i eat no starv cattl back thou goest to thy mother burn beast of the jungl lamer than ever thou camest into the world go father wolf look on amaz he had almost forgotten the dai when he won mother wolf in fair fight from five other wolv when she ran in the pack and wa not call the demon for compliment s sake shere khan might have face father wolf but he could not stand up against mother wolf for he knew that where he wa she had all the advantag of the ground and would fight to the death so he back out of the cave mouth growl and when he wa clear he shout each dog bark in hi own yard we will see what the pack will sai to thi foster of mancub the cub is mine and to my teeth he will come in the end o bushtail thiev mother wolf threw herself down pant among the cub and father wolf said to her grave shere khan speak thi much truth the cub must be shown to the pack wilt thou still keep him mother keep him she gasp he came nake by night alon and veri hungri yet he wa not afraid look he ha push on of my babe to on side alreadi and that lame butcher would have kill him and would have run off to the waingunga while the villag here hunt through all our lair in reveng keep him assuredli i will keep him lie still littl frog o thou mowglifor mowgli the frog i will call theeth time will come when thou wilt hunt shere khan as he ha hunt thee but what will our pack sai said father wolf the law of the jungl lai down veri clearli that ani wolf mai when he marri withdraw from the pack he belong to but as soon as hi cub ar old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the pack council which is gener held onc a month at full moon in order that the other wolv mai identifi them after that inspect the cub ar free to run where thei pleas and until thei have kill their first buck no excus is accept if a grown wolf of the pack kill on of them the punish is death where the murder can be found and if you think for a minut you will see that thi must be so father wolf wait till hi cub could run a littl and then on the night of the pack meet took them and mowgli and mother wolf to the council rocka hilltop cover with stone and boulder where a hundr wolv could hide akela the great grai lone wolf who led all the pack by strength and cun lai out at full length on hi rock and below him sat forti or more wolv of everi size and color from badgercolor veteran who could handl a buck alon to young black threeyearold who thought thei could the lone wolf had led them for a year now he had fallen twice into a wolf trap in hi youth and onc he had been beaten and left for dead so he knew the manner and custom of men there wa veri littl talk at the rock the cub tumbl over each other in the center of the circl where their mother and father sat and now and again a senior wolf would go quietli up to a cub look at him carefulli and return to hi place on noiseless feet sometim a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been overlook akela from hi rock would cry ye know the lawy know the law look well o wolv and the anxiou mother would take up the call looklook well o wolv at lastand mother wolf s neck bristl lift as the time camefath wolf push mowgli the frog as thei call him into the center where he sat laugh and plai with some pebbl that glisten in the moonlight akela never rais hi head from hi paw but went on with the monoton cry look well a muffl roar came up from behind the rocksth voic of shere khan cry the cub is mine give him to me what have the free peopl to do with a man s cub akela never even twitch hi ear all he said wa look well o wolv what have the free peopl to do with the order of ani save the free peopl look well there wa a choru of deep growl and a young wolf in hi fourth year flung back shere khan s question to akela what have the free peopl to do with a man s cub now the law of the jungl lai down that if there is ani disput as to the right of a cub to be accept by the pack he must be spoken for by at least two member of the pack who ar not hi father and mother who speak for thi cub said akela among the free peopl who speak there wa no answer and mother wolf got readi for what she knew would be her last fight if thing came to fight then the onli other creatur who is allow at the pack councilbaloo the sleepi brown bear who teach the wolf cub the law of the jungl old baloo who can come and go where he pleas becaus he eat onli nut and root and honeyros upon hi hind quarter and grunt the man s cubth man s cub he said i speak for the man s cub there is no harm in a man s cub i have no gift of word but i speak the truth let him run with the pack and be enter with the other i myself will teach him we need yet anoth said akela baloo ha spoken and he is our teacher for the young cub who speak besid baloo a black shadow drop down into the circl it wa bagheera the black panther inki black all over but with the panther mark show up in certain light like the pattern of water silk everybodi knew bagheera and nobodi care to cross hi path for he wa as cun as tabaqui as bold as the wild buffalo and as reckless as the wound eleph but he had a voic as soft as wild honei drip from a tree and a skin softer than down o akela and ye the free peopl he pur i have no right in your assembl but the law of the jungl sai that if there is a doubt which is not a kill matter in regard to a new cub the life of that cub mai be bought at a price and the law doe not sai who mai or mai not pai that price am i right good good said the young wolv who ar alwai hungri listen to bagheera the cub can be bought for a price it is the law know that i have no right to speak here i ask your leav speak then cri twenti voic to kill a nake cub is shame besid he mai make better sport for you when he is grown baloo ha spoken in hi behalf now to baloo s word i will add on bull and a fat on newli kill not half a mile from here if ye will accept the man s cub accord to the law is it difficult there wa a clamor of score of voic sai what matter he will die in the winter rain he will scorch in the sun what harm can a nake frog do us let him run with the pack where is the bull bagheera let him be accept and then came akela s deep bai cry look welllook well o wolv mowgli wa still deepli interest in the pebbl and he did not notic when the wolv came and look at him on by on at last thei all went down the hill for the dead bull and onli akela bagheera baloo and mowgli s own wolv were left shere khan roar still in the night for he wa veri angri that mowgli had not been hand over to him ay roar well said bagheera under hi whisker for the time will come when thi nake thing will make thee roar to anoth tune or i know noth of man it wa well done said akela men and their cub ar veri wise he mai be a help in time truli a help in time of need for none can hope to lead the pack forev said bagheera akela said noth he wa think of the time that come to everi leader of everi pack when hi strength goe from him and he get feebler and feebler till at last he is kill by the wolv and a new leader come upto be kill in hi turn take him awai he said to father wolf and train him as befit on of the free peopl and that is how mowgli wa enter into the seeone wolf pack for the price of a bull and on baloo s good word now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole year and onli guess at all the wonder life that mowgli led among the wolv becaus if it were written out it would fill ever so mani book he grew up with the cub though thei of cours were grown wolv almost befor he wa a child and father wolf taught him hi busi and the mean of thing in the jungl till everi rustl in the grass everi breath of the warm night air everi note of the owl abov hi head everi scratch of a bat s claw as it roost for a while in a tree and everi splash of everi littl fish jump in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of hi offic mean to a busi man when he wa not learn he sat out in the sun and slept and at and went to sleep again when he felt dirti or hot he swam in the forest pool and when he want honei baloo told him that honei and nut were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat he climb up for it and that bagheera show him how to do bagheera would lie out on a branch and call come along littl brother and at first mowgli would cling like the sloth but afterward he would fling himself through the branch almost as boldli as the grai ap he took hi place at the council rock too when the pack met and there he discov that if he stare hard at ani wolf the wolf would be forc to drop hi ey and so he us to stare for fun at other time he would pick the long thorn out of the pad of hi friend for wolv suffer terribl from thorn and bur in their coat he would go down the hillsid into the cultiv land by night and look veri curious at the villag in their hut but he had a mistrust of men becaus bagheera show him a squar box with a drop gate so cunningli hidden in the jungl that he nearli walk into it and told him that it wa a trap he love better than anyth els to go with bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest to sleep all through the drowsi dai and at night see how bagheera did hi kill bagheera kill right and left as he felt hungri and so did mowgliwith on except as soon as he wa old enough to understand thing bagheera told him that he must never touch cattl becaus he had been bought into the pack at the price of a bull s life all the jungl is thine said bagheera and thou canst kill everyth that thou art strong enough to kill but for the sake of the bull that bought thee thou must never kill or eat ani cattl young or old that is the law of the jungl mowgli obei faithfulli and he grew and grew strong as a boi must grow who doe not know that he is learn ani lesson and who ha noth in the world to think of except thing to eat mother wolf told him onc or twice that shere khan wa not a creatur to be trust and that some dai he must kill shere khan but though a young wolf would have rememb that advic everi hour mowgli forgot it becaus he wa onli a boythough he would have call himself a wolf if he had been abl to speak in ani human tongu shere khan wa alwai cross hi path in the jungl for as akela grew older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friend with the younger wolv of the pack who follow him for scrap a thing akela would never have allow if he had dare to push hi author to the proper bound then shere khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young hunter were content to be led by a dy wolf and a man s cub thei tell me shere khan would sai that at council ye dare not look him between the ey and the young wolv would growl and bristl bagheera who had ey and ear everywher knew someth of thi and onc or twice he told mowgli in so mani word that shere khan would kill him some dai mowgli would laugh and answer i have the pack and i have thee and baloo though he is so lazi might strike a blow or two for my sake why should i be afraid it wa on veri warm dai that a new notion came to bagheeraborn of someth that he had heard perhap ikki the porcupin had told him but he said to mowgli when thei were deep in the jungl as the boi lai with hi head on bagheera s beauti black skin littl brother how often have i told thee that shere khan is thy enemi as mani time as there ar nut on that palm said mowgli who natur could not count what of it i am sleepi bagheera and shere khan is all long tail and loud talklik mao the peacock but thi is no time for sleep baloo know it i know it the pack know it and even the foolish foolish deer know tabaqui ha told thee too ho ho said mowgli tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude talk that i wa a nake man s cub and not fit to dig pignut but i caught tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palmtre to teach him better manner that wa foolish for though tabaqui is a mischiefmak he would have told thee of someth that concern thee close open those ey littl brother shere khan dare not kill thee in the jungl but rememb akela is veri old and soon the dai come when he cannot kill hi buck and then he will be leader no more mani of the wolv that look thee over when thou wast brought to the council first ar old too and the young wolv believ as shere khan ha taught them that a mancub ha no place with the pack in a littl time thou wilt be a man and what is a man that he should not run with hi brother said mowgli i wa born in the jungl i have obei the law of the jungl and there is no wolf of our from whose paw i have not pull a thorn sure thei ar my brother bagheera stretch himself at full length and half shut hi ey littl brother said he feel under my jaw mowgli put up hi strong brown hand and just under bagheera s silki chin where the giant roll muscl were all hid by the glossi hair he came upon a littl bald spot there is no on in the jungl that know that i bagheera carri that markth mark of the collar and yet littl brother i wa born among men and it wa among men that my mother diedin the cage of the king s palac at oodeypor it wa becaus of thi that i paid the price for thee at the council when thou wast a littl nake cub ye i too wa born among men i had never seen the jungl thei fed me behind bar from an iron pan till on night i felt that i wa bagheerath pantherand no man s playth and i broke the silli lock with on blow of my paw and came awai and becaus i had learn the wai of men i becam more terribl in the jungl than shere khan is it not so ye said mowgli all the jungl fear bagheeraal except mowgli oh thou art a man s cub said the black panther veri tenderli and even as i return to my jungl so thou must go back to men at lastto the men who ar thy brothersif thou art not kill in the council but whybut why should ani wish to kill me said mowgli look at me said bagheera and mowgli look at him steadili between the ey the big panther turn hi head awai in half a minut that is why he said shift hi paw on the leav not even i can look thee between the ey and i wa born among men and i love thee littl brother the other thei hate thee becaus their ey cannot meet thine becaus thou art wise becaus thou hast pull out thorn from their feetbecaus thou art a man i did not know these thing said mowgli sullenli and he frown under hi heavi black eyebrow what is the law of the jungl strike first and then give tongu by thy veri careless thei know that thou art a man but be wise it is in my heart that when akela miss hi next killand at each hunt it cost him more to pin the buckth pack will turn against him and against thee thei will hold a jungl council at the rock and thenand theni have it said bagheera leap up go thou down quickli to the men s hut in the vallei and take some of the red flower which thei grow there so that when the time come thou mayest have even a stronger friend than i or baloo or those of the pack that love thee get the red flower by red flower bagheera meant fire onli no creatur in the jungl will call fire by it proper name everi beast live in deadli fear of it and invent a hundr wai of describ it the red flower said mowgli that grow outsid their hut in the twilight i will get some there speak the man s cub said bagheera proudli rememb that it grow in littl pot get on swiftli and keep it by thee for time of need good said mowgli i go but art thou sure o my bagheera he slip hi arm around the splendid neck and look deep into the big ey art thou sure that all thi is shere khan s do by the broken lock that freed me i am sure littl brother then by the bull that bought me i will pai shere khan full tale for thi and it mai be a littl over said mowgli and he bound awai that is a man that is all a man said bagheera to himself ly down again oh shere khan never wa a blacker hunt than that froghunt of thine ten year ago mowgli wa far and far through the forest run hard and hi heart wa hot in him he came to the cave as the even mist rose and drew breath and look down the vallei the cub were out but mother wolf at the back of the cave knew by hi breath that someth wa troubl her frog what is it son she said some bat s chatter of shere khan he call back i hunt among the plow field tonight and he plung downward through the bush to the stream at the bottom of the vallei there he check for he heard the yell of the pack hunt heard the bellow of a hunt sambhur and the snort as the buck turn at bai then there were wick bitter howl from the young wolv akela akela let the lone wolf show hi strength room for the leader of the pack spring akela the lone wolf must have sprung and miss hi hold for mowgli heard the snap of hi teeth and then a yelp as the sambhur knock him over with hi forefoot he did not wait for anyth more but dash on and the yell grew fainter behind him as he ran into the cropland where the villag live bagheera spoke truth he pant as he nestl down in some cattl fodder by the window of a hut tomorrow is on dai both for akela and for me then he press hi face close to the window and watch the fire on the hearth he saw the husbandman s wife get up and feed it in the night with black lump and when the morn came and the mist were all white and cold he saw the man s child pick up a wicker pot plaster insid with earth fill it with lump of redhot charcoal put it under hi blanket and go out to tend the cow in the byre is that all said mowgli if a cub can do it there is noth to fear so he strode round the corner and met the boi took the pot from hi hand and disappear into the mist while the boi howl with fear thei ar veri like me said mowgli blow into the pot as he had seen the woman do thi thing will die if i do not give it thing to eat and he drop twig and dri bark on the red stuff halfwai up the hill he met

forget me the dawn wa begin to break when mowgli went down the hillsid alon to meet those mysteri thing that ar call men huntingsong of the seeone pack as the dawn wa break the sambhur bell onc twice and again and a doe leap up and a doe leap up from the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup thi i scout alon beheld onc twice and again as the dawn wa break the sambhur bell onc twice and again and a wolf stole back and a wolf stole back to carri the word to the wait pack and we sought and we found and we bai on hi track onc twice and again as the dawn wa break the wolf pack yell onc twice and again feet in the jungl that leav no mark ey that can see in the darkth dark tongueg tongu to it hark o hark onc twice and again kaa s hunt hi spot ar the joi of the leopard hi horn ar the buffalo s pride be clean for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of hi hide if ye find that the bullock can toss you or the heavybrow sambhur can gore ye need not stop work to inform us we knew it ten season befor oppress not the cub of the stranger but hail them as sister and brother for though thei ar littl and fubsi it mai be the bear is their mother there is none like to me sai the cub in the pride of hi earliest kill but the jungl is larg and the cub he is small let him think and be still maxim of baloo all that is told here happen some time befor mowgli wa turn out of the seeone wolf pack or reveng himself on shere khan the tiger it wa in the dai when baloo wa teach him the law of the jungl the big seriou old brown bear wa delight to have so quick a pupil for the young wolv will onli learn as much of the law of the jungl as appli to their own pack and tribe and run awai as soon as thei can repeat the hunt vers feet that make no nois ey that can see in the dark ear that can hear the wind in their lair and sharp white teeth all these thing ar the mark of our brother except tabaqui the jackal and the hyaena whom we hate but mowgli as a mancub had to learn a great deal more than thi sometim bagheera the black panther would come loung through the jungl to see how hi pet wa get on and would purr with hi head against a tree while mowgli recit the dai s lesson to baloo the boi could climb almost as well as he could swim and swim almost as well as he could run so baloo the teacher of the law taught him the wood and water law how to tell a rotten branch from a sound on how to speak polit to the wild bee when he came upon a hive of them fifti feet abov ground what to sai to mang the bat when he disturb him in the branch at middai and how to warn the watersnak in the pool befor he splash down among them none of the jungl peopl like be disturb and all ar veri readi to fly at an intrud then too mowgli wa taught the stranger hunt call which must be repeat aloud till it is answer whenev on of the junglepeopl hunt outsid hi own ground it mean translat give me leav to hunt here becaus i am hungri and the answer is hunt then for food but not for pleasur all thi will show you how much mowgli had to learn by heart and he grew veri tire of sai the same thing over a hundr time but as baloo said to bagheera on dai when mowgli had been cuf and run off in a temper a man s cub is a man s cub and he must learn all the law of the jungl but think how small he is said the black panther who would have spoil mowgli if he had had hi own wai how can hi littl head carri all thy long talk is there anyth in the jungl too littl to be kill no that is why i teach him these thing and that is why i hit him veri softli when he forget softli what dost thou know of soft old ironfeet bagheera grunt hi face is all bruis todai by thysoft ugh better he should be bruis from head to foot by me who love him than that he should come to harm through ignor baloo answer veri earnestli i am now teach him the master word of the jungl that shall protect him with the bird and the snake peopl and all that hunt on four feet except hi own pack he can now claim protect if he will onli rememb the word from all in the jungl is not that worth a littl beat well look to it then that thou dost not kill the mancub he is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claw upon but what ar those master word i am more like to give help than to ask it bagheera stretch out on paw and admir the steelblu rippingchisel talon at the end of it still i should like to know i will call mowgli and he shall sai themif he will come littl brother my head is ring like a bee tree said a sullen littl voic over their head and mowgli slid down a tree trunk veri angri and indign ad as he reach the ground i come for bagheera and not for thee fat old baloo that is all on to me said baloo though he wa hurt and griev tell bagheera then the master word of the jungl that i have taught thee thi dai master word for which peopl said mowgli delight to show off the jungl ha mani tongu i know them all a littl thou knowest but not much see o bagheera thei never thank their teacher not on small wolfl ha ever come back to thank old baloo for hi teach sai the word for the huntingpeopl thengreat scholar we be of on blood ye and i said mowgli give the word the bear accent which all the hunt peopl us good now for the bird mowgli repeat with the kite s whistl at the end of the sentenc now for the snakepeopl said bagheera the answer wa a perfectli indescrib hiss and mowgli kick up hi feet behind clap hi hand togeth to applaud himself and jump on to bagheera s back where he sat sidewai drum with hi heel on the glossi skin and make the worst face he could think of at baloo therether that wa worth a littl bruis said the brown bear tenderli some dai thou wilt rememb me then he turn asid to tell bagheera how he had beg the master word from hathi the wild eleph who know all about these thing and how hathi had taken mowgli down to a pool to get the snake word from a watersnak becaus baloo could not pronounc it and how mowgli wa now reason safe against all accid in the jungl becaus neither snake bird nor beast would hurt him no on then is to be fear baloo wound up pat hi big furri stomach with pride except hi own tribe said bagheera under hi breath and then aloud to mowgli have a care for my rib littl brother what is all thi danc up and down mowgli had been try to make himself heard by pull at bagheera s shoulder fur and kick hard when the two listen to him he wa shout at the top of hi voic and so i shall have a tribe of my own and lead them through the branch all dai long what is thi new folli littl dreamer of dream said bagheera ye and throw branch and dirt at old baloo mowgli went on thei have promis me thi ah whoof baloo s big paw scoop mowgli off bagheera s back and as the boi lai between the big forepaw he could see the bear wa angri mowgli said baloo thou hast been talk with the bandarlogth monkei peopl mowgli look at bagheera to see if the panther wa angri too and bagheera s ey were as hard as jade stone thou hast been with the monkei peopleth grai apesth peopl without a lawth eater of everyth that is great shame when baloo hurt my head said mowgli he wa still on hi back i went awai and the grai ap came down from the tree and had piti on me no on els care he snuffl a littl the piti of the monkei peopl baloo snort the still of the mountain stream the cool of the summer sun and then mancub and then and then thei gave me nut and pleasant thing to eat and theythei carri me in their arm up to the top of the tree and said i wa their blood brother except that i had no tail and should be their leader some dai thei have no leader said bagheera thei lie thei have alwai li thei were veri kind and bade me come again why have i never been taken among the monkei peopl thei stand on their feet as i do thei do not hit me with their hard paw thei plai all dai let me get up bad baloo let me up i will plai with them again listen mancub said the bear and hi voic rumbl like thunder on a hot night i have taught thee all the law of the jungl for all the peopl of the jungleexcept the monkeyfolk who live in the tree thei have no law thei ar outcast thei have no speech of their own but us the stolen word which thei overhear when thei listen and peep and wait up abov in the branch their wai is not our wai thei ar without leader thei have no remembr thei boast and chatter and pretend that thei ar a great peopl about to do great affair in the jungl but the fall of a nut turn their mind to laughter and all is forgotten we of the jungl have no deal with them we do not drink where the monkei drink we do not go where the monkei go we do not hunt where thei hunt we do not die where thei die hast thou ever heard me speak of the bandarlog till todai no said mowgli in a whisper for the forest wa veri still now baloo had finish the junglepeopl put them out of their mouth and out of their mind thei ar veri mani evil dirti shameless and thei desir if thei have ani fix desir to be notic by the jungl peopl but we do not notic them even when thei throw nut and filth on our head he had hardli spoken when a shower of nut and twig spatter down through the branch and thei could hear cough and howl and angri jump high up in the air among the thin branch the monkeypeopl ar forbidden said baloo forbidden to the junglepeopl rememb forbidden said bagheera but i still think baloo should have warn thee against them ii how wa i to guess he would plai with such dirt the monkei peopl faugh a fresh shower came down on their head and the two trot awai take mowgli with them what baloo had said about the monkei wa perfectli true thei belong to the treetop and as beast veri seldom look up there wa no occas for the monkei and the junglepeopl to cross each other s path but whenev thei found a sick wolf or a wound tiger or bear the monkei would torment him and would throw stick and nut at ani beast for fun and in the hope of be notic then thei would howl and shriek senseless song and invit the junglepeopl to climb up their tree and fight them or would start furiou battl over noth among themselv and leav the dead monkei where the junglepeopl could see them thei were alwai just go to have a leader and law and custom of their own but thei never did becaus their memori would not hold over from dai to dai and so thei compromis thing by make up a sai what the bandarlog think now the jungl will think later and that comfort them a great deal none of the beast could reach them but on the other hand none of the beast would notic them and that wa why thei were so pleas when mowgli came to plai with them and thei heard how angri baloo wa thei never meant to do ani moreth bandarlog never mean anyth at all but on of them invent what seem to him a brilliant idea and he told all the other that mowgli would be a us person to keep in the tribe becaus he could weav stick togeth for protect from the wind so if thei caught him thei could make him teach them of cours mowgli as a woodcutt s child inherit all sort of instinct and us to make littl hut of fallen branch without think how he came to do it the monkeypeopl watch in the tree consid hi plai most wonder thi time thei said thei were realli go to have a leader and becom the wisest peopl in the jungleso wise that everyon els would notic and envi them therefor thei follow baloo and bagheera and mowgli through the jungl veri quietli till it wa time for the middai nap and mowgli who wa veri much asham of himself slept between the panther and the bear resolv to have no more to do with the monkei peopl the next thing he rememb wa feel hand on hi leg and armshard strong littl handsand then a swash of branch in hi face and then he wa stare down through the swai bough as baloo woke the jungl with hi deep cri and bagheera bound up the trunk with everi tooth bare the bandarlog howl with triumph and scuffl awai to the upper branch where bagheera dare not follow shout he ha notic us bagheera ha notic us all the junglepeopl admir us for our skill and our cun then thei began their flight and the flight of the monkeypeopl through treeland is on of the thing nobodi can describ thei have their regular road and crossroad up hill and down hill all laid out from fifti to seventi or a hundr feet abov ground and by these thei can travel even at night if necessari two of the strongest monkei caught mowgli under the arm and swung off with him through the treetop twenti feet at a bound had thei been alon thei could have gone twice as fast but the boi s weight held them back sick and giddi as mowgli wa he could not help enjoi the wild rush though the glimps of earth far down below frighten him and the terribl check and jerk at the end of the swing over noth but empti air brought hi heart between hi teeth hi escort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost branch crackl and bend under them and then with a cough and a whoop would fling themselv into the air outward and downward and bring up hang by their hand or their feet to the lower limb of the next tree sometim he could see for mile and mile across the still green jungl as a man on the top of a mast can see for mile across the sea and then the branch and leav would lash him across the face and he and hi two guard would be almost down to earth again so bound and crash and whoop and yell the whole tribe of bandarlog swept along the treeroad with mowgli their prison for a time he wa afraid of be drop then he grew angri but knew better than to struggl and then he began to think the first thing wa to send back word to baloo and bagheera for at the pace the monkei were go he knew hi friend would be left far behind it wa useless to look down for he could onli see the topsid of the branch so he stare upward and saw far awai in the blue rann the kite balanc and wheel as he kept watch over the jungl wait for thing to die rann saw that the monkei were carri someth and drop a few hundr yard to find out whether their load wa good to eat he whistl with surpris when he saw mowgli be drag up to a treetop and heard him give the kite call for we be of on blood thou and i the wave of the branch close over the boi but rann balanc awai to the next tree in time to see the littl brown face come up again mark my trail mowgli shout tell baloo of the seeone pack and bagheera of the council rock in whose name brother rann had never seen mowgli befor though of cours he had heard of him mowgli the frog mancub thei call me mark my trail the last word were shriek as he wa be swung through the air but rann nod and rose up till he look no bigger than a speck of dust and there he hung watch with hi telescop ey the swai of the treetop as mowgli s escort whirl along thei never go far he said with a chuckl thei never do what thei set out to do alwai peck at new thing ar the bandarlog thi time if i have ani eyesight thei have peck down troubl for themselv for baloo is no fledgl and bagheera can as i know kill more than goat so he rock on hi wing hi feet gather up under him and wait meantim baloo and bagheera were furiou with rage and grief bagheera climb as he had never climb befor but the thin branch broke beneath hi weight and he slip down hi claw full of bark why didst thou not warn the mancub he roar to poor baloo who had set off at a clumsi trot in the hope of overtak the monkei what wa the us of half slai him with blow if thou didst not warn him hast o hast wew mai catch them yet baloo pant at that speed it would not tire a wound cow teacher of the lawcubbeatera mile of that roll to and fro would burst thee open sit still and think make a plan thi is no time for chase thei mai drop him if we follow too close arrula whoo thei mai have drop him alreadi be tire of carri him who can trust the bandarlog put dead bat on my head give me black bone to eat roll me into the hive of the wild bee that i mai be stung to death and buri me with the hyaena for i am most miser of bear arulala wahooa o mowgli mowgli why did i not warn thee against the monkeyfolk instead of break thy head now perhap i mai have knock the dai s lesson out of hi mind and he will be alon in the jungl without the master word baloo clasp hi paw over hi ear and roll to and fro moan at least he gave me all the word correctli a littl time ago said bagheera impati baloo thou hast neither memori nor respect what would the jungl think if i the black panther curl myself up like ikki the porcupin and howl what do i care what the jungl think he mai be dead by now unless and until thei drop him from the branch in sport or kill him out of idl i have no fear for the mancub he is wise and well taught and abov all he ha the ey that make the junglepeopl afraid but and it is a great evil he is in the power of the bandarlog and thei becaus thei live in tree have no fear of ani of our peopl bagheera lick on forepaw thoughtfulli fool that i am oh fat brown rootdig fool that i am said baloo uncoil himself with a jerk it is true what hathi the wild eleph sai to each hi own fear and thei the bandarlog fear kaa the rock snake he can climb as well as thei can he steal the young monkei in the night the whisper of hi name make their wick tail cold let us go to kaa what will he do for us he is not of

bandarlog have shift their ground he said quietli when i came up into the sun todai i heard them whoop among the treetop itit is the bandarlog that we follow now said baloo but the word stuck in hi throat for that wa the first time in hi memori that on of the junglepeopl had own to be interest in the do of the monkei beyond doubt then it is no small thing that take two such hunterslead in their own jungl i am certainon the trail of the bandarlog kaa repli courteous as he swell with curios inde baloo began i am no more than the old and sometim veri foolish teacher of the law to the seeone

our mancub of whom thou hast perhap heard i heard some new from ikki hi quill make him presumptu of a manth that wa enter into a wolf pack but i did not believ ikki is full of stori half heard and

iwelov him kaa ts ts said kaa weav hi head to and fro i also have known what love is there ar tale i could tell that that need a clear night when we ar all well fed to prais properli said bagheera quickli our mancub is in the hand of the bandarlog now and we know that of all the junglepeopl thei fear kaa alon thei fear me alon thei have good reason said kaa chatter foolish vainvain foolish and chatter ar the monkei but a manth in their hand is in no good luck thei grow tire of the nut thei pick and throw them down thei carri a branch half a dai mean to do great thing with it and then thei snap it in two that manth is not to be envi thei call me alsoyellow fish wa it not wormwormearthworm said bagheera as well as other thing which i cannot now sai for shame we must remind them to speak well of their master aaassp we must help their wander memori now whither went thei with the cub the jungl alon know toward the sunset i believ said baloo we had thought that thou wouldst know kaa i how i take them when thei come in my wai but i do not hunt the bandarlog or frogsor green scum on a waterhol for that matter up up up up hillo illo illo look up baloo of the seeone wolf pack baloo look up to see where the voic came from and there wa rann the kite sweep down with the sun shine on the upturn flang of hi wing it wa near rann s bedtim but he had rang all over the jungl look for the bear and had miss him in the thick foliag what is it said baloo i have seen mowgli among the bandarlog he bade me tell you i watch the bandarlog have taken him beyond the river to the monkei cityto the cold lair thei mai stai there for a night or ten night or an hour i have told the bat to watch through the dark time that is my messag good hunt all you below full gorg and a deep sleep to you rann cri bagheera i will rememb thee in my next kill and put asid the head for thee alon o best of kite it is noth it is noth the boi held the master word i could have done no less and rann circl up again to hi roost he ha not forgotten to us hi tongu said baloo with a chuckl of pride to think of on so young rememb the master word for the bird too while he wa be pull across tree it wa most firmli driven into him said bagheera but i am proud of him and now we must go to the cold lair thei all knew where that place wa but few of the jungl peopl ever went there becaus what thei call the cold lair wa an old desert citi lost and buri in the jungl and beast seldom us a place that men have onc us the wild boar will but the hunt tribe do not besid the monkei live there as much as thei could be said to live anywher and no selfrespect anim would come within eyeshot of it except in time of drought when the halfruin tank and reservoir held a littl water it is half a night s journeyat full speed said bagheera and baloo look veri seriou i will go as fast as i can he said anxious we dare not wait for thee follow baloo we must go on the quickfootkaa and i feet or no feet i can keep abreast of all thy four said kaa shortli baloo made on effort to hurri but had to sit down pant and so thei left him to come on later while bagheera hurri forward at the quick panthercant kaa said noth but strive as bagheera might the huge rockpython held level with him when thei came to a hill stream bagheera gain becaus he bound across while kaa swam hi head and two feet of hi neck clear the water but on level ground kaa made up the distanc by the broken lock that freed me said bagheera when twilight had fallen thou art no slow goer i am hungri said kaa besid thei call me speckl frog wormearthworm and yellow to boot all on let us go on and kaa seem to pour himself along the ground find the shortest road with hi steadi ey and keep to it in the cold lair the monkeypeopl were not think of mowgli s friend at all thei had brought the boi to the lost citi and were veri much pleas with themselv for the time mowgli had never seen an indian citi befor and though thi wa almost a heap of ruin it seem veri wonder and splendid some king had built it long ago on a littl hill you could still trace the stone causewai that led up to the ruin gate where the last splinter of wood hung to the worn rust hing tree had grown into and out of the wall the battlement were tumbl down and decai and wild creeper hung out of the window of the tower on the wall in bushi hang clump a great roofless palac crown the hill and the marbl of the courtyard and the fountain wa split and stain with red and green and the veri cobbleston in the courtyard where the king s eleph us to live had been thrust up and apart by grass and young tree from the palac you could see the row and row of roofless hous that made up the citi look like empti honeycomb fill with black the shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the squar where four road met the pit and dimpl at street corner where the public well onc stood and the shatter dome of templ with wild fig sprout on their side the monkei call the place their citi and pretend to despis the junglepeopl becaus thei live in the forest and yet thei never knew what the build were made for nor how to us them thei would sit in circl on the hall of the king s council chamber and scratch for flea and pretend to be men or thei would run in and out of the roofless hous and collect piec of plaster and old brick in a corner and forget where thei had hidden them and fight and cry in scuffl crowd and then break off to plai up and down the terrac of the king s garden where thei would shake the rose tree and the orang in sport to see the fruit and flower fall thei explor all the passag and dark tunnel in the palac and the hundr of littl dark room but thei never rememb what thei had seen and what thei had not and so drift about in on and two or crowd tell each other that thei were do as men did thei drank at the tank and made the water all muddi and then thei fought over it and then thei would all rush togeth in mob and shout there is no on in the jungl so wise and good and clever and strong and gentl as the bandarlog then all would begin again till thei grew tire of the citi and went back to the treetop hope the junglepeopl would notic them mowgli who had been train under the law of the jungl did not like or understand thi kind of life the monkei drag him into the cold lair late in the afternoon and instead of go to sleep as mowgli would have done after a long journei thei join hand and danc about and sang their foolish song on of the monkei made a speech and told hi companion that mowgli s captur mark a new thing in the histori of the bandarlog for mowgli wa go to show them how to weav stick and cane togeth as a protect against rain and cold mowgli pick up some creeper and began to work them in and out and the monkei tri to imit but in a veri few minut thei lost interest and began to pull their friend tail or jump up and down on all four cough i wish to eat said mowgli i am a stranger in thi part of the jungl bring me food or give me leav to hunt here twenti or thirti monkei bound awai to bring him nut and wild pawpaw but thei fell to fight on the road and it wa too much troubl to go back with what wa left of the fruit mowgli wa sore and angri as well as hungri and he roam through the empti citi give the stranger hunt call from time to time but no on answer him and mowgli felt that he had reach a veri bad place inde all that baloo ha said about the bandarlog is true he thought to himself thei have no law no hunt call and no leadersnoth but foolish word and littl pick thievish hand so if i am starv or kill here it will be all my own fault but i must try to return to my own jungl baloo will sure beat me but that is better than chase silli rose leav with the bandarlog no sooner had he walk to the citi wall than the monkei pull him back tell him that he did not know how happi he wa and pinch him to make him grate he set hi teeth and said noth but went with the shout monkei to a terrac abov the red sandston reservoir that were halfful of rain water there wa a ruin summerhous of white marbl in the center of the terrac built for queen dead a hundr year ago the dome roof had half fallen in and block up the underground passag from the palac by which the queen us to enter but the wall were made of screen of marbl tracerybeauti milkwhit fretwork set with agat and cornelian and jasper and lapi lazuli and as the moon came up behind the hill it shone through the open work cast shadow on the ground like black velvet embroideri sore sleepi and hungri as he wa mowgli could not help laugh when the bandarlog began twenti at a time to tell him how great and wise and strong and gentl thei were and how foolish he wa to wish to leav them we ar great we ar free we ar wonder we ar the most wonder peopl in all the jungl we all sai so and so it must be true thei shout now as you ar a new listen and can carri our word back to the junglepeopl so that thei mai notic us in futur we will tell you all about our most excel selv mowgli made no object and the monkei gather by hundr and hundr on the terrac to listen to their own speaker sing the prais of the bandarlog and whenev a speaker stop for want of breath thei would all shout togeth thi is true we all sai so mowgli nod and blink and said ye when thei ask him a question and hi head spun with the nois tabaqui the jackal must have bitten all these peopl he said to himself and now thei have mad certainli thi is dewane the mad do thei never go to sleep now there is a cloud come to cover that moon if it were onli a big enough cloud i might try to run awai in the dark but i am tire that same cloud wa be watch by two good friend in the ruin ditch below the citi wall for bagheera and kaa know well how danger the monkeypeopl were in larg number did not wish to run ani risk the monkei never fight unless thei ar a hundr to on and few in the jungl care for those odd i will go to the west wall kaa whisper and come down swiftli with the slope of the ground in my favor thei will not throw themselv upon my back in their hundr but i know it said bagheera would that baloo were here but we must do what we can when that cloud cover the moon i shall go to the terrac thei hold some sort of council there over the boi good hunt said kaa grimli and glide awai to the west wall that happen to be the least ruin of ani and the big snake wa delai awhil befor he could find a wai up the stone the cloud hid the moon and as mowgli wonder what would come next he heard bagheera s light feet on the terrac the black panther had race up the slope almost without a sound and wa strikingh knew better than to wast time in bitingright and left among the monkei who were seat round mowgli in circl fifti and sixti deep there wa a howl of fright and rage and then as bagheera trip on the roll kick bodi beneath him a monkei shout there is onli on here kill him kill a scuffl mass of monkei bite scratch tear and pull close over bagheera while five or six laid hold of mowgli drag him up the wall of the summerhous and push him through the hole of the broken dome a mantrain boi would have been badli bruis for the fall wa a good fifteen feet but mowgli fell as baloo had taught him to fall and land on hi feet stai there shout the monkei till we have kill thy friend and later we will plai with theeif the poisonpeopl leav thee aliv we be of on

tank where the monkei could not follow the panther lai gasp for breath hi head just out of the water while the monkei stood three deep on the red step danc up and down with rage readi to spring upon him from all side if he came out to help baloo it wa then that bagheera lift up hi drip chin and in despair gave the snake s call for protect we be of on blood ye and i for he believ that kaa had turn

what of the quarri ye went to kill brother he crop in the jungl still where is the power that made your pride brother it ebb from my flank and side where is the hast that ye hurri by brother i go to my lairto die now we must go back to the first tale when mowgli left the wolf s cave after the fight with the pack at the council rock he went down to the plow land where the villag live but he would not stop there becaus it wa too near to the jungl and he knew that he had made at least on bad enemi at the council so he hurri on keep to the rough road that ran down the vallei and follow it at a steadi jogtrot for nearli twenti mile till he came to a countri that he did not know the vallei open out into a great plain dot over with rock and cut up by ravin at on end stood a littl villag and at the other the thick jungl came down in a sweep to the grazingground and stop there as though it had been cut off with a hoe all over the plain cattl and buffalo were graze and when the littl boi in charg of the herd saw mowgli thei shout and ran awai and the yellow pariah dog that hang about everi indian villag bark mowgli walk on for he wa feel hungri and when he came to the villag gate he saw the big thornbush that wa drawn up befor the gate at twilight push to on side umph he said for he had come across more than on such barricad in hi night rambl after thing to eat so men ar afraid of the peopl of the jungl here also he sat down by the gate and when a man came out he stood up open hi mouth and point down it to show that he want food the man stare and ran back up the on street of the villag shout for the priest who wa a big fat man dress in white with a red and yellow mark on hi forehead the priest came to the gate and with him at least a hundr peopl who stare and talk and shout and point at mowgli thei have no manner these men folk said mowgli to himself onli the grai ap would behav as thei do so he threw back hi long hair and frown at the crowd what is there to be afraid of said the priest look at the mark on hi arm and leg thei ar the bite of wolv he is but a wolfchild run awai from the jungl of cours in plai togeth the cub had often nip mowgli harder than thei intend and there were white scar all over hi arm and leg but he would have been the last person in the world to call these bite for he knew what real bite meant arr arr said two or three women togeth to be bitten by wolv poor child he is a handsom boi he ha ey like red fire by my honor messua he is not unlik thy boi that wa taken by the tiger let me look said a woman with heavi copper ring on her wrist and ankl and she peer at mowgli under the palm of her hand inde he is not he is thinner but he ha the veri look of my boi the priest wa a clever man and he knew that messua wa wife to the richest villag in the place so he look up at the sky for a minut and said solemnli what the jungl ha taken the jungl ha restor take the boi into thy hous my sister and forget not to honor the priest who see so far into the live of men by the bull that bought me said mowgli to himself but all thi talk is like anoth lookingov by the pack well if i am a man a man i must becom the crowd part as the woman beckon mowgli to her hut where there wa a red lacquer bedstead a great earthen grain chest with funni rais pattern on it half a dozen copper cook pot an imag of a hindu god in a littl alcov and on the wall a real look glass such as thei sell at the countri fair she gave him a long drink of milk and some bread and then she laid her hand on hi head and look into hi ey for she thought perhap that he might be her real son come back from the jungl where the tiger had taken him so she said nathoo o nathoo mowgli did not show that he knew the name dost thou not rememb the dai when i gave thee thy new shoe she touch hi foot and it wa almost as hard as horn no she said sorrowfulli those feet have never worn shoe but thou art veri like my nathoo and thou shalt be my son mowgli wa uneasi becaus he had never been under a roof befor but as he look at the thatch he saw that he could tear it out ani time if he want to get awai and that the window had no fasten what is the good of a man he said to himself at last if he doe not understand man s talk now i am as silli and dumb as a man would be with us in the jungl i must speak their talk it wa not for fun that he had learn while he wa with the wolv to imit the challeng of buck in the jungl and the grunt of the littl wild pig so as soon as messua pronounc a word mowgli would imit it almost perfectli and befor dark he had learn the name of mani thing in the hut there wa a difficulti at bedtim becaus mowgli would not sleep under anyth that look so like a panther trap as that hut and when thei shut the door he went through the window give him hi will said messua s husband rememb he can never till now have slept on a bed if he is inde sent in the place of our son he will not run awai so mowgli stretch himself in some long clean grass at the edg of the field but befor he had close hi ey a soft grai nose poke him under the chin phew said grai brother he wa the eldest of mother wolf s cub thi is a poor reward for follow thee twenti mile thou smellest of wood smoke and cattlealtogeth like a man alreadi wake littl brother i bring new ar all well in the jungl said mowgli hug him all except the wolv that were burn with the red flower now listen shere khan ha gone awai to hunt far off till hi coat grow again for he is badli sing when he return he swear that he will lai thy bone in the waingunga there ar two word to that i also have made a littl promis but new is alwai good i am tire tonightveri tire with new thing grai brotherbut bring me the new alwai thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf men will not make thee forget said grai brother anxious never i will alwai rememb that i love thee and all in our cave but also i will alwai rememb that i have been cast out of the pack and that thou mayest be cast out of anoth pack men ar onli men littl brother and their talk is like the talk of frog in a pond when i come down here again i will wait for thee in the bamboo at the edg of the grazingground for three month after that night mowgli hardli ever left the villag gate he wa so busi learn the wai and custom of men first he had to wear a cloth round him which annoi him horribl and then he had to learn about monei which he did not in the least understand and about plow of which he did not see the us then the littl children in the villag made him veri angri luckili the law of the jungl had taught him to keep hi temper for in the jungl life and food depend on keep your temper but when thei made fun of him becaus he would not plai game or fly kite or becaus he mispronounc some word onli the knowledg that it wa unsportsmanlik to kill littl nake cub kept him from pick them up and break them in two he did not know hi own strength in the least in the jungl he knew he wa weak compar with the beast but in the villag peopl said that he wa as strong as a bull and mowgli had not the faintest idea of the differ that cast make between man and man when the potter s donkei slip in the clai pit mowgli haul it out by the tail and help to stack the pot for their journei to the market at khanhiwara that wa veri shock too for the potter is a lowcast man and hi donkei is wors when the priest scold him mowgli threaten to put him on the donkei too and the priest told messua s husband that mowgli had better be set to work as soon as possibl and the villag headman told mowgli that he would have to go out with the buffalo next dai and herd them while thei graze no on wa more pleas than mowgli and that night becaus he had been appoint a servant of the villag as it were he went off to a circl that met everi even on a masonri platform under a great figtre it wa the villag club and the headman and the watchman and the barber who knew all the gossip of the villag and old buldeo the villag hunter who had a tower musket met and smoke the monkei sat and talk in the upper branch and there wa a hole under the platform where a cobra live and he had hi littl platter of milk everi night becaus he wa sacr and the old men sat around the tree and talk and pull at the big huqa the waterpip till far into the night thei told wonder tale of god and men and ghost and buldeo told even more wonder on of the wai of beast in the jungl till the ey of the children sit outsid the circl bulg out of their head most of the tale were about anim for the jungl wa alwai at their door the deer and the wild pig grub up their crop and now and again the tiger carri off a man at twilight within sight of the villag gate mowgli who natur knew someth about what thei were talk of had to cover hi face not to show that he wa laugh while buldeo the tower musket across hi knee climb on from on wonder stori to anoth and mowgli s shoulder shook buldeo wa explain how the tiger that had carri awai messua s son wa a ghosttig and hi bodi wa inhabit by the ghost of a wick old moneylend who had di some year ago and i know that thi is true he said becaus purun dass alwai limp from the blow that he got in a riot when hi account book were burn and the tiger that i speak of he limp too for the track of hi pad ar unequ true true that must be the truth said the graybeard nod togeth ar all these tale such cobweb and moon talk said mowgli that tiger limp becaus he wa born lame as everyon know to talk of the soul of a moneylend in a beast that never had the courag of a jackal is child s talk buldeo wa speechless with surpris for a moment and the headman stare oho it is the jungl brat is it said buldeo if thou art so wise better bring hi hide to khanhiwara for the govern ha set a hundr rupe on hi life better still talk not when thy elder speak mowgli rose to go all the even i have lain here listen he call back over hi shoulder and except onc or twice buldeo ha not said on word of truth concern the jungl which is at hi veri door how then shall i believ the tale of ghost and god and goblin which he sai he ha seen it is full time that boi went to herd said the headman while buldeo puf and snort at mowgli s impertin the custom of most indian villag is for a few boi to take the cattl and buffalo out to graze in the earli morn and bring them back at night the veri cattl that would trampl a white man to death allow themselv to be bang and bulli and shout at by children that hardli come up to their nose so long as the boi keep with the herd thei ar safe for not even the tiger will charg a mob of cattl but if thei straggl to pick flower or hunt lizard thei ar sometim carri off mowgli went through the villag street in the dawn sit on the back of rama the great herd bull the slatyblu buffalo with their long backwardsweep horn and savag ey rose out their byre on by on and follow him and mowgli made it veri clear to the children with him that he wa the master he beat the buffalo with a long polish bamboo and told kamya on of the boi to graze the cattl by themselv while he went on with the buffalo and to be veri care not to strai awai from the herd an indian graze ground is all rock and scrub and tussock and littl ravin among which the herd scatter and disappear the buffalo gener keep to the pool and muddi place where thei lie wallow or bask in the warm mud for hour mowgli drove them on to the edg of the plain where the waingunga came out of the jungl then he drop from rama s neck trot off to a bamboo clump and found grai brother ah said grai brother i have wait here veri mani dai what is the mean of thi cattleherd work it is an order said mowgli i am a villag herd for a while what new of shere khan he ha come back to thi countri and ha wait here a long time for thee now he ha gone off again for the game is scarc but he mean to kill thee veri good said mowgli so long as he is awai do thou or on of the four brother sit on that rock so that i can see thee as i come out of the villag when he come back wait for me in the ravin by the dhak tree in the center of the plain we need not walk into shere khan s mouth then mowgli pick out a shadi place and lai down and slept while the buffalo graze round him herd in india is on of the laziest thing in the world the cattl move and crunch and lie down and move on again and thei do not even low thei onli grunt and the buffalo veri seldom sai anyth but get down into the muddi pool on after anoth and work their wai into the mud till onli their nose and stare chinablu ey show abov the surfac and then thei lie like log the sun make the rock danc in the heat and the herd children hear on kite never ani more whistl almost out of sight overhead and thei know that if thei di or a cow di that kite would sweep down and the next kite mile awai would see him drop and follow and the next and the next and almost befor thei were dead there would be a score of hungri kite come out of nowher then thei sleep and wake and sleep again and weav littl basket of dri grass and put grasshopp in them or catch two prai mantis and make them fight or string a necklac of red and black jungl nut or watch a lizard bask on a rock or a snake hunt a frog near the wallow then thei sing long long song with odd nativ quaver at the end of them and the dai seem longer than most peopl s whole live and perhap thei make a mud castl with mud figur of men and hors and buffalo and put reed into the men s hand and pretend that thei ar king and the figur ar their armi or that thei ar god to be worship then even come and the children call and the buffalo lumber up out of the sticki mud with nois like gunshot go off on after the other and thei all string across the grai plain back to the twinkl villag light dai after dai mowgli would lead the buffalo out to their wallow and dai after dai he would see grai brother s back a mile and a half awai across the plain so he knew that shere khan had not come back and dai after dai he would lie on the grass listen to the nois round him and dream of old dai in the jungl if shere khan had made a fals step with hi lame paw up in the jungl by the waingunga mowgli would have heard him in those long still morn at last a dai came when he did not see grai brother at the signal place and he laugh and head the buffalo for the ravin by the dhk tree which wa all cover with goldenr flower there sat grai brother everi bristl on hi back lift he ha hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard he cross the rang last night with tabaqui hotfoot on thy trail said the wolf pant mowgli frown i am not afraid of shere khan but tabaqui is veri cun have no fear said grai brother lick hi lip a littl i met tabaqui in the dawn now he is tell all hi wisdom to the kite but he told me everyth befor i broke hi back shere khan s plan is to wait for thee at the villag gate thi eveningfor thee and for no on els he is ly up now in the big dry ravin of the waingunga ha he eaten todai or doe he hunt empti said mowgli for the answer meant life and death to him he kill at dawna pigand he ha drunk too rememb shere khan could never fast even for the sake of reveng oh fool fool what a cub s cub it is eaten and drunk too and he think that i shall wait till he ha slept now where doe he lie up if there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he li these buffalo will not charg unless thei wind him and i cannot speak their languag can we get behind hi track so that thei mai smell it he swam far down the waingunga to cut that off said grai brother tabaqui told him that i know he would never have thought of it alon mowgli stood with hi finger in hi mouth think the big ravin of the waingunga that open out on the plain not half a mile from here i can take the herd round through the jungl to the head of the ravin and then sweep downbut he would slink out at the foot we must block that end grai brother canst thou cut the herd in two for me not i perhapsbut i have brought a wise helper grai brother trot off and drop into a hole then there lift up a huge grai head that mowgli knew well and the hot air wa fill with the most desol cry of all the jungleth hunt howl of a wolf at middai akela akela said mowgli clap hi hand i might have known that thou wouldst not forget me we have a big work in hand cut the herd in two akela keep the cow and calv togeth and the bull and the plow buffalo by themselv the two wolv ran ladi chain fashion in and out of the herd which snort and threw up it head and separ into two clump in on the cowbuffalo stood with their calv in the center and glare and paw readi if a wolf would onli stai still to charg down and trampl the life out of him in the other the bull and the young bull snort and stamp but though thei look more impos thei were much less danger for thei had no calv to protect no six men could have divid the herd so neatli what order pant akela thei ar try to join again mowgli slip on to rama s back drive the bull awai to the left akela grai brother when we ar gone hold the cow togeth and drive them into the foot of the ravin how far said grai brother pant and snap till the side ar higher than shere khan can jump shout mowgli keep them there till we come down the bull swept off as akela bai and grai brother stop in front of the cow thei charg down on him and he ran just befor them to the foot of the ravin as akela drove the bull far to the left well done anoth charg and thei ar fairli start care nowcar akela a snap too much and the bull will charg hujah thi is wilder work than drive blackbuck didst thou think these creatur could move so swiftli mowgli call i havehav hunt these too in my time gasp akela in the dust shall i turn them into the jungl ay turn swiftli turn them rama is mad with rage oh if i could onli tell him what i need of him todai the bull were turn to the right thi time and crash into the stand thicket the other herd children watch with the cattl half a mile awai hurri to the villag as fast as their leg could carri them cry that the buffalo had gone mad and run awai but mowgli s plan wa simpl enough all he want to do wa to make a big circl uphil and get at the head of the ravin and then take the bull down it and catch shere khan between the bull and the cow for he knew that after a meal and a full drink shere khan would not be in ani condit to fight or to clamber up the side of the ravin he wa sooth the buffalo now by voic and akela had drop far to the rear onli whimper onc or twice to hurri the rearguard it wa a long long circl for thei did not wish to get too near the ravin and give shere khan warn at last mowgli round up the bewild herd at the head of the ravin on a grassi patch that slope steepli down to the ravin itself from that height you could see across the top of the tree down to the plain below but what mowgli look at wa the side of the ravin and he saw with a great deal of satisfact that thei ran nearli straight up and down while the vine and creeper that hung over them would give no foothold to a tiger who want to get out let them breath akela he said hold up hi hand thei have not wind him yet let them breath i must tell shere khan who come we have him in the trap he put hi hand to hi mouth and shout down the ravineit wa almost like shout down a tunneland the echo jump from rock to rock after a long time there came back the drawl sleepi snarl of a fullf tiger just waken who call said shere khan and a splendid peacock flutter up out of the ravin screech i mowgli cattl thief it is time to come to the council rock downhurri them down akela down rama down the herd paus for an instant at the edg of the slope but akela gave tongu in the full huntingyel and thei pitch over on after the other just as steamer shoot rapid the sand and stone spurt up round them onc start there wa no chanc of stop and befor thei were fairli in the bed of the ravin rama wind shere khan and bellow ha ha said mowgli on hi back now thou knowest and the torrent of black horn foam muzzl and stare ey whirl down the ravin just as boulder go down in floodtim the weaker buffalo be shoulder out to the side of the ravin where thei tore through the creeper thei knew what the busi wa befor themth terribl charg of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand shere khan heard the thunder of their hoof pick himself up and lumber down the ravin look from side to side for some wai of escap but the wall of the ravin were straight and he had to hold on heavi with hi dinner and hi drink will to do anyth rather than fight the herd splash through the pool he had just left bellow till the narrow cut rang mowgli heard an answer bellow from the foot of the ravin saw shere khan turn the tiger knew if the worst came to the worst it wa better to meet the bull than the cow with their calv and then rama trip stumbl and went on again over someth soft and with the bull at hi heel crash full into the other herd while the weaker buffalo were lift clean off their feet by the shock of the meet that charg carri both herd out into the plain gore and stamp and snort mowgli watch hi time and slip off rama s neck lai about him right and left with hi stick quick akela break them up scatter them or thei will be fight on anoth drive them awai akela hai rama hai hai hai my children softli now softli it is all over akela and grai brother ran to and fro nip the buffalo leg and though the herd wheel onc to charg up the ravin again mowgli manag to turn rama and the other follow him to the wallow shere khan need no more trampl he wa dead and the kite were come for him alreadi brother that wa a dog s death said mowgli feel for the knife he alwai carri in a sheath round hi neck now that he live with men but he would never have shown fight hi hide will look well on the council rock we must get to work swiftli a boi train among men would never have dream of skin a tenfoot tiger alon but mowgli knew better than anyon els how an anim s skin is fit on and how it can be taken off but it wa hard work and mowgli slash and tore and grunt for an hour while the wolv loll out their tongu or came forward and tug as he order them present a hand fell on hi shoulder and look up he saw buldeo with the tower musket the children had told the villag about the buffalo stamped and buldeo went out angrili onli too anxiou to correct mowgli for not take better care of the herd the

not wake thee nor shark overtak thee asleep in the arm of the slowswing sea seal lullabi all these thing happen sever year ago at a place call novastoshnah or north east point on the island of st paul awai and awai in the bere sea limmershin the winter wren told me the tale when he wa blown on to the rig of a steamer go to japan and i took him down into my cabin and warm and fed him for a coupl of dai till he wa fit to fly back to st paul s again limmershin is a veri quaint littl bird but he know how to tell the truth nobodi come to novastoshnah except on busi and the onli peopl who have regular busi there ar the seal thei come in the summer month by hundr and hundr of thousand out of the cold grai sea for novastoshnah beach ha the finest accommod for seal of ani place in all the world sea catch knew that and everi spring would swim from whatev place he happen to be inwould swim like a torpedoboat straight for novastoshnah and spend a month fight with hi companion for a good place on the rock as close to the sea as possibl sea catch wa fifteen year old a huge grai fur seal with almost a mane on hi shoulder and long wick dog teeth when he heav himself up on hi front flipper he stood more than four feet clear of the ground and hi weight if anyon had been bold enough to weigh him wa nearli seven hundr pound he wa scar all over with the mark of savag fight but he wa alwai readi for just on fight more he would put hi head on on side as though he were afraid to look hi enemi in the face then he would shoot it out like lightn and when the big teeth were firmli fix on the other seal s neck the other seal might get awai if he could but sea catch would not help him yet sea catch never chase a beaten seal for that wa against the rule of the beach he onli want room by the sea for hi nurseri but as there were forti or fifti thousand other seal hunt for the same thing each spring the whistl bellow roar and blow on the beach wa someth fright from a littl hill call hutchinson s hill you could look over three and a half mile of ground cover with fight seal and the surf wa dot all over with the head of seal hurri to land and begin their share of the fight thei fought in the breaker thei fought in the sand and thei fought on the smoothworn basalt rock of the nurseri for thei were just as stupid and unaccommod as men their wive never came to the island until late in mai or earli in june for thei did not care to be torn to piec and the young two three and fouryearold seal who had not begun housekeep went inland about half a mile through the rank of the fighter and plai about on the sand dune in drove and legion and rub off everi singl green thing that grew thei were call the holluschickieth bachelorsand there were perhap two or three hundr thousand of them at novastoshnah alon sea catch had just finish hi fortyfifth fight on spring when matkah hi soft sleek gentleei wife came up out of the sea and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dump her down on hi reserv sai gruffli late as usual where have you been it wa not the fashion for sea catch to eat anyth dure the four month he stai on the beach and so hi temper wa gener bad matkah knew better than to answer back she look round and coo how thought of you you ve taken the old place again i should think i had said sea catch look at me he wa scratch and bleed in twenti place on ey wa almost out and hi side were torn to ribbon oh you men you men matkah said fan herself with her hind flipper why can t you be sensibl and settl your place quietli you look as though you had been fight with the killer whale i haven t been do anyth but fight sinc the middl of mai the beach is disgracefulli crowd thi season i ve met at least a hundr seal from lukannon beach hous hunt why can t peopl stai where thei belong i ve often thought we should be much happier if we haul out at otter island instead of thi crowd place said matkah bah onli the holluschicki go to otter island if we went there thei would sai we were afraid we must preserv appear my dear sea catch sunk hi head proudli between hi fat shoulder and pretend to go to sleep for a few minut but all the time he wa keep a sharp lookout for a fight now that all the seal and their wive were on the land you could hear their clamor mile out to sea abov the loudest gale at the lowest count there were over a million seal on the beachold seal mother seal tini babi and holluschicki fight scuffl bleat crawl and plai togethergo down to the sea and come up from it in gang and regiment ly over everi foot of ground as far as the ey could reach and skirmish about in brigad through the fog it is nearli alwai foggi at novastoshnah except when the sun come out and make everyth look all pearli and rainbowcolor for a littl while kotick matkah s babi wa born in the middl of that confus and he wa all head and shoulder with pale wateri blue ey as tini seal must be but there wa someth about hi coat that made hi mother look at him veri close sea catch she said at last our babi s go to be white empti clamshel and dry seawe snort sea catch there never ha been such a thing in the world as a white seal i can t help that said matkah there s go to be now and she sang the low croon seal song that all the mother seal sing to their babi you mustn t swim till you re six week old or your head will be sunk by your heel and summer gale and killer whale ar bad for babi seal ar bad for babi seal dear rat as bad as bad can be but splash and grow strong and you can t be wrong child of the open sea of cours the littl fellow did not understand the word at first he paddl and scrambl about by hi mother s side and learn to scuffl out of the wai when hi father wa fight with anoth seal and the two roll and roar up and down the slipperi rock matkah us to go to sea to get thing to eat and the babi wa fed onli onc in two dai but then he at all he could and throve upon it the first thing he did wa to crawl inland and there he met ten of thousand of babi of hi own ag and thei plai togeth like puppi went to sleep on the clean sand and plai again the old peopl in the nurseri took no notic of them and the holluschicki kept to their own ground and the babi had a beauti playtim when matkah came back from her deepsea fish she would go straight to their playground and call as a sheep call for a lamb and wait until she heard kotick bleat then she would take the straightest of straight line in hi direct strike out with her fore flipper and knock the youngster head over heel right and left there were alwai a few hundr mother hunt for their children through the playground and the babi were kept live but as matkah told kotick so long as you don t lie in muddi water and get mang or rub the hard sand into a cut or scratch and so long as you never go swim when there is a heavi sea noth will hurt you here littl seal can no more swim than littl children but thei ar unhappi till thei learn the first time that kotick went down to the sea a wave carri him out beyond hi depth and hi big head sank and hi littl hind flipper flew up exactli as hi mother had told him in the song and if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have drown after that he learn to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the wave just cover him and lift him up while he paddl but he alwai kept hi ey open for big wave that might hurt he wa two week learn to us hi flipper and all that while he flounder in and out of the water and cough and grunt and crawl up the beach and took catnap on the sand and went back again until at last he found that he truli belong to the water then you can imagin the time that he had with hi companion duck under the roller or come in on top of a comber and land with a swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirl far up the beach or stand up on hi tail and scratch hi head as the old peopl did or plai i m the king of the castl on slipperi weedi rock that just stuck out of the wash now and then he would see a thin fin like a big shark s fin drift along close to shore and he knew that that wa the killer whale the grampu who eat young seal when he can get them and kotick would head for the beach like an arrow and the fin would jig off slowli as if it were look for noth at all late in octob the seal began to leav st paul s for the deep sea by famili and tribe and there wa no more fight over the nurseri and the holluschicki plai anywher thei like next year said matkah to kotick you will be a holluschicki but thi year you must learn how to catch fish thei set out togeth across the pacif and matkah show kotick how to sleep on hi back with hi flipper tuck down by hi side and hi littl nose just out of the water no cradl is so comfort as the long rock swell of the pacif when kotick felt hi skin tingl all over matkah told him he wa learn the feel of the water and that tingli prickli feel meant bad weather come and he must swim hard and get awai in a littl time she said you ll know where to swim to but just now we ll follow sea pig the porpois for he is veri wise a school of porpois were duck and tear through the water and littl kotick follow them as fast as he could how do you know where to go to he pant the leader of the school roll hi white ey and duck under my tail tingl youngster he said that mean there s a gale behind me come along when you re south of the sticki water he meant the equat and your tail tingl that mean there s a gale in front of you and you must head north come along the water feel bad here thi wa on of veri mani thing that kotick learn and he wa alwai learn matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the undersea bank and wrench the rockl out of hi hole among the weed how to skirt the wreck ly a hundr fathom below water and dart like a rifl bullet in at on porthol and out at anoth as the fish ran how to danc on the top of the wave when the lightn wa race all over the sky and wave hi flipper polit to the stumpytail albatross and the manofwar hawk as thei went down the wind how to jump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin flipper close to the side and tail curv to leav the fly fish alon becaus thei ar all boni to take the shoulderpiec out of a cod at full speed ten fathom deep and never to stop and look at a boat or a ship but particularli a rowboat at the end of six month what kotick did not know about deepsea fish wa not worth the know and all that time he never set flipper on dry ground on dai howev as he wa ly half asleep in the warm water somewher off the island of juan fernandez he felt faint and lazi all over just as human peopl do when the spring is in their leg and he rememb the good firm beach of novastoshnah seven thousand mile awai the game hi companion plai the smell of the seawe the seal roar and the fight that veri minut he turn north swim steadili and as he went on he met score of hi mate all bound for the same place and thei said greet kotick thi year we ar all holluschicki and we can danc the fired in the breaker off lukannon and plai on the new grass but where did you get that coat kotick s fur wa almost pure white now and though he felt veri proud of it he onli said swim quickli my bone ar ach for the land and so thei all came to the beach where thei had been born and heard the old seal their father fight in the roll mist that night kotick danc the fired with the yearl seal the sea is full of fire on summer night all the wai down from novastoshnah to lukannon and each seal leav a wake like burn oil behind him and a flame flash when he jump and the wave break in great phosphoresc streak and swirl then thei went inland to the holluschicki ground and roll up and down in the new wild wheat and told stori of what thei had done while thei had been at sea thei talk about the pacif as boi would talk about a wood that thei had been nut in and if anyon had understood them he could have gone awai and made such a chart of that ocean as never wa the three and fouryearold holluschicki romp down from hutchinson s hill cry out of the wai youngster the sea is deep and you don t know all that s in it yet wait till you ve round the horn hi you yearl where did you get that white coat i didn t get it said kotick it grew and just as he wa go to roll the speaker over a coupl of blackhair men with flat red face came from behind a sand dune and kotick who had never seen a man befor cough and lower hi head the holluschicki just bundl off a few yard and sat stare stupidli the men were no less than kerick booterin the chief of the sealhunt on the island and patalamon hi son thei came from the littl villag not half a mile from the sea nurseri and thei were decid what seal thei would drive up to the kill pensfor the seal were driven just like sheepto be turn into sealskin jacket later on ho said patalamon look there s a white seal kerick booterin turn nearli white under hi oil and smoke for he wa an aleut and aleut ar not clean peopl then he began to mutter a prayer don t touch him patalamon there ha never been a white seal sincesinc i wa born perhap it is old zaharrof s ghost he wa lost last year in the big gale i m not go near him said patalamon he s unlucki do you realli think he is old zaharrof come back i ow him for some gull egg don t look at him said kerick head off that drove of fouryearold the men ought to skin two hundr todai but it s the begin of the season and thei ar new to the work a hundr will do quick patalamon rattl a pair of seal s shoulder bone in front of a herd of holluschicki and thei stop dead puf and blow then he step near and the seal began to move and kerick head them inland and thei never tri to get back to their companion hundr and hundr of thousand of seal watch them be driven but thei went on plai just the same kotick wa the onli on who ask question and none of hi companion could tell him anyth except that the men alwai drove seal in that wai for six week or two month of everi year i am go to follow he said and hi ey nearli pop out of hi head as he shuffl along in the wake of the herd the white seal is come after us cri patalamon that s the first time a seal ha ever come to the killingground alon hsh don t look behind you said kerick it is zaharrof s ghost i must speak to the priest about thi the distanc to the killingground wa onli half a mile but it took an hour to cover becaus if the seal went too fast kerick knew that thei would get heat and then their fur would come off in patch when thei were skin so thei went on veri slowli past sea lion s neck past webster hous till thei came to the salt hous just beyond the sight of the seal on the beach kotick follow pant and wonder he thought that he wa at the world s end but the roar of the seal nurseri behind him sound as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel then kerick sat down on the moss and pull out a heavi pewter watch and let the drove cool off for thirti minut and kotick could hear the fogdew drip off the brim of hi cap then ten or twelv men each with an ironbound club three or four feet long came up and kerick point out on or two of the drove that were bitten by their companion or too hot and the men kick those asid with their heavi boot made of the skin of a walru s throat and then kerick said let go and then the men club the seal on the head as fast as thei could ten minut later littl kotick did not recogn hi friend ani more for their skin were rip off from the nose to the hind flipper whip off and thrown down on the ground in a pile that wa enough for kotick he turn and gallop a seal can gallop veri swiftli for a short time back to the sea hi littl new mustach bristl with horror at sea lion s neck where the great sea lion sit on the edg of the surf he flung himself flipperoverhead into the cool water and rock there gasp miser what s here said a sea lion gruffli for as a rule the sea lion keep themselv to themselv scoochni ochen scoochni i m lonesom veri lonesom said kotick thei re kill all the holluschicki on all the beach the sea lion turn hi head inshor nonsens he said your friend ar make as much nois as ever you must have seen old kerick polish off a drove he s done that for thirti year it s horribl said kotick back water as a wave went over him and steadi himself with a screw stroke of hi flipper that brought him all stand within three inch of a jag edg of rock well done for a yearl said the sea lion who could appreci good swim i suppos it is rather aw from your wai of look at it but if you seal will come here year after year of cours the men get to know of it and unless you can find an island where no men ever come you will alwai be driven isn t there ani such island began kotick i ve follow the poltoo the halibut for twenti year and i can t sai i ve found it yet but look herey seem to have a fond for talk to your betterssuppos you go to walru islet and talk to sea vitch he mai know someth don t flounc off like that it s a sixmil swim and if i were you i should haul out and take a nap first littl on kotick thought that that wa good advic so he swam round to hi own beach haul out and slept for half an hour twitch all over as seal will then he head straight for walru islet a littl low sheet of rocki island almost due northeast from novastoshnah all ledg and rock and gull nest where the walru herd by themselv he land close to old sea vitchth big ugli bloat pimpl fatneck longtusk walru of the north pacif who ha no manner except when he is asleepa he wa then with hi hind flipper half in and half out of the surf wake up bark kotick for the gull were make a great nois hah ho hmph what s that said sea vitch and he struck the next walru a blow with hi tusk and wake him up and the next struck the next and so on till thei were all awak and stare in everi direct but the right on hi it s me said kotick bob in the surf and look like a littl white slug well mai i beskin said sea vitch and thei all look at kotick as you can fanci a club full of drowsi old gentlemen would look at a littl boi kotick did not care to hear ani more about skin just then he had seen enough of it so he call out isn t there ani place for seal to go where men don t ever come go and find out said sea vitch shut hi ey run awai we re busi here kotick made hi dolphinjump in the air and shout as loud as he could clameat clameat he knew that sea vitch never caught a fish in hi life but alwai root for clam and seawe though he pretend to be a veri terribl person natur the chicki and the gooverooski and the epatkasth burgomast gull and the kittiwak and the puffin who ar alwai look for a chanc to be rude took up the cry andso limmershin told mefor nearli five minut you could not have heard a gun fire on walru islet all the popul wa yell and scream clameat stareek old man while sea vitch roll from side to side grunt and cough now will you tell said kotick all out of breath go and ask sea cow said sea vitch if he is live still he ll be abl to tell you how shall i know sea cow when i meet him said kotick sheer off he s the onli thing in the sea uglier than sea vitch scream a burgomast gull wheel under sea vitch s nose uglier and with wors manner stareek kotick swam back to novastoshnah leav the gull to scream there he found that no on sympath with him in hi littl attempt to discov a quiet place for the seal thei told him that men had alwai driven the holluschickieit wa part of the dai s workand that if he did not like to see ugli thing he should not have gone to the kill ground but none of the other seal had seen the kill and that made the differ between him and hi friend besid kotick wa a white seal what you must do said old sea catch after he had heard hi son s adventur is to grow up and be a big seal like your father and have a nurseri on the beach and then thei will leav you alon in anoth five year you ought to be abl to fight for yourself even gentl matkah hi mother said you will never be abl to stop the kill go and plai in the sea kotick and kotick went off and danc the fired with a veri heavi littl heart that autumn he left the beach as soon as he could and set off alon becaus of a notion in hi bullethead he wa go to find sea cow if there wa such a person in the sea and he wa go to find a quiet island with good firm beach for seal to live on where men could not get at them so he explor and explor by himself from the north to the south pacif swim as much as three hundr mile in a dai and a night he met with more adventur than can be told and narrowli escap be caught by the bask shark and the spot shark and the hammerhead and he met all the untrustworthi ruffian that loaf up and down the sea and the heavi polit fish and the scarlet spot scallop that ar moor in on place for hundr of year and grow veri proud of it but he never met sea cow and he never found an island that he could fanci if the beach wa good and hard with a slope behind it for seal to plai on there wa alwai the smoke of a whaler on the horizon boil down blubber and kotick knew what that meant or els he could see that seal had onc visit the island and been kill off and kotick knew that where men had come onc thei would come again he pick up with an old stumpytail albatross who told him that kerguelen island wa the veri place for peac and quiet and when kotick went down there he wa all but smash to piec against some wick black cliff in a heavi sleetstorm with lightn and thunder yet as he pull out against the gale he could see that even there had onc been a seal nurseri and it wa so in all the other island that he visit limmershin gave a long list of them for he said that kotick spent five season explor with a four month rest each year at novastoshnah when the holluschicki us to make fun of him and hi imaginari island he went to the gallapago a horrid dry place on the equat where he wa nearli bake to death he went to the georgia island the orknei emerald island littl nightingal island gough s island bouvet s island the crosset and even to a littl speck of an island south of the cape of good hope but everywher the peopl of the sea told him the same thing seal had come to those island onc upon a time but men had kill them all off even when he swam thousand of mile out of the pacif and got to a place call cape corrient that wa when he wa come back from gough s island he found a few hundr mangi seal on a rock and thei told him that men came there too that nearli broke hi heart and he head round the horn back to hi own beach and on hi wai north he haul out on an island full of green tree where he found an old old seal who wa dy and kotick caught fish for him and told him all hi sorrow now said kotick i am go back to novastoshnah and if i am driven to the killingpen with the holluschicki i shall not care the old seal said try onc more i am the last of the lost rookeri of masafuera and in the dai when men kill us by the hundr thousand there wa a stori on the beach that some dai a white seal would come out of the north and lead the seal peopl to a quiet place i am old and i shall never live to see that dai but other will try onc more and kotick curl up hi mustach it wa a beauti and said i am the onli white seal that ha ever been born on the beach and i am the onli seal black or white who ever thought of look for new island thi cheer him immens and when he came back to novastoshnah that summer matkah hi mother beg him to marri and settl down for he wa no longer a holluschick but a fullgrown seacatch with a curli white mane on hi shoulder as heavi as big and as fierc as hi father give me anoth season he said rememb mother it is alwai the seventh wave that goe farthest up the beach curious enough there wa anoth seal who thought that she would put off marri till the next year and kotick danc the fired with her all down lukannon beach the night befor he set off on hi last explor thi time he went westward becaus he had fallen on the trail of a great shoal of halibut and he need at least on hundr pound of fish a dai to keep him in good condit he chase them till he wa tire and then he curl himself up and went to sleep on the hollow of the ground swell that set in to copper island he knew the coast perfectli well so about midnight when he felt himself gentli bump on a weedb he said hm tide s run strong tonight and turn over under water open hi ey slowli and stretch then he jump like a cat for he saw huge thing nose about in the shoal water and brows on the heavi fring of the weed by the great comber of magellan he said beneath hi mustach who in the deep sea ar these peopl thei were like no walru sea lion seal bear whale shark fish squid or scallop that kotick had ever seen befor thei were between twenti and thirti feet long and thei had no hind flipper but a shovellik tail that look as if it had been whittl out of wet leather their head were the most foolishlook thing you ever saw and thei balanc on the end of their tail in deep water when thei weren t graze bow solemnli to each other and wave their front flipper as a fat man wave hi arm ahem said kotick good sport gentlemen the big thing answer by bow and wave their flipper like the frog footman when thei began feed again kotick saw that their upper lip wa split into two piec that thei could twitch apart about a foot and bring togeth again with a whole bushel of seawe between the split thei tuck the stuff into their mouth and chump solemnli messi style of feed that said kotick thei bow again and kotick began to lose hi temper veri good he said if you do happen to have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn t show off so i see you bow gracefulli but i should like to know your name the split lip move and twitch and the glassi green ey stare but thei did not speak well said kotick you re the onli peopl i ve ever met uglier than sea vitchand with wors manner then he rememb in a flash what the burgomast gull had scream to him when he wa a littl yearl at walru islet and he tumbl backward in the water for he knew that he had found sea cow at last the sea cow went on schloop and graze and chump in the weed and kotick ask them question in everi languag that he had pick up in hi travel and the sea peopl talk nearli as mani languag as human be but the sea cow did not answer becaus sea cow cannot talk he ha onli six bone in hi neck where he ought to have seven and thei sai under the sea that that prevent him from speak even to hi companion but as you know he ha an extra joint in hi foreflipp and by wave it up and down and about he make what answer to a sort of clumsi telegraph code by daylight kotick s mane wa stand on end and hi temper wa gone where the dead crab go then the sea cow began to travel northward veri slowli stop to hold absurd bow council from time to time and kotick follow them sai to himself peopl who ar such idiot as these ar would have been kill long ago if thei hadn t found out some safe island and what is good enough for the sea cow is good enough for the sea catch all the same i wish thei d hurri it wa weari work for kotick the herd never went more than forti or fifti mile a dai and stop to feed at night and kept close to the shore all the time while kotick swam round them and over them and under them but he could not hurri them up onehalf mile as thei went farther north thei held a bow council everi few hour and kotick nearli bit off hi mustach with impati till he saw that thei were follow up a warm current of water and then he respect them more on night thei sank through the shini watersank like stonesand for the first time sinc he had known them began to swim quickli kotick follow and the pace astonish him for he never dream that sea cow wa anyth of a swimmer thei head for a cliff by the shorea cliff that ran down into deep water and plung into a dark hole at the foot of it twenti fathom under the sea it wa a long long swim and kotick badli want fresh air befor he wa out of the dark tunnel thei led him through my wig he said when he rose gasp and puf into open water at the farther end it wa a long dive but it wa worth it the sea cow had separ and were brows lazili along the edg of the finest beach that kotick had ever seen there were long stretch of smoothworn rock run for mile exactli fit to make sealnurseri and there were playground of hard sand slope inland behind them and there were roller for seal to danc in and long grass to roll in and sand dune to climb up and down and best of all kotick knew by the feel of the water which never deceiv a true sea catch that no men had ever come there the first thing he did wa to assur himself that the fish wa good and then he swam along the beach and count up the delight low sandi island half hidden in the beauti roll fog awai to the northward out to sea ran a line of bar and shoal and rock that would never let a ship come within six mile of the beach and between the island and the mainland wa a stretch of deep water that ran up to the perpendicular cliff and somewher below the cliff wa the mouth of the tunnel it s novastoshnah over again but ten time better said kotick sea cow must be wiser than i thought men can t come down the cliff even if there were ani men and the shoal to seaward would knock a ship to splinter if ani place in the sea is safe thi is it he began to think of the seal he had left behind him but though he wa in a hurri to go back to novastoshnah he thoroughli explor the new countri so that he would be abl to answer all question then he dive and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel and race through to the southward no on but a sea cow or a seal would have dream of there be such a place and when he look back at the cliff even kotick could hardli believ that he had been under them he wa six dai go home though he wa not swim slowli and when he haul out just abov sea lion s neck the first person he met wa the seal who had been wait for him and she saw by the look in hi ey that he had found hi island at last but the holluschicki and sea catch hi father and all the other seal laugh at him when he told them what he had discov and a young seal about hi own ag said thi is all veri well kotick but you can t come from no on know where and order us off like thi rememb we ve been fight for our nurseri and that s a thing you never did you prefer prowl about in the sea the other seal laugh at thi and the young seal began twist hi head from side to side he had just marri that year and wa make a great fuss about it i ve no nurseri to fight for said kotick i onli want to show you all a place where you will be safe what s the us of fight oh if you re try to back out of cours i ve no more to sai said the young seal with an ugli chuckl will you come with me if i win said kotick and a green light came into hi ey for he wa veri angri at have to fight at all veri good said the young seal carelessli if you win i ll come he had no time to chang hi mind for kotick s head wa out and hi teeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal s neck then he threw himself back on hi haunch and haul hi enemi down the beach shook him and knock him over then kotick roar to the seal i ve done my best for you these five season past i ve found you the island where you ll be safe but unless your head ar drag off your silli neck you won t believ i m go to teach you now look out for yourselv limmershin told me that never in hi lifeand limmershin see ten thousand big seal fight everi yearnev in all hi littl life did he see anyth like kotick s charg into the nurseri he flung himself at the biggest sea catch he could find caught him by the throat choke him and bump him and bang him till he grunt for merci and then threw him asid and attack the next you see kotick had never fast for four month as the big seal did everi year and hi deepsea swim trip kept him in perfect condit and best of all he had never fought befor hi curli white mane stood up with rage and hi ey flame and hi big dog teeth glisten and he wa splendid to look at old sea catch hi father saw him tear past haul the grizzl old seal about as though thei had been halibut and upset the young bachelor in all direct and sea catch gave a roar and shout he mai be a fool but he is the best fighter on the beach don t tackl your father my son he s with you kotick roar in answer and old sea catch waddl in with hi mustach on end blow like a locomot while matkah and the seal that wa go to marri kotick cower down and admir their menfolk it wa a gorgeou fight for the two fought as long as there wa a seal that dare lift up hi head and when there were none thei parad grandli up and down the beach side by side bellow at night just as the northern light were wink and flash through the fog kotick climb a bare rock and look down on the scatter nurseri and the torn and bleed seal now he said i ve taught you your lesson my wig said old sea catch boost himself up stiffli for he wa fearfulli maul the killer whale himself could not have cut them up wors son i m proud of you and what s more i ll come with you to your islandif there is such a place hear you fat pig of the sea who come with me to the sea cow s tunnel answer or i shall teach you again roar kotick there wa a murmur like the rippl of the tide all up and down the beach we will come said thousand of tire voic we will follow kotick the white seal then kotick drop hi head between hi shoulder and shut hi ey proudli he wa not a white seal ani more but red from head to tail all the same he would have scorn to look at or touch on of hi wound a week later he and hi armi nearli ten thousand holluschicki and old seal went awai north to the sea cow s tunnel kotick lead them and the seal that stai at novastoshnah call them idiot but next spring when thei all met off the fish bank of the pacif kotick s seal told such tale of the new beach beyond sea cow s tunnel that more and more seal left novastoshnah of cours it wa not all done at onc for the seal ar not veri clever and thei need a long time to turn thing over in their mind but year after year more seal went awai from novastoshnah and lukannon and the other nurseri to the quiet shelter beach where kotick sit all the summer through get bigger and fatter and stronger each year while the holluschicki plai around him in that sea where no man come lukannon thi is the great deepsea song that all the st paul seal sing when thei ar head back to their beach in the summer it is a sort of veri sad seal nation anthem i met my mate in the morn and oh but i am old where roar on the ledg the summer groundswel roll i heard them lift the choru that drown the breaker song the beach of lukannontwo million voic strong the song of pleasant station besid the salt lagoon the song of blow squadron that shuffl down the dune the song of midnight danc that churn the sea to flame the beach of lukannonbefor the sealer came i met my mate in the morn i ll never meet them more thei came and went in legion that darken all the shore and o er the foamfleck of as far as voic could reach we hail the landingparti and we sang them up the beach the beach of lukannonth winter wheat so tall the drip crinkl lichen and the seafog drench all the platform of our playground all shine smooth and worn the beach of lukannonth home where we were born i met my mate in the morn a broken scatter band men shoot us in the water and club us on the land men drive us to the salt hous like silli sheep and tame and still we sing lukannonbefor the sealer came wheel down wheel down to southward oh gooverooska go and tell the deepsea viceroi the stori of our woe er empti as the shark s egg the tempest fling ashor the beach of lukannon shall know their son no more rikkitikkitavi at the hole where he went in redey call to

run and hide thee nag hah the hood death ha miss woe betid thee nag thi is the stori of the great war that rikkitikkitavi fought singlehand through the bathroom of the big bungalow in segowle canton darze the tailorbird help him and chuchundra the muskrat who never come out into the middl of the floor but alwai creep round by the wall gave him advic but rikkitikki did the real fight he wa a mongoos rather like a littl cat in hi fur and hi tail but quit like a weasel in hi head and hi habit hi ey and the end of hi restless nose were pink he could scratch himself anywher he pleas with ani leg front or back that he chose to us he could fluff up hi tail till it look like a bottl brush and hi war cry as he scuttl through the long grass wa rikktikktikkitikkitchk on dai a high summer flood wash him out of the burrow where he live with hi father and mother and carri him kick and cluck down a roadsid ditch he found a littl wisp of grass float there and clung to it till he lost hi sens when he reviv he wa ly in the hot sun on the middl of a garden path veri draggl inde and a small boi wa sai here s a dead mongoos let s have a funer no said hi mother let s take him in and dry him perhap he isn t realli dead thei took him into the hous and a big man pick him up between hi finger and thumb and said he wa not dead but half choke so thei wrap him in cotton wool and warm him over a littl fire and he open hi ey and sneez now said the big man he wa an englishman who had just move into the bungalow don t frighten him and we ll see what he ll do it is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoos becaus he is eaten up from nose to tail with curios the motto of all the mongoos famili is run and find out and rikkitikki wa a true mongoos he look at the cotton wool decid that it wa not good to eat ran all round the tabl sat up and put hi fur in order scratch himself and jump on the small boi s shoulder don t be frighten teddi said hi father that s hi wai of make friend ouch he s tickl under my chin said teddi rikkitikki look down between the boi s collar and neck snuf at hi ear and climb down to the floor where he sat rub hi nose good graciou said teddi s mother and that s a wild creatur i suppos he s so tame becaus we ve been kind to him all mongoos ar like that said her husband if teddi doesn t pick him up by the tail or try to put him in a cage he ll run in and out of the hous all dai long let s give him someth to eat thei gave him a littl piec of raw meat rikkitikki like it immens and when it wa finish he went out into the veranda and sat in the sunshin and fluf up hi fur to make it dry to the root then he felt better there ar more thing to find out about in thi hous he said to himself than all my famili could find out in all their live i shall certainli stai and find out he spent all that dai roam over the hous he nearli drown himself in the bathtub put hi nose into the ink on a write tabl and burn it on the end of the big man s cigar for he climb up in the big man s lap to see how write wa done at nightfal he ran into teddi s nurseri to watch how kerosen lamp were light and when teddi went to bed rikkitikki climb up too but he wa a restless companion becaus he had to get up and attend to everi nois all through the night and find out what made it teddi s mother and father came in the last thing to look at their boi and rikkitikki wa awak on the pillow i don t like that said teddi s mother he mai bite the child he ll do no such thing said the father teddi s safer with that littl beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him if a snake came into the nurseri now but teddi s mother wouldn t think of anyth so aw earli in the morn rikkitikki came to earli breakfast in the veranda ride on teddi s shoulder and thei gave him banana and some boil egg he sat on all their lap on after the other becaus everi wellbroughtup mongoos alwai hope to be a hous mongoos some dai and have room to run about in and rikkitikki s mother she us to live in the gener s hous at segowle had carefulli told rikki what to do if ever he came across white men then rikkitikki went out into the garden to see what wa to be seen it wa a larg garden onli half cultiv with bush as big as summerhous of marshal niel rose lime and orang tree clump of bamboo and thicket of high grass rikkitikki lick hi lip thi is a splendid huntingground he said and hi tail grew bottlebrushi at the thought of it and he scuttl up and down the garden snuf here and there till he heard veri sorrow voic in a thornbush it wa darze the tailorbird and hi wife thei had made a beauti nest by pull two big leav togeth and stitch them up the edg with fiber and had fill the hollow with cotton and downi fluff the nest swai to and fro as thei sat on the rim and cri what is the matter ask rikkitikki we ar veri miser said darze on of our babi fell out of the nest yesterdai and nag at him h m said rikkitikki that is veri sadbut i am a stranger here who is nag darze and hi wife onli cower down in the nest without answer for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hissa horrid cold sound that made rikkitikki jump back two clear feet then inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of nag the big black cobra and he wa five feet long from tongu to tail when he had lift onethird of himself clear of the ground he stai balanc to and fro exactli as a dandelion tuft balanc in the wind and he look at rikkitikki with the wick snake s ey that never chang their express whatev the snake mai be think of who is nag said he i am nag the great god brahm put hi mark upon all our peopl when the first cobra spread hi hood to keep the sun off brahm as he slept look and be afraid he spread out hi hood more than ever and rikkitikki saw the spectaclemark on the back of it that look exactli like the ey part of a hookandey fasten he wa afraid for the minut but it is imposs for a mongoos to stai frighten for ani length of time and though rikkitikki had never met a live cobra befor hi mother had fed him on dead on and he knew that all a grown mongoos s busi in life wa to fight and eat snake nag knew that too and at the bottom of hi cold heart he wa afraid well said rikkitikki and hi tail began to fluff up again mark or no mark do you think it is right for you to eat fledgl out of a nest nag wa think to himself and watch the least littl movement in the grass behind rikkitikki he knew that mongoos in the garden meant death sooner or later for him and hi famili but he want to get rikkitikki off hi guard so he drop hi head a littl and put it on on side let us talk he said you eat egg why should not i eat bird behind you look behind you sang darze rikkitikki knew better than to wast time in stare he jump up in the air as high as he could go and just under him whizz by the head of nagaina nag s wick wife she had crept up behind him as he wa talk to make an end of him he heard her savag hiss as the stroke miss he came down almost across her back and if he had been an old mongoos he would have known that then wa the time to break her back with on bite but he wa afraid of the terribl lash return stroke of the cobra he bit inde but did not bite long enough and he jump clear of the whisk tail leav nagaina torn and angri wick wick darze said nag lash up as high as he could reach toward the nest in the thornbush but darze had built it out of reach of snake and it onli swai to and fro rikkitikki felt hi ey grow red and hot when a mongoos s ey grow red he is angri and he sat back on hi tail and hind leg like a littl kangaroo and look all round him and chatter with rage but nag and nagaina had disappear into the grass when a snake miss it stroke it never sai anyth or give ani sign of what it mean to do next rikkitikki did not care to follow them for he did not feel sure that he could manag two snake at onc so he trot off to the gravel path near the hous and sat down to think it wa a seriou matter for him if you read the old book of natur histori you will find thei sai that when the mongoos fight the snake and happen to get bitten he run off and eat some herb that cure him that is not true the victori is onli a matter of quick of ey and quick of footsnak s blow against mongoos s jumpand as no ey can follow the motion of a snake s head when it strike thi make thing much more wonder than ani magic herb rikkitikki knew he wa a young mongoos and it made him all the more pleas to think that he had manag to escap a blow from behind it gave him confid in himself and when teddi came run down the path rikkitikki wa readi to be pet but just as teddi wa stoop someth wriggl a littl in the dust and a tini voic said be care i am death it wa karait the dusti brown snakel that li for choic on the dusti earth and hi bite is as danger as the cobra s but he is so small that nobodi think of him and so he doe the more harm to peopl rikkitikki s ey grew red again and he danc up to karait with the peculiar rock swai motion that he had inherit from hi famili it look veri funni but it is so perfectli balanc a gait that you can fly off from it at ani angl you pleas and in deal with snake thi is an advantag if rikkitikki had onli known he wa do a much more danger thing than fight nag for karait is so small and can turn so quickli that unless rikki bit him close to the back of the head he would get the return stroke in hi ey or hi lip but rikki did not know hi ey were all red and he rock back and forth look for a good place to hold karait struck out rikki jump sidewai and tri to run in but the wick littl dusti grai head lash within a fraction of hi shoulder and he had to jump over the bodi and the head follow hi heel close teddi shout to the hous oh look here our mongoos is kill a snake and rikkitikki heard a scream from teddi s mother hi father ran out with a stick but by the time he came up karait had lung out onc too far and rikkitikki had sprung jump on the snake s back drop hi head far between hi foreleg bitten as high up the back as he could get hold and roll awai that bite paralyz karait and rikkitikki wa just go to eat him up from the tail after the custom of hi famili at dinner when he rememb that a full meal make a slow mongoos and if he want all hi strength and quick readi he must keep himself thin he went awai for a dust bath under the castoroil bush while teddi s father beat the dead karait what is the us of that thought rikkitikki i have settl it all and then teddi s mother pick him up from the dust and hug him cry that he had save teddi from death and teddi s father said that he wa a provid and teddi look on with big scare ey rikkitikki wa rather amus at all the fuss which of cours he did not understand teddi s mother might just as well have pet teddi for plai in the dust rikki wa thoroughli enjoi himself that night at dinner walk to and fro among the wineglass on the tabl he might have stuf himself three time over with nice thing but he rememb nag

befor them and the hill driver went back to petersen sahib through the afternoon light tell the plain driver to be extra care that night and laugh when the plain driver ask the reason littl toomai attend to kala nag s supper and as even fell wander through the camp unspeak happi in search of a tomtom when an indian child s heart is full he doe not run about and make a nois in an irregular fashion he sit down to a sort of revel all by himself and littl toomai had been spoken to by petersen sahib if he had not found what he want i believ he would have been ill but the sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a littl tomtoma drum beaten with the flat of the handand he sat down crossleg befor kala nag as the star began to come out the tomtom in hi lap and he thump and he thump and he thump and the more he thought of the great honor that had been done to him the more he thump all alon among the eleph fodder there wa no tune and no word but the thump made him happi the new eleph strain at their rope and squeal and trumpet from time to time and he could hear hi mother in the camp hut put hi small brother to sleep with an old old song about the great god shiv who onc told all the anim what thei should eat it is a veri sooth lullabi and the first vers sai shiv who pour the harvest and made the wind to blow sit at the doorwai of a dai of long ago gave to each hi portion food and toil

head o littl son of mine littl toomai came in with a joyou tunkatunk at the end of each vers till he felt sleepi and stretch himself on the fodder at kala nag s side at last the eleph began to lie down on after anoth as is their custom till onli kala nag at the right of the line wa left stand up and he rock slowli from side to side hi ear put forward to listen to the night wind as it blew veri slowli across the hill the air wa full of all the night nois that taken togeth make on big silenceth click of on bamboo stem against the other the rustl of someth aliv in the undergrowth the scratch and squawk of a halfwak bird bird ar awak in the night much more often than we imagin and the fall of water ever so far awai littl toomai slept for some time and when he wake it wa brilliant moonlight and kala nag wa still stand up with hi ear cock littl toomai turn rustl in the fodder and watch the curv of hi big back against half the star in heaven and while he watch he heard so far awai that it sound no more than a pinhol of nois prick through the still the hoottoot of a wild eleph all the eleph in the line jump up as if thei had been shot and their grunt at last wake the sleep mahout and thei came out and drove in the picket peg with big mallet and tighten thi rope and knot that till all wa quiet on new eleph had nearli grub up hi picket and big toomai took off kala nag s leg chain and shackl that eleph forefoot to hindfoot but slip a loop of grass string round kala nag s leg and told him to rememb that he wa ti fast he knew that he and hi father and hi grandfath had done the veri same thing hundr of time befor kala nag did not answer to the order by gurgl as he usual did he stood still look out across the moonlight hi head a littl rais and hi ear spread like fan up to the great fold of the garo hill tend to him if he grow restless in the night said big toomai to littl toomai and he went into the hut and slept littl toomai wa just go to sleep too when he heard the coir string snap with a littl tang and kala nag roll out of hi picket as slowli and as silent as a cloud roll out of the mouth of a vallei littl toomai patter after him barefoot down the road in the moonlight call under hi breath kala nag kala nag take me with you o kala nag the eleph turn without a sound took three stride back to the boi in the moonlight put down hi trunk swung him up to hi neck and almost befor littl toomai had settl hi knee slip into the forest there wa on blast of furiou trumpet from the line and then the silenc shut down on everyth and kala nag began to move sometim a tuft of high grass wash along hi side as a wave wash along the side of a ship and sometim a cluster of wildpepp vine would scrape along hi back or a bamboo would creak where hi shoulder touch it but between those time he move absolut without ani sound drift through the thick garo forest as though it had been smoke he wa go uphil but though littl toomai watch the star in the rift of the tree he could not tell in what direct then kala nag reach the crest of the ascent and stop for a minut and littl toomai could see the top of the tree ly all speckl and furri under the moonlight for mile and mile and the bluewhit mist over the river in the hollow toomai lean forward and look and he felt that the forest wa awak below himawak and aliv and crowd a big brown fruiteat bat brush past hi ear a porcupin s quill rattl in the thicket and in the dark between the tree stem he heard a hogbear dig hard in the moist warm earth and snuf as it dig then the branch close over hi head again and kala nag began to go down into the valleynot quietli thi time but as a runawai gun goe down a steep bankin on rush the huge limb move as steadili as piston eight feet to each stride and the wrinkl skin of the elbow point rustl the undergrowth on either side of him rip with a nois like torn canva and the sapl that he heav awai right and left with hi shoulder sprang back again and bang him on the flank and great trail of creeper all mat togeth hung from hi tusk as he threw hi head from side to side and plow out hi pathwai then littl toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swing bough should sweep him to the ground and he wish that he were back in the line again the grass began to get squashi and kala nag s feet suck and squelch as he put them down and the night mist at the bottom of the vallei chill littl toomai there wa a splash and a trampl and the rush of run water and kala nag strode through the bed of a river feel hi wai at each step abov the nois of the water as it swirl round the eleph s leg littl toomai could hear more splash and some trumpet both upstream and downgreat grunt and angri snort and all the mist about him seem to be full of roll wavi shadow ai he said half aloud hi teeth chatter the elephantfolk ar out tonight it is the danc then kala nag swash out of the water blew hi trunk clear and began anoth climb but thi time he wa not alon and he had not to make hi path that wa made alreadi six feet wide in front of him where the bent junglegrass wa try to recov itself and stand up mani eleph must have gone that wai onli a few minut befor littl toomai look back and behind him a great wild tusker with hi littl pig s ey glow like hot coal wa just lift himself out of the misti river then the tree close up again and thei went on and up with trumpet and crash and the sound of break branch on everi side of them at last kala nag stood still between two treetrunk at the veri top of the hill thei were part of a circl of tree that grew round an irregular space of some three or four acr and in all that space as littl toomai could see the ground had been trampl down as hard as a brick floor some tree grew in the center of the clear but their bark wa rub awai and the white wood beneath show all shini and polish in the patch of moonlight there were creeper hang from the upper branch and the bell of the flower of the creeper great waxi white thing like convolvulus hung down fast asleep but within the limit of the clear there wa not a singl blade of greennoth but the trampl earth the moonlight show it all iron grai except where some eleph stood upon it and their shadow were inki black littl toomai look hold hi breath with hi ey start out of hi head and as he look more and more and more eleph swung out into the open from between the tree trunk littl toomai could onli count up to ten and he count again and again on hi finger till he lost count of the ten and hi head began to swim outsid the clear he could hear them crash in the undergrowth as thei work their wai up the hillsid but as soon as thei were within the circl of the tree trunk thei move like ghost there were whitetusk wild male with fallen leav and nut and twig ly in the wrinkl of their neck and the fold of their ear fat slowfoot sheeleph with restless littl pinki black calv onli three or four feet high run under their stomach young eleph with their tusk just begin to show and veri proud of them lanki scraggi oldmaid eleph with their hollow anxiou face and trunk like rough bark savag old bull eleph scar from shoulder to flank with great weal and cut of bygon fight and the cake dirt of their solitari mud bath drop from their shoulder and there wa on with a broken tusk and the mark of the fullstrok the terribl draw scrape of a tiger s claw on hi side thei were stand head to head or walk to and fro across the ground in coupl or rock and swai all by themselvesscor and score of eleph toomai knew that so long as he lai still on kala nag s neck noth would happen to him for even in the rush and scrambl of a keddah drive a wild eleph doe not reach up with hi trunk and drag a man off the neck of a tame eleph and these eleph were not think of men that night onc thei start and put their ear forward when thei heard the chink of a leg iron in the forest but it wa pudmini petersen sahib s pet eleph her chain snap short off grunt snuffl up the hillsid she must have broken her picket and come straight from petersen sahib s camp and littl toomai saw anoth eleph on that he did not know with deep rope gall on hi back and breast he too must have run awai from some camp in the hill about at last there wa no sound of ani more eleph move in the forest and kala nag roll out from hi station between the tree and went into the middl of the crowd cluck and gurgl and all the eleph began to talk in their own tongu and to move about still ly down littl toomai look down upon score and score of broad back and wag ear and toss trunk and littl roll ey he heard the click of tusk as thei cross other tusk by accid and the dry rustl of trunk twine togeth and the chafe of enorm side and shoulder in the crowd and the incess flick and hissh of the great tail then a cloud came over the moon and he sat in black dark but the quiet steadi hustl and push and gurgl went on just the same he knew that there were eleph all round kala nag and that there wa no chanc of back him out of the assembl so he set hi teeth and shiver in a keddah at least there wa torchlight and shout but here he wa all alon in the dark and onc a trunk came up and touch him on the knee then an eleph trumpet and thei all took it up for five or ten terribl second the dew from the tree abov spatter down like rain on the unseen back and a dull boom nois began not veri loud at first and littl toomai could not tell what it wa but it grew and grew and kala nag lift up on forefoot and then the other and brought them down on the groundonetwo onetwo as steadili as triphamm the eleph were stamp all togeth now and it sound like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave the dew fell from the tree till there wa no more left to fall and the boom went on and the ground rock and shiver and littl toomai put hi hand up to hi ear to shut out the sound but it wa all on gigant jar that ran through himthi stamp of hundr of heavi feet on the raw earth onc or twice he could feel kala nag and all the other surg forward a few stride and the thump would chang to the crush sound of juici green thing be bruis but in a minut or two the boom of feet on hard earth began again a tree wa creak and groan somewher near him he put out hi arm and felt the bark but kala nag move forward still tramp and he could not tell where he wa in the clear there wa no sound from the eleph except onc when two or three littl calv squeak togeth then he heard a thump and a shuffl and the boom went on it must have last fulli two hour and littl toomai ach in everi nerv but he knew by the smell of the night air that the dawn wa come the morn broke in on sheet of pale yellow behind the green hill and the boom stop with the first rai as though the light had been an order befor littl toomai had got the ring out of hi head befor even he had shift hi posit there wa not an eleph in sight except kala nag pudmini and the eleph with the ropegal and there wa neither sign nor rustl nor whisper down the hillsid to show where the other had gone littl toomai stare again and again the clear as he rememb it had grown in the night more tree stood in the middl of it but the undergrowth and the jungl grass at the side had been roll back littl toomai stare onc more now he understood the trampl the eleph had stamp out more roomhad stamp the thick grass and juici cane to trash the trash into sliver the sliver into tini fiber and the fiber into hard earth wah said littl toomai and hi ey were veri heavi kala nag my lord let us keep by pudmini and go to petersen sahib s camp or i shall drop from thy neck the third eleph
