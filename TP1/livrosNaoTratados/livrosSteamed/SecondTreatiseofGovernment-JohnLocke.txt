reader thou hast here the begin and end of a discours concern govern what fate ha otherwis dispos of the paper that should have fill up the middl and were more than all the rest it is not worth while

govern he ha more fulli and clearli than ani princ in christendom and to justifi to the world the peopl of england whose love of their just and natur right with their resolut to preserv them save the nation when it wa on the veri brink of slaveri and ruin if these paper have that evid i flatter myself is to be found in them there will be no great miss of those which ar lost and my reader mai be satisfi without them for i imagin i shall have neither the time nor inclin to repeat my pain and fill up the want part of my answer by trace sir robert again through all the wind and obscur which ar to be met with in the sever branch of hi wonder system the king and bodi of the nation have sinc so thoroughli confut hi hypothesi that i suppos no bodi hereaft will have either the confid to appear against our common safeti and be again an advoc for slaveri or the weak to be deceiv with contradict dress up in a popular stile and wellturn period for if ani on will be at the pain himself in those part which ar here untouch to strip sir robert discours of the flourish of doubt express and endeavour to reduc hi word to direct posit intellig proposit and then compar them on with anoth he will quickli be satisfi there wa never so much glib nonsens put togeth in wellsound english if he think it not worth while to examin hi work all thro let him make an experi in that part where he treat of usurp and let him try whether he can with all hi skill make sir robert intellig and consist with himself or common sens i should not speak so plainli of a gentleman long sinc past answer had not the pulpit of late year publicli own hi doctrin and made it the current divin of the time it is necessari those men who take on them to be teacher have so danger misl other should be openli shew of what author thi their patriarch is whom thei have so blindli follow that so thei mai either retract what upon so ill ground thei have vent and cannot be maintain or els justifi those principl which thei preach up for gospel though thei had no better an author than an english courtier for i should not have writ against sir robert or taken the pain to shew hi mistak inconsist and want of what he so much boast of and pretend wholli to build on scriptureproof were there not men amongst us who by cry up hi book and espous hi doctrin save me from the reproach of write against a dead adversari thei have been so zealou in thi point that if i have done him ani wrong i cannot hope thei should spare me i wish where thei have done the truth and the public wrong thei would be as readi to redress it and allow it just weight to thi reflect viz that there cannot be done a greater mischief to princ and peopl than the propag wrong notion concern govern that so at last all time might not have reason to complain of the drum ecclesiast if ani on concern realli for truth undertak the confut of my hypothesi i promis him either to recant my mistak upon fair convict or to answer hi difficulti but he must rememb two thing first that cavil here and there at some express or littl incid of my discours is not an answer to my book secondli that i shall not take rail for argument nor think either of these worth my notic though i shall alwai look on myself as bound to give satisfact to ani on who shall appear to be conscienti scrupul in the point and shall shew ani just ground for hi scrupl i have noth more but to advertis the reader that observ stand for observ on hobb milton c and that a bare quotat of page alwai mean page of hi patriarcha edit book ii chapter i an essai concern the true origin extent and end of civil govern sect it have been shewn in the forego discours i i that adam had not either by natur right of fatherhood or by posit donat from god ani such author over hi children or dominion over the world as is pretend i i that if he had hi heir yet had no right to it i i that if hi heir had there be no law of natur nor posit law of god that determin which is the right heir in all case that mai aris the right of success and consequ of bear rule could not have been certainli determin i i that if even that had been determin yet the knowledg of which is the eldest line of adam poster be so long sinc utterli lost that in the race of mankind and famili of the world there remain not to on abov anoth the least pretenc to be the eldest hous and to have the right of inherit all these premis have as i think been clearli made out it is imposs that the ruler now on earth should make ani benefit or deriv ani the least shadow of author from that which is held to be the fountain of all power adam privat dominion and patern jurisdict so that he that will not give just occas to think that all govern in the world is the product onli of forc and violenc and that men live togeth by no other rule but that of beast where the strongest carri it and so lai a foundat for perpetu disord and mischief tumult sedit and rebellion thing that the follow of that hypothesi so loudli cry out against must of necess find out anoth rise of govern anoth origin of polit power and anoth wai of design and know the person that have it than what sir robert filmer hath taught us sect to thi purpos i think it mai not be amiss to set down what i take to be polit power that the power of a magistr over a subject mai be distinguish from that of a father over hi children a master over hi servant a husband over hi wife and a lord over hi slave all which distinct power happen sometim togeth in the same man if he be consid under these differ relat it mai help us to distinguish these power on from wealth a father of a famili and a captain of a gallei sect polit power then i take to be a right of make law with penalti of death and consequ all less penalti for the regul and preserv of properti and of emploi the forc of the commun in the execut of such law and in the defenc of the commonwealth from foreign injuri and all thi onli for the public good chapter ii of the state of natur sect to understand polit power right and deriv it from it origin we must consid what state all men ar natur in and that is a state of perfect freedom to order their action and dispos of their possess and person as thei think fit within the bound of the law of natur without ask leav or depend upon the will of ani other man a state also of equal wherein all the power and jurisdict is reciproc no on have more than anoth there be noth more evid than that creatur of the same speci and rank promiscu born to all the same advantag of natur and the us of the same faculti should also be equal on amongst anoth without subordin or subject unless the lord and master of them all should by ani manifest declar of hi will set on abov anoth and confer on him by an evid and clear appoint an undoubt right to dominion and sovereignti sect thi equal of men by natur the judici hooker look upon as so evid in itself and beyond all question that he make it the foundat of that oblig to mutual love amongst men on which he build the duti thei ow on anoth and from whenc he deriv the great maxim of justic and chariti hi word ar the like natur induc hath brought men to know that it is no less their duti to love other than themselv for see those thing which ar equal must need all have on measur if i cannot but wish to receiv good even as much at everi man hand as ani man can wish unto hi own soul how should i look to have ani part of my desir herein satisfi unless myself be care to satisfi the like desir which is undoubtedli in other men be of on and the same natur to have ani thing offer them repugn to thi desir must need in all respect griev them as much as me so that if i do harm i must look to suffer there be no reason that other should shew greater measur of love to me than thei have by me shew unto them my desir therefor to be love of my equal in natur as much as possibl mai be imposeth upon me a natur duti of bear to themward fulli the like affect from which relat of equal between ourselv and them that ar as ourselv what sever rule and canon natur reason hath drawn for direct of life no man is ignor eccl pol lib sect but though thi be a state of liberti yet it is not a state of licenc though man in that state have an uncontroul liberti to dispos of hi person or possess yet he ha not liberti to destroi himself or so much as ani creatur in hi possess but where some nobler us than it bare preserv call for it the state of natur ha a law of natur to govern it which oblig everi on and reason which is that law teach all mankind who will but consult it that be all equal and independ no on ought to harm anoth in hi life health liberti or possess for men be all the workmanship of on omnipot and infinit wise maker all the servant of on sovereign master sent into the world by hi order and about hi busi thei ar hi properti whose workmanship thei ar made to last dure hi not on anoth pleasur and be furnish with like faculti share all in on commun of natur there cannot be suppos ani such subordin among us that mai author us to destroi on anoth as if we were made for on anoth us as the inferior rank of creatur ar for our everi on as he is bound to preserv himself and not to quit hi station wilfulli so by the like reason when hi own preserv come not in competit ought he as much as he can to preserv the rest of mankind and mai not unless it be to do justic on an offend take awai or impair the life or what tend to the preserv of the life the liberti health limb or good of anoth sect and that all men mai be restrain from invad other right and from do hurt to on anoth and the law of natur be observ which willeth the peac and preserv of all mankind the execut of the law of natur is in that state put into everi man hand wherebi everi on ha a right to punish the transgressor of that law to such a degre as mai hinder it violat for the law of natur would as all other law that concern men in thi world be in vain if there were no bodi that in the state of natur had a power to execut that law and therebi preserv the innoc and restrain offend and if ani on in the state of natur mai punish anoth for ani evil he ha done everi on mai do so for in that state of perfect equal where natur there is no superior or jurisdict of on over anoth what ani mai do in prosecut of that law everi on must need have a right to do sect and thu in the state of natur on man come by a power over anoth but yet no absolut or arbitrari power to us a crimin when he ha got him in hi hand accord to the passion heat or boundless extravag of hi own will but onli to retribut to him so far as calm reason and conscienc dictat what is proportion to hi transgress which is so much as mai serv for repar and restraint for these two ar the onli reason why on man mai lawfulli do harm to anoth which is that we call punish in transgress the law of natur the offend declar himself to live by anoth rule than that of reason and common equiti which is that measur god ha set to the action of men for their mutual secur and so he becom danger to mankind the tye which is to secur them from injuri and violenc be slight and broken by him which be a trespass against the whole speci and the peac and safeti of it provid for by the law of natur everi man upon thi score by the right he hath to preserv mankind in gener mai restrain or where it is necessari destroi thing noxiou to them and so mai bring such evil on ani on who hath transgress that law as mai make him repent the do of it and therebi deter him and by hi exampl other from do the like mischief and in the case and upon thi ground everi man hath a right to punish the offend and be execution of the law of natur sect i doubt not but thi will seem a veri strang doctrin to some men but befor thei condemn it i desir them to resolv me by what right ani princ or state can put to death or punish an alien for ani crime he commit in their countri it is certain their law by virtu of ani sanction thei receiv from the promulg will of the legisl reach not a stranger thei speak not to him nor if thei did is he bound to hearken to them the legisl author by which thei ar in forc over the subject of that commonwealth hath no power over him those who have the suprem power of make law in england franc or holland ar to an indian but like the rest of the world men without author and therefor if by the law of natur everi man hath not a power to punish offenc against it as he soberli judg the case to requir i see not how the magistr of ani commun can punish an alien of anoth countri sinc in refer to him thei can have no more power than what everi man natur mai have over anoth sect besid the crime which consist in violat the law and vari from the right rule of reason wherebi a man so far becom degener and declar himself to quit the principl of human natur and to be a noxiou creatur there is commonli injuri done to some person or other and some other man receiv damag by hi transgress in which case he who hath receiv ani damag ha besid the right of punish common to him with other men a particular right to seek repar from him that ha done it and ani other person who find it just mai also join with him that is injur and assist him in recov from the offend so much as mai make satisfact for the harm he ha suffer sect from these two distinct right the on of punish the crime for restraint and prevent the like offenc which right of punish is in everi bodi the other of take repar which belong onli to the injur parti come it to pass that the magistr who by be magistr hath the common right of punish put into hi hand can often where the public good demand not the execut of the law remit the punish of crimin offenc by hi own author but yet cannot remit the satisfact due to ani privat man for the damag he ha receiv that he who ha suffer the damag ha a right to demand in hi own name and he alon can remit the damnifi person ha thi power of appropri to himself the good or servic of the offend by right of selfpreserv as everi man ha a power to punish the crime to prevent it be commit again by the right he ha of preserv all mankind and do all reason thing he can in order to that end and thu it is that everi man in the state of natur ha a power to kill a murder both to deter other from do the like injuri which no repar can compens by the exampl of the punish that attend it from everi bodi and also to secur men from the attempt of a crimin who have renounc reason the common rule and measur god hath given to mankind hath by the unjust violenc and slaughter he hath commit upon on declar war against all mankind and therefor mai be destroi as a lion or a tyger on of those wild savag beast with whom men can have no societi nor secur and upon thi is ground that great law of natur whoso sheddeth man blood by man shall hi blood be shed and cain wa so fulli convinc that everi on had a right to destroi such a crimin that after the murder of hi brother he cri out everi on that findeth me shall slai me so plain wa it writ in the heart of all mankind sect by the same reason mai a man in the state of natur punish the lesser breach of that law it will perhap be demand with death i answer each transgress mai be punish to that degre and with so much sever as will suffic to make it an ill bargain to the offend give him caus to repent and terrifi other from do the like everi offenc that can be commit in the state of natur mai in the state of natur be also punish equal and as far forth as it mai in a commonwealth for though it would be besid my present purpos to enter here into the particular of the law of natur or it measur of punish yet it is certain there is such a law and that too as intellig and plain to a ration creatur and a studier of that law as the posit law of commonwealth nai possibl plainer as much as reason is easier to be understood than the fanci and intric contriv of men follow contrari and hidden interest put into word for so truli ar a great part of the municip law of countri which ar onli so far right as thei ar found on the law of natur by which thei ar to be regul and interpret sect to thi strang doctrin viz that in the state of natur everi on ha the execut power of the law of natur i doubt not but it will be object that it is unreason for men to be judg in their own case that selflov will make men partial to themselv and their friend and on the other side that ill natur passion and reveng will carri them too far in punish other and henc noth but confus and disord will follow and that therefor god hath certainli appoint govern to restrain the partial and violenc of men i easili grant that civil govern is the proper remedi for the inconveni of the state of natur which must certainli be great where men mai be judg in their own case sinc it is easi to be imagin that he who wa so unjust as to do hi brother an injuri will scarc be so just as to condemn himself for it but i shall desir those who make thi object to rememb that absolut monarch ar but men and if govern is to be the remedi of those evil which necessarili follow from men be judg in their own case and the state of natur is therefor not to be endur i desir to know what kind of govern that is and how much better it is than the state of natur where on man command a multitud ha the liberti to be judg in hi own case and mai do to all hi subject whatev he pleas without the least liberti to ani on to question or controul those who execut hi pleasur and in whatsoev he doth whether led by reason mistak or passion must be submit to much better it is in the state of natur wherein men ar not bound to submit to the unjust will of anoth and if he that judg judg amiss in hi own or ani other case he is answer for it to the rest of mankind sect it is often ask as a mighti object where ar or ever were there ani men in such a state of natur to which it mai suffic as an answer at present that sinc all princ and ruler of independ govern all through the world ar in a state of natur it is plain the world never wa nor ever will be without number of men in that state i have name all governor of independ commun whether thei ar or ar not in leagu with other for it is not everi compact that put an end to the state of natur between men but onli thi on of agre togeth mutual to enter into on commun and make on bodi polit other promis and compact men mai make on with anoth and yet still be in the state of natur the promis and bargain for truck c between the two men in the desert island mention by garcilasso de la vega in hi histori of peru or between a swiss and an indian in the wood of america ar bind to them though thei ar perfectli in a state of natur in refer to on anoth for truth and keep of faith belong to men as men and not as member of societi sect to those that sai there were never ani men in the state of natur i will not onli oppos the author of the judici hooker eccl pol lib i sect where he sai the law which have been hitherto mention ie the law of natur do bind men absolut even as thei ar men although thei have never ani settl fellowship never ani solemn agreement amongst themselv what to do or not to do but forasmuch as we ar not by ourselv suffici to furnish ourselv with compet store of thing need for such a life as our natur doth desir a life fit for the digniti of man therefor to suppli those defect and imperfect which ar in us as live singl and sole by ourselv we ar natur induc to seek communion and fellowship with other thi wa the caus of men unit themselv at first in polit societi but i moreov affirm that all men ar natur in that state and remain so till by their own consent thei make themselv member of some polit societi and i doubt not in the sequel of thi discours to make it veri clear chapter iii of the state of war sect the state of war is a state of enmiti and destruct and therefor declar by word or action not a passion and hasti but a sedat settl design upon anoth man life put him in a state of war with him against whom he ha declar such an intent and so ha expos hi life to the other power to be taken awai by him or ani on that join with him in hi defenc and espous hi quarrel it be reason and just i should have a right to destroi that which threaten me with destruct for by the fundament law of natur man be to be preserv as much as possibl when all cannot be preserv the safeti of the innoc is to be prefer and on mai destroi a man who make war upon him or ha discov an enmiti to hi be for the same reason that he mai kill a wolf or a lion becaus such men ar not under the ti of the commonlaw of reason have no other rule but that of forc and violenc and so mai be treat as beast of prei those danger and noxiou creatur that will be sure to destroi him whenev he fall into their power sect and henc it is that he who attempt to get anoth man into hi absolut power doe therebi put himself into a state of war with him it be to be understood as a declar of a design upon hi life for i have reason to conclud that he who would get me into hi power without my consent would us me as he pleas when he had got me there and destroi me too when he had a fanci to it for no bodi can desir to have me in hi absolut power unless it be to compel me by forc to that which is against the right of my freedom ie make me a slave to be free from such forc is the onli secur of my preserv and reason bid me look on him as an enemi to my preserv who would take awai that freedom which is the fenc to it so that he who make an attempt to enslav me therebi put himself into a state of war with me he that in the state of natur would take awai the freedom that belong to ani on in that state must necessarili be suppos to have a design to take awai everi thing els that freedom be the foundat of all the rest as he that in the state of societi would take awai the freedom belong to those of that societi or commonwealth must be suppos to design to take awai from them everi thing els and so be look on as in a state of war sect thi make it law for a man to kill a thief who ha not in the least hurt him nor declar ani design upon hi life ani farther than by the us of forc so to get him in hi power as to take awai hi monei or what he pleas from him becaus us forc where he ha no right to get me into hi power let hi pretenc be what it will i have no reason to suppos that he who would take awai my liberti would not when he had me in hi power take awai everi thing els and therefor it is law for me to treat him as on who ha put himself into a state of war with me ie kill him if i can for to that hazard doe he justli expos himself whoever introduc a state of war and is aggressor in it sect and here we have the plain differ between the state of natur and the state of war which howev some men have confound ar as far distant as a state of peac good will mutual assist and preserv and a state of enmiti malic violenc and mutual destruct ar on from anoth men live togeth accord to reason without a common superior on earth with author to judg between them is properli the state of natur but forc or a declar design of forc upon the person of anoth where there is no common superior on earth to appeal to for relief is the state of war and it is the want of such an appeal give a man the right of war even against an aggressor tho he be in societi and a fellow subject thu a thief whom i cannot harm but by appeal to the law for have stolen all that i am worth i mai kill when he set on me to rob me but of my hors or coat becaus the law which wa made for my preserv where it cannot interpos to secur my life from present forc which if lost is capabl of no repar permit me my own defenc and the right of war a liberti to kill the aggressor becaus the aggressor allow not time to appeal to our common judg nor the decis of the law for remedi in a case where the mischief mai be irrepar want of a common judg with author put all men in a state of natur forc without right upon a man person make a state of war both where there is and is not a common judg sect but when the actual forc is over the state of war ceas between those that ar in societi and ar equal on both side subject to the fair determin of the law becaus then there li open the remedi of appeal for the past injuri and to prevent futur harm but where no such appeal is as in the state of natur for want of posit law and judg with author to appeal to the state of war onc begun continu with a right to the innoc parti to destroi the other whenev he can until the aggressor offer peac and desir reconcili on such term as mai repair ani wrong he ha alreadi done and secur the innoc for the futur nai where an appeal to the law and constitut judg li open but the remedi is deni by a manifest pervert of justic and a barefac wrest of the law to protect or indemnifi the violenc or injuri of some men or parti of men there it is hard to imagin ani thing but a state of war for wherev violenc is us and injuri done though by hand appoint to administ justic it is still violenc and injuri howev colour with the name pretenc or form of law the end whereof be to protect and redress the innoc by an unbiass applic of it to all who ar under it wherev that is not bona fide done war is made upon the suffer who have no appeal on earth to right them thei ar left to the onli remedi in such case an appeal to heaven sect to avoid thi state of war wherein there is no appeal but to heaven and wherein everi the least differ is apt to end where there is no author to decid between the contend is on great reason of men put themselv into societi and quit the state of natur for where there is an author a power on earth from which relief can be had by appeal there the continu of the state of war is exclud and the controversi is decid by that power had there been ani such court ani superior jurisdict on earth to determin the right between jephtha and the ammonit thei had never come to a state of war but we see he wa forc to appeal to heaven the lord the judg sai he be judg thi dai between the children of israel and the children of ammon judg xi and then prosecut and reli on hi appeal he lead out hi armi to battl and therefor in such controversi where the question is put who shall be judg it cannot be meant who shall decid the controversi everi on know what jephtha here tell us that the lord the judg shall judg where there is no judg on earth the appeal li to god in heaven that question then cannot mean who shall judg whether anoth hath put himself in a state of war with me and whether i mai as jephtha did appeal to heaven in it of that i myself can onli be judg in my own conscienc as i will answer it at the great dai to the suprem judg of all men chapter iv of slaveri sect the natur liberti of man is to be free from ani superior power on earth and not to be under the will or legisl author of man but to have onli the law of natur for hi rule the liberti of man in societi is to be under no other legisl power but that establish by consent in the commonwealth nor under the dominion of ani will or restraint of ani law but what that legisl shall enact accord to the trust put in it freedom then is not what sir robert filmer tell us observ a a liberti for everi on to do what he list to live as he pleas and not to be ti by ani law but freedom of men under govern is to have a stand rule to live by common to everi on of that societi and made by the legisl power erect in it a liberti to follow my own will in all thing where the rule prescrib not and not to be subject to the inconst uncertain unknown arbitrari will of anoth man as freedom of natur is to be under no other restraint but the law of natur sect thi freedom from absolut arbitrari power is so necessari to and close join with a man preserv that he cannot part with it but by what forfeit hi preserv and life togeth for a man not have the power of hi own life cannot by compact or hi own consent enslav himself to ani on nor put himself under the absolut arbitrari power of anoth to take awai hi life when he pleas no bodi can give more power than he ha himself and he that cannot take awai hi own life cannot give anoth power over it inde have by hi fault forfeit hi own life by some act that deserv death he to whom he ha forfeit it mai when he ha him in hi power delai to take it and make us of him to hi own servic and he doe him no injuri by it for whenev he find the hardship of hi slaveri outweigh the valu of hi life it is in hi power by resist the will of hi master to draw on himself the death he desir sect thi is the perfect condit of slaveri which is noth els but the state of war continu between a law conqueror and a captiv for if onc compact enter between them and make an agreement for a limit power on the on side and obedi on the other the state of war and slaveri ceas as long as the compact endur for as ha been said no man can by agreement pass over to anoth that which he hath not in himself a power over hi own life i confess we find among the jew as well as other nation that men did sell themselv but it is plain thi wa onli to drudgeri not to slaveri for it is evid the person sold wa not under an absolut arbitrari despot power for the master could not have power to kill him at ani time whom at a certain time he wa oblig to let go free out of hi servic and the master of such a servant wa so far from have an arbitrari power over hi life that he could not at pleasur so much as maim him but the loss of an ey or tooth set him free exod xxi chapter v of properti sect whether we consid natur reason which tell us that men be onc born have a right to their preserv and consequ to meat and drink and such other thing as natur afford for their subsist or revel which give us an account of those grant god made of the world to adam and to noah and hi son it is veri clear that god as king david sai psal cxv ha given the earth to the children of men given it to mankind in common but thi be suppos it seem to some a veri great difficulti how ani on should ever come to have a properti in ani thing i will not content myself to answer that if it be difficult to make out properti upon a supposit that god gave the world to adam and hi poster in common it is imposs that ani man but on univers monarch should have ani properti upon a supposit that god gave the world to adam and hi heir in success exclus of all the rest of hi poster but i shall endeavour to shew how men might come to have a properti in sever part of that which god gave to mankind in common and that without ani express compact of all the common sect god who hath given the world to men in common hath also given them reason to make us of it to the best advantag of life and conveni the earth and all that is therein is given to men for the support and comfort of their be and tho all the fruit it natur produc and beast it feed belong to mankind in common as thei ar produc by the spontan hand of natur and no bodi ha origin a privat dominion exclus of the rest of mankind in ani of them as thei ar thu in their natur state yet be given for the us of men there must of necess be a mean to appropri them some wai or other befor thei can be of ani us or at all benefici to ani particular man the fruit or venison which nourish the wild indian who know no enclosur and is still a tenant in common must be hi and so hi ie a part of him that anoth can no longer have ani right to it befor it can do him ani good for the support of hi life sect though the earth and all inferior creatur be common to all men yet everi man ha a properti in hi own person thi no bodi ha ani right to but himself the labour of hi bodi and the work of hi hand we mai sai ar properli hi whatsoev then he remov out of the state that natur hath provid and left it in he hath mix hi labour with and join to it someth that is hi own and therebi make it hi properti it be by him remov from the common state natur hath place it in it hath by thi labour someth annex to it that exclud the common right of other men for thi labour be the unquestion properti of the labour no man but he can have a right to what that is onc join to at least where there is enough and as good left in common for other sect he that is nourish by the acorn he pick up under an oak or the appl he gather from the tree in the wood ha certainli appropri them to himself no bodi can deni but the nourish is hi i ask then when did thei begin to be hi when he digest or when he eat or when he boil or when he brought them home or when he pick them up and it is plain if the first gather made them not hi noth els could that labour put a distinct between them and common that ad someth to them more than natur the common mother of all had done and so thei becam hi privat right and will ani on sai he had no right to those acorn or appl he thu appropri becaus he had not the consent of all mankind to make them hi wa it a robberi thu to assum to himself what belong to all in common if such a consent as that wa necessari man had starv notwithstand the plenti god had given him we see in common which remain so by compact that it is the take ani part of what is common and remov it out of the state natur leav it in which begin the properti without which the common is of no us and the take of thi or that part doe not depend on the express consent of all the common thu the grass my hors ha bit the turf my servant ha cut and the or i have dig in ani place where i have a right to them in common with other becom my properti without the assign or consent of ani bodi the labour that wa mine remov them out of that common state thei were in hath fix my properti in them sect by make an explicit consent of everi common necessari to ani on appropri to himself ani part of what is given in common children or servant could not cut the meat which their father or master had provid for them in common without assign to everi on hi peculiar part though the water run in the fountain be everi on yet who can doubt but that in the pitcher is hi onli who drew it out hi labour hath taken it out of the hand of natur where it wa common and belong equal to all her children and hath therebi appropri it to himself sect thu thi law of reason make the deer that indian who hath kill it it is allow to be hi good who hath bestow hi labour upon it though befor it wa the common right of everi on and amongst those who ar count the civil part of mankind who have made and multipli posit law to determin properti thi origin law of natur for the begin of properti in what wa befor common still take place and by virtu thereof what fish ani on catch in the ocean that great and still remain common of mankind or what ambergris ani on take up here is by the labour that remov it out of that common state natur left it in made hi properti who take that pain about it and even amongst us the hare that ani on is hunt is thought hi who pursu her dure the chase for be a beast that is still look upon as common and no man privat possess whoever ha emploi so much labour about ani of that kind as to find and pursu her ha therebi remov her from the state of natur wherein she wa common and hath begun a properti sect it will perhap be object to thi that if gather the acorn or other fruit of the earth c make a right to them then ani on mai ingross as much as he will to which i answer not so the same law of natur that doe by thi mean give us properti doe also bound that properti too god ha given us all thing richli tim vi is the voic of reason confirm by inspir but how far ha he given it us to enjoi as much as ani on can make us of to ani advantag of life befor it spoil so much he mai by hi labour fix a properti in whatev is beyond thi is more than hi share and belong to other noth wa made by god for man to spoil or destroi and thu consid the plenti of natur provis there wa a long time in the world and the few spender and to how small a part of that provis the industri of on man could extend itself and ingross it to the prejudic of other especi keep within the bound set by reason of what might serv for hi us there could be then littl room for quarrel or content about properti so establish sect but the chief matter of properti be now not the fruit of the earth and the beast that subsist on it but the earth itself as that which take in and carri with it all the rest i think it is plain that properti in that too is acquir as the former as much land as a man till plant improv cultiv and can us the product of so much is hi properti he by hi labour doe as it were inclos it from the common nor will it invalid hi right to sai everi bodi els ha an equal titl to it and therefor he cannot appropri he cannot inclos without the consent of all hi fellowcommon all mankind god when he gave the world in common to all mankind command man also to labour and the penuri of hi condit requir it of him god and hi reason command him to subdu the earth ie improv it for the benefit of life and therein lai out someth upon it that wa hi own hi labour he that in obedi to thi command of god subdu till and sow ani part of it therebi annex to it someth that wa hi properti which anoth had no titl to nor could without injuri take from him sect nor wa thi appropri of ani parcel of land by improv it ani prejudic to ani other man sinc there wa still enough and as good left and more than the yet unprovid could us so that in effect there wa never the less left for other becaus of hi enclosur for himself for he that leav as much as anoth can make us of doe as good as take noth at all no bodi could think himself injur by the drink of anoth man though he took a good draught who had a whole river of the same water left him to quench hi thirst and the case of land and water where there is enough of both is perfectli the same sect god gave the world to men in common but sinc he gave it them for their benefit and the greatest conveni of life thei were capabl to draw from it it cannot be suppos he meant it should alwai remain common and uncultiv he gave it to the us of the industri and ration and labour wa to be hi titl to it not to the fanci or covet of the quarrelsom and contenti he that had as good left for hi improv as wa alreadi taken up need not complain ought not to meddl with what wa alreadi improv by anoth labour if he did it is plain he desir the benefit of anoth pain which he had no right to and not the ground which god had given him in common with other to labour on and whereof there wa as good left as that alreadi possess and more than he knew what to do with or hi industri could reach to sect it is true in land that is common in england or ani other countri where there is plenti of peopl under govern who have monei and commerc no on can inclos or appropri ani part without the consent of all hi fellowcommon becaus thi is left common by compact ie by the law of the land which is not to be violat and though it be common in respect of some men it is not so to all mankind but is the joint properti of thi countri or thi parish besid the remaind after such enclosur would not be as good to the rest of the common as the whole wa when thei could all make us of the whole wherea in the begin and first peopl of the great common of the world it wa quit otherwis the law man wa under wa rather for appropri god command and hi want forc him to labour that wa hi properti which could not be taken from him whereev he had fix it and henc subdu or cultiv the earth and have dominion we see ar join togeth the on gave titl to the other so that god by command to subdu gave author so far to appropri and the condit of human life which requir labour and materi to work on necessarili introduc privat possess sect the measur of properti natur ha well set by the extent of men labour and the conveni of life no man labour could subdu or appropri all nor could hi enjoy consum more than a small part so that it wa imposs for ani man thi wai to intrench upon the right of anoth or acquir to himself a properti to the prejudic of hi neighbour who would still have room for as good and as larg a possess after the other had taken out hi as befor it wa appropri thi measur did confin everi man possess to a veri moder proport and such as he might appropri to himself without injuri to ani bodi in the first ag of the world when men were more in danger to be lost by wander from their compani in the then vast wilder of the earth than to be straiten for want of room to plant in and the same measur mai be allow still without prejudic to ani bodi as full as the world seem for suppos a man or famili in the state thei were at first peopl of the world by the children of adam or noah let him plant in some inland vacant place of america we shall find that the possess he could make himself upon the measur we have given would not be veri larg nor even to thi dai prejudic the rest of mankind or give them reason to complain or think themselv injur by thi man incroach though the race of men have now spread themselv to all the corner of the world and do infinit exce the small number wa at the begin nai the extent of ground is of so littl valu without labour that i have heard it affirm that in spain itself a man mai be permit to plough sow and reap without be disturb upon land he ha no other titl to but onli hi make us of it but on the contrari the inhabit think themselv beholden to him who by hi industri on neglect and consequ wast land ha increas the stock of corn which thei want but be thi as it will which i lai no stress on thi i dare boldli affirm that the same rule of proprieti viz that everi man should have as much as he could make us of would hold still in the world without straiten ani bodi sinc there is land enough in the world to suffic doubl the inhabit had not the invent of monei and the tacit agreement of men to put a valu on it introduc by consent larger possess and a right to them which how it ha done i shall by and by shew more at larg sect thi is certain that in the begin befor the desir of have more than man need had alter the intrins valu of thing which depend onli on their us to the life of man or had agre that a littl piec of yellow metal which would keep without wast or decai should be worth a great piec of flesh or a whole heap of corn though men had a right to appropri by their labour each on of himself as much of the thing of natur as he could us yet thi could not be much nor to the prejudic of other where the same plenti wa still left to those who would us the same industri to which let me add that he who appropri land to himself by hi labour doe not lessen but increas the common stock of mankind for the provis serv to the support of human life produc by on acr of inclos and cultiv land ar to speak much within compass ten time more than those which ar yield by an acr of land of an equal rich ly wast in common and therefor he that inclos land and ha a greater plenti of the conveni of life from ten acr than he could have from an hundr left to natur mai truli be said to give nineti acr to mankind for hi labour now suppli him with provis out of ten acr which were but the product of an hundr ly in common i have here rate the improv land veri low in make it product but as ten to on when it is much nearer an hundr to on for i ask whether in the wild wood and uncultiv wast of america left to natur without ani improv tillag or husbandri a thousand acr yield the needi and wretch inhabit as mani conveni of life as ten acr of equal fertil land do in devonshir where thei ar well cultiv befor the appropri of land he who gather as much of the wild fruit kill caught or tame as mani of the beast as he could he that so imploi hi pain about ani of the spontan product of natur as ani wai to alter them from the state which natur put them in by place ani of hi labour on them did therebi acquir a proprieti in them but if thei perish in hi possess without their due us if the fruit rot or the venison putrifi befor he could spend it he offend against the common law of natur and wa liabl to be punish he invad hi neighbour share for he had no right farther than hi us call for ani of them and thei might serv to afford him conveni of life sect the same measur govern the possess of land too whatsoev he till and reap laid up and made us of befor it spoil that wa hi peculiar right whatsoev he enclos and could feed and make us of the cattl and product wa also hi but if either the grass of hi enclosur rot on the ground or the fruit of hi plant perish without gather and lai up thi part of the earth notwithstand hi enclosur wa still to be look on as wast and might be the possess of ani other thu at the begin cain might take as much ground as he could till and make it hi own land and yet leav enough to abel sheep to feed on a few acr would serv for both their possess but as famili increas and industri inlarg their stock their possess inlarg with the need of them but yet it wa commonli without ani fix properti in the ground thei made us of till thei incorpor settl themselv togeth and built citi and then by consent thei came in time to set out the bound of their distinct territori and agre on limit between them and their neighbour and by law within themselv settl the properti of those of the same societi for we see that in that part of the world which wa first inhabit and therefor like to be best peopl even as low down as abraham time thei wander with their flock and their herd which wa their substanc freeli up and down and thi abraham did in a countri where he wa a stranger whenc it is plain that at least a great part of the land lai in common that the inhabit valu it not nor claim properti in ani more than thei made us of but when there wa not room enough in the same place for their herd to feed togeth thei by consent as abraham and lot did gen xiii separ and inlarg their pastur where it best like them and for the same reason esau went from hi father and hi brother and plant in mount seir gen xxxvi sect and thu without suppos ani privat dominion and properti in adam over all the world exclus of all other men which can no wai be prove nor ani on properti be made out from it but suppos the world given as it wa to the children of men in common we see how labour could make men distinct titl to sever parcel of it for their privat us wherein there could be no doubt of right no room for quarrel sect nor is it so strang as perhap befor consider it mai appear that the properti of labour should be abl to overbal the commun of land for it is labour inde that put the differ of valu on everi thing and let ani on consid what the differ is between an acr of land plant with tobacco or sugar sown with wheat or barlei and an acr of the same land ly in common without ani husbandri upon it and he will find that the improv of labour make the far greater part of the valu i think it will be but a veri modest comput to sai that of the product of the earth us to the life of man nine tenth ar the effect of labour nai if we will rightli estim thing as thei come to our us and cast up the sever expenc about them what in them is pure ow to natur and what to labour we shall find that in most of them ninetynin hundredth ar wholli to be put on the account of labour sect there cannot be a clearer demonstr of ani thing than sever nation of the american ar of thi who ar rich in land and poor in all the comfort of life whom natur have furnish as liber as ani other peopl with the materi of plenti ie a fruit soil apt to produc in abund what might serv for food raiment and delight yet for want of improv it by labour have not on hundredth part of the conveni we enjoi and a king of a larg and fruit territori there feed lodg and is clad wors than a daylabour in england sect to make thi a littl clearer let us but trace some of the ordinari provis of life through their sever progress befor thei come to our us and see how much thei receiv of their valu from human industri bread wine and cloth ar thing of daili us and great plenti yet notwithstand acorn water and leav or skin must be our bread drink and cloath did not labour furnish us with these more us commod for whatev bread is more worth than acorn wine than water and cloth or silk than leav skin or moss that is wholli ow to labour and industri the on of these be the food and raiment which unassist natur furnish us with the other provis which our industri and pain prepar for us which how much thei exce the other in valu when ani on hath comput he will then see how much labour make the far greatest part of the valu of thing we enjoi in thi world and the ground which produc the materi is scarc to be reckon in as ani or at most but a veri small part of it so littl that even amongst us land that is left wholli to natur that hath no improv of pasturag tillag or plant is call as inde it is wast and we shall find the benefit of it amount to littl more than noth thi shew how much number of men ar to be prefer to larg of dominion and that the increas of land and the right emploi of them is the great art of govern and that princ who shall be so wise and godlik as by establish law of liberti to secur protect and encourag to the honest industri of mankind against the oppress of power and narrow of parti will quickli be too hard for hi neighbour but thi by the by to return to the argument in hand sect an acr of land that bear here twenti bushel of wheat and anoth in america which with the same husbandri would do the like ar without doubt of the same natur intrins valu but yet the benefit mankind receiv from the on in a year is worth l and from the other possibl not worth a penni if all the profit an indian receiv from it were to be valu and sold here at least i mai truli sai not on thousandth it is labour then which put the greatest part of valu upon land without which it would scarc be worth ani thing it is to that we ow the greatest part of all it us product for all that the straw bran bread of that acr of wheat is more worth than the product of an acr of as good land which li wast is all the effect of labour for it is not bare the ploughman pain the reaper and thresher toil and the baker sweat is to be count into the bread we eat the labour of those who broke the oxen who dig and wrought the iron and stone who fell and frame the timber emploi about the plough mill oven or ani other utensil which ar a vast number requisit to thi corn from it be feed to be sown to it be made bread must all be charg on the account of labour and receiv as an effect of that natur and the earth furnish onli the almost worthless materi as in themselv it would be a strang catalogu of thing that industri provid and made us of about everi loaf of bread befor it came to our us if we could trace them iron wood leather bark timber stone brick coal lime cloth dy drug pitch tar mast rope and all the materi made us of in the ship that brought ani of the commod made us of by ani of the workmen to ani part of the work all which it would be almost imposs at least too long to reckon up sect from all which it is evid that though the thing of natur ar given in common yet man by be master of himself and proprietor of hi own person and the action or labour of it had still in himself the great foundat of properti and that which made up the great part of what he appli to the support or comfort of hi be when invent and art had improv the conveni of life wa perfectli hi own and did not belong in common to other sect thu labour in the begin gave a right of properti wherev ani on wa pleas to emploi it upon what wa common which remain a long while the far greater part and is yet more than mankind make us of men at first for the most part content themselv with what unassist natur offer to their necess and though afterward in some part of the world where the increas of peopl and stock with the us of monei had made land scarc and so of some valu the sever commun settl the bound of their distinct territori and by law within themselv regul the properti of the privat men of their societi and so by compact and agreement settl the properti which labour and industri began and the leagu that have been made between sever state and kingdom either expresli or tacitli disown all claim and right to the land in the other possess have by common consent given up their pretenc to their natur common right which origin thei had to those countri and so have by posit agreement settl a properti amongst themselv in distinct part and parcel of the earth yet there ar still great tract of ground to be found which the inhabit thereof not have join with the rest of mankind in the consent of the us of their common monei lie wast and ar more than the peopl who dwell on it do or can make us of and so still lie in common tho thi can scarc happen amongst that part of mankind that have consent to the us of monei sect the greatest part of thing realli us to the life of man and such as the necess of subsist made the first common of the world look after as it doth the american now ar gener thing of short durat such as if thei ar not consum by us will decai and perish of themselv gold silver and diamond ar thing that fanci or agreement hath put the valu on more than real us and the necessari support of life now of those good thing which natur hath provid in common everi on had a right as hath been said to as much as he could us and properti in all that he could effect with hi labour all that hi industri could extend to to alter from the state natur had put it in wa hi he that gather a hundr bushel of acorn or appl had therebi a properti in them thei were hi good as soon as gather he wa onli to look that he us them befor thei spoil els he took more than hi share and rob other and inde it wa a foolish thing as well as dishonest to hoard up more than he could make us of if he gave awai a part to ani bodi els so that it perish not uselesli in hi possess these he also made us of and if he also barter awai plum that would have rot in a week for nut that would last good for hi eat a whole year he did no injuri he wast not the common stock destroi no part of the portion of good that belong to other so long as noth perish uselesli in hi hand again if he would give hi nut for a piec of metal pleas with it colour or exchang hi sheep for shell or wool for a sparkl pebbl or a diamond and keep those by him all hi life he invad not the right of other he might heap up as much of these durabl thing as he pleas the exceed of the bound of hi just properti not ly in the larg of hi possess but the perish of ani thing uselesli in it sect and thu came in the us of monei some last thing that men might keep without spoil and that by mutual consent men would take in exchang for the truli us but perish support of life sect and as differ degre of industri were apt to give men possess in differ proport so thi invent of monei gave them the opportun to continu and enlarg them for suppos an island separ from all possibl commerc with the rest of the world wherein there were but an hundr famili but there were sheep hors and cow with other us anim wholsom fruit and land enough for corn for a hundr thousand time as mani but noth in the island either becaus of it common or perish fit to suppli the place of monei what reason could ani on have there to enlarg hi possess beyond the us of hi famili and a plenti suppli to it consumpt either in what their own industri produc or thei could barter for like perish us commod with other where there is not some thing both last and scarc and so valuabl to be hoard up there men will not be apt to enlarg their possess of land were it never so rich never so free for them to take for i ask what would a man valu ten thousand or an hundr thousand acr of excel land readi cultiv and well stock too with cattl in the middl of the inland part of america where he had no hope of commerc with other part of the world to draw monei to him by the sale of the product it would not be worth the enclos and we should see him give up again to the wild common of natur whatev wa more than would suppli the conveni of life to be had there for him and hi famili sect thu in the begin all the world wa america and more so than that is now for no such thing as monei wa ani where known find out someth that hath the us and valu of monei amongst hi neighbour you shall see the same man will begin present to enlarg hi possess sect but sinc gold and silver be littl us to the life of man in proport to food raiment and carriag ha it valu onli from the consent of men whereof labour yet make in great part the measur it is plain that men have agre to a disproportion and unequ possess of the earth thei have by a tacit and voluntari consent found out a wai how a man mai fairli possess more land than he himself can us the product of by receiv in exchang for the overplu gold and silver which mai be hoard up without injuri to ani on these metal not spoil or decai in the hand of the possessor thi partag of thing in an inequ of privat possess men have made practic out of the bound of societi and without compact onli by put a valu on gold and silver and tacitli agre in the us of monei for in govern the law regul the right of properti and the possess of land is determin by posit constitut sect and thu i think it is veri easi to conceiv without ani difficulti how labour could at first begin a titl of properti in the common thing of natur and how the spend it upon our us bound it so that there could then be no reason of quarrel about titl nor ani doubt about the larg of possess it gave right and conveni went togeth for as a man had a right to all he could emploi hi labour upon so he had no temptat to labour for more than he could make us of thi left no room for controversi about the titl nor for encroach on the right of other what portion a man carv to himself wa easili seen and it wa useless as well as dishonest to carv himself too much or take more than he need chapter vi of patern power sect it mai perhap be censur as an impertin critic in a discours of thi natur to find fault with word and name that have obtain in the world and yet possibl it mai not be amiss to offer new on when the old ar apt to lead men into mistak as thi of patern power probabl ha done which seem so to place the power of parent over their children wholli in the father as if the mother had no share in it wherea if we consult reason or revel we shall find she hath an equal titl thi mai give on reason to ask whether thi might not be more properli call parent power for whatev oblig natur and the right of gener lai on children it must

father and thy mother exod xx whosoev curseth hi father or hi mother lev xx ye shall fear everi man hi mother and hi father lev xix children obei your parent c eph vi is the stile of the old and new testament sect had but thi on thing been well consid without look ani deeper into the matter it might perhap have kept men from run into those gross mistak thei have made about thi power of parent which howev it might without ani great harsh bear the name of absolut dominion and regal author when under the titl of patern power it seem appropri to the father would yet have found but oddli and in the veri name shewn the absurd if thi suppos absolut power over children had been call parent and therebi have discov that it belong to the mother too for it will but veri ill serv the turn of those men who contend so much for the absolut power and author of the fatherhood as thei call it that the mother should have ani share in it and it would have but ill support the monarchi thei contend for when by the veri name it appear that that fundament author from whenc thei would deriv their govern of a singl person onli wa not place in on but two person jointli but to let thi of name pass sect though i have said abov chap ii that all men by natur ar equal i cannot be suppos to understand all sort of equal ag or virtu mai give men a just preced excel of part and merit mai place other abov the common level birth mai subject some and allianc or benefit other to pai an observ to those to whom natur gratitud or other respect mai have made it due and yet all thi consist with the equal which all men ar in in respect of jurisdict or dominion on over anoth which wa the equal i there spoke of as proper to the busi in hand be that equal right that everi man hath to hi natur freedom without be subject to the will or author of ani other man sect children i confess ar not born in thi full state of equal though thei ar born to it their parent have a sort of rule and jurisdict over them when thei come into the world and for some time after but it is but a temporari on the bond of thi subject ar like the swaddl cloth thei ar wrapt up in and support by in the weak of their infanc ag and reason as thei grow up loosen them till at length thei drop quit off and leav a man at hi own free dispos sect adam wa creat a perfect man hi bodi and mind in full possess of their strength and reason

is peopl with hi descend who ar all born infant weak and helpless without knowledg or understand but to suppli the defect of thi imperfect state till the improv of growth and ag hath remov them adam and ev and after them all parent were by the law of natur under an oblig to preserv nourish and educ the children thei had begotten not as their own workmanship but the workmanship of their own maker the almighti to whom thei were to be account for them sect the law that wa to govern adam wa the same that wa to govern all hi poster the law of reason but hi offspr have anoth wai of entranc into the world differ from him by a natur birth that produc them ignor and without the us of reason thei were not present under that law for no bodi can be under a law which is not promulg to him and thi law be promulg or made known by reason onli he that is not come to the us of hi reason cannot be said to be under thi law and adam children be not present as soon as born under thi law of reason were not present free for law in it true notion is not so much the limit as the direct of a free and intellig agent to hi proper interest and prescrib no farther than is for the gener good of those under that law could thei be happier without it the law as an useless thing would of itself vanish and that ill deserv the name of confin which hedg us in onli from bog and precipic so that howev it mai be mistaken the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserv and enlarg freedom for in all the state of creat be capabl of law where there is no law there is no freedom for liberti is to be free from restraint and violenc from other which cannot be where there is no law but freedom is not as we ar told a liberti for everi man to do what he list for who could be free when everi other man humour might domin over him but a liberti to dispos and order as he list hi person action possess and hi whole properti within the allow of those law under which he is and therein not to be subject to the arbitrari will of anoth but freeli follow hi own sect the power then that parent have over their children aris from that duti which is incumb on them to take care of their offspr dure the imperfect state of childhood to inform the mind and govern the action of their yet ignor nonag till reason shall take it place and eas them of that troubl is what the children want and the parent ar bound to for god have given man an understand to direct hi action ha allow him a freedom of will and liberti of act as properli belong thereunto within the bound of that law he is under but whilst he is in an estat wherein he ha not understand of hi own to direct hi will he is not to have ani will of hi own to follow he that understand for him must will for him too he must prescrib to hi will and regul hi action but when he come to the estat that made hi father a freeman the son is a freeman too sect thi hold in all the law a man is under whether natur or civil is a man under the law of natur what made him free of that law what gave him a free dispos of hi properti accord to hi own will within the compass of that law i answer a state of matur wherein he might be suppos capabl to know that law that so he might keep hi action within the bound of it when he ha acquir that state he is presum to know how far that law is to be hi guid and how far he mai make us of hi freedom and so come to have it till then some bodi els must guid him who is presum to know how far the law allow a liberti if such a state of reason such an ag of discret made him free the same shall make hi son free too is a man under the law of england what made him free of that law that is to have the liberti to dispos of hi action and possess accord to hi own will within the permiss of that law a capac of know that law which is suppos by that law at the ag of on and twenti year and in some case sooner if thi made the father free it shall make the son free too till then we see the law allow the son to have no will but he is to be guid by the will of hi father or guardian who is to understand for him and if the father die and fail to substitut a deputi in hi trust if he hath not provid a tutor to govern hi son dure hi minor dure hi want of understand the law take care to do it some other must govern him and be a will to him till he hath attain to a state of freedom and hi understand be fit to take the govern of hi will but after that the father and son ar equal free as much as tutor and pupil after nonag equal subject of the same law togeth without ani dominion left in the father over the life liberti or estat of hi son whether thei be onli in the state and under the law of natur or under the posit law of an establish govern sect but if through defect that mai happen out of the ordinari cours of natur ani on come not to such a degre of reason wherein he might be suppos capabl of know the law and so live within the rule of it he is never capabl of be a free man he is never let loos to the disposur of hi own will becaus he know no bound to it ha not understand it proper guid but is continu under the tuition and govern of other all the time hi own understand is uncap of that charg

life the want of distinguish these two power viz that which the father hath in the right of tuition dure minor and the right of honour all hi life mai perhap have caus a great part of the mistak about thi matter for to speak properli of them the first of these is rather the privileg of children and duti of parent than ani prerog of patern power the nourish and educ of their children is a charg so incumb on parent for their children good that noth can absolv them from take care of it and though the power of command and chastis them go along with it yet god hath woven into the principl of human

and therefor god almighti when he would express hi gentl deal with the israelit he tell them that though he chasten them he chasten them as a man chasten hi son deut viii ie with tender and affect and kept them under no sever disciplin than what wa absolut best for them and had been less kind to have slacken thi is that power to which children ar command obedi that the pain and care of their parent mai not be increas or ill reward sect on the other side honour and support all that which gratitud requir to return for the benefit receiv by and from them is the indispens duti of the child and the proper privileg of the parent thi is intend for the parent advantag as the other is for the child though educ the parent duti seem to have most power becaus the ignor and infirm of childhood stand in need of restraint and correct which is a visibl exercis of rule and a kind of dominion and that duti which is comprehend in the word honour requir less obedi though the oblig be stronger on grown than younger children for who can think the command children obei your parent requir in a man that ha children of hi own the same submiss to hi father as it doe in hi yet young children to him and that by thi precept he were bound to obei all hi father command if out of a conceit of author he should have the indiscret to treat him still as a boi sect the first part then of patern power or rather duti which is educ belong so to the father that it termin at a certain season when the busi of educ is over it ceas of itself and is also alien befor for a man mai put the tuition of hi son in other hand and he that ha made hi son an apprentic to anoth ha discharg him dure that time of a great part of hi obedi both to himself and to hi mother but all the duti of honour the other part remain never the less entir to them noth can cancel that it is so insepar from them both that the father author cannot dispossess the mother of thi right nor can ani man discharg hi son from honour her that bore him but both these ar veri far from a power to make law and enforc them with penalti that mai reach estat liberti limb and life the power of command end with nonag and though after that honour and respect support and defenc and whatsoev gratitud can oblig a man to for the highest benefit he is natur capabl of be alwai due from a son to hi parent yet all thi put no scepter into the father hand no sovereign power of command he ha no dominion over hi son properti or action nor ani right that hi will should prescrib to hi son in all thing howev it mai becom hi son in mani thing not veri inconveni to him and hi famili to pai a defer to it sect a man mai ow honour and respect to an ancient or wise man defenc to hi child or friend relief and support to the distress and gratitud to a benefactor to such a degre that all he ha all he can do cannot suffici pai it but all these give no author no right to ani on of make law over him from whom thei ar ow and it is plain all thi is due not onli to the bare titl of father not onli becaus as ha been said it is ow to the mother too but becaus these oblig to parent and the degre of what is requir of children mai be vari by the differ care and kind troubl and expenc which is often emploi upon on child more than anoth sect thi shew the reason how it come to pass that parent in societi where thei themselv ar subject retain a power over their children and have as much right to their subject as those who ar in the state of natur which could not possibl be if all polit power were onli patern and that in truth thei were on and the same thing for then all patern power be in the princ the subject could natur have none of it but these two power polit and patern ar so perfectli distinct and separ ar built upon so differ foundat and given to so differ end that everi subject that is a father ha as much a patern power over hi children as the princ ha over hi and everi princ that ha parent ow them as much filial duti and obedi as the meanest of hi subject do to their and can therefor contain not ani part or degre of that kind of dominion which a princ or magistr ha over hi subject sect though the oblig on the parent to bring up their children and the oblig on children to honour their parent contain all the power on the on hand and submiss on the other which ar proper to thi relat yet there is anoth power ordinarili in the father wherebi he ha a tie on the obedi of hi children which tho it be common to him with other men yet the occas of shew it almost constantli happen to father in their privat famili and the instanc of it elsewher be rare and less taken notic of it pass in the world for a part of patern jurisdict and thi is the power men gener have to bestow their estat on those who pleas them best the possess of the father be the expect and inherit of the children ordinarili in certain proport accord to the law and custom of each countri yet it is commonli in the father power to bestow it with a more spare or liber hand accord as the behaviour of thi or that child hath comport with hi will and humour sect thi is no small tie on the obedi of children and there be alwai annex to the enjoy of land a submiss to the govern of the countri of which that land is a part it ha been commonli suppos that a father could oblig hi poster to that govern of which he himself wa a subject and that hi compact held them wherea it be onli a necessari condit annex to the land and the inherit of an estat which is under that govern reach onli those who will take it on that condit and so is no natur tie or engag but a voluntari submiss for everi man children be by natur as free as himself or ani of hi ancestor ever were mai whilst thei ar in that freedom choos what societi thei will join themselv to what commonwealth thei will put themselv under but if thei will enjoi the inherit of their ancestor thei must take it on the same term their ancestor had it and submit to all the condit annex to such a possess by thi power inde father oblig their children to obedi to themselv even when thei ar past minor and most commonli too subject them to thi or that polit power but neither of these by ani peculiar right of fatherhood but by the reward thei have in their hand to inforc and recomp such a complianc and is no more power than what a french man ha over an english man who by the hope of an estat he will leav him will certainli have a strong tie on hi obedi and if when it is left him he will enjoi it he must certainli take it upon the condit annex to the possess of land in that countri where it li whether it be franc or england sect to conclud then tho the father power of command extend no farther than the minor of hi children and to a degre onli fit for the disciplin and govern of that ag and tho that honour and respect and all that which the latin call pieti which thei indispens ow to their parent all their lifetim and in all estat with all that support and defenc is due to them give the father no power of govern ie make law and enact penalti on hi children though by all thi he ha no dominion over the properti or action of hi son yet it is obviou to conceiv how easi it wa in the first ag of the world and in place still where the thin of peopl give famili leav to separ into unpossess quarter and thei have room to remov or plant themselv in yet vacant habit for the father of the famili to becom the princ of it he had been a ruler from the begin of the infanc of hi children and sinc without some govern it would be hard for them to live togeth it wa likeliest it should by the express or tacit consent of the children when thei were grown up be in the father where it seem without ani chang bare to continu when inde noth more wa requir to it than the permit the father to exercis alon in hi famili that execut power of the law of natur which everi free man natur hath and by that permiss resign up to him a monarch power whilst thei remain in it but that thi wa not by ani patern right but onli by the consent of hi children is evid from henc that no bodi doubt but if a stranger whom chanc or busi had brought to hi famili had there kill ani of hi children or commit ani other fact he might condemn and put him to death or otherwis have punish him as well as ani of hi children which it wa imposs he should do by virtu of ani patern author over on who wa not hi child but by virtu of that execut power of the law of natur which as a man he had a right to and he alon could punish him in hi famili where the respect of hi children had laid by the exercis of such a power to give wai to the digniti and author thei were will should remain in him abov the rest of hi famili it is no improb opinion therefor which the archphilosoph wa of that the chief person in everi houshold wa alwai as it were a king so when number of houshold join themselv in civil societi togeth king were the first kind of governor amongst them which is also as it seemeth the reason why the name of father continu still in them who of father were made ruler as also the ancient custom of governor to do as melchizedec and be king to exercis the offic of priest which father did at the first grew perhap by the same occas howbeit thi is not the onli kind of regiment that ha been receiv in the world the inconveni of on kind have caus sundri other to be devis so that in a word all

afford greater controversi and when ani should aris where could thei have a fitter umpir than he by whose care thei had everi on been sustain and brought up and who had a tender for them all it is no wonder that thei made no distinct betwixt minor and full ag nor look after on and twenti or ani other ag that might make them the free dispos of themselv and fortun when thei could have no desir to be out of their pupilag the govern thei had been under dure it continu still to be more their protect than restraint and thei could no where find a greater secur to their peac liberti and fortun than in

as strongli prove that all princ nai princ onli ought to be priest sinc it is as certain that in the begin the father of the famili wa priest as that he wa ruler in hi own houshold chapter vii of

as well as fit him with understand and languag to continu and enjoi it the first societi wa between man and wife which gave begin to that between parent and children to which in time that between master and servant came to be ad and though all these might and commonli did meet togeth and make up but on famili wherein the master or mistress of it had some sort of rule proper to a famili each of these or all togeth came short of polit societi as we shall see if we consid the differ end ti and bound of each of these sect conjug societi is made by a voluntari compact between man and woman and tho it consist chiefli in such a communion and right in on anoth bodi as is necessari to it chief end procreat yet it draw with it mutual support and assist and a communion of interest too as necessari not onli to unit their care and affect but also necessari to their common offspr who have a right to be nourish and maintain by them till thei ar abl to provid for themselv sect for the end of conjunct between male and femal be not bare procreat but the continu of the speci thi conjunct betwixt male and femal ought to last even after procreat so long as is necessari to the nourish and support of the young on who ar to be sustain even after procreat so long as is necessari to the nourish and support of the young on who ar to be sustain by those that got them till thei ar abl to shift and provid for themselv thi rule which the infinit wise maker hath set to the work of hi hand we find the inferior creatur steadili obei in those vivipar anim which feed on grass the conjunct between male and femal last no longer than the veri act of copul becaus the teat of the dam be suffici to nourish the young till it be abl to feed on grass the male onli beget but concern not himself for the femal or young to whose susten he can contribut noth but in beast of prei the conjunct last longer becaus the dam not be abl well to subsist herself and nourish her numer offspr by her own prei alon a more labori as well as more danger wai of live than by feed on grass the assist of the male is necessari to the mainten of their common famili which cannot subsist till thei ar abl to prei

young need food in the nest the cock and hen continu mate till the young ar abl to us their wing and provid for themselv sect and herein i think li the chief if not the onli reason why the male and femal in mankind ar ti to a longer conjunct than other creatur viz becaus the femal is capabl of conceiv and de facto is commonli with child again and bring forth too a new birth long befor the former is out of a depend for support on hi parent help and abl to shift for himself and ha all the assist is due to him from hi parent wherebi the father who is bound to take care for those he hath begot is under an oblig to continu in conjug societi with the same woman longer than other creatur whose young be abl to subsist of themselv befor the time of procreat return again the conjug bond dissolv of itself and thei ar at liberti till hymen at hi usual anniversari season summon them again to chuse new mate wherein on cannot but admir the wisdom of the great creator who have given to man foresight and an abil to lai up for the futur as well as to suppli the present necess hath made it necessari that societi of man and wife should be more last than of male and femal amongst other creatur that so their industri might be encourag and their interest better unit to make provis and lai up good for their common issu which uncertain mixtur or easi and frequent solut of conjug societi would mightili disturb sect but tho these ar ti upon mankind which make the conjug bond more firm and last in man than the other speci of anim yet it would give on reason to enquir why thi compact where procreat and

sort of servant which by a peculiar name we call slave who be captiv taken in a just war ar by the right of natur subject to the absolut dominion and arbitrari power of their master these men have as i sai forfeit their live and with it their liberti and lost their estat and be in the state of slaveri not capabl of ani properti cannot in that state be consid as ani part of civil societi the chief end whereof is the preserv of properti sect let us therefor consid a master of a famili with all these subordin relat of wife children servant and slave unit under the domest rule of a famili which what resembl soever it mai have in it order offic and number too with a littl commonwealth yet is veri far from it both in it constitut power and end or if it must be thought a monarchi and the paterfamilia the absolut monarch in it absolut monarchi will have but a veri shatter and short power when it is plain by what ha been said befor that the master of the famili ha a veri distinct and differ limit power both as to time and extent over those sever person that ar in it for except the slave and the famili is as much a famili and hi power as paterfamilia as great whether there be ani slave in hi famili or no he ha no legisl power of life and death over ani of them and none too but what a mistress of a famili mai have as well as he and he certainli can have no absolut power over the whole famili who ha but a veri limit on over everi individu in it but how a famili or ani other societi of men differ from that which is properli polit societi we shall best see by consid wherein polit societi itself consist sect man be born as ha been prove with a titl to perfect freedom and an uncontroul enjoy of all the right and privileg of the law of natur equal with ani other man or

determin by occasion judgment found on the present circumst of the fact how far injuri from without ar to be vindic and in both these to emploi all the forc of all the member when there shall be need

absolut monarchi is what kind of father of their countri it make princ to be and to what a degre of happi and secur it carri civil societi where thi sort of govern is grown to perfect he that will look into the late relat of ceylon mai easili see sect in absolut monarchi inde as well as other govern of the world the subject have an appeal to the law and judg to decid ani controversi and restrain ani violenc that mai happen betwixt the subject themselv on amongst anoth thi everi on think necessari and believ he deserv to be thought a declar enemi to societi and mankind who should go about to take it awai but whether thi be from a true love of mankind and societi and such a chariti as we ow all on to anoth there is reason to doubt for thi is no more than what everi man who love hi

question can scarc be born thei ar readi to tell you that it deserv death onli to ask after safeti betwixt subject and subject thei will grant there must be measur law and judg for their mutual peac and secur but as for the ruler he ought to be absolut and is abov all such circumst becaus he ha power to do more hurt and wrong it is right when he doe it to ask how you mai be guard from harm or injuri on that side where the strongest hand is to do it is present the voic of faction and rebellion as if when men quit the state of natur enter into societi thei agre that all of them but on should be under the restraint of law but that he should still retain all the liberti of the state of natur increas with power and made licenti by impun thi is to think that men ar so foolish that thei take care to avoid what mischief mai be done them by polecat or fox but ar content nai think it safeti to be devour by lion sect but whatev flatter mai talk to amus peopl understand it hinder not men from feel and when thei perceiv that ani man in what station soever is out of the bound of the civil societi which thei ar of and that thei have no appeal on earth against ani harm thei mai receiv from him thei ar apt to think themselv in the state of natur in respect of him whom thei find to be so and to take care as soon as thei can to have that safeti and secur in civil societi for which it wa first institut and for which onli thei enter into it and therefor though perhap at first as shall be shew more at larg hereaft in the follow part of thi discours some on good and excel man have got a

that noth wa then farther thought upon for the manner of govem but all permit unto their wisdom and discret which were to rule till by experi thei found thi for all part veri inconveni so as the thing which thei had devis for a remedi did inde but increas the sore which it should have cure thei saw that to live by on man will becam the caus of all men miseri thi constrain them to come unto law wherein all men might see their duti beforehand and know the penalti of transgress them hooker eccl pol l i sect civil law be the act of the whole bodi polit doth therefor overrul each sever part of the same bodi hooker ibid chapter viii of the begin of polit societi sect men be as ha been said by natur all free equal and independ no on can be put out of thi estat and subject to the polit power of anoth without hi own consent the onli wai wherebi ani on divest himself of hi natur liberti and put on the bond of civil societi is by agre with other men to join and unit into a commun for their comfort safe and peaceabl live on amongst anoth in a secur enjoy of their properti and a greater secur against ani that ar not of it thi ani number of men mai do becaus it injur not the freedom of the rest thei ar left as thei were in the liberti of the state of natur when ani number of men have so consent to make on commun or govern thei ar therebi present incorpor and make on bodi polit wherein the major have a right to act and conclud the rest sect for when ani number of men have by the consent of everi individu made a commun thei have therebi made that commun on bodi with a power to act as on bodi which is onli by the will and determin of the major for that which act ani commun be onli the consent of the individu of it and it be necessari to that which is on bodi to move on wai it is necessari the bodi should move that wai whither the greater forc carri it which is the consent of the major or els it is imposs it should act or continu on bodi on commun which the consent of everi individu that unit into it agre that it should and so everi on is bound by that consent to be conclud by the major and therefor we see that in assembl impow to act by posit law where no number is set by that posit law which impow them the act of the major pass for the act of the whole and of cours determin as have by the law of natur and reason the power of the whole sect and thu everi man by consent with other to make on bodi polit under on govern put himself under an oblig to everi on of that societi to submit to the determin of the major and to be conclud by it or els thi origin compact wherebi he with other incorpor into on societi would signifi noth and be no compact if he be left free and under no other ti than he wa in befor in the state of natur for what appear would there be of ani compact what new engag if he were no farther ti by ani decre of the societi than he himself thought fit and did actual consent to thi would be still as great a liberti as he himself had befor hi compact or ani on els in the state of natur hath who mai submit himself and consent to ani act of it if he think fit sect for if the consent of the major shall not in reason be receiv as the act of the whole and conclud everi individu noth but the consent of everi individu can make ani thing to be the act of the whole but such a consent is next to imposs ever to be had if we consid the infirm of health and avoc of busi which in a number though much less than that of a commonwealth will necessarili keep mani awai from the public assembl to which if we add the varieti of opinion and contrarieti of interest which unavoid happen in all collect of men the come into societi upon such term would be onli like cato come into the theatr onli to go out again such a constitut as thi would make the mighti leviathan of a shorter durat than the feeblest creatur and not let it outlast the dai it wa born in which cannot be suppos till we can think that ration creatur should desir and constitut societi onli to be dissolv for where the major cannot conclud the rest there thei cannot act as on bodi and consequ will be immedi dissolv again sect whosoev therefor out of a state of natur unit into a commun must be understood to give up all the power necessari to the end for which thei unit into societi to the major of the commun unless thei expresli agre in ani number greater than the major and thi is done by bare agre to unit into on polit societi which is all the compact that is or need be between the individu that enter into or make up a commonwealth and thu that which begin and actual constitut ani polit societi is noth but the consent of ani number of freemen capabl of a major to unit and incorpor into such a societi and thi is that and that onli which did or could give begin to ani law govern in the world sect to thi i find two object made first that there ar no instanc to be found in stori of a compani of men independ and equal on amongst anoth that met togeth and in thi wai began and set up a govern secondli it is imposs of right that men should do so becaus all men be born under govern thei ar to submit to that and ar not at liberti to begin a new on sect to the first there is thi to answer that it is not at all to be wonder that histori give us but a veri littl account of men that live togeth in the state of natur the inconveni of that condit and the love and want of societi no sooner brought ani number of them togeth but thei present unit and incorpor if thei design to continu togeth and if we mai not suppos men ever to have been in the state of natur becaus we hear not much of them in such a state we mai as well suppos the armi of salmanass or xerx were never children becaus we hear littl of them till thei were men and imbodi in armi govern is everi where anteced to record and letter seldom come in amongst a peopl till a long continu of civil societi ha by other more necessari art provid for their safeti eas and plenti and then thei begin to look after the histori of their founder and search into their origin when thei have outliv the memori of it for it is with commonwealth as with particular person thei ar commonli ignor of their own birth and infanc and if thei know ani thing of their origin thei ar beholden for it to the accident record that other have kept of it and those that we have of the begin of ani politi in the world except that of the jew where god himself immedi interpos and which favour not at all patern dominion ar all either plain instanc of such a begin as i have mention or at least have manifest footstep of it sect he must shew a strang inclin to deni evid matter of fact when it agre not with hi hypothesi who will not allow that shew a strang inclin to deni evid matter of fact when it agre not with hi hypothesi who will not allow that the begin of rome and venic were by the unit togeth of sever men free and independ on of anoth amongst whom there wa no natur superior or subject and if josephu acosta word mai be taken he tell us that in mani part of america there wa no govern at all there ar great and appar conjectur sai he that these men speak of those of peru for a long time had neither king nor commonwealth but live in troop as thei do thi dai in florida the cheriquana those of brazil and mani other nation which have no certain king but as occas is offer in peac or war thei choos their captain as thei pleas i c if it be said that everi man there wa born subject to hi father or the head of hi famili that the subject due from a child to a father took not awai hi freedom of unit into what polit societi he thought fit ha been alreadi prove but be that as it will these men it is evid were actual free and whatev superior some politician now would place in ani of them thei themselv claim it not but by consent were all equal till by the same consent thei set ruler over themselv so that their polit societi all began from a voluntari union and the mutual agreement of men freeli act in the choic of their governor and form of govern sect and i hope those who went awai from sparta with palantu mention by justin iii c will be allow to have been freemen independ on of anoth and to have set up a govern over themselv by their own consent thu i have given sever exampl out of histori of peopl free and in the state of natur that be met togeth incorpor and began a commonwealth and if the want of such instanc be an argument to prove that govern were not nor could not be so begun i suppos the contend for patern empir were better let it alon than urg it against natur liberti for if thei can give so mani instanc out of histori of govern begun upon patern right i think though at best an argument from what ha been to what should of right be ha no great forc on might without ani great danger yield them the caus but if i might advis them in the case thei would do well not to search too much into the origin of govern as thei have begun de facto lest thei should find at the foundat of most of them someth veri littl favour to the design thei promot and such a power as thei contend for sect but to conclud reason be plain on our side that men ar natur free and the exampl of histori shew that the govern of the world that were begun in peac had their begin laid on that foundat and were made by the consent of the peopl there can be littl room for doubt either where the right is or what ha been the opinion or practic of mankind about the first erect of govern sect i will not deni that if we look back as far as histori will direct us toward the origin of commonwealth we shall gener find them under the govern and administr of on man and i am also apt to believ that where a famili wa numer enough to subsist by itself and continu entir togeth without mix with other as it often happen where there is much land and few peopl the govern commonli began in the father for the father have by the law of natur the same power with everi man els to punish as he thought fit ani offenc against that law might therebi punish hi transgress children even when thei were men and out of their pupilag and thei were veri like to submit to hi punish and all join with him against the offend in their turn give him therebi power to execut hi sentenc against ani transgress and so in effect make him the lawmak and governor over all that remain in conjunct with hi famili he wa fittest to be trust patern affect secur their properti and interest under hi care and the custom of obei him in their childhood made it easier to submit to him rather than to ani other if therefor thei must have on to rule them as govern is hardli to be avoid amongst men that live togeth who so like to be the man as he that wa their common father unless neglig cruelti or ani other defect of mind or bodi made him unfit for it but when either the father di and left hi next heir for want of ag wisdom courag or ani other qualiti less fit for rule or where sever famili met and consent to continu togeth there it is not to be doubt but thei us their natur freedom to set up him whom thei judg the ablest and most like to rule well over them conform hereunto we find the peopl of america who live out of the reach of the conquer sword and spread domin of the two great empir of peru and mexico enjoi their own natur freedom though caeteri paribu thei commonli prefer the heir of their deceas king yet if thei find him ani wai weak or uncap thei pass him by and set up the stoutest and bravest man for their ruler sect thu though look back as far as record give us ani account of peopl the world and the histori of nation we commonli find the govern to be in on hand yet it destroi not that which i affirm viz that the begin of polit societi depend upon the consent of the individu to join into and make on societi who when thei ar thu incorpor might set up what form of govern thei thought fit but thi have given occas to men to mistak and think that by natur govern wa monarch and belong to the father it mai not be amiss here to consid why peopl in the begin gener pitch upon thi form which though perhap the father preemin might in the first institut of some commonwealth give a rise to and place in the begin the power in on hand yet it is plain that the reason that continu the form of govern in a singl person wa not ani regard or respect to patern author sinc all petti monarchi that is almost all monarchi near their origin have been commonli at least upon occas elect sect first then in the begin of thing the father govern of the childhood of those sprung from him have accustom them to the rule of on man and taught them that where it wa exercis with care and skill with affect and love to those under it it wa suffici to procur and preserv to men all the polit happi thei sought for in societi it wa no wonder that thei should pitch upon and natur run into that form of govern which from their infanc thei had been all accustom to and which by experi thei had found both easi and safe to which if we add that monarchi be simpl and most obviou to men whom neither experi had instruct in form of govern nor the ambit or insol of empir had taught to bewar of the encroach of prerog or the inconveni of absolut power which monarchi in success wa apt to lai claim to and bring upon them it wa not at all strang that thei should not much troubl themselv to think of method of restrain ani exorbit of those to whom thei had given the author over them and of balanc the power of govern by place sever part of it in differ hand thei had neither felt the oppress of tyrann dominion nor did the fashion of the ag nor their possess or wai of live which afford littl matter for covet or ambit give them ani reason to apprehend or provid against it and therefor it is no wonder thei put themselv into such a frame of govern as wa not onli as i said most obviou and simpl but also best suit to their present state and condit which stood more in need of defenc against foreign invas and injuri than of multipl of law the equal of a simpl poor wai of live confin their desir within the narrow bound of each man small properti made few controversi and so no need of mani law to decid them or varieti of offic to superintend the process or look after the execut of justic where there were but few trespass and few offend sinc then those who like on anoth so well as to join into societi cannot but be suppos to have some acquaint and friendship togeth and some trust on in anoth thei could not but have greater apprehens of other than of on anoth and therefor their first care and thought cannot but be suppos to be how to secur themselv against foreign forc it wa natur for them to put themselv under a frame of govern which might best serv to that end and chuse the wisest and bravest man to conduct them in their war and lead them out against their enemi and in thi chiefli be their ruler sect thu we see that the king of the indian in america which is still a pattern of the first ag in asia and europ whilst the inhabit were too few for the countri and want of peopl and monei gave men no temptat to enlarg their possess of land or contest for wider extent of ground ar littl more than gener of their armi and though thei command absolut in war yet at home and in time of peac thei exercis veri littl dominion and have but a veri moder sovereignti the resolut of peac and war be ordinarili either in the peopl or in a council tho the war itself which admit not of plural of governor natur devolv the command into the king sole author sect and thu in israel itself the chief busi of their judg and first king seem to have been to be captain in war and leader of their armi which besid what is signifi by go out and in befor the peopl which wa to march forth to war and home again in the head of their forc appear plainli in the stori of jephtha the ammonit make war upon israel the gileadit in fear send to jephtha a bastard of their famili whom thei had cast off and articl with him if he will assist them against the ammonit to make him their ruler which thei do in these word and the peopl made him head and captain over them judg xi which wa as it seem all on as to be judg and he judg israel judg xii that is wa their captaingener six year so when jotham upbraid the shechemit with the oblig thei had to gideon who had been their judg and ruler he tell them he fought for you and adventur hi life far and deliv you out of the hand of midian judg ix noth mention of him but what he did as a gener and inde that is all is found in hi histori or in ani of the rest of the judg and abimelech particularli is call king though at most he wa but their gener and when be weari of the ill conduct of samuel son the children of israel desir a king like all the nation to judg them and to go out befor them and to fight their battl i sam viii god grant their desir sai to samuel i will send thee a man and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my peopl israel that he mai save my peopl out of the hand of the philistin ix as if the onli busi of a king had been to lead out their armi and fight in their defenc and accordingli at hi inaugur pour a vial of oil upon him declar to saul that the lord had anoint him to be captain over hi inherit x and therefor those who after saul be solemnli chosen and salut king by the tribe at mispah were unwil to have him their king made no other object but thi how shall thi man save us v as if thei should have said thi man is unfit to be our king not have skill and conduct enough in war to be abl to defend us and when god resolv to transfer the govern to david it is in these word but now thy kingdom shall not continu the lord hath sought him a man after hi own heart and the lord hath command him to be captain over hi peopl xiii as if the whole kingli author were noth els but to be their gener and therefor the tribe who had stuck to saul famili and oppos david reign when thei came to hebron with term of submiss to him thei tell him amongst other argument thei had to submit to him as to their king that he wa in effect their king in saul time and therefor thei had no reason but to receiv him as their king now also sai thei in time past when saul wa king over us thou wast he that reddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said unto thee thou shalt feed my peopl israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel sect thu whether a famili by degre grew up into a commonwealth and the fatherli author be continu on to the elder son everi on in hi turn grow up under it tacitli submit to it and the easi and equal of it not offend ani on everi on acquiesc till time seem to have confirm it and settl a right of success by prescript or whether sever famili or the descend of sever famili whom chanc neighbourhood or busi brought togeth unit into societi the need of a gener whose conduct might defend them against their enemi in war and the great confid the innoc

societi could not have subsist without such nurs father tender and care of the public weal all govern would have sunk under the weak and infirm of their infanc and the princ and the peopl had soon perish togeth sect but though the golden ag befor vain ambit and amor sceleratu habendi evil concupisc had corrupt men mind into a mistak of true power and honour had more virtu and consequ better governor as well as less viciou subject and there wa then no stretch prerog on the on side to oppress the peopl nor consequ on the other ani disput about privileg to lessen or restrain the power of the magistr and so no contest betwixt ruler and peopl about governor or govern yet when ambit and luxuri in futur ag would retain and increas the power without do the busi for which it wa given and

law wherein all men might see their duti befor hand and know the penalti of transgress them hooker eccl pol l i sect sect thu we mai see how probabl it is that peopl that were natur free and by their own consent either submit to the govern of their father or unit togeth out of differ famili to make a govern should gener put the rule into on man hand and chuse to be under the conduct of a singl person without so much as by express condit limit or regul hi power which thei thought safe enough in hi honesti and prudenc though thei never dream of monarchi be lure divino which we never heard of among mankind till it wa reveal to us by the divin of thi last ag nor ever allow patern power to have a right to dominion or to be the foundat of all govern and thu much mai suffic to shew that as far as we have ani light from histori we have reason to conclud that all peac begin of govern have been laid in the consent of the peopl i sai peac becaus i shall have occas in anoth place to speak of conquest which some esteem a wai of begin of govern the other object i find urg against the begin of politi in the wai i have mention is thi viz sect that all men be born under govern some or other it is imposs ani of them should ever be free and at liberti to unit togeth and begin a new on or ever be abl to erect a law govern if thi argument be good i ask how came so mani law monarchi into the world for if ani bodi upon thi supposit can shew me ani on man in ani ag of the world free to begin a law monarchi i will be bound to shew him ten other free men at liberti at the same time to unit and begin a new govern under a regal or ani other form it be demonstr that if ani on born under the dominion of anoth mai be so free as to have a right to command other in a new and distinct empir everi on that is born under the dominion of anoth mai be so free too and mai becom a ruler or subject of a distinct separ govern and so by thi their own principl either all men howev born ar free or els there is but on law princ on law govern in the world and then thei have noth to do but bare to shew us which that is which when thei have done i doubt not but all mankind will easili agre to pai obedi to him sect though it be a suffici answer to their object to shew that it involv them in the same difficulti that it doth those thei us it against yet i shall endeavour to discov the weak of thi argument a littl farther all men sai thei ar born under govern and therefor thei cannot be at liberti to begin a new on everi on is born a subject to hi father or hi princ and is therefor under the perpetu tie of subject and allegi it is plain mankind never own nor consid ani such natur subject that thei were born in to on or to the other that ti them without their own consent to a subject to them and their heir sect for there ar no exampl so frequent in histori both sacr and profan as those of men withdraw themselv and their obedi from the jurisdict thei were born under and the famili or commun thei were bred up in and set up new govern in other place from whenc sprang all that number of petti commonwealth in the begin of ag and which alwai multipli as long as there wa room enough till the stronger or more fortun swallow the weaker and those great on again break to piec dissolv into lesser dominion all which ar so mani testimoni against patern sovereignti and plainli prove that it wa not the natur right of the father descend to hi heir that made govern in the begin sinc it wa imposs upon that ground there should have been so mani littl kingdom all must have been but onli on univers monarchi if men had not been at liberti to separ themselv from their famili and the govern be it what it will that wa set up in it and go and make distinct commonwealth and other govern as thei thought fit sect thi ha been the practic of the world from it first begin to thi dai nor is it now ani more hindranc to the freedom of mankind that thei ar born under constitut and ancient politi that have establish law and set form of govern than if thei were born in the wood amongst the unconfin inhabit that run loos in them for those who would persuad us that by be born under ani govern we ar natur subject to it and have no more ani titl or pretenc to the freedom of the state of natur have no other reason bate that of patern power which we have alreadi answer to produc for it but onli becaus our father or progenitor pass awai their natur liberti and therebi bound up themselv and their poster to a perpetu subject to the govern which thei themselv submit to it is true that whatev engag or promis ani on ha made for himself he is under the oblig of them but cannot by ani compact whatsoev bind hi children or poster for hi son when a man be altogeth as free as the father ani act of the father can no more give awai the liberti of the son than it can of ani bodi els he mai inde annex such condit to the land he enjoi as a subject of ani commonwealth as mai oblig hi son to be of that commun if he will enjoi those possess which were hi father becaus that estat be hi father properti he mai dispos or settl it as he pleas sect and thi ha gener given the occas to mistak in thi matter becaus commonwealth not permit ani part of their dominion to be dismemb nor to be enjoi by ani but those of their commun the son cannot ordinarili enjoi the possess of hi father but under the same term hi father did by becom a member of the societi wherebi he put himself present under the govern he find there establish as much as ani other subject of that commonwealth and thu the consent of freemen born under govern which onli make them member of it be given separ in their turn as each come to be of ag and not in a multitud togeth peopl take no notic of it and think it not done at all or not necessari conclud thei ar natur subject as thei ar men sect but it is plain govern themselv understand it otherwis thei claim no power over the son becaus of that thei had over the father nor look on children as be their subject by their father be so if a subject of england have a child by an english woman in franc whose subject is he not the king of england for he must have leav to be admit to the privileg of it nor the king of franc for how then ha hi father a liberti to bring him awai and breed him as he pleas and who ever wa judg as a traytor or desert if he left or war against a countri for be bare born in it of parent that were alien there it is plain then by the practic of govern themselv as well as by the law of right reason that a child is born a subject of no countri or govern he is under hi father tuition and author till he come to ag of discret and then he is a freeman at liberti what govern he will put himself under what bodi polit he will unit himself to for if an englishman son born in franc be at liberti and mai do so it is evid there is no tie upon him by hi father be a subject of thi kingdom nor is he bound up by ani compact of hi ancestor and why then hath not hi son by the same reason the same liberti though he be born ani where els sinc the power that a father hath natur over hi children is the same whereev thei be born and the ti of natur oblig ar not bound by the posit limit of kingdom and commonwealth sect everi man be as ha been shew natur free and noth be abl to put him into subject to ani earthli power but onli hi own consent it is to be consid what shall be understood to be a suffici declar of a man consent to make him subject to the law of ani govern there is a common distinct of an express and a tacit consent which will concern our present case no bodi doubt but an express consent of ani man enter into ani societi make him a perfect member of that societi a subject of that govern the difficulti is what ought to be look upon as a tacit consent and how far it bind ie how far ani on shall be look on to have consent and therebi submit to ani govern where he ha made no express of it at all and to thi i sai that everi man that hath ani possess or enjoy of ani part of the dominion of ani govern doth therebi give hi tacit consent and is as far forth oblig to obedi to the law of that govern dure such enjoy as ani on under it whether thi hi possess be of land to him and hi heir for ever or a lodg onli for a week or whether it be bare travel freeli on the highwai and in effect it reach as far as the veri be of ani on within the territori of that govern sect to understand thi the better it is fit to consid that everi man when he at first incorpor himself into ani commonwealth he by hi unit himself thereunto annex also and submit to the commun those possess which he ha or shall acquir that do not alreadi belong to ani other govern for it would be a direct contradict for ani on to enter into societi with other for the secur and regul of properti and yet to suppos hi land whose properti is to be regul by the law of the societi should be exempt from the jurisdict of that govern to which he himself the proprietor of the land is a subject by the same act therefor wherebi ani on unit hi person which wa befor free to ani commonwealth by the same he unit hi possess which were befor free to it also and thei becom both of them person and possess subject to the govern and dominion of that commonwealth as long as it hath a be whoever therefor from thenceforth by inherit purchas permiss or otherwai enjoi ani part of the land so annex to and under the govern of that commonwealth must take it with the condit it is under that is of submit to the govern of the commonwealth under whose jurisdict it is as far forth as ani subject of it sect but sinc the govern ha a direct jurisdict onli over the land and reach the possessor of it befor he ha actual incorpor himself in the societi onli as he dwell upon and enjoi that the oblig ani on is under by virtu of such enjoy to submit to the govern begin and end with the enjoy so that whenev the owner who ha given noth but such a tacit consent to the govern will by donat sale or otherwis quit the said possess he is at liberti to go and incorpor himself into ani other commonwealth or to agre with other to begin a new on in vacui loci in ani part of the world thei can find free and unpossess wherea he that ha onc by actual agreement and ani express declar given hi consent to be of ani commonwealth is perpetu and indispens oblig to be and remain unalter a subject to it and can never be again in the liberti of the state of natur unless by ani calam the govern he wa under come to be dissolv or els by some public act cut him off from be ani longer a member of it sect but submit to the law of ani countri live quietli and enjoi privileg and protect under them make not a man a member of that societi thi is onli a local protect and homag due to and from all those who not be in a state of war come within the territori belong to ani govern to all part whereof the forc of it law extend but thi no more make a man a member of that societi a perpetu subject of that commonwealth than it would make a man a subject to anoth in whose famili he found it conveni to abid for some time though whilst he continu in it he were oblig to compli with the law and submit to the govern he found there and thu we see that foreign by live all their live under anoth govern and enjoi the privileg and protect of it though thei ar bound even in conscienc to submit to it administr as far forth as ani denison yet do not therebi come to be subject or member of that commonwealth noth can make ani man so but hi actual enter into it by posit engag and express promis and compact thi is that which i think concern the begin of polit societi and that consent which make ani on a member of ani commonwealth chapter ix of the end of polit societi and govern sect if man in the state of natur be so free as ha been said if he be absolut lord of hi own person and possess equal to the greatest and subject to no bodi why will he part with hi freedom why will he give up thi empir and subject himself to the dominion and controul of ani other power to which it is obviou to answer that though in the state of natur he hath such a right yet the enjoy of it is veri uncertain and constantli expos to the invas of other for all be king as much as he everi man hi equal and the greater part no strict observ of equiti and justic the enjoy of the properti he ha in thi state is veri unsaf veri unsecur thi make him will to quit a condit which howev free is full of fear and continu danger and it is not without reason that he seek out and is will to join in societi with other who ar alreadi unit or have a mind to unit for the mutual preserv of their live liberti and estat which i call by the gener name properti sect the great and chief end therefor of men unit into commonwealth and put themselv under govern is the preserv of their properti to which in the state of natur there ar mani thing want first there want an establish settl known law receiv and allow by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong and the common measur to decid all controversi between them for though the law of natur be plain and intellig to all ration creatur yet men be biass by their interest as well as ignor for want of studi of it ar not apt to allow of it as a law bind to them in the applic of it to their particular case sect secondli in the state of natur there want a known and indiffer judg with author to determin all differ accord to the establish law for everi on in that state be both judg and execution of the law of natur men be partial to themselv passion and reveng is veri apt to carri them too far and with too much heat in their own case as well as neglig and unconcerned to make them too remiss in other men sect thirdli in the state of natur there often want power to back and support the sentenc when right and to give it due execut thei who by ani injustic offend will seldom fail where thei ar abl by forc to make good their injustic such resist mani time make the punish danger and frequent destruct to those who attempt it sect thu mankind notwithstand all the privileg of the state of natur be but in an ill condit while thei remain in it ar quickli driven into societi henc it come to pass that we seldom find ani number of men live ani time togeth in thi state the inconveni that thei ar therein expos to by the irregular and uncertain exercis of the power everi man ha of punish the transgress of other make them take sanctuari under the establish law of govern and therein seek the preserv of their properti it is thi make them so willingli give up everi on hi singl power of punish to be exercis by such alon as shall be appoint to it amongst them and by such rule as the commun or those author by them to that purpos shall agre on and in thi we have the origin right and rise of both the legisl and execut power as well as of the govern and societi themselv sect for in the state of natur to omit the liberti he ha of innoc delight a man ha two power the first is to do whatsoev he think fit for the preserv of himself and other within the permiss of the law of natur by which law common to them all he and all the rest of mankind ar on commun make up on societi distinct from all other creatur and were it not for the corrupt and vitious of degener men there would be no need of ani other no necess that men should separ from thi great and natur commun and by posit agreement combin into smaller and divid associ the other power a man ha in the state of natur is the power to punish the crime commit against that law both these he give up when he join in a privat if i mai so call it or particular polit societi and incorpor into ani commonwealth separ from the rest of mankind sect the first power viz of do whatsoev he thought for the preserv of himself and the rest of mankind he give up to be regul by law made by the societi so far forth as the preserv of himself and the rest of that societi shall requir which law of the societi in mani thing confin the liberti he had by the law of natur sect secondli the power of punish he wholli give up and engag hi natur forc which he might befor emploi in the execut of the law of natur by hi own singl author as he thought fit to assist the execut power of the societi as the law thereof shall requir for be now in a new state wherein he is to enjoi mani conveni from the labour assist and societi of other in the same commun as well as protect from it whole strength he is to part also with as much of hi natur liberti in provid for himself as the good prosper and safeti of the societi shall requir which is not onli necessari but just sinc the other member of the societi do the like sect but though men when thei enter into societi give up the equal liberti and execut power thei had in the state of natur into the hand of the societi to be so far dispos of by the legisl as the good of the societi shall requir yet it be onli with an intent in everi on the better to preserv himself hi liberti and properti for no ration creatur can be suppos to chang hi condit with an intent to be wors the power of the societi or legisl constitut by them can never be suppos to extend farther than the common good but is oblig to secur everi on properti by provid against those three defect abov mention that made the state of natur so unsaf and uneasi and so whoever ha the legisl or suprem power of ani commonwealth is bound to govern by establish stand law promulg and known to the peopl and not by extemporari decre by indiffer and upright judg who ar to decid controversi by those law and to emploi the forc of the commun at home onli in the execut of such law or abroad to prevent or redress foreign injuri and secur the commun from inroad and invas and all thi to be direct to no other end but the peac safeti and public good of the peopl chapter x of the form of a commonwealth sect the major have as ha been shew upon men first unit into societi the whole power of the commun natur in them mai emploi all that power in make law for the commun from time to time and execut those law by offic of their own appoint and then the form of the govern is a perfect democraci or els mai put the power of make law into the hand of a few select men and their heir or successor and then it is an oligarchi or els into the hand of on man and then it is a monarchi if to him and hi heir it is an hereditari monarchi if to him onli for life but upon hi death the power onli of nomin a successor to return to them an elect monarchi and so accordingli of these the commun mai make compound and mix form of govern as thei think good and if the legisl power be at first given by the major to on or more person onli for their live or ani limit time and then the suprem power to revert to them again when it is so revert the commun mai dispos of it again anew into what hand thei pleas and so constitut a new form of govern for the form of govern depend upon the place the suprem power which is the legisl it be imposs to conceiv that an inferior power should prescrib to a superior or ani but the suprem make law accord as the power of make law is place such is the form of the commonwealth sect by commonwealth i must be understood all along to mean not a democraci or ani form of govern but ani independ commun which the latin signifi by the word civita to which the word which best answer in our languag is commonwealth and most properli express such a societi of men which commun or citi in english doe not for there mai be subordin commun in a govern and citi amongst us ha a quit differ notion from commonwealth and therefor to avoid ambigu i crave leav to us the word commonwealth in that sens in which i find it us by king jame the first and i take it to be it genuin signif which if ani bodi dislik i consent with him to chang it for a better chapter xi of the extent of the legisl power sect the great end of men enter into societi be the enjoy of their properti in peac and safeti and the great instrument and mean of that be the law establish in that societi the first and fundament posit law of all commonwealth is the establish of the legisl power as the first and fundament natur law which is to govern even the legisl itself is the preserv of the societi and as far as will consist with the public good of everi

conceiv or by what power soever back have the forc and oblig of a law which ha not it sanction from that legisl which the public ha chosen and appoint for without thi the law could not have that which is absolut necessari to it be a law the consent of the societi over whom no bodi can have a power to make law but by their own consent and by author receiv from them and therefor all the obedi which by the most solemn ti ani on can be oblig to pai ultim termin in thi suprem power and is direct by those law which it enact nor can ani oath to ani foreign power whatsoev or ani domest subordin power discharg ani member of the societi from hi obedi to the legisl act pursuant to their trust nor oblig him to ani obedi contrari to the law so enact or farther than thei do allow it be ridicul to imagin

the legisl whether place in on or more whether it be alwai in be or onli by interv though it be the suprem power in everi commonwealth yet first it is not nor can possibl be absolut arbitrari over the live and fortun of the peopl for it be but the joint power of everi member of the societi given up to that person or assembl which is legisl it can be no more than those person had in a state of natur befor thei enter into societi and gave up to the commun for no bodi can transfer to anoth more power than he ha in himself and no bodi ha an absolut arbitrari power over himself or over ani other to destroi hi own life or take awai the life or properti of anoth a man as ha been prove cannot subject himself to the arbitrari power of anoth and have in the state of natur no arbitrari power over the life liberti or possess of anoth but onli so much as the law of natur gave him for the preserv of himself and the rest of mankind thi is all he doth or can give up to the commonwealth and by it to the legisl power so that the legisl can have no more than thi their power in the utmost bound of it is limit to the public good of the societi it is a power that hath no other end but preserv and therefor can never have a right to destroi enslav or designedli to impoverish the subject the oblig of the law of natur ceas not in societi but onli in mani case ar drawn closer and have by human law known

into societi that thei mai have the unit strength of the whole societi to secur and defend their properti and mai have stand rule to bound it by which everi on mai know what is hi to thi end it is that men give up all their natur power to the societi which thei enter into and the commun put the legisl power into such hand as thei think fit with thi trust that thei shall be govern by declar law

posit law of scriptur otherwis thei ar ill made hooker eccl pol l iii sect to constrain men to ani thing inconveni doth seem unreason ibid l i sect sect absolut arbitrari power or govern without settl stand law can neither of them consist with the end of societi and govern which men would not quit the freedom of the state of natur for and tie themselv up under were it not to preserv their live liberti and fortun and by state rule of right and properti to secur their peac and quiet it cannot be suppos that thei should intend had thei a power so to do to give to ani on or more an absolut arbitrari power over their person and estat and put a forc into the magistr hand to execut hi unlimit will arbitrarili upon them thi were to put themselv into a wors condit than the state of natur wherein thei had a liberti to defend their right against the injuri of other and were upon equal term of forc to maintain it whether invad by a singl man or mani in combin wherea by suppos thei have given up themselv to the absolut arbitrari power and will of a legisl thei have disarm themselv and arm him to make a prei of them when he pleas he be in a much wors condit who is expos to the arbitrari power of on man who ha the command of than he that is expos to the arbitrari power of singl men no bodi be secur that hi will who ha such a command is better than that of other men though hi forc be time stronger and therefor whatev form the commonwealth is under the rule power ought to govern by declar and receiv law and not by extemporari dictat and undetermin resolut for then mankind will be in a far wors condit than in the state of natur if thei shall have arm on or a few men with the joint power of a multitud to forc them to obei at pleasur the exorbit and unlimit decre of their sudden thought or unrestrain and till that moment unknown will without have ani measur set down which mai guid and justifi their action for all the power the govern ha be onli for the good of the societi as it ought not to be arbitrari and at pleasur so it ought to be exercis by establish and promulg law that both the peopl mai know their duti and be safe and secur within the limit of the law and the ruler too kept within their bound and not be tempt by the power thei have in their hand to emploi it to such purpos and by such measur as thei would not have known and own not willingli sect thirdli the suprem power cannot take from ani man ani part of hi properti without hi own consent for the preserv of properti be the end of govern and that for which men enter into societi it necessarili suppos and requir that the peopl should have properti without which thei must be suppos to lose that by enter into societi which wa the end for which thei enter into it too gross an absurd for ani man to own men therefor in societi have properti thei have such a right to the good which by the law of the commun ar their that no bodi hath a right to take their substanc or ani part of it from them without their own consent without thi thei have no properti at all for i have truli no properti in that which anoth can by right take from me when he pleas against my consent henc it is a mistak to think that the suprem or legisl power of ani commonwealth can do what it will and dispos of the estat of the subject arbitrarili or take ani part of them at pleasur thi is not much to be fear in govern where the legisl consist wholli or in part in assembl which ar variabl whose member upon the dissolut of the assembl ar subject under the common law of their countri equal with the rest but in govern where the legisl is in on last assembl alwai in be or in on man as in absolut monarchi there is danger still that thei will think themselv to have a distinct interest from the rest of the commun and so will be apt to increas their own rich and power by take what thei think fit from the peopl for a man properti is not at all secur tho there be good and equit law to set the bound of it between him and hi fellow subject if he who command those subject have power to take from ani privat man what part he pleas of hi properti and us and dispos of it as he think good sect but govern into whatsoev hand it is put be as i have befor shew intrust with thi condit and for thi end that men might have and secur their properti the princ or senat howev it mai have power to make law for the regul of properti between the subject on amongst anoth yet can never have a power to take to themselv the whole or ani part of the subject properti without their own consent for thi would be in effect to leav them no properti at all and to let us see that even absolut power where it is necessari is not arbitrari by be absolut but is still limit by that reason and confin to those end which requir it in some case to be absolut we need look no farther than the common practic of martial disciplin for the preserv of the armi and in it of the whole commonwealth requir an absolut obedi to the command of everi superior offic and it is justli death to disobei or disput the most danger or unreason of them but yet we see that neither the serjeant that could command a soldier to march up to the mouth of a cannon or stand in a breach where he is almost sure to perish can command that soldier to give him on penni of hi monei nor the gener that can condemn him to death for desert hi post or for not obei the most desper order can yet with all hi absolut power of life and death dispos of on farth of that soldier estat or seiz on jot of hi good whom yet he can command ani thing and hang for the least disobedi becaus such a blind obedi is necessari to that end for which the command ha hi power viz the preserv of the rest but the dispos of hi good ha noth to do with it sect it is true govern cannot be support without great charg and it is fit everi on who enjoi hi share of the protect should pai out of hi estat hi proport for the mainten of it but still it must be with hi own consent ie the consent of the major give it either by themselv or their repres chosen by them for if ani on shall claim a power to lai and levi tax on the peopl by hi own author and without such consent of the peopl he therebi invad the fundament law of properti and subvert the end of govern for what properti have i in that which anoth mai by right take when he pleas to himself sect fourthli the legisl cannot transfer the power of make law to ani other hand for it be but a deleg power from the peopl thei who have it cannot pass it over to other the peopl alon can appoint the form of the commonwealth which is by constitut the legisl and appoint in whose hand that shall be and when the peopl have said we will submit to rule and be govern by law made by such men and in such form no bodi els can sai other men shall make law for them nor can the peopl be bound by ani law but such as ar enact by those whom thei have chosen and author to make law for them the power of the legisl be deriv from the peopl by a posit voluntari grant and institut can be no other than what that posit grant convei which be onli to make law and not to make legisl the legisl can have no power to transfer their author of make law and place it in other hand sect these ar the bound which the trust that is put in them by the societi and the law of god and natur have set to the legisl power of everi commonwealth in all form of govern first thei ar to govern by promulg establish law not to be vari in particular case but to have on rule for rich and poor for the favourit at court and the countri man at plough secondli these law also ought to be design for no other end ultim but the good of the peopl thirdli thei must not rais tax on the properti of the peopl without the consent of the peopl given by themselv or their deputi and thi properli concern onli such govern where the legisl is alwai in be or at least where the peopl have not reserv ani part of the legisl to deputi to be from time to time chosen by themselv fourthli the legisl neither must nor can transfer the power of make law to ani bodi els or place it ani where but where the peopl have chapter xii of the legisl execut and feder power of the commonwealth sect the legisl power is that which ha a right to direct how the forc of the commonwealth shall be emploi for preserv the commun and the member of it but becaus those law which ar constantli to be execut and whose forc is alwai to continu mai be made in a littl time therefor there is no need that the legisl should be alwai in be not have alwai busi to do and becaus it mai be too great a temptat to human frailti apt to grasp at power for the same person who have the power of make law to have also in their hand the power to execut them wherebi thei mai exempt themselv from obedi to the law thei make and suit the law both in it make and execut to their own privat advantag and therebi come to have a distinct interest from the rest of the commun contrari to the end of societi and govern therefor in wellord commonwealth where the good of the whole is so consid as it ought the legisl power is put into the hand of diver person who duli assembl have by themselv or jointli with other a power to make law which when thei have done be separ again thei ar themselv subject to the law thei have made which is a new and near tie upon them to take care that thei make them for the public good sect but becaus the law that ar at onc and in a short time made have a constant and last forc and need a perpetu execut or an attend thereunto therefor it is necessari there should be a power alwai in be which should see to the execut of the law that ar made and remain in forc and thu the legisl and execut power come often to be separ sect there is anoth power in everi commonwealth which on mai call natur becaus it is that which answer to the power everi man natur had befor he enter into societi for though in a commonwealth the member of it ar distinct person still in refer to on anoth and as such as govern by the law of the societi yet in refer to the rest of mankind thei make on bodi which is as everi member of it befor wa still in the state of natur with the rest of mankind henc it is that the controversi that happen between ani man of the societi with those that ar out of it ar manag by the public and an injuri done to a member of their bodi engag the whole in the repar of it so that under thi consider the whole commun is on bodi in the state of natur in respect of all other state or person out of it commun sect thi therefor contain the power of war and peac leagu and allianc and all the transact with all person and commun without the commonwealth and mai be call feder if ani on pleas so the thing be understood i am indiffer as to the name sect these two power execut and feder though thei be realli distinct in themselv yet on comprehend the execut of the municip law of the societi within it self upon all that ar part of it the other the manag of the secur and interest of the public without with all those that it mai receiv benefit or damag from yet thei ar alwai almost unit and though thi feder power in the well or ill manag of it be of great moment to the commonwealth yet it is much less capabl to be direct by anteced stand posit law than the execut and so must necessarili be left to the prudenc and wisdom of those whose hand it is in to be manag for the public good for the law that concern subject on amongst anoth be to direct their action mai well enough preced them but what is to be done in refer to foreign depend much upon their action and the variat of design and interest must be left in great part to the prudenc of those who have thi power commit to them to be manag by the best of their skill for the advantag of the commonwealth sect though as i said the execut and feder power of everi commun be realli distinct in themselv yet thei ar hardli to be separ and place at the same time in the hand of distinct person for both of them requir the forc of the societi for their exercis it is almost impractic to place the forc of the commonwealth in distinct and not subordin hand or that the execut and feder power should be place in person that might act separ wherebi the forc of the public would be under differ command which would be apt some time or other to caus disord and ruin chapter xiii of the subordin of the power of the commonwealth sect though in a constitut commonwealth stand upon it own basi and act accord to it own natur that is act for the preserv of the commun there can be but on suprem power which is the legisl to which all the rest ar and must be subordin yet the legisl be onli a fiduciari power to act for certain end there remain still in the peopl a suprem power to remov or alter the legisl when thei find the legisl act contrari to the trust repos in them for all power given with trust for the attain an end be limit by that end whenev that end is manifestli neglect or oppos the trust must necessarili be forfeit and the power devolv into the hand of those that gave it who mai place it anew where thei shall think best for their safeti and secur and thu the commun perpetu retain a suprem power of save themselv from the attempt and design of ani bodi even of their legisl whenev thei shall be so foolish or so wick as to lai and carri on design against the liberti and properti of the subject for no man or societi of men have a power to deliv up their preserv or consequ the mean of it to the absolut will and arbitrari dominion of anoth when ever ani on shall go about to bring them into such a slavish condit thei will alwai have a right to preserv what thei have not a power to part with and to rid themselv of those who invad thi fundament sacr and unalter law of selfpreserv for which thei enter into societi and thu the commun mai be said in thi respect to be alwai the suprem power but not as consid under ani form of govern becaus thi power of the peopl can

no otherwis legisl of the societi but by the right it ha to make law for all the part and for everi member of the societi prescrib rule to their action and give power of execut where thei ar transgress the legisl must need be the suprem and all other power in ani member or part of the societi deriv from and subordin to it sect in some commonwealth where the legisl is not alwai in be and the execut is vest in a singl person who ha also a share in the legisl there that singl person in a veri toler sens mai also be call suprem not that he ha in himself all the suprem power which is that of lawmak but becaus he ha in him the suprem execut from whom all inferior magistr deriv all their sever subordin power or at least the greatest part of them have also no legisl superior to him there be no law to be made without hi consent which cannot be expect should ever subject him to the other part of the legisl he is properli enough in thi sens suprem but yet it is to be observ that tho oath of allegi and fealti ar taken to him it is not to him as suprem legisl but as suprem executor of the law made by a joint power of him with other allegi be noth but an obedi accord to law which when he violat he ha no right to obedi nor can claim it otherwis than as the public person vest with the power of the law and so is to be consid as the imag phantom or repres of the commonwealth act by the will of the societi declar in it law and thu he ha no will no power but that of the law but when he quit thi represent thi public will and act by hi own privat will he degrad himself and is but a singl privat person without power and without will that ha ani right to obedi the member ow no obedi but to the public will of the societi sect the execut power place ani where but in a person that ha also a share in the legisl is visibl subordin and account to it and mai be at pleasur chang and displac so that it is not the suprem execut power that is exempt from subordin but the suprem execut power vest in on who have a share in the legisl ha no distinct superior legisl to be subordin and account to farther than he himself shall join and consent so that he is no more subordin than he himself shall think fit which on mai certainli conclud will be but veri littl of other ministeri and subordin power in a commonwealth we need not speak thei be so multipli with infinit varieti in the differ custom and constitut of distinct commonwealth that it is imposs to give a particular account of them all onli thu much which is necessari to our present purpos we mai take notic of concern them that thei have no manner of author ani of them beyond what is by posit grant and commiss deleg to them and ar all of them account to some other power in the commonwealth sect it is not necessari no nor so much as conveni that the legisl should be alwai in be but absolut necessari that the execut power should becaus there is not alwai need of new law to be made but alwai need of execut of the law that ar made when the legisl hath put the execut of the law thei make into other hand thei have a power still to resum it out of those hand when thei find caus and to punish for ani maladministr against the law the same hold also in regard of the feder power that and the execut be both ministeri and subordin to the legisl which as ha been shew in a constitut commonwealth is the suprem the legisl also in thi case be suppos to consist of sever person for if it be a singl person it cannot but be alwai in be and so will as suprem natur have the suprem execut power togeth with the legisl mai assembl and exercis their legislatur at the time that either their origin constitut or their own adjourn appoint or when thei pleas if neither of these hath appoint ani time or there be no other wai prescrib to convok them for the suprem power be place in them by the peopl it is alwai in them and thei mai exercis it when thei pleas unless by their origin constitut thei ar limit to certain season or by an act of their suprem power thei have adjourn to a certain time and when that time come thei have a right to assembl and act again sect if the legisl or ani part of it be made up of repres chosen for that time by the peopl which afterward return into the ordinari state of subject and have no share in the legislatur but upon a new choic thi power of chuse must also be exercis by the peopl either at certain appoint season or els when thei ar summon to it and in thi latter case the power of convok the legisl is ordinarili place in the execut and ha on of these two limit in respect of time that either the origin constitut requir their assembl and act at certain interv and then the execut power doe noth but ministeri issu direct for their elect and assembl accord to due form or els it is left to hi prudenc to call them by new elect when the occas or exig of the public requir the amend of old or make of new law or the redress or prevent of ani inconveni that lie on or

forc from what is so necessari to the societi and wherein the safeti and preserv of the peopl consist the peopl have a right to remov it by forc in all state and condit the true remedi of forc without author is to oppos forc to it the us of forc without author alwai put him that us it into a state of war as the aggressor and render him liabl to be treat accordingli sect the power of assembl and dismiss the legisl place in the execut give not the execut a superior over it but is a fiduciari trust place in him for the safeti of the peopl in a case where the uncertainti and variabl of human affair could not bear a steadi fix rule for it not be possibl that the first framer of the govern should by ani foresight be so much master of futur event as to be abl to prefix so just period of return and durat to the assembl of the legisl in all time to come that might exactli answer all the exig of the commonwealth the best remedi could be found for thi defect wa to trust thi to the prudenc of on who wa alwai to be present and whose busi it wa to watch over the public good constant frequent meet of the legisl and long continu of their assembl without necessari occas could not but be burdensom to the peopl and must necessarili in time produc more danger inconveni and yet the quick turn of affair might be sometim such as to need their present help ani delai of their conven might endang the public and sometim too their busi might be so great that the limit time of their sit might be too short for their work and rob the public of that benefit which could be had onli from their matur deliber what then could be done in thi case to prevent the commun from be expos some time or other to emin hazard on on side or the other by fix interv and period set to the meet and act of the legisl but to intrust it to the prudenc of some who be present and acquaint with the state of public affair might make us of thi prerog for the public good and where els could thi be so well place as in hi hand who wa intrust with the execut of the law for the same end thu suppos the regul of time for the assembl and sit of the legisl not settl by the origin constitut it natur fell into the hand of the execut not as an arbitrari power depend on hi good pleasur but with thi trust alwai to have it exercis onli for the public weal as the occurr of time and chang of affair might requir whether settl period of their conven or a liberti left to the princ for convok the legisl or perhap a mixtur of both hath the least inconveni attend it it is not my busi here to inquir but onli to shew that though the execut power mai have the prerog of convok and dissolv such convent of the legisl yet it is not therebi superior to it sect thing of thi world ar in so constant a flux that noth remain long in the same state thu peopl rich trade power chang their station flourish mighti citi come to ruin and prove in time neglect desol corner whilst other unfrequ place grow into popul countri fill with wealth and inhabit but thing not alwai chang equal and privat interest often keep up custom and privileg when the reason of them ar ceas it often come to pass that in govern where part of the legisl consist of repres chosen by the peopl that in tract of time thi represent becom veri unequ and disproportion to the reason it wa at first establish upon to what gross absurd the follow of custom when

to be found send as mani repres to the grand assembl of lawmak as a whole counti numer in peopl and power in rich thi stranger stand amaz at and everi on must confess need a remedi tho most think it hard to find on becaus the constitut of the legisl be the origin and suprem act of the societi anteced to all posit law in it and depend wholli on the peopl no inferior power can alter it and therefor the peopl when the legisl is onc constitut have in such a govern as we have been speak of no power to act as long as the govern stand thi inconveni is thought incap of a remedi sect salu populi suprema lex is certainli so just and fundament a rule that he who sincer follow it cannot danger err if therefor the execut who ha the power of convok the legisl observ rather the true proport than

origin frame of the govern it cannot be doubt to be the will and act of the societi whoever permit or caus them so to do chapter xiv of prerog sect where the legisl and execut power ar in distinct hand as thei ar in all moder monarchi and wellfram govern there the good of the societi requir that sever thing should be left to the discret of him that ha the execut power for the legisl not be abl to forese and provid by law for all that mai be us to the commun the executor of the law have the power in hi hand ha by the common law of natur a right to make us of it for the good of the societi in mani case where the municip law ha given no direct till the legisl can conveni be assembl to provid for it mani thing there ar which the law can by no mean provid for and those must necessarili be left to the discret of him that ha the execut power in hi hand to be order by him as the public good and advantag shall requir nai it is fit that the law themselv should in some case give wai to the execut power or rather to thi fundament law of natur and govern viz that as much as mai be all the member of the societi ar to be preserv for sinc mani accid mai happen wherein a strict and rigid observ of the law mai do harm as not to pull down an innoc man hous to stop the fire when the next to it is burn and a man mai come sometim within the reach of the law which make no distinct of person by an action that mai deserv reward and pardon ti fit the ruler should have a power in mani case to mitig the sever of the law and pardon some offend for the end of govern be the preserv of all as much as mai be even the guilti ar to be spare where it can prove no prejudic to the innoc sect thi power to act accord to discret for the public good without the prescript of the law and sometim even against it is that which is call prerog for sinc in some govern the lawmak power is not alwai in be and is usual too numer and so too slow for the dispatch requisit to execut and becaus also it is imposs to forese and so by law to provid for all accid and necess that mai concern the public or to make such law as will do no harm if thei ar execut with an inflex rigour on all occas and upon all person that mai come in their wai therefor there is a latitud left to the execut power to do mani thing of choic which the law do not prescrib sect thi power whilst emploi for the benefit of the commun and suitabl to the trust and end of the govern is undoubt prerog and never is question for the peopl ar veri seldom or never scrupul or nice in the point thei ar far from examin prerog whilst it is in ani toler degre emploi for the us it wa meant that is for the good of the peopl and not manifestli against it but if there come to be a question between the execut power and the peopl about a thing claim as a prerog the tendenc of the exercis of such prerog to the good or hurt of the peopl will easili decid that question sect it is easi to conceiv that in the infanc of govern when commonwealth differ littl from famili in number of peopl thei differ from them too but littl in number of law and the governor be as the father of them watch over them for their good the govern wa almost all prerog a few establish law serv the turn and the discret and care of the ruler suppli the rest but when mistak or flatteri prevail with weak princ to make us of thi power for privat end of their own and not for the public good the peopl were fain by express law to get prerog determin in those point wherein thei found disadvantag from it and thu declar limit of prerog were by the peopl found necessari in case which thei and their ancestor had left in the utmost latitud to the wisdom of those princ who made no other but a right us of it that is for the good of their peopl sect and therefor thei have a veri wrong notion of govern who sai that the peopl have encroach upon the prerog when thei have got ani part of it to be defin by posit law for in so do thei have not pull from the princ ani thing that of right belong to him but onli declar that that power which thei indefinit left in hi or hi ancestor hand to be exercis for their good wa not a thing which thei intend him when he us it otherwis for the end of govern be the good of the commun whatsoev alter ar made in it tend to that end cannot be an encroach upon ani bodi sinc no bodi in govern can have a right tend to ani other end and those onli ar encroach which prejudic or hinder the public good those who sai otherwis speak as if the princ had a distinct and separ interest from the good of the commun and wa not made for it the root and sourc from which spring almost all those evil and disord which happen in kingli govern and inde if that be so the peopl under hi govern ar not a societi of ration creatur enter into a commun for their mutual good thei ar not such as have set ruler over themselv to guard and promot that good but ar to be look on as an herd of inferior creatur under the dominion of a master who keep them and work them for hi own pleasur or profit if men were so void of reason and brutish as to enter into societi upon such term prerog might inde be what some men would have it an arbitrari power to do thing hurt to the peopl sect but sinc a ration creatur cannot be suppos when free to put himself into subject to anoth for hi own harm though where he find a good and wise ruler he mai not perhap think it either necessari or us to set precis bound to hi power in all thing prerog can be noth but the peopl permit their ruler to do sever thing of their own free choic where the law wa silent and sometim too against the direct letter of the law for the public good and their acquiesc in it when so done for as a good princ who is mind of the trust put into hi hand and care of the good of hi peopl cannot have too much prerog that is power to do good so a weak and ill princ who would claim that power which hi predecessor exercis without the direct of the law as a prerog belong to him by right of hi offic which he mai exercis at hi pleasur to make or promot an interest distinct from that of the public give the peopl an occas to claim their right and limit that power which whilst it wa exercis for their good thei were content should be tacitli allow sect and therefor he that will look into the histori of england will find that prerog wa alwai largest in the hand of our wisest and best princ becaus the peopl observ the whole tendenc of their action to be the public good contest not what wa done without law to that end or if ani human frailti or mistak for princ ar but men made as other appear in some small declin from that end yet twa visibl the main of their conduct tend to noth but the care of the public the peopl therefor find reason to be satisfi with these princ whenev thei act without or contrari to the letter of the law acquiesc in what thei did and without the least complaint let them inlarg their prerog as thei pleas judg rightli that thei did noth herein to the prejudic of their law sinc thei act conform to the foundat and end of all law the public good sect such godlik princ inde had some titl to arbitrari power by that argument that would prove absolut monarchi the best govern as that which god himself govern the univers by becaus such king partak of hi wisdom and good upon thi is found that sai that the reign of good princ have been alwai most danger to the liberti of their peopl for when their successor manag the govern with differ thought would draw the action of those good ruler into preced and make them the standard of their prerog as if what had been done onli for the good of the peopl wa a right in them to do for the harm of the peopl if thei so pleas it ha often occas contest and sometim public disord befor the peopl could recov their origin right and get that to be declar not to be prerog which truli wa never so sinc it is imposs that ani bodi in the societi should ever have a right to do the peopl harm though it be veri possibl and reason that the peopl should not go about to set ani bound to the prerog of those king or ruler who themselv transgress not the bound of the public good for prerog is noth but the power of do public good without a rule sect the power of call parliament in england as to precis time place and durat is certainli a prerog of the king but still with thi trust that it shall be made us of for the good of the nation as the exig of the time and varieti of occas shall requir for it be imposs to forese which should alwai be the fittest place for them to assembl in and what the best season the choic of these wa left with the execut power as might be most subservi to the public good and best suit the end of parliament sect the old question will be ask in thi matter of prerog but who shall be judg when thi power is made a right us of on answer between an execut power in be with such a prerog and a legisl that depend upon hi will for their conven there can be no judg on earth as there can be none between the legisl and the peopl should either the execut or the legisl when thei have got the power in their hand design or go about to enslav or destroi them the peopl have no other remedi in thi as in all other case where thei have no judg on earth but to appeal to heaven for the ruler in such attempt exercis a power the peopl never put into their hand who can never be suppos to consent that ani bodi should rule over them for their harm do that which thei have not a right to do and where the bodi of the peopl or ani singl man is depriv of their right or is under the exercis of a power without right and have no appeal on earth then thei have a liberti to appeal to heaven whenev thei judg the caus of suffici moment and therefor though the peopl cannot be judg so as to have by the constitut of that societi ani superior power to determin and give effect sentenc in the case yet thei have by a law anteced and paramount to all posit law of men reserv that ultim determin to themselv which belong to all mankind where there li no appeal on earth viz to judg whether thei have just caus to make their appeal to heaven and thi judgment thei cannot part with it be out of a man power so to submit himself to anoth as to give him a liberti to destroi him god and natur never allow a man so to abandon himself as to neglect hi own preserv and sinc he cannot take awai hi own life neither can he give anoth power to take it nor let ani on think thi lai a perpetu foundat for disord for thi oper not till the inconveni is so great that the major feel it and ar weari of it and find a necess to have it amend but thi the execut power or wise princ never need come in the danger of and it is the thing of all other thei have most need to avoid as of all other the most peril chapter xv of patern polit and despot power consid togeth sect though i have had occas to speak of these separ befor yet the great mistak of late about govern have as i suppos arisen from confound these distinct power on with anoth it mai not perhap be amiss to consid them here togeth sect first then patern or parent power is noth but that which parent have over their children to govern them for the children good till thei come to the us of reason or a state of knowledg wherein thei mai be suppos capabl to understand that rule whether it be the law of natur or the municip law of their countri thei ar to govern themselv by capabl i sai to know it as well as sever other who live as freemen under that law the affect and tender which god hath plant in the breast of parent toward their children make it evid that thi is not intend to be a sever arbitrari govern but onli for the help instruct and preserv of their offspr but happen it as it will there is as i have prove no reason why it should be thought to extend to life and death at ani time over their children more than over ani bodi els neither can there be ani pretenc why thi parent power should keep the child when grown to a man in subject to the will of hi parent ani farther than have receiv life and educ from hi parent oblig him to respect honour gratitud assist and support all hi life to both father and mother and thu ti true the patern is a natur govern but not at all extend itself to the end and jurisdict of that which is polit the power of the father doth not reach at all to the properti of the child which is onli in hi own dispos sect secondli polit power is that power which everi man have in the state of natur ha given up into the hand of the societi and therein to the governor whom the societi hath set over itself with thi express or tacit trust that it shall be emploi for their good and the preserv of their properti now thi power which everi man ha in the state of natur and which he part with to the societi in all such case where the societi can secur him is to us such mean for the preserv of hi own properti as he think good and natur allow him and to punish the breach of the law of natur in other so as accord to the best of hi reason mai most conduc to the preserv of himself and the rest of mankind so that the end and measur of thi power when in everi man hand in the state of natur be the preserv of all of hi societi that is all mankind in gener it can have no other end or measur when in the hand of the magistr but to preserv the member of that societi in their live liberti and possess and so cannot be an absolut arbitrari power over their live and fortun which ar as much as possibl to be preserv but a power to make law and annex such penalti to them as mai tend to the preserv of the whole by cut off those part and those onli which ar so corrupt that thei threaten the sound and healthi without which no sever is law and thi power ha it origin onli from compact and agreement and the mutual consent of those who make up the commun sect thirdli despot power is an absolut arbitrari power on man ha over anoth to take awai hi life whenev he pleas thi is a power which neither natur give for it ha made no such distinct between on man and anoth nor compact can convei for man not have such an arbitrari power over hi own life cannot give anoth man such a power over it but it is the effect onli of forfeitur which the aggressor make of hi own life when he put himself into the state of war with anoth for have quit reason which god hath given to be the rule betwixt man and man and the common bond wherebi human kind is unit into on fellowship and societi and have renounc the wai of peac which that teach and made us of the forc of war to compass hi unjust end upon anoth where he ha no right and so revolt from hi own kind to that of beast by make forc which is their to be hi rule of right he render himself liabl to be destroi by the injur person and the rest of mankind that will join with him in the execut of justic as ani other wild beast or noxiou brute with whom mankind can have neither societi nor secur and thu captiv taken in a just and law war and such onli ar subject to a despot power which as it aris not from compact so neither is it capabl of ani but is the state of war continu for what compact can be made with a man that is not master of hi own life what condit can he perform and if he be onc allow to be master of hi own life the despot arbitrari power of hi master ceas he that is master of himself and hi own life ha a right too to the mean of preserv it so that as soon as compact enter slaveri ceas and he so far quit hi absolut power and put an end to the state of war who enter into condit with hi captiv anoth copi correct by mr lock ha it thu noxiou brute that is destruct to their be sect natur give the first of these viz patern power to parent for the benefit of their children dure their minor to suppli their want of abil and understand how to manag their properti by properti i must be understood here as in other place to mean that properti which men have in their person as well as good voluntari agreement give the second viz polit power to governor for the benefit of their subject to secur them in the possess and us of their properti and forfeitur give the third despot power to lord for their own benefit over those who ar strip of all properti sect he that shall consid the distinct rise and extent and the differ end of these sever power will plainli see that patern power come as far short of that of the magistr as despot exce it and that absolut dominion howev place is so far from be on kind of civil societi that it is as inconsist with it as slaveri is with properti patern power is onli where minor make the child incap to manag hi properti polit where men have properti in their own dispos and despot over such as have no properti at all chapter xvi of conquest sect though govern can origin have no other rise than that befor mention nor politi be found on ani thing but the consent of the peopl yet such have been the disord ambit ha fill the world with that in the nois of war which make so great a part of the histori of mankind thi consent is littl taken notic of and therefor mani have mistaken the forc of arm for the consent of the peopl and reckon conquest as on of the origin of govern but conquest is as far from set up ani govern as demolish an hous is from build a new on in the place inde it often make wai for a new frame of a commonwealth by destroi the former but without the consent of the peopl can never erect a new on sect that the aggressor who put himself into the state of war with anoth and unjustli invad anoth man right can by such an unjust war never come to have a right over the conquer will be easili agre by all men who will not think that robber and pyrat have a right of empir over whomsoev thei have forc enough to master or that men ar bound by promis which unlaw forc extort from them should a robber break into my hous and with a dagger at my throat make me seal deed to convei my estat to him would thi give him ani titl just such a titl by hi sword ha an unjust conqueror who forc me into submiss the injuri and the crime is equal whether commit by the wearer of a crown or some petti villain the titl of the offend and the number of hi follow make no differ in the offenc unless it be to aggrav it the onli differ is great robber punish littl on to keep them in their obedi but the great on ar reward with laurel and triumph becaus thei ar too big for the weak hand of justic in thi world and have the power in their own possess which should punish offend what is my remedi against a robber that so broke into my hous appeal to the law for justic but perhap justic is deni or i am crippl and cannot stir rob and have not the mean to do it if god ha taken awai all mean of seek remedi there is noth left but patienc but my son when abl mai seek the relief of the law which i am deni he or hi son mai renew hi appeal till he recov hi right but the conquer or their children have no court no arbitr on earth to appeal to then thei mai appeal as jephtha did to heaven and repeat their appeal till thei have recov the nativ right of their ancestor which wa to have such a legisl over them as the major should approv and freeli acquiesc in if it be object thi would caus endless troubl i answer no more than justic doe where she li open to all that appeal to her he that troubl hi neighbour without a caus is punish for it by the justic of the court he appeal to and he that appeal to heaven must be sure he ha right on hi side and a right too that is worth the troubl and cost of the appeal as he will answer at a tribun that cannot be deceiv and will be sure to retribut to everi on accord to the mischief he hath creat to hi fellow subject that is ani part of mankind from whenc it is plain that he that conquer in an unjust war can therebi have no titl to the subject and obedi of the conquer sect but suppos victori favour the right side let us consid a conqueror in a law war and see what power he get and over whom first it is plain he get no power by hi conquest over those that conquer with him thei that fought on hi side cannot suffer by the conquest but must at least be as much freemen as thei were befor and most commonli thei serv upon term and on condit to share with their leader and enjoi a part of the spoil and other advantag that attend the conquer sword or at least have a part of the subdu countri bestow upon them and the conquer peopl ar not i hope to be slave by conquest and wear their laurel onli to shew thei ar sacrific to their leader triumph thei that found absolut monarchi upon the titl of the sword make their hero who ar the founder of such monarchi arrant drawcansir and forget thei had ani offic and soldier that fought on their side in the battl thei won or assist them in the subdu or share in possess the countri thei master we ar told by some that the english monarchi is found in the norman conquest and that our princ have therebi a titl to absolut dominion which if it were true as by the histori it appear otherwis and that william had a right to make war on thi island yet hi dominion by conquest could reach no farther than to the saxon and briton that were then inhabit of thi countri the norman that came with him and help to conquer and all descend from them ar freemen and no subject by conquest let that give what dominion it will and if i or ani bodi els shall claim freedom as deriv from them it will be veri hard to prove the contrari and it is plain the law that ha made no distinct between the on and the other intend not there should be ani differ in their freedom or privileg sect but suppos which seldom happen that the conqueror and conquer never incorpor into on peopl under the same law and freedom let us see next what power a law conqueror ha over the subdu and that i sai is pure despot he ha an absolut power over the live of those who by an unjust war have forfeit them but not over the live or fortun of those who engag not in the war nor over the possess even of those who were actual engag in it sect secondli i sai then the conqueror get no power but onli over those who have actual assist concur or consent to that unjust forc that is us against him for the peopl have given to their governor no power to do an unjust thing such as is to make an unjust war for thei never had such a power in themselv thei ought not to be charg as guilti of the violenc and unjustic that is commit in an unjust war ani farther than thei actual abet it no more than thei ar to be thought guilti of ani violenc or oppress their governor should us upon the peopl themselv or ani part of their fellow subject thei have empow them no more to the on than to the other conqueror it is true seldom troubl themselv to make the distinct but thei willingli permit the confus of war to sweep all togeth but yet thi alter not the right for the conqueror power over the live of the conquer be onli becaus thei have us forc to do or maintain an injustic he can have that power onli over those who have concur in that forc all the rest ar innoc and he ha no more titl over the peopl of that countri who have done him no injuri and so have made no forfeitur of their live than he ha over ani other who without ani injuri or provoc have live upon fair term with him sect thirdli the power a conqueror get over those he overcom in a just war is perfectli despot he ha an absolut power over the live of those who by put themselv in a state of war have forfeit them but he ha not therebi a right and titl to their possess thi i doubt not but at first sight will seem a strang doctrin it be so quit contrari to the practic of the world there be noth more familiar in speak of the dominion of countri than to sai such an on conquer it as if conquest without ani more ado convei a right of possess but when we consid that the practic of the strong and power how univers soever it mai be is seldom the rule of right howev it be on part of the subject of the conquer not to argu against the condit cut out to them by the conquer sword sect though in all war there be usual a complic of forc and damag and the aggressor seldom fail to harm the estat when he us forc against the person of those he make war upon yet it is the us of forc onli that put a man into the state of war for whether by forc he begin the injuri or els have quietli and by fraud done the injuri he refus to make repar and by forc maintain it which is the same thing as at first to have done it by forc it is the unjust us of forc that make the war for he that break open my hous and violent turn me out of door or have peaceabl got in by forc keep me out doe in effect the same thing suppos we ar in such a state that we have no common judg on earth whom i mai appeal to and to whom we ar both oblig to submit for of such i am now speak it is the unjust us of forc then that put a man into the state of war with anoth and therebi he that is guilti of it make a forfeitur of hi life for quit reason which is the rule given between man and man and us forc the wai of beast he becom liabl to be destroi by him he us forc against as ani savag raven beast that is danger to hi be sect but becaus the miscarriag of the father ar no fault of the children and thei mai be ration and peaceabl notwithstand the brutish and injustic of the father the father by hi miscarriag and violenc can forfeit but hi own life but involv not hi children in hi guilt or destruct hi good which natur that willeth the preserv of all mankind as much as is possibl hath made to belong to the children to keep them from perish do still continu to belong to hi children for suppos them not to have join in the war either thro infanc absenc or choic thei have done noth to forfeit them nor ha the conqueror ani right to take them awai by the bare titl of have subdu him that by forc attempt hi destruct though perhap he mai have some right to them to repair the damag he ha sustain by the war and the defenc of hi own right which how far it reach to the possess of the conquer we shall see by and by so that he that by conquest ha a right over a man person to destroi him if he pleas ha not therebi a right over hi estat to possess and enjoi it for it is the brutal forc the aggressor ha us that give hi adversari a right to take awai hi life and destroi him if he pleas as a noxiou creatur but it is damag sustain that alon give him titl to anoth man good for though i mai kill a thief that set on me in the highwai yet i mai not which seem less take awai hi monei and let him go thi would be robberi on my side hi forc and the state of war he put himself in made him forfeit hi life but gave me no titl to hi good the right then of conquest extend onli to the live of those who join in the war not to their estat but onli in order to make repar for the damag receiv and the charg of the war and that too with reserv of the right of the innoc wife and children sect let the conqueror have as much justic on hi side as could be suppos he ha no right to seiz more than the vanquish could forfeit hi life is at the victor merci and hi servic and good he mai appropri to make himself repar but he cannot take the good of hi wife and children thei too had a titl to the good he enjoi and their share in the estat he possess for exampl i in the state of natur and all commonwealth ar in the state of natur on with anoth have injur anoth man and refus to give satisfact it come to a state of war wherein my defend by forc what i had gotten unjustli make me the aggressor i am conquer my life it is true as forfeit is at merci but not my wife and children thei made not the war nor assist in it i could not forfeit their live thei were not mine to forfeit my wife had a share in my estat that neither could i forfeit and my children also be born of me had a right to be maintain out of my labour or substanc here then is the case the conqueror ha a titl to repar for damag receiv and the children have a titl to their father estat for their subsist for as to the wife share whether her own labour or compact gave her a titl to it it is plain her husband could not forfeit what wa her what must be done in the case i answer the fundament law of natur be that all as much as mai be should be preserv it follow that if there be not enough fulli to satisfi both viz for the conqueror loss and children mainten he that hath and to spare must remit someth of hi full satisfact and give wai to the press and prefer titl of those who ar in danger to perish without it sect but suppos the charg and damag of the war ar to be made up to the conqueror to the utmost farth and that the children of the vanquish spoil of all their father good ar to be left to starv and perish yet the satisfi of what shall on thi score be due to the conqueror will scarc give him a titl to ani countri he shall conquer for the damag of war can scarc amount to the valu of ani consider tract of land in ani part of the world where all the land is possess and none li wast and if i have not taken awai the conqueror land which be vanquish it is imposs i should scarc ani other spoil i have done him can amount to the valu of mine suppos it equal cultiv and of an extent ani wai come near what i had overrun of hi the destruct of a year product or two for it seldom reach four or five is the utmost spoil that usual can be done for as to monei and such rich and treasur taken awai these ar none of natur good thei have but a fantast imaginari valu natur ha put no such upon them thei ar of no more account by her standard than the wampompek of the american to an european princ or the silver monei of europ would have been formerli to an american and five year product is not worth the perpetu inherit of land where all is possess and none remain wast to be taken up by him that is disseiz which will be easili grant if on do but take awai the imaginari valu of monei the disproport be more than between five and five hundr though at the same time half a year product is more worth than the inherit where there be more land than the inhabit possess and make us of ani on ha liberti to make us of the wast but there conqueror take littl care to possess themselv of the land of the vanquish no damag therefor that men in the state of natur as all princ and govern ar in refer to on anoth suffer from on anoth can give a conqueror power to dispossess the poster of the vanquish and turn them out of that inherit which ought to be the possess of them and their descend to all gener the conqueror inde will be apt to think himself master and it is the veri condit of the subdu not to be abl to disput their right but if that be all it give no other titl than what bare forc give to the stronger over the weaker and by thi reason he that is strongest will have a right to whatev he pleas to seiz on sect over those then that join with him in the war and over those of the subdu countri that oppos him not and the poster even of those that did the conqueror even in a just war hath by hi conquest no right of dominion thei ar free from ani subject to him and if their former govern be dissolv thei ar at liberti to begin and erect anoth to themselv sect the conqueror it is true usual by the forc he ha over them compel them with a sword at their breast to stoop to hi condit and submit to such a govern as he pleas to afford them but the enquiri is what right he ha to do so if it be said thei submit by their own consent then thi allow their own consent to be necessari to give the conqueror a titl to rule over them it remain onli to be consid whether promis extort by forc without right can be thought consent and how far thei bind to which i shall sai thei bind not at all becaus whatsoev anoth get from me by forc i still retain the right of and he is oblig present to restor he that forc my hors from me ought present to restor him and i have still a right to retak him by the same reason he that forc a promis from me ought present to restor it ie quit me of the oblig of it or i mai resum it myself ie chuse whether i will perform it for the law of natur lai an oblig on me onli by the rule she prescrib cannot oblig me by the violat of her rule such is the extort ani thing from me by forc nor doe it at all alter the case to sai i gave my promis no more than it excus the forc and pass the right when i put my hand in my pocket and deliv my purs myself to a thief who demand it with a pistol at my breast sect from all which it follow that the govern of a conqueror impos by forc on the subdu against whom he had no right of war or who join not in the war against him where he had right ha no oblig upon them sect but let us suppos that all the men of that commun be all member of the same bodi polit mai be taken to have join in that unjust war wherein thei ar subdu and so their live ar at the merci of the conqueror sect i sai thi concern not their children who ar in their minor for sinc a father hath not in himself a power over the life or liberti of hi child no act of hi can possibl forfeit it so that the children whatev mai have happen to the father ar freemen and the absolut power of the conqueror reach no farther than the person of the men that were subdu by him and di with them and should he govern them as slave subject to hi absolut arbitrari power he ha no such right of dominion over their children he can have no power over them but by their own consent whatev he mai drive them to sai or do and he ha no lawful author whilst forc and not choic compel them to submiss sect everi man is born with a doubl right first a right of freedom to hi person which no other man ha a power over but the free dispos of it li in himself secondli a right befor ani other man to inherit with hi brethren hi father good sect by the first of these a man is natur free from subject to ani govern tho he be born in a place under it jurisdict but if he disclaim the law govern of the countri he wa born in he must also quit the right that belong to him by the law of it and the possess there descend to him from hi ancestor if it were a govern made by their consent sect by the second the inhabit of ani countri who ar descend and deriv a titl to their estat from those who ar subdu and had a govern forc upon them against their free consent retain a right to the possess of their ancestor though thei consent not freeli to the govern whose hard condit were by forc impos on the possessor of that countri for the first conqueror never have had a titl to the land of that countri the peopl who ar the descend of or claim under those who were forc to submit to the yoke of a govern by constraint have alwai a right to shake it off and free themselv from the usurp or tyranni which the sword hath brought in upon them till their ruler put them under such a frame of govern as thei willingli and of choic consent to who doubt but the grecian christian descend of the ancient possessor of that countri mai justli cast off the turkish yoke which thei have so long groan under whenev thei have an opportun to do it for no govern can have a right to obedi from a peopl who have not freeli consent to it which thei can never be suppos to do till either thei ar put in a full state of liberti to chuse their govern and governor or at least till thei have such stand law to which thei have by themselv or their repres given their free consent and also till thei ar allow their due properti which is so to be proprietor of what thei have that no bodi can take awai ani part of it without their own consent without which men under ani govern ar not in the state of freemen but ar direct slave under the forc of war sect but grant that the conqueror in a just war ha a right to the estat as well as power over the person of the conquer which it is plain he hath not noth of absolut power will follow from henc in the continu of the govern becaus the descend of these be all freemen if he grant them estat and possess to inhabit hi countri without which it would be worth noth whatsoev he grant them thei have so far as it is grant properti in the natur whereof is that without a man own consent it cannot be taken from him sect their person ar free by a nativ right and their properti be thei more or less ar their own and at their own dispos and not at hi or els it is no properti suppos the conqueror give to on man a thousand acr to him and hi heir for ever to anoth he let a thousand acr for hi life under the rent of l or l per ann ha not the on of these a right to hi thousand acr for ever and the other dure hi life pai the said rent and hath not the tenant for life a properti in all that he get over and abov hi rent by hi labour and industri dure the said term suppos it be doubl the rent can ani on sai the king or conqueror after hi grant mai by hi power of conqueror take awai all or part of the land from the heir of on or from the other dure hi life he pai the rent or can he take awai from either the good or monei thei have got upon the said land at hi pleasur if he can then all free and voluntari contract ceas and ar void in the world there need noth to dissolv them at ani time but power enough and all the grant and promis of men in power ar but mockeri and collus for can there be ani thing more ridicul than to sai i give you and your thi for ever and that in the surest and most solemn wai of convey can be devis and yet it is to be understood that i have right if i pleas to take it awai from you again to morrow sect i will not disput now whether princ ar exempt from the law of their countri but thi i am sure thei ow subject to the law of god and natur no bodi no power can exempt them from the oblig of that etern law those ar so great and so strong in the case of promis that omnipot itself can be ti by them grant promis and oath ar bond that hold the almighti whatev some flatter sai to princ of the world who all togeth with all their peopl join to them ar in comparison of the great god but as a drop of the bucket or a dust on the balanc inconsider noth sect the short of the case in conquest is thi the conqueror if he have a just caus ha a despot right over the person of all that actual aid and concur in the war against him and a right to make up hi damag and cost out of their labour and estat so he injur not the right of ani other over the rest of the peopl if there were ani that consent not to the war and over the children of the captiv themselv or the possess of either he ha no power and so can have by virtu of conquest no law titl himself to dominion over them or deriv it to hi poster but is an aggressor if he attempt upon their properti and therebi put himself in a state of war against them and ha no better a right of princip he nor ani of hi successor than hingar or hubba the dane had here in england or spartacu had he conquer itali would have had which is to have their yoke cast off as soon as god shall give those under their subject courag and opportun to do it thu notwithstand whatev titl the king of assyria had over judah by the sword god assist hezekiah to throw off the dominion of that conquer empir and the lord wa with hezekiah and he prosper wherefor he went forth and he rebel against the king of assyria and serv him not king xviii whenc it is plain that shake off a power which forc and not right hath set over ani on though it hath the name of rebellion yet is no offenc befor god but is that which he allow and counten though even promis and coven when obtain by forc have interven for it is veri probabl to ani on that read the stori of ahaz and hezekiah attent that the assyrian subdu ahaz and depos him and made hezekiah king in hi father lifetim and that hezekiah by agreement had done him homag and paid him tribut all thi time chapter xvii of usurp sect as conquest mai be call a foreign usurp so usurp is a kind of domest conquest with thi differ that an usurp can never have right on hi side it be no usurp but where on is got into the possess of what anoth ha right to thi so far as it is usurp is a chang onli of person but not of the form and rule of the govern for if the usurp extend hi power beyond what of right belong to the law princ or governor of the commonwealth it is tyranni ad to usurp sect in all law govern the design of the person who ar to bear rule is as natur and necessari a part as the form of the govern itself and is that which had it establish origin from the peopl the anarchi be much alik to have no form of govern at all or to agre that it shall be monarch but to appoint no wai to design the person that shall have the power and be the monarch henc all commonwealth with the form of govern establish have rule also of appoint those who ar to have ani share in the public author and settl method of convei the right to them for the anarchi is much alik to have no form of govern at all or to agre that it shall be monarch but to appoint no wai to know or design the person that shall have the power and be the monarch whoever get into the exercis of ani part of the power by other wai than what the law of the commun have prescrib hath no right to be obei though the form of the commonwealth be still preserv sinc he is not the person the law have appoint and consequ not the person the peopl have consent to nor can such an usurp or ani deriv from him ever have a titl till the peopl ar both at liberti to consent and have actual consent to allow and confirm in him the power he hath till then usurp chapter xviii of tyranni sect as usurp is the exercis of power which anoth hath a right to so tyranni is the exercis of power beyond right which no bodi can have a right to and thi is make us of the power ani on ha in hi hand not for the good of those who ar under it but for hi own privat separ advantag when the governor howev intitl make not the law but hi will the rule and hi command and action ar not direct to the preserv of the properti of hi peopl but the satisfact of hi own ambit reveng covet or ani other irregular passion sect if on can doubt thi to be truth or reason becaus it come from the obscur hand of a subject i hope the author of a king will make it pass with him king jame the first in hi speech to the parliament tell them thu i will ever prefer the weal of the public and of the whole commonwealth in make of good law and constitut to ani particular and privat end of mine think ever the wealth and weal of the commonwealth to be my greatest weal and worldli felic a point wherein a law king doth directli differ from a tyrant for i do acknowledg that the special and greatest point of differ that is between a right king and an usurp tyrant is thi that wherea the proud and ambiti tyrant doth think hi kingdom and peopl ar onli ordain for satisfact of hi desir and unreason appetit the righteou and just king doth by the contrari acknowledg himself to be ordain for the procur of the wealth and properti of hi peopl and again in hi speech to the parliament he hath these word the king bind himself by a doubl oath to the observ of the fundament law of hi kingdom tacitli as by be a king and so bound to protect as well the peopl as the law of hi kingdom and expressli by hi oath at hi coron so as everi just king in a settl kingdom is bound to observ that paction made to hi peopl by hi law in frame hi govern agreeabl thereunto accord to that paction which god made with noah after the delug hereaft seedtim and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and dai and night shall not ceas while the earth remaineth and therefor a king govern in a settl kingdom leav to be a king and degener into a tyrant as soon as he leav off to rule accord to hi law and a littl after therefor all king that ar not tyrant or perjur will be glad to bound themselv within the limit of their law and thei that persuad them the contrari ar viper and pest both against them and the commonwealth thu that learn king who well understood the notion of thing make the differ betwixt a king and a tyrant to consist onli in thi that on make the law the bound of hi power and the good of the public the end of hi govern the other make all give wai to hi own will and appetit sect it is a mistak to think thi fault is proper onli to monarchi other form of govern ar liabl to it as well as that for wherev the power that is put in ani hand for the govern of the peopl and the preserv of their properti is appli to other end and made us of to impoverish harass or subdu them to the arbitrari and irregular command of those that have it there it present becom tyranni whether those that thu us it ar on or mani thu we read of the thirti tyrant at athen as well as on at syracus and the intoler dominion of the decemviri at rome wa noth better sect whereev law end tyranni begin if the law be transgress to anoth harm and whosoev in author exce the power given him by the law and make us of the forc he ha under hi command to compass that upon the subject which the law allow not ceas in that to be a magistr and act without author mai be oppos as ani other man who by forc invad the right of anoth thi is acknowledg in subordin magistr he that hath author to seiz my person in the street mai be oppos as a thief and a robber if he endeavour to break into my hous to execut a writ notwithstand that i know he ha such a warrant and such a legal author as will impow him to arrest me abroad and why thi should not hold in the highest as well as in the most inferior magistr i would gladli be inform is it reason that the eldest brother becaus he ha the greatest part of hi father estat should therebi have a right to take awai ani of hi younger brother portion or that a rich man who possess a whole countri should from thenc have a right to seiz when he pleas the cottag and garden of hi poor neighbour the be rightfulli possess of great power and rich exceedingli beyond the greatest part of the son of adam is so far from be an excus much less a reason for rapin and oppress which the endamag anoth without author is that it is a great aggrav of it for the exceed the bound of author is no more a right in a great than in a petti offic no more justifi in a king than a constabl but is so much the wors in him in that he ha more trust put in him ha alreadi a much greater share than the rest of hi brethren and is suppos from the advantag of hi educ employ and counsellor to be more know in the measur of right and wrong sect mai the command then of a princ be oppos mai he be resist as often as ani on shall find himself aggriev and but imagin he ha not right done him thi will unhing and overturn all politi and instead of govern and order leav noth but anarchi and confus sect to thi i answer that forc is to be oppos to noth but to unjust and unlaw forc whoever make ani opposit in ani other case draw on himself a just condemn both from god and man and so no such danger or confus will follow as is often suggest for sect first as in some countri the person of the princ by the law is sacr and so whatev he command or doe hi person is still free from all question or violenc not liabl to forc or ani judici censur or condemn but yet opposit mai be made to the illeg act of ani inferior offic or other commiss by him unless he will by actual put himself into a state of war with hi peopl dissolv the govern and leav them to that defenc which belong to everi on in the state of natur for of such thing who can tell what the end will be and a neighbour kingdom ha shew the world an odd exampl in all other case the sacred of the person exempt him from all inconveni wherebi he is secur whilst the govern stand from all violenc and harm whatsoev than which there cannot be a wiser constitut for the harm he can do in hi own person not be like to happen often nor to extend itself far nor be abl by hi singl strength to subvert the law nor oppress the bodi of the peopl should ani princ have so much weak and ill natur as to be will to do it the inconveni of some particular mischief that mai happen sometim when a headi princ come to the throne ar well recompens by the peac of the public and secur of the govern in the person of the chief magistr thu set out of the reach of danger it be safer for the bodi that some few privat men should be sometim in danger to suffer than that the head of the republ should be easili and upon slight occas expos sect secondli but thi privileg belong onli to the king person hinder not but thei mai be question oppos and resist who us unjust forc though thei pretend a commiss from him which the law author not as is plain in the case of him that ha the king writ to arrest a man which is a full commiss from the king and yet he that ha it cannot break open a man hous to do it nor execut thi command of the king upon certain dai nor in certain place though thi commiss have no such except in it but thei ar the limit of the law which if ani on transgress the king commiss excus him not for the king author be given him onli by the law he cannot impow ani on to act against the law or justifi him by hi commiss in so do the commiss or command of ani magistr where he ha no author be as void and insignific as that of ani privat man the differ between the on and the other be that the magistr ha some author so far and to such end and the privat man ha none at all for it is not the commiss but the author that give the right of act and against the law there can be no author but notwithstand such resist the king person and author ar still both secur and so no danger to governor or govern sect thirdli suppos a govern wherein the person of the chief magistr is not thu sacr yet thi doctrin of the law of resist all unlaw exercis of hi power will not upon everi slight occas indang him or imbroil the govern for where the injur parti mai be reliev and hi damag repair by appeal to the law there can be no pretenc for forc which is onli to be us where a man is intercept from appeal to the law for noth is to be account hostil forc but where it leav not the remedi of such an appeal and it is such forc alon that put him that us it into a state of war and make it law to resist him a man with a sword in hi hand demand my purs in the highwai when perhap i have not twelv penc in my pocket thi man i mai lawfulli kill to anoth i deliv pound to hold onli whilst i alight which he refus to restor me when i am got up again but draw hi sword to defend the possess of it by forc if i endeavour to retak it the mischief thi man doe me is a hundr or possibl a thousand time more than the other perhap intend me whom i kill befor he realli did me ani and yet i might lawfulli kill the on and cannot so much as hurt the other lawfulli the reason whereof is plain becaus the on us forc which threaten my life i could not have time to appeal to the law to secur it and when it wa gone it wa too late to appeal the law could not restor life to my dead carcass the loss wa irrepar which to prevent the law of natur gave me a right to destroi him who had put himself into a state of war with me and threaten my destruct but in the other case my life not be in danger i mai have the benefit of appeal to the law and have repar for my pound that wai sect fourthli but if the unlaw act done by the magistr be maintain by the power he ha got and the remedi which is due by law be by the same power obstruct yet the right of resist even in such manifest act of tyranni will not suddenli or on slight occas disturb the govern for if it reach no farther than some privat men case though thei have a right to defend themselv and to recov by forc what by unlaw forc is taken from them yet the right to do so will not easili engag them in a contest wherein thei ar sure to perish it be as imposs for on or a few oppress men to disturb the govern where the bodi of the peopl do not think themselv concern in it as for a rave madman or headi malcont to overturn a well settl state the peopl be as littl apt to follow the on as the other sect but if either these illeg act have extend to the major of the peopl or if the mischief and oppress ha light onli on some few but in such case as the preced and consequ seem to threaten all and thei ar persuad in their conscienc that their law and with them their estat liberti and live ar in danger and perhap their religion too how thei will be hinder from resist illeg forc us against them i cannot tell thi is an inconveni i confess that attend all govern whatsoev when the governor have brought it to thi pass to be gener suspect of their peopl the most danger state which thei can possibl put themselv in wherein thei ar the less to be piti becaus it is so easi to be avoid it be as imposs for a governor if he realli mean the good of hi peopl and the preserv of them and their law togeth not to make them see and feel it as it is for the father of a famili not to let hi children see he love and take care of them sect but if all the world shall observ pretenc of on kind and action of anoth art us to elud the law and the trust of prerog which is an arbitrari power in some thing left in the princ hand to do good not harm to the peopl emploi contrari to the end for which it wa given if the peopl shall find the minist and subordin magistr chosen suitabl to such end and favour or laid by proportion as thei promot or oppos them if thei see sever experi made of arbitrari power and that religion underhand favour tho publicli proclaim against which is readiest to introduc it and the oper in it support as much as mai be and when that cannot be done yet approv still and like the better if a long train of action shew the council all tend that wai how can a man ani more hinder himself from be persuad in hi own mind which wai thing ar go or from cast about how to save himself than he could from believ the captain of the ship he wa in wa carri him and the rest of the compani to algier when he found him alwai steer that

circumst would let him chapter xix of the dissolut of govern sect he that will with ani clear speak of the dissolut of govern ought in the first place to distinguish between the dissolut of the societi and the dissolut of the govern that which make the commun and bring men out of the loos state of natur into on polit societi is the agreement which everi on ha with the rest to incorpor and act as on bodi and so be on distinct commonwealth the usual and almost onli wai wherebi thi union is dissolv is the inroad of foreign forc make a conquest upon them for in that case not be abl to maintain and support themselv as on intir and independ bodi the union belong to that bodi which consist therein must necessarili ceas and so everi on return to the state he wa in befor with a liberti to shift for himself and provid for hi own safeti as he think fit in some other societi whenev the societi is dissolv it is certain the govern of that societi cannot remain thu conqueror sword often cut up govern by the root and mangl societi to piec separ the subdu or scatter multitud from the protect of and depend on that societi which ought to have preserv them from violenc the world is too well instruct in and too forward to allow of thi wai of dissolv of govern to need ani more to be said of it and there want not much argument to prove that where the societi is dissolv the govern cannot remain that be as imposs as for the frame of an hous to subsist when the materi of it ar scatter and dissip by a whirlwind or jumbl into a confus heap by an earthquak sect besid thi overturn from without govern ar dissolv from within first when the legisl is alter civil societi be a state of peac amongst those who ar of it from whom the state of war is exclud by the umpirag which thei

the peopl without which no on man or number of men amongst them can have author of make law that shall be bind to the rest when ani on or more shall take upon them to make law whom the peopl have not appoint so to do thei make law without author which the peopl ar not therefor bound to obei by which mean thei come again to be out of subject and mai constitut to themselv a new legisl as thei think best be in full liberti to resist the forc of those who without author would impos ani thing upon them everi on is at the disposur of hi own will when those who had by the deleg of the societi the declar of the public will ar exclud from it and other usurp the place who have no such author or deleg sect thi be usual brought about by such in the commonwealth who misus the power thei have it is hard to consid it aright and know at whose door to lai it without know the form of govern in which it happen let us suppos then the legisl place in the concurr of three distinct person i i a singl hereditari person have the constant suprem execut power and with it the power of convok and dissolv the other two within certain period of time i i an assembl of hereditari nobil i i an assembl of repres chosen pro tempor by the peopl such a form of govern suppos it is evid sect first that when such a singl person or princ set up hi own arbitrari will in place of the law which ar the will of the societi declar by the legisl then the legisl is chang for that be in effect the legisl whose rule and law ar put in execut and requir to be obei when other law ar set up and other rule pretend and inforc than what the legisl constitut by the societi have enact it is plain that the legisl is chang whoever introduc new law not be thereunto author by the fundament appoint of the societi or subvert the old disown and overturn the power by which thei were made and so set up a new legisl sect secondli when the princ hinder the legisl from assembl in it due time or from act freeli pursuant to those end for which it wa constitut the legisl is alter for it is not a certain number of men no nor their meet unless thei have also freedom of debat and leisur of perfect what is for the good of the societi wherein the legisl consist when these ar taken awai or alter so as to depriv the societi of the due exercis of their power the legisl is truli alter for it is not name that constitut govern but the us and exercis of those power that were intend to accompani them so that he who take awai the freedom or hinder the act of the legisl in it due season in effect take awai the legisl and put an end to the govern sect thirdli when by the arbitrari power of the princ the elector or wai of elect ar alter without the consent and contrari to the common interest of the peopl there also the legisl is alter for if other than those whom the societi hath author thereunto do chuse or in anoth wai than what the societi hath prescrib those chosen ar not the legisl appoint by the peopl sect fourthli the deliveri also of the peopl into the subject of a foreign power either by the princ or by the legisl is certainli a chang of the legisl and so a dissolut of the govern for the end why peopl enter into societi be to be preserv on intir free independ societi to be govern by it own law thi is lost whenev thei ar given up into the power of anoth sect why in such a constitut as thi the dissolut of the govern in these case is to be imput to the princ is evid becaus he have the forc treasur and offic of the state to emploi and often persuad himself or be flatter by other that as suprem magistr he is uncap of controul he alon is in a condit to make great advanc toward such chang under pretenc of law author and ha it in hi hand to terrifi or suppress oppos as factiou sediti and enemi to the govern wherea no other part of the legisl or peopl is capabl by themselv to attempt ani alter of the legisl without open and visibl rebellion apt enough to be taken notic of which when it prevail produc effect veri littl differ from foreign conquest besid the princ in such a form of govern have the power of dissolv the other part of the legisl and therebi render them privat person thei can never in opposit to him or without hi concurr alter the legisl by a law hi consent be necessari to give ani of their decre that sanction but yet so far as the other part of the legisl ani wai contribut to ani attempt upon the govern and do either promot or not what li in them hinder such design thei ar guilti and partak in thi which is certainli the greatest crime which men can partak of on toward anoth sec there is on wai more wherebi such a govern mai be dissolv and that is when he who ha the suprem execut power neglect and abandon that charg so that the law alreadi made can no longer be put in execut thi is demonstr to reduc all to anarchi and so effectu to dissolv the govern for law not be made for themselv but to be by their execut the bond of the societi to keep everi part of the bodi polit in it due place and function when that total ceas the govern visibl ceas and the peopl becom a confus multitud without order or connexion where there is no longer the administr of justic for the secur of men right nor ani remain power within the commun to direct the forc or provid for the necess of the public there certainli is no govern left where the law cannot be execut it is all on as if there were no law and a govern without law is i suppos a mysteri in polit unconceiv to human capac and inconsist with human societi sect in these and the like case when the govern is dissolv the peopl ar at liberti to provid for themselv by erect a new legisl differ from the other by the chang of person or form or both as thei shall find it most for their safeti and good for the societi can never by the fault of anoth lose the nativ and origin right it ha to preserv itself which can onli be done by a settl legisl and a fair and imparti execut of the law made by it but the state of mankind is not so miser that thei ar not capabl of us thi remedi till it be too late to look for ani to tell peopl thei mai provid for themselv by erect a new legisl when by oppress artific or be deliv over to a foreign power their old on is gone is onli to tell them thei mai expect relief when it is too late and the evil is past cure thi is in effect no more than to bid them first be slave and then to take care of their liberti and when their chain ar on tell them thei mai act like freemen thi if bare so is rather mockeri than relief and men can never be secur from tyranni if there be no mean to escap it till thei ar perfectli under it and therefor it is that thei have not onli a right to get out of it but to prevent it sect there is therefor secondli anoth wai wherebi govern ar dissolv and that is when the legisl or the princ either of them act contrari to their trust first the legisl act against the trust repos in them when thei endeavour to invad the properti of the subject and to make themselv or ani part of the commun master or arbitrari dispos of the live liberti or fortun of the peopl sect the reason why men enter into societi is the preserv of their properti and the end why thei chuse and author a legisl is that there mai be law made and rule set as guard and fenc to the properti of all the member of the societi to limit the power and moder the dominion of everi part and member of the societi for sinc it can never be suppos to be the will of the societi that the legisl should have a power to destroi that which everi on design to secur by enter into societi and for which the peopl submit themselv to legisl of their own make whenev the legisl endeavour to take awai and destroi the properti of the peopl or to reduc them to slaveri under arbitrari power thei put themselv into a state of war with the peopl who ar thereupon absolv from ani farther obedi and ar left to the common refug which god hath provid for all men against forc and violenc whensoev therefor the legisl shall transgress thi fundament rule of societi and either by ambit fear folli or corrupt endeavour to grasp themselv or put into the hand of ani other an absolut power over the live liberti and estat of the peopl by thi breach of trust thei forfeit the power the peopl had put into their hand for quit contrari end and it devolv to the peopl who have a right to resum their origin liberti and by the establish of a new legisl such as thei shall think fit provid for their own safeti and secur which is the end for which thei ar in societi what i have said here concern the legisl in gener hold true also concern the suprem executor who have a doubl trust put in him both to have a part in the legisl and the suprem execut of the law act against both when he goe about to set up hi own arbitrari will as the law of the societi he act also contrari to hi trust when he either emploi the forc treasur and offic of the societi to corrupt the repres and gain them to hi purpos or openli preengag the elector and prescrib to their choic such whom he ha by sollicit threat promis or otherwis won to hi design and emploi them to bring in such who have promis beforehand what to vote and what to enact thu to regul candid and elector and newmodel the wai of elect what is it but to cut up the govern by the root and poison the veri fountain of public secur for the peopl have reserv to themselv the choic of their repres as the fenc to their properti could do it for no other end but that thei might alwai be freeli chosen and so chosen freeli act and advis as the necess of the commonwealth and the public good should upon examin and matur debat be judg to requir thi those who give their vote befor thei hear the debat and have weigh the reason on all side ar not capabl of do to prepar such an assembl as thi and endeavour to set up the declar abettor of hi own will for the true repres of the peopl and the lawmak of the societi is certainli as great a breach of trust and as perfect a declar of a design to subvert the govern as is possibl to be met with to which if on shall add reward and punish visibl emploi to the same end and all the art of pervert law made us of to take off and destroi all that stand in the wai of such a design and will not compli and consent to betrai the liberti of their countri it will be past doubt what is do what power thei ought to have in the societi who thu emploi it contrari to the trust went along with it in it first institut is easi to determin and on cannot but see that he who ha onc attempt ani such thing as thi cannot ani longer be trust sect to thi perhap it will be said that the peopl be ignor and alwai discont to lai the foundat of govern in the unsteadi opinion and uncertain humour of the peopl is to expos it to certain ruin and no govern will be abl long to subsist if the peopl mai set up a new legisl whenev thei take offenc at the old on to thi i answer quit the contrari peopl ar not so easili got out of their old form as some ar apt to suggest thei ar hardli to be prevail with to amend the acknowledg fault in the frame thei have been accustom to and if there be ani origin defect or adventiti on introduc by time or corrupt it is not an easi thing to get them chang even when all the world see there is an opportun for it thi slow and avers in the peopl to quit their old constitut ha in the mani revolut which have been seen in thi kingdom in thi and former ag still kept us to or after some interv of fruitless attempt still brought us back again to our old legisl of king lord and common and whatev provoc have made the crown be taken from some of our princ head thei never carri the peopl so far as to place it in anoth line sect but it will be said thi hypothesi lai a ferment for frequent rebellion to which i answer first no more than ani other hypothesi for when the peopl ar made miser and find themselv expos to the ill usag of arbitrari power cry up their governor as much as you will for son of jupit let them be sacr and divin descend or author from heaven give them out for whom or what you pleas the same will happen the peopl gener ill treat and contrari to right will be readi upon ani occas to eas themselv of a burden that sit heavi upon them thei will wish and seek for the opportun which in the chang weak and accid of human affair seldom delai long to offer itself he must have live but a littl while in the world who ha not seen exampl of thi in hi time and he must have read veri littl who cannot produc exampl of it in all sort of govern in the world sect secondli i answer such revolut happen not upon everi littl mismanag in public affair great mistak in the rule part mani wrong and inconveni law and all the slip of human frailti will be born by the peopl without mutini or murmur but if a long train of abus prevar and artific all tend the same wai make the design visibl to the peopl and thei cannot but feel what thei lie under and see whither thei ar go it is not to be wonder that thei should then rouz themselv and endeavour to put the rule into such hand which mai secur to them the end for which govern wa at first erect and without which ancient name and speciou form ar so far from be better that thei ar much wors than the state of natur or pure anarchi the inconveni be all as great and as near but the remedi farther off and more difficult sect thirdli i answer that thi doctrin of a power in the peopl of provid for their safeti anew by a new legisl when their legisl have act contrari to their trust by invad their properti is the best fenc against rebellion and the probablest mean to hinder it for rebellion be an opposit not to person but author which is found onli in the constitut and law of the govern those whoever thei be who by forc break through and by forc justifi their violat of them ar truli and properli rebel for when men by enter into societi and civilgovern have exclud forc and introduc law for the preserv of properti peac and uniti amongst themselv those who set up forc again in opposit to the law do rebellar that is bring back again the state of war and ar properli rebel which thei who ar in power by the pretenc thei have to author the temptat of forc thei have in their hand and the flatteri of those about them be likeliest to do the properest wai to prevent the evil is to shew them the danger and injustic of it who ar under the greatest temptat to run into it sect in both the forement case when either the legisl is chang or the legisl act contrari to the end for which thei were constitut those who ar guilti ar guilti of rebellion for if ani on by forc take awai the establish legisl of ani societi and the law by them made pursuant to their trust he therebi take awai the umpirag which everi on had consent to for a peaceabl decis of all their controversi and a bar to the state of war amongst them thei who remov or chang the legisl take awai thi decis power which no bodi can have but by the appoint and consent of the peopl and so destroi the author which the peopl did and no bodi els can set up and introduc a power which the peopl hath not author thei actual introduc a state of war which is that of forc without author and thu by remov the legisl establish by the societi in whose decis the peopl acquiesc and unit as to that of their own will thei unti the knot and expos the peopl anew to the state of war and if those who by forc take awai the legisl ar rebel the legisl themselv as ha been shewn can be no less esteem so when thei who were set up for the protect and preserv of the peopl their liberti and properti shall by forc invad and endeavour to take them awai and so thei put themselv into a state of war with those who made them the protector and guardian of their peac ar properli and with the greatest aggrav rebellant rebel sect but if thei who sai it lai a foundat for rebellion mean that it mai occas civil war or intestin broil to tell the peopl thei ar absolv from obedi when illeg attempt ar made upon their liberti or properti and mai oppos the unlaw violenc of those who were their magistr when thei invad their properti contrari to the trust put in them and that therefor thi doctrin is not to be allow be so destruct to the peac of the world thei mai as well sai upon the same ground that honest men mai not oppos robber or pirat becaus thi mai occas disord or bloodsh if ani mischief come in such case it is not to be charg upon him who defend hi own right but on him that invad hi neighbour if the innoc honest man must quietli quit all he ha for peac sake to him who will lai violent hand upon it i desir it mai be consid what a kind of peac there will be in the world which consist onli in violenc and rapin and which is to be maintain onli for the benefit of robber and oppressor who would not think it an admir peac betwix the mighti and the mean when the lamb without resist yield hi throat to be torn by the imperi wolf polyphemuss den give us a perfect pattern of such a peac and such a govern wherein ulyss and hi companion had noth to do but quietli to suffer themselv to be devour and no doubt ulyss who wa a prudent man preach up passiv obedi and exhort them to a quiet submiss by repres to them of what concern peac wa to mankind and by shew the inconveni might happen if thei should offer to resist polyphemu who had now the power over them sect the end of govern is the good of mankind and which is best for mankind that the peopl should be alwai expos to the boundless will of tyranni or that the ruler should be sometim liabl to be oppos when thei grow exorbit in the us of their power and emploi it for the destruct and not the preserv of the properti of their peopl sect nor let ani on sai that mischief can aris from henc as often as it shall pleas a busi head or turbul spirit to desir the alter of the govern it is true such men mai stir whenev thei pleas but it will be onli to their own just ruin and perdit for till the mischief be grown gener and the ill design of the ruler becom visibl or their attempt sensibl to the greater part the peopl who ar more dispos to suffer than right themselv by resist ar not apt to stir the exampl of particular injustic or oppress of here and there an unfortun man move them not but if thei univers have a persuat ground upon manifest evid that design ar carri on against their liberti and the gener cours and tendenc of thing cannot but give them strong suspicion of the evil intent of their governor who is to be blame for it who can help it if thei who might avoid it bring themselv into thi suspicion ar the peopl to be blame if thei have the sens of ration creatur and can think of thing no otherwis than as thei find and feel them and is it not rather their fault who put thing into such a postur that thei would not have them thought to be as thei ar i grant that the pride ambit and turbul of privat men have sometim caus great disord in commonwealth and faction have been fatal to state and kingdom but whether the mischief hath often begun in the peopl wanton and a desir to cast off the law author of their ruler or in the ruler insol and endeavour to get and exercis an arbitrari power over their peopl whether oppress or disobedi gave the first rise to the disord i leav it to imparti histori to determin thi i am sure whoever either ruler or subject by forc goe about to invad the right of either princ or peopl and lai the foundat for overturn the constitut and frame of ani just govern is highli guilti of the greatest crime i think a man is capabl of be to answer for all those mischief of blood rapin and desol which the break to piec of govern bring on a countri and he who doe it is justli to be esteem the common enemi and pest of mankind and is to be treat accordingli sect that subject or foreign attempt by forc on the properti of ani peopl mai be resist with forc is agre on all hand but that magistr do the same thing mai be resist hath of late been deni as if those who had the greatest privileg and advantag by the law had therebi a power to break those law by which alon thei were set in a better place than their brethren wherea their offenc is therebi the greater both as be ungrat for the greater share thei have by the law and break also that trust which is put into their hand by their brethren sect whosoev us forc without right as everi on doe in societi who doe it without law put himself into a state of war with those against whom he so us it and in that state all former ti ar cancel all other right ceas and everi on ha a right to defend himself and to resist the aggressor thi is so evid that barclai himself that great assertor of the power and sacred of king is forc to confess that it is law for the peopl in some case to resist their king and that too in a chapter wherein he pretend to shew that the divin law shut up the peopl from all manner of rebellion wherebi it is evid even by hi own doctrin that sinc thei mai in

shall shew an hatr not onli to some particular person but set himself against the bodi of the commonwealth whereof he is the head and shall with intoler ill usag cruelli tyrann over the whole or a

wherein the peopl mai of right and by their own author help themselv take arm and set upon their king imperi domin over them none at all whilst he remain a king honour the king and he that resist the power resist the ordin of god ar divin oracl that will never permit it the peopl therefor can never come by a power over him unless he doe someth that make him ceas to be a king for then he divest himself of hi crown and digniti and return to the state of a privat man and the peopl becom free and superior the power which thei had in the interregnum befor thei crown him king devolv to them again but there ar but few miscarriag which bring the matter to thi state after consid it well on all side i can find but two two case there ar i sai wherebi a king ipso facto becom no king and lose all power and regal author over hi peopl which ar also taken notic of by winzeru the first is if he endeavour to overturn the govern that is if he have a purpos and design to ruin the kingdom and commonwealth as it is record of nero that he resolv to cut off the senat and peopl of rome lai the citi wast with fire and sword and then remov to some other place and of caligula that he openli declar that he would be no longer a head to the peopl or senat and that he had it in hi thought to cut off the worthiest men of both rank and then retir to alexandria and he wisht that the peopl had but on neck that he might dispatch them all at a blow such design as these when ani king harbour in hi thought and serious promot he immedi give up all care and thought of the commonwealth and consequ forfeit the power of govern hi subject as a master doe the dominion over hi slave whom he hath abandon sect the other case is when a king make himself the depend of anoth and subject hi kingdom which hi ancestor left him and the peopl put free into hi hand to the dominion of anoth for howev perhap it mai not be hi intent to prejudic the peopl yet becaus he ha herebi lost the princip part of regal digniti viz to be next and immedi under god suprem in hi kingdom and also becaus he betrai or forc hi peopl whose liberti he ought to have carefulli preserv into the power and dominion of a foreign nation by thi as it were alien of hi kingdom he himself lose the power he had in it befor without transfer ani the least right to those on whom he would have bestow it and so by thi act set the peopl free and leav them at their own dispos on exampl of thi is to be found in the scotch annal sect in these case barclai the great champion of absolut monarchi is forc to allow that a king mai be resist and ceas to be a king that is in short not to multipli case in whatsoev he ha no author there he is no king and mai be resist for wheresoev the author ceas the king ceas too and becom like other men who have no author and these two case he instanc in differ littl from those abov mention to be destruct to govern onli that he ha omit the principl from which hi doctrin flow and that is the breach of trust in not preserv the form of govern agre on and in not intend the end of govern itself which is the public good and preserv of properti when a king ha dethron himself and put himself in a state of war with hi peopl what shall hinder them from prosecut him who is no king as thei would ani other man who ha put himself into a state of war with them barclai and those of hi opinion would do well to tell us thi farther i desir mai be taken notic of out of barclai that he sai the mischief that is design them the peopl mai prevent befor it be done wherebi he allow resist when tyranni is but in design such design as these sai he when ani king harbour in hi thought and serious promot he immedi give up all care and thought of the commonwealth so that accord to him the neglect of the public good is to be taken as an evid of such design or at least for a suffici caus of resist and the reason of all he give in these word becaus he betrai or forc hi peopl whose liberti he ought carefulli to have preserv what he add into the power and dominion of a foreign nation signifi noth the fault and forfeitur ly in the loss of their liberti which he ought to have preserv and not in ani distinct of the person to whose dominion thei were subject the peopl right is equal invad and their liberti lost whether thei ar made slave to ani of their own or a foreign nation and in thi li the injuri and against thi onli have thei the right of defenc and there ar instanc to be found in all countri which shew that it is not the chang of nation in the person of their governor but the chang of govern that give the offenc bilson a bishop of our church and a great stickler for the power and prerog of princ doe if i mistak not in hi treatis of christian subject acknowledg that princ mai forfeit their power and their titl to the obedi of their subject and if there need author in a case where reason is so plain i could send my reader to bracton fortescu and the author of the mirrour and other writer that cannot be suspect to be ignor of our govern or enemi to it but i thought hooker alon might be enough to satisfi those men who reli on him for their ecclesiast politi ar by a strang fate carri to deni those principl upon which he build it whether thei ar herein made the tool of cunning workmen to pull down their own fabric thei were best look thi i am sure their civil polici is so new so danger and so destruct to both ruler and peopl that as former ag never could bear the broach of it so it mai be hope those to come redeem from the imposit of these egyptian undertaskmast will abhor the memori of such servil flatter who whilst it seem to serv their turn resolv all govern into absolut tyranni and would have all men born to what their mean soul fit them for slaveri sect here it is like the common question will be made who shall be judg whether the princ or legisl act contrari to their trust thi perhap illaffect and factiou men mai spread amongst the peopl when the princ onli make us of hi due prerog to thi i repli the peopl shall be judg for who shall be judg whether hi truste or deputi act well and accord to the trust repos in him but he who deput him and must by have deput him have still a power to discard him when he fail in hi trust if thi be reason in particular case of privat men why should it be otherwis in that of the greatest moment where the welfar of million is concern and also where the evil if not prevent is greater and the redress veri difficult dear and danger sect but farther thi question who shall be judg cannot mean that there is no judg at all for where there is no judicatur on earth to decid controversi amongst men god in heaven is judg he alon it is true is judg of the right but everi man is judg for himself as in all other case so in thi whether anoth hath put himself into a state of war with him and whether he should appeal to the suprem judg as jeptha did sect if a controversi aris betwixt a princ and some of the peopl in a matter where the law is silent or doubt and the thing be of great consequ i should think the proper umpir in such a case should be the bodi of the peopl for in case where the princ hath a trust repos in him and is dispens from the common ordinari rule of the law there if ani men find themselv aggriev and think the princ act contrari to or beyond that trust who so proper to judg as the bodi of the peopl who at first lodg that trust in him how far thei meant it should extend but if the princ or whoever thei be in the administr declin that wai of determin the appeal then li no where but to heaven forc between either person who have no known superior on earth or which permit no appeal to a judg on earth be properli a state of war wherein the appeal li onli to heaven and in that state the injur parti must judg for himself when he will think fit to make us of that appeal and put himself upon it sect to conclud the power that everi individu gave the societi when he enter into it can never revert to the individu again as long as the societi last but will alwai remain in the commun becaus without thi there can be no commun no commonwealth which is contrari to the origin agreement so also when the societi hath place the legisl in ani assembl of men to continu in them and their successor with direct and author for provid such successor the legisl can never revert to the peopl whilst that govern last becaus have provid a legisl with power to continu for ever thei have given up their polit power to the legisl and cannot resum it but if thei have set limit to the durat of their legisl and made thi suprem power in ani person or assembl onli temporari or els when by the miscarriag of those in author it is forfeit upon the forfeitur or at the determin of the time set it revert to the societi and the peopl have a right to act as suprem and continu the legisl in themselv or erect a new form or under the old form place it in new hand as thei think good fini end of project
