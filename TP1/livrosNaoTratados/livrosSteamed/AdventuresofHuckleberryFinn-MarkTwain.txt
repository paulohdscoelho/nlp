chapter i you don t know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventur of tom sawyer but that ain t no matter that book wa made by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainli there wa thing which he stretch but mainli he told the truth that is noth i never seen anybodi but li on time or anoth without it wa aunt polli or the widow or mayb mari aunt pollytom s aunt polli she isand mari and the widow dougla is all told about in that book which is mostli a true book with some stretcher as i said befor now the wai that the book wind up is thi tom and me found the monei that the robber hid in the cave and it made us rich we got six thousand dollar apieceal gold it wa an aw sight of monei when it wa pile up well judg thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetch us a dollar a dai apiec all the year roundmor than a bodi could tell what to do with the widow dougla she took me for her son and allow she would sivil me but it wa rough live in the hous all the time consid how dismal regular and decent the widow wa in all her wai and so when i couldn t stand it no longer i lit out i got into my old rag and my sugarhogshead again and wa free and satisfi but tom sawyer he hunt me up and said he wa go to start a band of robber and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respect so i went back the widow she cri over me and call me a poor lost lamb and she call me a lot of other name too but she never meant no harm by it she put me in them new cloth again and i couldn t do noth but sweat and sweat and feel all cramp up well then the old thing commenc again the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time when you got to the tabl you couldn t go right to eat but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumbl a littl over the victual though there warn t realli anyth the matter with themthat is noth onli everyth wa cook by itself in a barrel of odd and end it is differ thing get mix up and the juic kind of swap around and the thing go better after supper she got out her book and learn me about mose and the bulrush and i wa in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that mose had been dead a consider long time so then i didn t care no more about him becaus i don t take no stock in dead peopl pretti soon i want to smoke and ask the widow to let me but she wouldn t she said it wa a mean practic and wasn t clean and i must try to not do it ani more that is just the wai with some peopl thei get down on a thing when thei don t know noth about it here she wa aboth about mose which wa no kin to her and no us to anybodi be gone you see yet find a power of fault with me for do a thing that had some good in it and she took snuff too of cours that wa all right becaus she done it herself her sister miss watson a toler slim old maid with goggl on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a spellingbook she work me middl hard for about an hour and then the widow made her eas up i couldn t stood it much longer then for an hour it wa deadli dull and i wa fidgeti miss watson would sai don t put your feet up there huckleberri and don t scrunch up like that huckleberryset up straight and pretti soon she would sai don t gap and stretch like that huckleberrywhi don t you try to behav then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wish i wa there she got mad then but i didn t mean no harm all i want wa to go somewher all i want wa a chang i warn t particular she said it wa wick to sai what i said said she wouldn t sai it for the whole world she wa go to live so as to go to the good place well i couldn t see no advantag in go where she wa go so i made up my mind i wouldn t try for it but i never said so becaus it would onli make troubl and wouldn t do no good now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place she said all a bodi would have to do there wa to go around all dai long with a harp and sing forev and ever so i didn t think much of it but i never said so i ask her if she reckon tom sawyer would go there and she said not by a consider sight i wa glad about that becaus i want him and me to be togeth miss watson she kept peck at me and it got tiresom and lonesom by and by thei fetch the nigger in and had prayer and then everybodi wa off to bed i went up to my room with a piec of candl and put it on the tabl then i set down in a chair by the window and tri to think of someth cheer but it warn t no us i felt so lonesom i most wish i wa dead the star were shine and the leav rustl in the wood ever so mourn and i heard an owl awai off whowhoo about somebodi that wa dead and a whippowil and a dog cry about somebodi that wa go to die and the wind wa try to whisper someth to me and i couldn t make out what it wa and so it made the cold shiver run over me then awai out in the wood i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost make when it want to tell about someth that s on it mind and can t make itself understood and so can t rest easi in it grave and ha to go about that wai everi night griev i got so downheart and scare i did wish i had some compani pretti soon a spider went crawl up my shoulder and i flip it off and it lit in the candl and befor i could budg it wa all shrivel up i didn t need anybodi to tell me that that wa an aw bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i wa scare and most shook the cloth off of me i got up and turn around in my track three time and cross my breast everi time and then i ti up a littl lock of my hair with a thread to keep witch awai but i hadn t no confid you do that when you ve lost a horsesho that you ve found instead of nail it up over the door but i hadn t ever heard anybodi sai it wa ani wai to keep off bad luck when you d kill a spider i set down again ashak all over and got out my pipe for a smoke for the hous wa all as still as death now and so the widow wouldn t know well after a long time i heard the clock awai off in the town go boomboomboomtwelv lick and all still againstil than ever pretti soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the treessometh wa a stir i set still and listen directli i could just bare hear a meyow meyow down there that wa good sai i meyow meyow as soft as i could and then i put out the light and scrambl out of the window on to the shed then i slip down to the ground and crawl in among the tree and sure enough there wa tom sawyer wait for me chapter ii we went tipto along a path amongst the tree back toward the end of the widow s garden stoop down so as the branch wouldn t scrape our head when we wa pass by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a nois we scrouch down and laid still miss watson s big nigger name jim wa set in the kitchen door we could see him pretti clear becaus there wa a light behind him he got up and stretch hi neck out about a minut listen then he sai who dah he listen some more then he come tipto down and stood right between us we could a touch him nearli well like it wa minut and minut that there warn t a sound and we all there so close togeth there wa a place on my ankl that got to itch but i dasn t scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulder seem like i d die if i couldn t scratch well i ve notic that thing plenti time sinc if you ar with the qualiti or at a funer or try to go to sleep when you ain t sleepyif you ar anywher where it won t do for you to scratch why you will itch all over in upward of a thousand place pretti soon jim sai sai who is you whar is you dog my cat ef i didn hear sumf n well i know what i s gwyne to do i s gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hear it agin so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom he lean hi back up against a tree and stretch hi leg out till on of them most touch on of mine my nose begun to itch it itch till the tear come into my ey but i dasn t scratch then it begun to itch on the insid next i got to itch underneath i didn t know how i wa go to set still thi miser went on as much as six or seven minut but it seem a sight longer than that i wa itch in eleven differ place now i reckon i couldn t stand it more n a minut longer but i set my teeth hard and got readi to try just then jim begun to breath heavi next he begun to snoreand then i wa pretti soon comfort again tom he made a sign to mekind of a littl nois with hi mouthand we went creep awai on our hand and knee when we wa ten foot off tom whisper to me and want to tie jim to the tree for fun but i said no he might wake and make a disturb and then thei d find out i warn t in then tom said he hadn t got candl enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more i didn t want him to try i said jim might wake up and come but tom want to resk it so we slid in there and got three candl and tom laid five cent on the tabl for pai then we got out and i wa in a sweat to get awai but noth would do tom but he must crawl to where jim wa on hi hand and knee and plai someth on him i wait and it seem a good while everyth wa so still and lonesom as soon as tom wa back we cut along the path around the garden fenc and by and by fetch up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the hous tom said he slip jim s hat off of hi head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim stir a littl but he didn t wake afterward jim said the witch be witch him and put him in a tranc and rode him all over the state and then set him under the tree again and hung hi hat on a limb to show who done it and next time jim told it he said thei rode him down to new orlean and after that everi time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said thei rode him all over the world and tire him most to death and hi back wa all over saddleboil jim wa monstrou proud about it and he got so he wouldn t hardli notic the other nigger nigger would come mile to hear jim tell about it and he wa more look up to than ani nigger in that countri strang nigger would stand with their mouth open and look him all over same as if he wa a wonder nigger is alwai talk about witch in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenev on wa talk and let on to know all about such thing jim would happen in and sai hm what you know bout witch and that nigger wa cork up and had to take a back seat jim alwai kept that fivecent piec round hi neck with a string and said it wa a charm the devil give to him with hi own hand and told him he could cure anybodi with it and fetch witch whenev he want to just by sai someth to it but he never told what it wa he said to it nigger would come from all around there and give jim anyth thei had just for a sight of that fivecent piec but thei wouldn t touch it becaus the devil had had hi hand on it jim wa most ruin for a servant becaus he got stuck up on account of have seen the devil and been rode by witch well when tom and me got to the edg of the hilltop we look awai down into the villag and could see three or four light twinkl where there wa sick folk mayb and the star over us wa sparkl ever so fine and down by the villag wa the river a whole mile broad and aw still and grand we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben roger and two or three more of the boi hid in the old tanyard so we unhitch a skiff and pull down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillsid and went ashor we went to a clump of bush and tom made everybodi swear to keep the secret and then show them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bush then we lit the candl and crawl in on our hand and knee we went about two hundr yard and then the cave open up tom poke about amongst the passag and pretti soon duck under a wall where you wouldn t a notic that there wa a hole we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweati and cold and there we stop tom sai now we ll start thi band of robber and call it tom sawyer s gang everybodi that want to join ha got to take an oath and write hi name in blood everybodi wa will so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it it swore everi boi to stick to the band and never tell ani of the secret and if anybodi done anyth to ani boi in the band whichev boi wa order to kill that person and hi famili must do it and he mustn t eat and he mustn t sleep till he had kill them and hack a cross in their breast which wa the sign of the band and nobodi that didn t belong to the band could us that mark and if he did he must be su and if he done it again he must be kill and if anybodi that belong to the band told the secret he must have hi throat cut and then have hi carcass burnt up and the ash scatter all around and hi name blot off of the list with blood and never mention again by the gang but have a curs put on it and be forgot forev everybodi said it wa a real beauti oath and ask tom if he got it out of hi own head he said some of it but the rest wa out of piratebook and robberbook and everi gang that wa highton had it some thought it would be good to kill the famili of boi that told the secret tom said it wa a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in then ben roger sai here s huck finn he hain t got no famili what you go to do bout him well hain t he got a father sai tom sawyer ye he s got a father but you can t never find him these dai he us to lai drunk with the hog in the tanyard but he hain t been seen in these part for a year or more thei talk it over and thei wa go to rule me out becaus thei said everi boi must have a famili or somebodi to kill or els it wouldn t be fair and squar for the other well nobodi could think of anyth to doeverybodi wa stump and set still i wa most readi to cry but all at onc i thought of a wai and so i offer them miss watsonthei could kill her everybodi said oh she ll do that s all right huck can come in then thei all stuck a pin in their finger to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper now sai ben roger what s the line of busi of thi gang noth onli robberi and murder tom said but who ar we go to robhous or cattl or stuff steal cattl and such thing ain t robberi it s burglari sai tom sawyer we ain t burglar that ain t no sort of style we ar highwaymen we stop stage and carriag on the road with mask on and kill the peopl and take their watch and monei must we alwai kill the peopl oh certainli it s best some author think differ but mostli it s consid best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till thei re ransom ransom what s that i don t know but that s what thei do i ve seen it in book and so of cours that s what we ve got to do but how can we do it if we don t know what it is why blame it all we ve got to do it don t i tell you it s in the book do you want to go to do differ from what s in the book and get thing all muddl up oh that s all veri fine to sai tom sawyer but how in the nation ar these fellow go to be ransom if we don t know how to do it to themthat s the thing i want to get at now what do you reckon it is well i don t know but per ap if we keep them till thei re ransom it mean that we keep them till thei re dead now that s someth like that ll answer why couldn t you said that befor we ll keep them till thei re ransom to death and a bothersom lot thei ll be tooeat up everyth and alwai try to get loos how you talk ben roger how can thei get loos when there s a guard over them readi to shoot them down if thei move a peg a guard well that is good so somebodi s got to set up all night and never get ani sleep just so as to watch them i think that s foolish why can t a bodi take a club and ransom them as soon as thei get here becaus it ain t in the book sothat s why now ben roger do you want to do thing regular or don t youthat s the idea don t you reckon that the peopl that made the book know what s the correct thing to do do you reckon you can learn em anyth not by a good deal no sir we ll just go on and ransom them in the regular wai all right i don t mind but i sai it s a fool wai anyhow sai do we kill the women too well ben roger if i wa as ignor as you i wouldn t let on kill the women no nobodi ever saw anyth in the book like that you fetch them to the cave and you re alwai as polit as pie to them and by and by thei fall in love with you and never want to go home ani more well if that s the wai i m agre but i don t take no stock in it mighti soon we ll have the cave so clutter up with women and fellow wait to be ransom that there won t be no place for the robber but go ahead i ain t got noth to sai littl tommi barn wa asleep now and when thei wake him up he wa scare and cri and said he want to go home to hi ma and didn t want to be a robber ani more so thei all made fun of him and call him crybabi and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secret but tom give him five cent to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebodi and kill some peopl ben roger said he couldn t get out much onli sundai and so he want to begin next sundai but all the boi said it would be wick to do it on sundai and that settl the thing thei agre to get togeth and fix a dai as soon as thei could and then we elect tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so start home i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just befor dai wa break my new cloth wa all greas up and clayei and i wa dogtir chapter iii well i got a good goingov in the morn from old miss watson on account of my cloth but the widow she didn t scold but onli clean off the greas and clai and look so sorri that i thought i would behav awhil if i could then miss watson she took me in the closet and prai but noth come of it she told me to prai everi dai and whatev i ask for i would get it but it warn t so i tri it onc i got a fishlin but no hook it warn t ani good to me without hook i tri for the hook three or four time but somehow i couldn t make it work by and by on dai i ask miss watson to try for me but she said i wa a fool she never told me why and i couldn t make it out no wai i set down on time back in the wood and had a long think about it i sai to myself if a bodi can get anyth thei prai for why don t deacon winn get back the monei he lost on pork why can t the widow get back her silver snuffbox that wa stole why can t miss watson fat up no sai i to my self there ain t noth in it i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a bodi could get by prai for it wa spiritu gift thi wa too mani for me but she told me what she meanti must help other peopl and do everyth i could for other peopl and look out for them all the time and never think about myself thi wa includ miss watson as i took it i went out in the wood and turn it over in my mind a long time but i couldn t see no advantag about itexcept for the other peopl so at last i reckon i wouldn t worri about it ani more but just let it go sometim the widow would take me on side and talk about provid in a wai to make a bodi s mouth water but mayb next dai miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again i judg i could see that there wa two provid and a poor chap would stand consider show with the widow s provid but if miss watson s got him there warn t no help for him ani more i thought it all out and reckon i would belong to the widow s if he want me though i couldn t make out how he wa ago to be ani better off then than what he wa befor see i wa so ignor and so kind of lowdown and orneri pap he hadn t been seen for more than a year and that wa comfort for me i didn t want to see him no more he us to alwai whale me when he wa sober and could get hi hand on me though i us to take to the wood most of the time when he wa around well about thi time he wa found in the river drownd about twelv mile abov town so peopl said thei judg it wa him anywai said thi drownd man wa just hi size and wa rag and had uncommon long hair which wa all like pap but thei couldn t make noth out of the face becaus it had been in the water so long it warn t much like a face at all thei said he wa float on hi back in the water thei took him and buri him on the bank but i warn t comfort long becaus i happen to think of someth i know mighti well that a drownd man don t float on hi back but on hi face so i know then that thi warn t pap but a woman dress up in a man s cloth so i wa uncomfort again i judg the old man would turn up again by and by though i wish he wouldn t we plai robber now and then about a month and then i resign all the boi did we hadn t rob nobodi hadn t kill ani peopl but onli just pretend we us to hop out of the wood and go charg down on hogdriv and women in cart take garden stuff to market but we never hive ani of them tom sawyer call the hog ingot and he call the turnip and stuff juleri and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how mani peopl we had kill and mark but i couldn t see no profit in it on time tom sent a boi to run about town with a blaze stick which he call a slogan which wa the sign for the gang to get togeth and then he said he had got secret new by hi spi that next dai a whole parcel of spanish merchant and rich arab wa go to camp in cave hollow with two hundr eleph and six hundr camel and over a thousand sumter mule all load down with di mond and thei didn t have onli a guard of four hundr soldier and so we would lai in ambuscad as he call it and kill the lot and scoop the thing he said we must slick up our sword and gun and get readi he never could go after even a turnipcart but he must have the sword and gun all scour up for it though thei wa onli lath and broomstick and you might scour at them till you rot and then thei warn t worth a mouth of ash more than what thei wa befor i didn t believ we could lick such a crowd of spaniard and arab but i want to see the camel and eleph so i wa on hand next dai saturdai in the ambuscad and when we got the word we rush out of the wood and down the hill but there warn t no spaniard and arab and there warn t no camel nor no eleph it warn t anyth but a sundayschool picnic and onli a primerclass at that we bust it up and chase the children up the hollow but we never got anyth but some doughnut and jam though ben roger got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymnbook and a tract and then the teacher charg in and made us drop everyth and cut i didn t see no di mond and i told tom sawyer so he said there wa load of them there anywai and he said there wa arab there too and eleph and thing i said why couldn t we see them then he said if i warn t so ignor but had read a book call don quixot i would know without ask he said it wa all done by enchant he said there wa hundr of soldier there and eleph and treasur and so on but we had enemi which he call magician and thei had turn the whole thing into an infant sundayschool just out of spite i said all right then the thing for us to do wa to go for the magician tom sawyer said i wa a numskul why said he a magician could call up a lot of geni and thei would hash you up like noth befor you could sai jack robinson thei ar as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well i sai s pose we got some geni to help uscan t we lick the other crowd then how you go to get them i don t know how do thei get them why thei rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the geni come tear in with the thunder and lightn arip around and the smoke arol and everyth thei re told to do thei up and do it thei don t think noth of pull a shottow up by the root and belt a sundayschool superintend over the head with itor ani other man who make them tear around so why whoever rub the lamp or the ring thei belong to whoever rub the lamp or the ring and thei ve got to do whatev he sai if he tell them to build a palac forti mile long out of di mond and fill it full of chewinggum or whatev you want and fetch an emperor s daughter from china for you to marri thei ve got to do itand thei ve got to do it befor sunup next morn too and more thei ve got to waltz that palac around over the countri wherev you want it you understand well sai i i think thei ar a pack of flathead for not keep the palac themselv stead of fool them awai like that and what s moreif i wa on of them i would see a man in jericho befor i would drop my busi and come to him for the rub of an old tin lamp how you talk huck finn why you d have to come when he rub it whether you want to or not what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church all right then i would come but i lai i d make that man climb the highest tree there wa in the countri shuck it ain t no us to talk to you huck finn you don t seem to know anyth somehowperfect saphead i thought all thi over for two or three dai and then i reckon i would see if there wa anyth in it i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the wood and rub and rub till i sweat like an injun calcul to build a palac and sell it but it warn t no us none of the geni come so then i judg that all that stuff wa onli just on of tom sawyer s li i reckon he believ in the arab and the eleph but as for me i think differ it had all the

it ain t so no more it s the hand of a man that s start in on a new life and ll die befor he ll go back you mark them wordsdon t forget i said them it s a clean hand now shake itdon t be afeard so thei shook it on after the other all around and cri the judg s wife she kiss it then the old man he sign a pledgemad hi mark the judg said it wa the holiest time on record or someth like that then thei tuck the old man into a beauti room which wa the spare room and in the night some time he got power thirsti and clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and trade hi new coat for a jug of fortyrod and clumb back again and had a good old time and toward daylight he crawl out again drunk as a fiddler and roll off the porch and broke hi left arm in two place and wa most froze to death when somebodi found him after sunup and when thei come to look at that spare room thei had to take sound befor thei could navig it the judg he felt kind of sore he said he reckon a bodi could reform the old man with a shotgun mayb but he didn t know no other wai chapter vi well pretti soon the old man wa up and around again and then he went for judg thatcher in the court to make him give up that monei and he went for me too for not stop school he catch me a coupl of time and thrash me but i went to school just the same and dodg him or outrun him most of the time i didn t want to go to school much befor but i reckon i d go now to spite pap that law trial wa a slow businessappear like thei warn t ever go to get start on it so everi now and then i d borrow two or three dollar off of the judg for him to keep from get a cowhid everi time he got monei he got drunk and everi time he got drunk he rais cain around town and everi time he rais cain he got jail he wa just suitedthi kind of thing wa right in hi line he got to hang around the widow s too much and so she told him at last that if he didn t quit us around there she would make troubl for him well wasn t he mad he said he would show who wa huck finn s boss so he watch out for me on dai in the spring and catch me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff and cross over to the illinoi shore where it wa woodi and there warn t no hous but an old log hut in a place where the timber wa so thick you couldn t find it if you didn t know where it wa he kept me with him all the time and i never got a chanc to run off we live in that old cabin and he alwai lock the door and put the kei under hi head night he had a gun which he had stole i reckon and we fish and hunt and that wa what we live on everi littl while he lock me in and went down to the store three mile to the ferri and trade fish and game for whiski and fetch it home and got drunk and had a good time and lick me the widow she found out where i wa by and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove him off with the gun and it warn t long after that till i wa us to be where i wa and like ital but the cowhid part it wa kind of lazi and jolli lai off comfort all dai smoke and fish and no book nor studi two month or more run along and my cloth got to be all rag and dirt and i didn t see how i d ever got to like it so well at the widow s where you had to wash and eat on a plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forev bother over a book and have old miss watson peck at you all the time i didn t want to go back no more i had stop cuss becaus the widow didn t like it but now i took to it again becaus pap hadn t no object it wa pretti good time up in the wood there take it all around but by and by pap got too handi with hi hick ry and i couldn t stand it i wa all over welt he got to go awai so much too and lock me in onc he lock me in and wa gone three dai it wa dread lonesom i judg he had got drownd and i wasn t ever go to get out ani more i wa scare i made up my mind i would fix up some wai to leav there i had tri to get out of that cabin mani a time but i couldn t find no wai there warn t a window to it big enough for a dog to get through i couldn t get up the chimbl it wa too narrow the door wa thick solid oak slab pap wa pretti care not to leav a knife or anyth in the cabin when he wa awai i reckon i had hunt the place over as much as a hundr time well i wa most all the time at it becaus it wa about the onli wai to put in the time but thi time i found someth at last i found an old rusti woodsaw without ani handl it wa laid in between a rafter and the clapboard of the roof i greas it up and went to work there wa an old horseblanket nail against the log at the far end of the cabin behind the tabl to keep the wind from blow through the chink and put the candl out i got under the tabl and rais the blanket and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through well it wa a good long job but i wa get toward the end of it when i heard pap s gun in the wood i got rid of the sign of my work and drop the blanket and hid my saw and pretti soon pap come in pap warn t in a good humorso he wa hi natur self he said he wa down town and everyth wa go wrong hi lawyer said he reckon he would win hi lawsuit and get the monei if thei ever got start on the trial but then there wa wai to put it off a long time and judg thatcher know how to do it and he said peopl allow there d be anoth trial to get me awai from him and give me to the widow for my guardian and thei guess it would win thi time thi shook me up consider becaus i didn t want to go back to the widow s ani more and be so cramp up and sivil as thei call it then the old man got to cuss and cuss everyth and everybodi he could think of and then cuss them all over again to make sure he hadn t skip ani and after that he polish off with a kind of a gener cuss all round includ a consider parcel of peopl which he didn t know the name of and so call them what shisnam when he got to them and went right along with hi cuss he said he would like to see the widow get me he said he would watch out and if thei tri to come ani such game on him he know of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in where thei might hunt till thei drop and thei couldn t find me that made me pretti uneasi again but onli for a minut i reckon i wouldn t stai on hand till he got that chanc the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the thing he had got there wa a fiftypound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon ammunit and a fourgallon jug of whiski and an old book and two newspap for wad besid some tow i tote up a load and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest i thought it all over and i reckon i would walk off with the gun and some line and take to the wood when i run awai i guess i wouldn t stai in on place but just tramp right across the countri mostli night time and hunt and fish to keep aliv and so get so far awai that the old man nor the widow couldn t ever find me ani more i judg i would saw out and leav that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckon he would i got so full of it i didn t notic how long i wa stai till the old man holler and ask me whether i wa asleep or drownd i got the thing all up to the cabin and then it wa about dark while i wa cook supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warm up and went to rip again he had been drunk over in town and laid in the gutter all night and he wa a sight to look at a bodi would a thought he wa adamh wa just all mud whenev hi liquor begun to work he most alwai went for the govment thi time he sai call thi a govment why just look at it and see what it s like here s the law astand readi to take a man s son awai from hima man s own son which he ha had all the troubl and all the anxieti and all the expens of rais ye just as that man ha got that son rais at last and readi to go to work and begin to do suthin for him and give him a rest the law up and goe for him and thei call that govment that ain t all nuther the law back that old judg thatcher up and help him to keep me out o my properti here s what the law doe the law take a man worth six thousand dollar and up ard and jam him into an old trap of a cabin like thi and let him go round in cloth that ain t fitten for a hog thei call that govment a man can t get hi right in a govment like thi sometim i ve a mighti notion to just leav the countri for good and all ye and i told em so i told old thatcher so to hi face lot of em heard me and can tell what i said sai i for two cent i d leav the blame countri and never come anear it agin them s the veri word i sai look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid rais up and the rest of it goe down till it s below my chin and then it ain t rightli a hat at all but more like my head wa shove up through a jint o stovepip look at it sai isuch a hat for me to wearon of the wealthiest men in thi town if i could git my right oh ye thi is a wonder govment wonder why looki here there wa a free nigger there from ohioa mulatt most as white as a white man he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the shiniest hat and there ain t a man in that town that s got as fine cloth as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a silverhead caneth awfulest old grayhead nabob in the state and what do you think thei said he wa a p fessor in a colleg and could talk all kind of languag and know everyth and that ain t the wust thei said he could vote when he wa at home well that let me out think i what is the countri acom to it wa lection dai and i wa just about to go and vote myself if i warn t too drunk to get there but when thei told me there wa a state in thi countri where thei d let that nigger vote i draw out i sai i ll never vote agin them s the veri word i said thei all heard me and the countri mai rot for all mei ll never vote agin as long as i live and to see the cool wai of that niggerwhi he wouldn t a give me the road if i hadn t shove him out o the wai i sai to the peopl why ain t thi nigger put up at auction and soldthat s what i want to know and what do you reckon thei said why thei said he couldn t be sold till he d been in the state six month and he hadn t been there that long yet there nowthat s a specimen thei call that a govment that can t sell a free nigger till he s been in the state six month here s a govment that call itself a govment and let on to be a govment and think it is a govment and yet s got to set stockstil for six whole month befor it can take a hold of a prowl thiev infern whiteshirt free nigger and pap wa ago on so he never notic where hi old limber leg wa take him to so he went head over heel over the tub of salt pork and bark both shin and the rest of hi speech wa all the hottest kind of languagemostli hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the tub some too all along here and there he hop around the cabin consider first on on leg and then on the other hold first on shin and then the other on and at last he let out with hi left foot all of a sudden and fetch the tub a rattl kick but it warn t good judgment becaus that wa the boot that had a coupl of hi toe leak out of the front end of it so now he rais a howl that fairli made a bodi s hair rais and down he went in the dirt and roll there and held hi toe and the cuss he done then laid over anyth he had ever done previou he said so hi own self afterward he had heard old sowberri hagan in hi best dai and he said it laid over him too but i reckon that wa sort of pile it on mayb after supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whiski there for two drunk and on delirium tremen that wa alwai hi word i judg he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would steal the kei or saw myself out on or t other he drank and drank and tumbl down on hi blanket by and by but luck didn t run my wai he didn t go sound asleep but wa uneasi he groan and moan and thrash around thi wai and that for a long time at last i got so sleepi i couldn t keep my ey open all i could do and so befor i know what i wa about i wa sound asleep and the candl burn i don t know how long i wa asleep but all of a sudden there wa an aw scream and i wa up there wa pap look wild and skip around everi which wai and yell about snake he said thei wa crawl up hi leg and then he would give a jump and scream and sai on had bit him on the cheekbut i couldn t see no snake he start and run round and round the cabin holler take him off take him off he s bite me on the neck i never see a man look so wild in the ey pretti soon he wa all fag out and fell down pant then he roll over and over wonder fast kick thing everi which wai and strike and grab at the air with hi hand and scream and sai there wa devil ahold of him he wore out by and by and laid still a while moan then he laid stiller and didn t make a sound i could hear the owl and the wolv awai off in the wood and it seem terribl still he wa lai over by the corner by and by he rais up part wai and listen with hi head to on side he sai veri low tramptramptramp that s the dead tramptramptramp thei re come after me but i won t go oh thei re here don t touch medon t hand offthei re cold let go oh let a poor devil alon then he went down on all four and crawl off beg them to let him alon and he roll himself up in hi blanket and wallow in under the old pine tabl still abeg and then he went to cry i could hear him through the blanket by and by he roll out and jump up on hi feet look wild and he see me and went for me he chase me round and round the place with a claspknif call me the angel of death and sai he would kill me and then i couldn t come for him no more i beg and told him i wa onli huck but he laugh such a screechi laugh and roar and cuss and kept on chase me up onc when i turn short and dodg under hi arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulder and i thought i wa gone but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightn and save myself pretti soon he wa all tire out and drop down with hi back against the door and said he would rest a minut and then kill me he put hi knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and then he would see who wa who so he doze off pretti soon by and by i got the old splitbottom chair and clumb up as easi as i could not to make ani nois and got down the gun i slip the ramrod down it to make sure it wa load then i laid it across the turnip barrel point toward pap and set down behind it to wait for him to stir and how slow and still the time did drag along chapter vii git up what you bout i open my ey and look around try to make out where i wa it wa after sunup and i had been sound asleep pap wa stand over me look sour and sick too he sai what you doin with thi gun i judg he didn t know noth about what he had been do so i sai somebodi tri to get in so i wa lai for him why didn t you roust me out well i tri to but i couldn t i couldn t budg you well all right don t stand there palav all dai but out with you and see if there s a fish on the line for breakfast i ll be along in a minut he unlock the door and i clear out up the riverbank i notic some piec of limb and such thing float down and a sprinkl of bark so i know the river had begun to rise i reckon i would have great time now if i wa over at the town the june rise us to be alwai luck for me becaus as soon as that rise begin here come cordwood float down and piec of log raftssometim a dozen log togeth so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the woodyard and the sawmil i went along up the bank with on ey out for pap and t other on out for what the rise might fetch along well all at onc here come a cano just a beauti too about thirteen or fourteen foot long ride high like a duck i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog cloth and all on and struck out for the cano i just expect there d be somebodi lai down in it becaus peopl often done that to fool folk and when a chap had pull a skiff out most to it thei d rais up and laugh at him but it warn t so thi time it wa a driftcano sure enough and i clumb in and paddl her ashor think i the old man will be glad when he see thissh s worth ten dollar but when i got to shore pap wasn t in sight yet and as i wa run her into a littl creek like a gulli all hung over with vine and willow i struck anoth idea i judg i d hide her good and then stead of take to the wood when i run off i d go down the river about fifti mile and camp in on place for good and not have such a rough time tramp on foot it wa pretti close to the shanti and i thought i heard the old man come all the time but i got her hid and then i out and look around a bunch of willow and there wa the old man down the path a piec just draw a bead on a bird with hi gun so he hadn t seen anyth when he got along i wa hard at it take up a trot line he abus me a littl for be so slow but i told him i fell in the river and that wa what made me so long i know he would see i wa wet and then he would be ask question we got five catfish off the line and went home while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us be about wore out i got to think that if i could fix up some wai to keep pap and the widow from try to follow me it would be a certain thing than trust to luck to get far enough off befor thei miss me you see all kind of thing might happen well i didn t see no wai for a while but by and by pap rais up a minut to drink anoth barrel of water and he sai anoth time a man come aprowl round here you roust me out you hear that man warn t here for no good i d a shot him next time you roust me out you hear then he drop down and went to sleep again but what he had been sai give me the veri idea i want i sai to myself i can fix it now so nobodi won t think of follow me about twelv o clock we turn out and went along up the bank the river wa come up pretti fast and lot of driftwood go by on the rise by and by along come part of a log raftnin log fast togeth we went out with the skiff and tow it ashor then we had dinner anybodi but pap would a wait and seen the dai through so as to catch more stuff but that warn t pap s style nine log wa enough for on time he must shove right over to town and sell so he lock me in and took the skiff and start off tow the raft about halfpast three i judg he wouldn t come back that night i wait till i reckon he had got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on that log again befor he wa t other side of the river i wa out of the hole him and hi raft wa just a speck on the water awai off yonder i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the cano wa hid and shove the vine and branch apart and put it in then i done the same with the side of bacon then the whiskyjug i took all the coffe and sugar there wa and all the ammunit i took the wad i took the bucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two blanket and the skillet and the coffeepot i took fishlin and match and other thingseveryth that wa worth a cent i clean out the place i want an ax but there wasn t ani onli the on out at the woodpil and i know why i wa go to leav that i fetch out the gun and now i wa done i had wore the ground a good deal crawl out of the hole and drag out so mani thing so i fix that as good as i could from the outsid by scatter dust on the place which cover up the smooth and the sawdust then i fix the piec of log back into it place and put two rock under it and on against it to hold it there for it wa bent up at that place and didn t quit touch ground if you stood four or five foot awai and didn t know it wa saw you wouldn t never notic it and besid thi wa the back of the cabin and it warn t like anybodi would go fool around there it wa all grass clear to the cano so i hadn t left a track i follow around to see i stood on the bank and look out over the river all safe so i took the gun and went up a piec into the wood and wa hunt around for some bird when i see a wild pig hog soon went wild in them bottom after thei had got awai from the prairi farm i shot thi fellow and took him into camp i took the ax and smash in the door i beat it and hack it consider ado it i fetch the pig in and took him back nearli to the tabl and hack into hi throat with the ax and laid him down on the ground to bleed i sai ground becaus it wa groundhard pack and no board well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rock in ital i could dragand i start it from the pig and drag it to the door and through the wood down to the river and dump it in and down it sunk out of sight you could easi see that someth had been drag over the ground i did wish tom sawyer wa there i know he would take an interest in thi kind of busi and throw in the fanci touch nobodi could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as that well last i pull out some of my hair and blood the ax good and stuck it on the back side and slung the ax in the corner then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldn t drip till i got a good piec below the hous and then dump him into the river now i thought of someth els so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the cano and fetch them to the hous i took the bag to where it us to stand and rip a hole in the bottom of it with the saw for there warn t no knive and fork on the placepap done everyth with hi claspknif about the cook then i carri the sack about a hundr yard across the grass and through the willow east of the hous to a shallow lake that wa five mile wide and full of rushesand duck too you might sai in the season there wa a slough or a creek lead out of it on the other side that went mile awai i don t know where but it didn t go to the river the meal sift out and made a littl track all the wai to the lake i drop pap s whetston there too so as to look like it had been done by accid then i ti up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldn t leak no more and took it and my saw to the cano again it wa about dark now so i drop the cano down the river under some willow that hung over the bank and wait for the moon to rise i made fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in the cano to smoke a pipe and lai out a plan i sai to myself thei ll follow the track of that sack of rock to the shore and then drag the river for me and thei ll follow that meal track to the lake and go brows down the creek that lead out of it to find the robber that kill me and took the thing thei won t ever hunt the river for anyth but my dead carcass thei ll soon get tire of that and won t bother no more about me all right i can stop anywher i want to jackson s island is good enough for me i know that island pretti well and nobodi ever come there and then i can paddl over to town night and slink around and pick up thing i want jackson s island s the place i wa pretti tire and the first thing i know i wa asleep when i woke up i didn t know where i wa for a minut i set up and look around a littl scare then i rememb the river look mile and mile across the moon wa so bright i could a count the drift log that went aslip along black and still hundr of yard out from shore everyth wa dead quiet and it look late and smelt late you know what i meani don t know the word to put it in i took a good gap and a stretch and wa just go to unhitch and start when i heard a sound awai over the water i listen pretti soon i made it out it wa that dull kind of a regular sound that come from oar work in rowlock when it s a still night i peep out through the willow branch and there it wasa skiff awai across the water i couldn t tell how mani wa in it it kept acom and when it wa abreast of me i see there warn t but on man in it think s i mayb it s pap though i warn t expect him he drop below me with the current and by and by he came aswing up shore in the easi water and he went by so close i could a reach out the gun and touch him well it wa pap sure enoughand sober too by the wai he laid hi oar i didn t lose no time the next minut i wa aspin down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank i made two mile and a half and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more toward the middl of the river becaus pretti soon i would be pass the ferri land and peopl might see me and hail me i got out amongst the driftwood and then laid down in the bottom of the cano and let her float i laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe look awai into the sky not a cloud in it the sky look ever so deep when you lai down on your back in the moonshin i never know it befor and how far a bodi can hear on the water such night i heard peopl talk at the ferri land i heard what thei said tooeveri word of it on man said it wa get toward the long dai and the short night now t other on said thi warn t on of the short on he reckonedand then thei laugh and he said it over again and thei laugh again then thei wake up anoth fellow and told him and laugh but he didn t laugh he rip out someth brisk and said let him alon the first fellow said he low to tell it to hi old womansh would think it wa pretti good but he said that warn t noth to some thing he had said in hi time i heard on man sai it wa nearli three o clock and he hope daylight wouldn t wait more than about a week longer after that the talk got further and further awai and i couldn t make out the word ani more but i could hear the mumbl and now and then a laugh too but it seem a long wai off i wa awai below the ferri now i rose up and there wa jackson s island about two mile and a half down stream heavi timber and stand up out of the middl of the river big and dark and solid like a steamboat without ani light there warn t ani sign of the bar at the headit wa all under water now it didn t take me long to get there i shot past the head at a rip rate the current wa so swift and then i got into the dead water and land on the side toward the illinoi shore i run the cano into a deep dent in the bank that i know about i had to part the willow branch to get in and when i made fast nobodi could a seen the cano from the outsid i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and look out on the big river and the black driftwood and awai over to the town three mile awai where there wa three or four light twinkl a monstrou big lumberraft wa about a mile up stream come along down with a lantern in the middl of it i watch it come creep down and when it wa most abreast of where i stood i heard a man sai stern oar there heav her head to stabboard i heard that just as plain as if the man wa by my side there wa a littl grai in the sky now so i step into the wood and laid down for a nap befor breakfast chapter viii the sun wa up so high when i wake that i judg it wa after eight o clock i laid there in the grass and the cool shade think about thing and feel rest and ruther comfort and satisfi i could see the sun out at on or two hole but mostli it wa big tree all about and gloomi in there amongst them there wa freckl place on the ground where the light sift down through the leav and the freckl place swap about a littl show there wa a littl breez up there a coupl of squirrel set on a limb and jabber at me veri friendli i wa power lazi and comfortabledidn t want to get up and cook breakfast well i wa doze off again when i think i hear a deep sound of boom awai up the river i rous up and rest on my elbow and listen pretti soon i hear it again i hop up and went and look out at a hole in the leav and i see a bunch of smoke lai on the water a long wai upabout abreast the ferri and there wa the ferryboat full of peopl float along down i know what wa the matter now boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat s side you see thei wa fire cannon over the water try to make my carcass come to the top i wa pretti hungri but it warn t go to do for me to start a fire becaus thei might see the smoke so i set there and watch the cannonsmok and listen to the boom the river wa a mile wide there and it alwai look pretti on a summer morningso i wa have a good enough time see them hunt for my remaind if i onli had a bite to eat well then i happen to think how thei alwai put quicksilv in loav of bread and float them off becaus thei alwai go right to the drownd carcass and stop there so sai i i ll keep a lookout and if ani of them s float around after me i ll give them a show i chang to the illinoi edg of the island to see what luck i could have and i warn t disappoint a big doubl loaf come along and i most got it with a long stick but my foot slip and she float out further of cours i wa where the current set in the closest to the shorei know enough for that but by and by along come anoth on and thi time i won i took out the plug and shook out the littl dab of quicksilv and set my teeth in it wa baker s bread what the qualiti eat none of your lowdown cornpon i got a good place amongst the leav and set there on a log munch the bread and watch the ferryboat and veri well satisfi and then someth struck me i sai now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebodi prai that thi bread would find me and here it ha gone and done it so there ain t no doubt but there is someth in that thingthat is there s someth in it when a bodi like the widow or the parson prai but it don t work for me and i reckon it don t work for onli just the right kind i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watch the ferryboat wa float with the current and i allow i d have a chanc to see who wa aboard when she come along becaus she would come in close where the bread did when she d got pretti well along down toward me i put out my pipe and went to where i fish out the bread and laid down behind a log on the bank in a littl open place where the log fork i could peep through by and by she come along and she drift in so close that thei could a run out a plank and walk ashor most everybodi wa on the boat pap and judg thatcher and bessi thatcher and jo harper and tom sawyer and hi old aunt polli and sid and mari and plenti more everybodi wa talk about the murder but the captain broke in and sai look sharp now the current set in the closest here and mayb he s wash ashor and got tangl amongst the brush at the water s edg i hope so anywai i didn t hope so thei all crowd up and lean over the rail nearli in my face and kept still watch with all their might i could see them firstrat but thei couldn t see me then the captain sung out stand awai and the cannon let off such a blast right befor me that it made me deef with the nois and pretti near blind with the smoke and i judg i wa gone if thei d a had some bullet in i reckon thei d a got the corps thei wa after well i see i warn t hurt thank to good the boat float on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island i could hear the boom now and then further and further off and by and by after an hour i didn t hear it no more the island wa three mile long i judg thei had got to the foot and wa give it up but thei didn t yet a while thei turn around the foot of the island and start up the channel on the missouri side under steam and boom onc in a while as thei went i cross over to that side and watch them when thei got abreast the head of the island thei quit shoot and drop over to the missouri shore and went home to the town i know i wa all right now nobodi els would come ahunt after me i got my trap out of the cano and made me a nice camp in the thick wood i made a kind of a tent out of my blanket to put my thing under so the rain couldn t get at them i catch a catfish and haggl him open with my saw and toward sundown i start my camp fire and had supper then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast when it wa dark i set by my camp fire smoke and feel pretti well satisfi but by and by it got sort of lonesom and so i went and set on the bank and listen to the current swash along and count the star and drift log and raft that come down and then went to bed there ain t no better wai to put in time when you ar lonesom you can t stai so you soon get over it and so for three dai and night no differencejust the same thing but the next dai i went explor around down through the island i wa boss of it it all belong to me so to sai and i want to know all about it but mainli i want to put in the time i found plenti strawberri ripe and prime and green summer grape and green razberri and the green blackberri wa just begin to show thei would all come handi by and by i judg well i went fool along in the deep wood till i judg i warn t far from the foot of the island i had my gun along but i hadn t shot noth it wa for protect thought i would kill some game nigh home about thi time i mighti near step on a goodsiz snake and it went slide off through the grass and flower and i after it try to get a shot at it i clip along and all of a sudden i bound right on to the ash of a camp fire that wa still smoke my heart jump up amongst my lung i never wait for to look further but uncock my gun and went sneak back on my tipto as fast as ever i could everi now and then i stop a second amongst the thick leav and listen but my breath come so hard i couldn t hear noth els i slunk along anoth piec further then listen again and so on and so on if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trod on a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut on of my breath in two and i onli got half and the short half too when i got to camp i warn t feel veri brash there warn t much sand in my craw but i sai thi ain t no time to be fool around so i got all my trap into my cano again so as to have them out of sight and i put out the fire and scatter the ash around to look like an old last year s camp and then clumb a tree i reckon i wa up in the tree two hour but i didn t see noth i didn t hear nothingi onli thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand thing well i couldn t stai up there forev so at last i got down but i kept in the thick wood and on the lookout all the time all i could get to eat wa berri and what wa left over from breakfast by the time it wa night i wa pretti hungri so when it wa good and dark i slid out from shore befor moonris and paddl over to the illinoi bankabout a quarter of a mile i went out in the wood and cook a supper and i had about made up my mind i would stai there all night when i hear a plunketyplunk plunketyplunk and sai to myself hors come and next i hear peopl s voic i got everyth into the cano as quick as i could and then went creep through the wood to see what i could find out i hadn t got far when i hear a man sai we better camp here if we can find a good place the hors is about beat out let s look around i didn t wait but shove out and paddl awai easi i ti up in the old place and reckon i would sleep in the cano i didn t sleep much i couldn t somehow for think and everi time i wake up i thought somebodi had me by the neck so the sleep didn t do me no good by and by i sai to myself i can t live thi wai i m ago to find out who it is that s here on the island with me i ll find it out or bust well i felt better right off so i took my paddl and slid out from shore just a step or two and then let the cano drop along down amongst the shadow the moon wa shine and outsid of the shadow it made it most as light as dai i poke along well on to an hour everyth still as rock and sound asleep well by thi time i wa most down to the foot of the island a littl rippli cool breez begun to blow and that wa as good as sai the night wa about done i give her a turn with the paddl and brung her nose to shore then i got my gun and slip out and into the edg of the wood i sat down there on a log and look out through the leav i see the moon go off watch and the dark begin to blanket the river but in a littl while i see a pale streak over the treetop and know the dai wa come so i took my gun and slip off toward where i had run across that camp fire stop everi minut or two to listen but i hadn t no luck somehow i couldn t seem to find the place but by and by sure enough i catch a glimps of fire awai through the tree i went for it cautiou and slow by and by i wa close enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground it most give

want no mo chapter ix i want to go and look at a place right about the middl of the island that i d found when i wa explor so we start and soon got to it becaus the island wa onli three mile long and a quarter of a mile wide thi place wa a toler long steep hill or ridg about forti foot high we had a rough time get to the top the side wa so steep and the bush so thick we tramp and clumb around all over it and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side toward illinoi the cavern wa as big as two or three room bunch togeth and jim could stand up straight in it it wa cool in there jim wa for put our trap in there right awai but i said we didn t want to be climb up and down there all the time jim said if we had the cano hid in a good place and had all the trap in the cavern we could rush there if anybodi wa to come to the island and thei would never find us without dog and besid he said them littl bird had said it wa go to rain and did i want the thing to get wet so we went back and got the cano and paddl up abreast the cavern and lug all the trap up there then we hunt up a place close by to hide the cano in amongst the thick willow we took some fish off of the line and set them again and begun to get readi for dinner the door of the cavern wa big enough to roll a hogshead in and on on side of the door the floor stuck out a littl bit and wa flat and a good place to build a fire on so we built it there and cook dinner we spread the blanket insid for a carpet and eat our dinner in there we put all the other thing handi at the back of the cavern pretti soon it darken up and begun to thunder and lighten so the bird wa right about it directli it begun to rain and it rain like all furi too and i never see the wind blow so it wa on of these regular summer storm it would get so dark that it look all blueblack outsid and love and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the tree off a littl wai look dim and spiderwebbi and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the tree down and turn up the pale undersid of the leav and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branch to toss their arm as if thei wa just wild and next when it wa just about the bluest and blackestfst it wa as bright as glori and you d have a littl glimps of treetop aplung about awai off yonder in the storm hundr of yard further than you could see befor dark as sin again in a second and now you d hear the thunder let go with an aw crash and then go rumbl grumbl tumbl down the sky toward the under side of the world like roll

side it wa a good mani mile wide but on the missouri side it wa the same old distanc acrossa half a milebecaus the missouri shore wa just a wall of high bluff daytim we paddl all over the island in the cano it wa mighti cool and shadi in the deep wood even if the sun wa blaze outsid we went wind in and out amongst the tree and sometim the vine hung so thick we had to back awai and go some other wai well on everi old brokendown tree you could see rabbit and snake and such thing and when the island had been overflow a dai or two thei got so tame on account of be hungri that you could paddl right up and put your hand on them if you want to but not the snake and turtlesthei would slide off in the water the ridg our cavern wa in wa full of them we could a had pet enough if we d want them

on the west side she wa a twostori and tilt over consider we paddl out and got aboardclumb in at an upstair window but it wa too dark to see yet so we made the cano fast and set in her to wait for daylight the light begun to come befor we got to the foot of the island then we look in at the window we could make out a bed and a tabl and two old chair and lot of thing around about on the floor and there wa cloth hang against the wall there wa someth lai on the floor in the far corner that look like a man so jim sai hello you but it didn t budg so i holler again and then jim sai de man ain t

sunbonnet and some women s undercloth hang against the wall and some men s cloth too we put the lot into the canoeit might come good there wa a boi s old speckl straw hat on the floor i took that too and there wa a bottl that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a babi to suck we would a took the bottl but it wa broke there wa a seedi old chest and an old hair trunk with the hing broke thei stood open but there warn t noth left in them that wa ani account the wai thing wa scatter about we reckon the peopl left in a hurri and warn t fix so as to carri off most of their stuff we got

bedquilt off the bed and a reticul with needl and pin and beeswax and button and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet and some nail and a fishlin as thick as my littl finger with some monstrou hook on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dogcollar and a horsesho and some vial of medicin that didn t have no label on them and just as we wa leav i found a toler good currycomb and jim he found a ratti old fiddlebow and a wooden leg the strap wa broke off of it but bar that it wa a good enough leg though it wa too long for me and not long enough for jim and we couldn t find the other on though we hunt all around and so take it all around we made a good haul when we wa readi to shove off we wa a quarter of a mile below the island and it wa pretti broad dai so i made jim lai down in the cano and cover up with the quilt becaus if he set up peopl could tell he wa a nigger a good wai off i paddl over to the illinoi shore and drift down most a half a mile do it i crept up the dead water under the bank and hadn t no accid and didn t see nobodi we got home all safe chapter x after breakfast i want to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be kill but jim didn t want to he said it would fetch bad luck and besid he said he might come and ha nt us he said a man that warn t buri wa more like to go aha nting around than on that wa plant and comfort that sound pretti reason so i didn t sai no more but i couldn t keep from studi over it and wish i know who shot the man and what thei done it for we rummag the cloth we d got and found eight dollar in silver sew up in the line of an old blanket overcoat jim said he reckon the peopl in that hous stole the coat becaus if thei d a know the monei wa there thei wouldn t a left it i said i reckon thei kill him too but jim didn t want to talk about that i sai now you think it s bad luck but what did you sai when i fetch in the snakeskin that i found on the top of the ridg dai befor yesterdai you said it wa the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hand well here s your bad luck we ve rake in all thi truck and eight dollar besid i wish we could have some bad luck like thi everi dai jim never you mind honei never you mind don t you git too peart it s acomin mind i tell you it s acomin it did come too it wa a tuesdai that we had that talk well after dinner fridai we wa lai around in the grass at the upper end of the ridg and got out of tobacco i went to the cavern to get some and found a rattlesnak in there i kill him and curl him up on the foot of jim s blanket ever so natur think there d be some fun when jim found him there well by night i forgot all about the snake and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snake s mate wa there and bit him he jump up yell and the first thing the light show wa the varmint curl up and readi for anoth spring i laid him out in a second with a stick and jim grab pap s whiskyjug and begun to pour it down he wa barefoot and the snake bit him right on the heel that all come of my be such a fool as to not rememb that wherev you leav a dead snake it mate alwai come there and curl around it jim told me to chop off the snake s head and throw it awai and then skin the bodi and roast a piec of it i done it and he eat it and said it would help cure him he made me take off the rattl and tie them around hi wrist too he said that that would help then i slid out quiet and throw the snake clear awai amongst the bush for i warn t go to let jim find out it wa all my fault not if i could help it jim suck and suck at the jug and now and then he got out of hi head and pitch around and yell but everi time he come to himself he went to suck at the jug again hi foot swell up pretti big and so did hi leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judg he wa all right but i d druther been bit with a snake than pap s whiski jim wa laid up for four dai and night then the swell wa all gone and he wa around again i made up my mind i wouldn t ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hand now that i see what had come of it jim said he reckon i would believ him next time and he said that handl a snakeskin wa such aw bad luck that mayb we hadn t got to the end of it yet he said he druther see the new moon over hi left shoulder as much as a thousand time than take up a snakeskin in hi hand well i wa get to feel that wai myself though i ve alwai reckon that look at the new moon over your left shoulder is on of the carelessest and foolishest thing a bodi can do old hank bunker done it onc and brag about it and in less than two year he got drunk and fell off of the shottow and spread himself out so that he wa just a kind of a layer as you mai sai and thei slid him edgewai between two barn door for a coffin and buri him so so thei sai but i didn t see it pap told me but anywai it all come of look at the moon that wai like a fool well the dai went along and the river went down between it bank again and about the first thing we done wa to bait on of the big hook with a skin rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that wa as big as a man be six foot two inch long and weigh over two hundr pound we couldn t handl him of cours he would a flung us into illinoi we just set there and watch him rip and tear around till he drownd we found a brass button in hi stomach and a round ball and lot of rubbag we split the ball open with the hatchet and there wa a spool in it jim said he d had it there a long time to coat it over so and make a ball of it it wa as big a fish as wa ever catch in the mississippi i reckon jim said he hadn t ever seen a bigger on he would a been worth a good deal over at the villag thei peddl out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethous there everybodi bui some of him hi meat s as white as snow and make a good fry next morn i said it wa get slow and dull and i want to get a stir up some wai i said i reckon i would slip over the river and find out what wa go on jim like that notion but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp then he studi it over and said couldn t i put on some of them old thing and dress up like a girl that wa a good notion too so we shorten up on of the calico gown and i turn up my trouserleg to my knee and got into it jim hitch it behind with the hook and it wa a fair fit i put on the sunbonnet and ti it under my chin and then for a bodi to look in and see my face wa like look down a joint of stovepip jim said nobodi would know me even in the daytim hardli i practic around all dai to get the hang of the thing and by and by i could do pretti well in them onli jim said i didn t walk like a girl and he said i must quit pull up my gown to get at my britchespocket i took notic and done better i start up the illinoi shore in the cano just after dark i start across to the town from a littl below the ferryland and the drift of the current fetch me in at the bottom of the town i ti up and start along the bank there

knit by a candl that wa on a pine tabl i didn t know her face she wa a stranger for you couldn t start a face in that town that i didn t know now thi wa lucki becaus i wa weaken i wa get afraid i had come peopl might know my voic and find me out but if thi woman had been in such a littl town two dai she could tell me all i want to know so i knock at the door and made up my mind i wouldn t forget i

road s a rocki on and your feet ll be in a condit when you get to goshen i reckon i went up the bank about fifti yard and then i doubl on my track and slip back to where my cano wa a good piec below the hous i jump in and wa off in a hurri i went upstream far enough to make the head of the island and then start across i took off the sunbonnet for i didn t want no blinder on then when i wa about the middl i heard the clock begin to strike so i stop and listen the sound come faint over the water but cleareleven when i struck the head of the island i never wait to blow though i wa most wind but i shove right into the timber where my old camp us to be and start a good fire there on a high and dry spot then i jump in the cano and dug out for our place a mile and a half below as hard as i could go i land and slop through the timber and up the ridg and into the cavern there jim laid sound asleep on the ground i rous him out and sai git up and hump yourself jim there ain t a minut to lose thei re after us jim never ask no question he never said a word but the wai he work for the next half an hour show about how he wa scare by that time everyth we had in the world wa on our raft and she wa readi to be shove out from the willow cove where she wa hid we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didn t show a candl outsid after that i took the cano out from the shore a littl piec and took a look but if there wa a boat around i couldn t see it for star and shadow ain t good to see by then we got out the raft and slip along down in the shade past the foot of the island dead stillnev sai a word chapter xii it must a been close on to on o clock when we got below the island at last and the raft did seem to go mighti slow if a boat wa to come along we wa go to take to the cano and break for the illinoi shore and it wa well a boat didn t come for we hadn t ever thought to put the gun in the cano or a fishinglin or anyth to eat we wa in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so mani thing it warn t good judgment to put everyth on the raft if the men went to the island i just expect thei found the camp fire i built and watch it all night for jim to come anywai thei stai awai from us and if my build the fire never fool them it warn t no fault of mine i plai it as low down on them as i could when the first streak of dai began to show we ti up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinoi side and hack off cottonwood branch with the hatchet and cover up the raft with them so she look like there had been a cavein in the bank there a towhead is a sandbar that ha cottonwood on it as thick as harrowteeth we had mountain on the missouri shore and heavi timber on the illinoi side and the channel wa down the missouri shore at that place so we warn t afraid of anybodi run across us we laid there all dai and watch the raft and steamboat spin down the missouri shore and upbound steamboat fight the big river in the middl i told jim all about the time i had jabber with that woman and jim said she wa a smart on and if she wa to start after us herself she wouldn t set down and watch a camp fireno sir she d fetch a dog well then i said why couldn t she tell her husband to fetch a dog jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men wa readi to start and he believ thei must a gone uptown to get a dog and so thei lost all that time or els we wouldn t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the villageno indeedi we would be in that same old town again so i said i didn t care what wa the reason thei didn t get us as long as thei didn t when it wa begin to come on dark we poke our head out of the cottonwood thicket and look up and down and across noth in sight so jim took up some of the top plank of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blaze weather and raini and to keep the thing dry jim made a floor for the wigwam and rais it a foot or more abov the level of the raft so now the blanket and all the trap wa out of reach of steamboat wave right in the middl of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inch deep with a frame around it for to hold it to it place thi wa to build a fire on in sloppi weather or chilli the wigwam would keep it from be seen we made an extra steeringoar too becaus on of the other might get broke on a snag or someth we fix up a short fork stick to hang the old lantern on becaus we must alwai light the lantern whenev we see a steamboat come downstream to keep from get run over but we wouldn t have to light it for upstream boat unless we see we wa in what thei call a cross for the river wa pretti high yet veri low bank be still a littl under water so upbound boat didn t alwai run the channel but hunt easi water thi second night we run between seven and eight hour with a current that wa make over four mile an hour we catch fish and talk and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepi it wa kind of solemn drift down the big still river lai on our back look up at the star and we didn t ever feel like talk loud and it warn t often that we laughedonli a littl kind of a low chuckl we had mighti good weather as a gener thing and noth ever happen to us at allthat night nor the next nor the next everi night we pass town some of them awai up on black hillsid noth but just a shini bed of light not a hous could you see the fifth night we pass st loui and it wa like the whole world lit up in st petersburg thei us to sai there wa twenti or thirti thousand peopl in st loui but i never believ it till i see that wonder spread of light at two o clock that still night there warn t a sound there everybodi wa asleep everi night now i us to slip ashor toward ten o clock at some littl villag and bui ten or fifteen cent worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat and sometim i lift a chicken that warn t roost comfort and took him along pap alwai said take a chicken when you get a chanc becaus if you don t want him yourself you can easi find somebodi that doe and a good deed ain t ever forgot i never see pap when he didn t want the chicken himself but that is what he us to sai anywai morn befor daylight i slip into cornfield and borrow a watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or thing of that kind pap alwai said it warn t no harm to borrow thing if you wa mean to pai them back some time but the widow said it warn t anyth but a soft name for steal and no decent bodi would do it jim said he reckon the widow wa partli right and pap wa partli right so the best wai would be for us to pick out two or three thing from the list and sai we wouldn t borrow them ani morethen he reckon it wouldn t be no harm to borrow the other so we talk it over all on night drift along down the river try to make up our mind whether to drop the watermelon or the cantelop or the mushmelon or what but toward daylight we got it all settl satisfactori and conclud to drop crabappl and p simmon we warn t feel just right befor that but it wa all comfort now i wa glad the wai it come out too becaus crabappl ain t ever good and the p simmon wouldn t be ripe for two or three month yet we shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too earli in the morn or didn t go to bed earli enough in the even take it all round we live pretti high the fifth night below st loui we had a big storm after midnight with a power of thunder and lightn and the rain pour down in a solid sheet we stai in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself when the lightn glare out we could see a big straight river ahead and high rocki bluff on both side by and by sai i hello jim looki yonder it wa a steamboat that had kill herself on a rock we wa drift straight down for her the lightn show her veri distinct she wa lean over with part of her upper deck abov water and you could see everi littl chimblygui clean and clear and a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hang on the back of it when the flash come well it be awai in the night and stormi and all so mysteriouslik i felt just the wai ani other boi would a felt when i see that wreck lai there so mourn and lonesom in the middl of the river i want to get aboard of her and slink

resk hi life for a texa and a pilothous such a night as thi when it s like to break up and wash off down the river ani minut jim couldn t sai noth to that so he didn t try and besid i sai we might borrow someth worth have out of the captain s stateroom seegar i bet youand cost five cent apiec solid cash steamboat captain is alwai rich and get sixti dollar a month and thei don t care a cent what a thing cost you know long as thei want it stick a candl in your pocket i can t rest jim till we give her a rummag do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by thi thing not for pie he wouldn t he d call it an adventurethat s what he d call it and he d land on that wreck if it wa hi last act and wouldn t he throw style into itwouldn t he spread himself nor noth why you d think it wa christoph c lumbu discov kingdomcom i wish tom sawyer wa here jim he grumbl a littl but give in he said we mustn t talk ani more than we could help and then talk mighti low the lightn show us the wreck again just in time and we fetch the stabboard derrick and made fast there the deck wa high out here we went sneak down the slope of it to labboard in the dark toward the texa feel our wai slow with our feet and spread our hand out to fend off the gui for it wa so dark we couldn t see no sign of them pretti soon we struck the forward end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetch us in front of the captain s door which wa open and by jimmini awai down through the texashal we see a light and all in the same second we seem to hear low voic in yonder jim whisper and said he wa feel power sick and told me to come along i sai all right and wa go to start for the raft but just then i heard a voic wail out and sai oh pleas don t boi i swear i won t ever tell anoth voic said pretti loud it s a lie jim turner you ve act thi wai befor you alwai want more n your share of the truck and you ve alwai got it too becaus you ve swore t if you didn t you d tell but thi time you ve said it jest on time too mani you re the meanest treacherousest hound in thi countri by thi time jim wa gone for the raft i wa just abil with curios and i sai to myself tom sawyer wouldn t back out now and so i won t either i m ago to see what s go on here so i drop on my hand and knee in the littl passag and crept aft in the dark till there warn t but on stateroom betwixt me and the crosshal of the texa then in there i see a man stretch on the floor and ti hand and foot and two men stand over him and on of them had a dim lantern in hi hand and the other on had a pistol thi on kept point the pistol at the man s head on the floor and sai i d like to and i orter tooa mean skunk the man on the floor would shrivel up and sai oh pleas don t bill i hain t ever goin to tell and everi time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and sai deed you ain t you never said no truer thing n that you bet you and onc he said hear him beg and yit if we hadn t got the best of him and ti him he d a kill us both and what for jist for noth n jist becaus we stood on our rightsthat s what for but i lai you ain t agoin to threaten nobodi ani more jim turner put up that pistol bill bill sai i don t want to jake packard i m for killin himand didn t he kill old hatfield jist the same wayand don t he deserv it but i don t want him kill and i ve got my reason for it bless yo heart for them word jake packard i ll never forgit you long s i live sai the man on the floor sort of blubber packard didn t take no notic of that but hung up hi lantern on a nail and start toward where i wa there in the dark and motion bill to come i crawfish as fast as i could about two yard but the boat slant so that i couldn t make veri good time so to keep from get run over and catch i crawl into a stateroom on the upper side the man came apaw along in the dark and when packard got to my stateroom he sai herecom in here and in he come and bill after him but befor thei got in i wa up in the upper berth corner and sorri i come then thei stood there with their hand on the ledg of the berth and talk i couldn t see them but i could tell where thei wa by the whiski thei d been have i wa glad i didn t drink whiski but it wouldn t made much differ anywai becaus most of the time thei couldn t a treed me becaus i didn t breath i wa too scare and besid a bodi couldn t breath and hear such talk thei talk low and earnest bill want to kill turner he sai he s said he ll tell and he will if we wa to give both our share to him now it wouldn t make no differ after the row and the wai we ve serv him shore s you re born he ll turn state s evid now you hear me i m for put him out of hi troubl so m i sai packard veri quiet blame it i d sorter begun to think you wasn t well then that s all right le s go and do it hold on a minut i hain t had my sai yit you listen to me shoot s good but there s quieter wai if the thing s got to be done but what i sai is thi it ain t good sens to go court n around after a halter if you can git at what you re up to in some wai that s jist as good and at the same time don t bring you into no resk ain t that so you bet it is but how you goin to manag it thi time well my idea is thi we ll rustl around and gather up whatev pickin we ve overlook in the stateroom and shove for shore and hide the truck then we ll wait now i sai it ain t agoin to be more n two hour befo thi wrack break up and wash off down the river see he ll be drownd and won t have nobodi to blame for it but hi own self i reckon that s a considerbl sight better n killin of him i m unfavor to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it ain t good sens it ain t good moral ain t i right ye i reck n you ar but s pose she don t break up and wash off well we can wait the two hour anywai and see can t we all right then come along so thei start and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambl forward it wa dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coars whisper jim and he answer up right at my elbow with a sort of a moan and i sai quick jim it ain t no time for fool around and moan there s a gang of murder in yonder and if we don t hunt up their boat and set her drift down the river so these fellow can t get awai from the wreck there s on of em go to be in a bad fix but if we find their boat we can put all of em in a bad fixfor the sheriff ll get em quickhurri i ll hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard you start at the raft and oh my lordi lordi raf dei ain no raf no mo she done broke loos en gone ien here we is chapter xiii well i catch my breath and most faint shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that but it warn t no time to be sentiment we d got to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselv so we went aquak and shake down the stabboard side and slow work it wa tooseem a week befor we got to the stern no sign of a boat jim said he didn t believ he could go ani furtherso scare he hadn t hardli ani strength left he said but i said come on if we get left on thi wreck we ar in a fix sure so on we prowl again we struck for the stern of the texa and found it and then scrabbl along forward on the skylight hang on from shutter to shutter for the edg of the skylight wa in the water when we got pretti close to the crosshal door there wa the skiff sure enough i could just bare see her i felt ever so thank in anoth second i would a been aboard of her but just then the door open on of the men stuck hi head out onli about a coupl of foot from me and i thought i wa gone but he jerk it in again and sai heav that blame lantern out o sight bill he flung a bag of someth into the boat and then got in himself and set down it wa packard then bill he come out and got in packard sai in a low voic all readyshov off i couldn t hardli hang on to the shutter i wa so weak but bill sai hold on d you go through him no didn t you no so he s got hi share o the cash yet well then come along no us to take truck and leav monei sai won t he suspicion what we re up to mayb he won t but we got to have it anywai come along so thei got out and went in the door slam to becaus it wa on the careen side and in a half second i wa in the boat and jim come tumbl after me i out with my knife and cut the rope and awai we went we didn t touch an oar and we didn t speak nor whisper nor hardli even breath we went glide swift along dead silent past the tip of the paddlebox and past the stern then in a second or two more we wa a hundr yard below the wreck and the dark soak her up everi last sign of her and we wa safe and know it when we wa three or four hundr yard downstream we see the lantern show like a littl spark at the texa door for a second and we know by that that the rascal had miss their boat and wa begin to understand that thei wa in just as much troubl now as jim turner wa then jim man the oar and we took out after our raft now wa the first time that i begun to worri about the meni reckon i hadn t had time to befor i begun to think how dread it wa even for murder to be in such a fix i sai to myself there ain t no tell but i might come to be a murder myself yet and then how would i like it so sai i to jim the first light we see we ll land a hundr yard below it or abov it in a place where it s a good hidingplac for you and the skiff and then i ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebodi to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape so thei can be hung when their time come but that idea wa a failur for pretti soon it begun to storm again and thi time wors than ever the rain pour down and never a light show everybodi in bed i reckon we boom along down the river watch for light and watch for our raft after a long time the rain let up but the cloud stai and the lightn kept whimper and by and by a flash show us a black thing ahead float and we made for it it wa the raft and mighti glad wa we to get aboard of it again we seen a light now awai down to the right on shore so i said i would go for it the skiff wa half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck we hustl it on to the raft in a pile and i told jim to float along down and show a light when he judg he had gone about two mile and keep it burn till i come then i man my oar and shove for the light as i got down toward it three or four more showedup on a hillsid it wa a villag i close in abov the shore light and laid on my oar and float as i went by i see it wa a lantern hang on the jackstaff of a doublehul ferryboat i skim around for the watchman awond whereabout he slept and by and by i found him roost on the bitt forward with hi head down between hi knee i gave hi shoulder two or three littl shove and begun to cry he stir up in a kind of a startlish wai but when he see it wa onli me he took a good gap and stretch and then he sai hello what s up don t cry bub what s the troubl i sai pap and mam and si and then i broke down he sai oh dang it now don t take on so we all ha to have our troubl and thi n ll come out all right what s the matter with em thei rethei rear you the watchman of the boat ye he sai kind of prettywellsatisfi like i m the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deckhand and sometim i m the freight and passeng i ain t as rich as old jim hornback and i can t be so blame gener and good to tom dick and harri as what he is and slam around monei the wai he doe but i ve told him a mani a time t i wouldn t trade place with him for sai i a sailor s life s the life for me and i m dern if i d live two mile out o town where there ain t noth ever goin on not for all hi spondulick and as much more on top of it sai i i broke in and sai thei re in an aw peck of troubl and who is why pap and mam and si and miss hooker and if you d take your ferryboat and go up there up where where ar thei on the wreck what wreck why there ain t but on what you don t mean the walter scott ye good land what ar thei doin there for graciou sake well thei didn t go there apurpos i bet thei didn t why great good there ain t no chanc for em if thei don t git off mighti quick why how in the nation did thei ever git into such a scrape easi enough miss hooker wa avisit up there to the town ye booth s landinggo on she wa avisit there at booth s land and just in the edg of the even she start over with her nigger woman in the horseferri to stai all night at her friend s hous miss whatyoumaycallh i disrememb her nameand thei lost their steeringoar and swung around and went afloat down stern first about two mile and saddlebaggs on the wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the hors wa all lost but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck well about an hour after dark we come along down in our tradingscow and it wa so dark we didn t notic the wreck till we wa right on it and so we saddlebaggs but all of us wa save but bill whippleand oh he wa the best creturi most wish t it had been me i do my georg it s the beatenest thing i ever struck and then what did you all do well we holler and took on but it s so wide there we couldn t make nobodi hear so pap said somebodi got to get ashor and get help somehow i wa the onli on that could swim so i made a dash for it and miss hooker she said if i didn t strike help sooner come here and hunt up her uncl and he d fix the thing i made the land about a mile below and been fool along ever sinc try to get peopl to do someth but thei said what in such a night and such a current there ain t no sens in it go for the steam ferri now if you ll go and by jackson i d like to and blame it i don t know but i will but who in the dingnat s ago to pai for it do you reckon your pap why that s all right miss hooker she tole me particular that her uncl hornback great gun is he her uncl looki here you break for that light over yonderwai and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of a mile out you ll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to jim hornback s and he ll foot the bill and don t you fool around ani becaus he ll want to know the new tell him i ll have hi niec all safe befor he can get to town hump yourself now i m ago up around the corner here to roust out my engin i struck for the light but as soon as he turn the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bail her out and then pull up shore in the easi water about six hundr yard and tuck myself in among some woodboat for i couldn t rest easi till i could see the ferryboat start but take it all around i wa feel ruther comfort on account of take all thi troubl for that gang for not mani would a done it i wish the widow know about it i judg she would be proud of me for help these rapscallion becaus rapscallion and dead beat is the kind the widow and good peopl take the most interest in well befor long here come the wreck dim and duski slide along down a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out for her she wa veri deep and i see in a minut there warn t much chanc for anybodi be aliv in her i pull all around her and holler a littl but there wasn t ani answer all dead still i felt a littl bit heavyheart about the gang but not much for i reckon if thei could stand it i could then here come the ferryboat so i shove for the middl of the river on a long downstream slant and when i judg i wa out of eyereach i laid on my oar and look back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hooker s remaind becaus the captain would know her uncl hornback would want them and then pretti soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went aboom down the river it did seem a power long time befor jim s light show up and when it did show it look like it wa a thousand mile off by the time i got there the sky wa begin to get a littl grai in the east so we struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turn in and slept like dead peopl chapter xiv by and by when we got up we turn over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck and found boot and blanket and cloth and all sort of other thing and a lot of book and a spyglass and three box of seegar we hadn t ever been thi rich befor in neither of our live the seegar wa prime we laid off all the afternoon in the wood talk and me read the book and have a gener good time i told jim all about what happen insid the wreck and at the ferryboat and i said these kind of thing wa adventur but he said he didn t want no more adventur he said that when i went in the texa and he crawl back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearli di becaus he judg it wa all up with him anywai it could be fix for if he didn t get save he would get drownd and if he did get save whoever save him would send him back home so as to get the reward and then miss watson would sell him south sure well he wa right he wa most alwai right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger i read consider to jim about king and duke and earl and such and how gaudi thei dress and how much style thei put on and

us to cairo at the bottom of illinoi where the ohio river come in and that wa what we wa after we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go wai up the ohio amongst the free state and then be out of troubl well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead to tie to for it wouldn t do to try to run in a fog but when i paddl ahead in the cano with the line to make fast there warn t anyth but littl sapl to tie to i pass the line around on of them right on the edg of the cut bank but there wa a stiff current and the raft come boom down so live she tore it out by the root and awai she went i see the fog close down and it made me so sick and scare i couldn t budg for most a half a minut it seem to meand then there warn t no raft in sight you couldn t see twenti yard i jump into the cano and run back to the stern and grab the paddl and set her back a stroke but she didn t come i wa in such a hurri i hadn t unti her i got up and tri to unti her but i wa so excit my hand shook so i couldn t hardli do anyth with them as soon as i got start i took out after the raft hot and heavi right down the towhead that wa all right as far as it went but the towhead warn t sixti yard long and the minut i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog and hadn t no more idea which wai i wa go than a dead man think i it won t do to paddl first i know i ll run into the bank or a towhead or someth i got to set still and float and yet it s mighti fidgeti busi to have to hold your hand still at such a time i whoop and listen awai down there somewher i hear a small whoop and up come my spirit i went tear after it listen sharp to hear it again the next time it come i see i warn t head for it but head awai to the right of it and the next time i wa head awai to the left of itand not gain on it much either for i wa fly around thi wai and that and t other but it wa go straight ahead all the time i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the time but he never did and it wa the still place between the whoop that wa make the troubl for me well i fought along and directli i hear the whoop behind me i wa tangl good now that wa somebodi els s whoop or els i wa turn around i throw the paddl down i heard the whoop again it wa behind me yet but in a differ place it kept come and kept chang it place and i kept answer till by and by it wa in front of me again and i know the current had swung the cano s head downstream and i wa all right if that wa jim and not some other raftsman holler i couldn t tell noth about voic in a fog for noth don t look natur nor sound natur in a fog the whoop went on and in about a minut i come aboom down on a cut bank with smoki ghost of big tree on it and the current throw me off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snag that fairli roar the currrent wa tear by them so swift in anoth second or two it wa solid white and still again i set perfectli still then listen to my heart thump and i reckon i didn t draw a breath while it thump a hundr i just give up then i know what the matter wa that cut bank wa an island and jim had gone down t other side of it it warn t no towhead that you could float by in ten minut it had the big timber of a regular island it might be five or six mile long and more than half a mile wide i kept quiet with my ear cock about fifteen minut i reckon i wa float along of cours four or five mile an hour but you don t ever think of that no you feel like you ar lai dead still on the water and if a littl glimps of a snag slip by you don t think to yourself how fast you re go but you catch your breath and think my how that snag s tear along if you think it ain t dismal and lonesom out in a fog that wai by yourself in the night you try it oncey ll see next for about a half an hour i whoop now and then at last i hear the answer a long wai off and tri to follow it but i couldn t do it and directli i judg i d got into a nest of towhead for i had littl dim glimps of them on both side of mesometim just a narrow channel between and some that i couldn t see i know wa there becaus i d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the bank well i warn t long loos the whoop down amongst the towhead and i onli tri to chase them a littl while anywai becaus it wa wors than chase a jacko lantern you never know a sound dodg around so and swap place so quick and so much i had to claw awai from the bank pretti live four or five time to keep from knock the island out of the river and so i judg the raft must be but into the bank everi now and then or els it would get further ahead and clear out of hearingit wa float a littl faster than what i wa well i seem to be in the open river again by and by but i couldn t hear no sign of a whoop nowher i reckon jim had fetch up on a snag mayb and it wa all up with him i wa good and tire so i laid down in the cano and said i wouldn t bother no more i didn t want to go to sleep of cours but i wa so sleepi i couldn t help it so i thought i would take jest on littl catnap but i reckon it wa more than a catnap for when i wake up the star wa shine bright the fog wa all gone and i wa spin down a big bend stern first first i didn t know where i wa i thought i wa dream and when thing began to come back to me thei seem to come up dim out of last week it wa a monstrou big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both bank just a solid wall as well as i could see by the star i look awai downstream and seen a black speck on the water i took after it but when i got to it it warn t noth but a coupl of sawlog made fast togeth then i see anoth speck and chase that then anoth and thi time i wa right it wa the raft when i got to it jim wa set there with hi head down between hi knee asleep with hi right arm hang over the steeringoar the other oar wa smash off and the raft wa litter up with leav and branch and dirt so she d had a rough time i made fast and laid down under jim s nose on the raft and began to gap and stretch my fist out against jim and sai hello jim have i been asleep why didn t you stir me up good graciou

warn he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the current wa anoth man that would get us awai from him the whoop wa warn that would come to us everi now and then and if we didn t try hard to make out to understand them thei d just take us into bad luck stead of keep us out of it the lot of towhead wa troubl we wa go to get into with quarrelsom peopl and all kind of mean folk but if we mind our busi and didn t talk back and aggrav them we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river which wa the free state and wouldn t have no more troubl it had cloud up pretti dark just after i got on to the raft but it wa clear up again now oh well that s all interpret well enough as far as it goe jim i sai but what doe these thing stand for it wa the leav and rubbish on the raft and the smash oar you could see them firstrat now jim look at the trash and then look at me and back at the trash again he had got the dream fix so strong in hi head that he couldn t seem to shake it loos and get the fact back into it place again right awai but when he did get the thing straighten around he look at me steadi without ever smile and sai what

and i warn t ever sorri for it afterward neither i didn t do him no more mean trick and i wouldn t done that on if i d a know it would make him feel that wai chapter xvi we slept most all dai and start out at night a littl wai behind a monstrou long raft that wa as long go by as a process she had four long sweep at each end so we judg she carri as mani as thirti men like she had five big wigwam aboard wide apart and an open camp fire in the middl and a tall flagpol at each end there wa a power of style about her it amount to someth be a raftsman on such a craft as that we went drift down into a big bend and the night cloud up and got hot the river wa veri wide and wa wall with solid timber on both side you couldn t see a break in it hardli ever or a light we talk about cairo and wonder whether we would know it when we got to it i said like we wouldn t becaus i had heard sai there warn t but about a dozen hous there and if thei didn t happen to have them lit up how wa we go to know we wa pass a town jim said if the two big river join togeth there that would show but i said mayb we might think we wa pass the foot of an island and come into the same old river again that disturb jimand me too so the question wa what to do i said paddl ashor the first time a light show and tell them pap wa behind come along with a tradingscow and wa a green hand at the busi and want to know how far it wa to cairo jim thought it wa a good idea so we took a smoke on it and wait there warn t noth to do now but to look out sharp for the town and not pass it without see it he said he d be mighti sure to see it becaus he d be a free man the minut he seen it but if he miss it he d be in a slave countri again and no more show for freedom everi littl while he jump up and sai dah she is but it warn t it wa jacko lantern or lightn bug so he set down again and went to watch same as befor jim said it made him all over trembl and feverish to be so close to freedom well i can tell you it made me all over trembl and feverish too to hear him becaus i begun to get it through my head that he wa most freeand who wa to blame for it why me i couldn t get that out of my conscienc no how nor no wai it got to troubl me so i couldn t rest i couldn t stai still in on place it hadn t ever come home to me befor what thi thing wa that i wa do but now it did and it stai with me and scorch me more and more i tri to make out to myself that i warn t to blame becaus i didn t run jim off from hi right owner but it warn t no us conscienc up and sai everi time but you know he wa run for hi

fidget up and down past me we neither of us could keep still everi time he danc around and sai dah s cairo it went through me like a shot and i thought if it wa cairo i reckon i would die of miser jim talk out loud all the time while i wa talk to myself he wa sai how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to save up monei and never spend a singl cent and when he got enough he would bui hi wife which wa own on a farm close to where miss watson live and then thei would both work to bui the two children and if their master wouldn t sell them thei d get an ab litionist to go and steal them it most froze me to hear such talk he wouldn t ever dare to talk such talk in hi life befor just see what a differ it made in him the minut he judg he wa about free it wa accord to the old sai give a nigger an inch and he ll take an ell think i thi is what come of my not think here wa thi nigger which i had as good as help to run awai come right out flatfoot and sai

night he sai doan le s talk about it huck po nigger can t have no luck i awluz spect dat rattlesnakeskin warn t done wid it work i wish i d never seen that snakeskin jimi do wish i d never laid ey on it it ain t yo fault huck you didn know don t you blame yo self bout it when it wa daylight here wa the clear ohio water inshor sure enough and outsid wa the old regular muddi so it wa all up with cairo we talk it all over it wouldn t do to take to the shore we couldn t take the raft up the stream of cours there warn t no wai but to wait for dark and start back in the cano and take the chanc so we slept all dai amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work and when we went back to the raft about dark the cano wa gone we didn t sai a word for a good while there warn t anyth to sai we both know well enough it wa some more work of the rattlesnakeskin so what wa the us to talk about it it would onli look like we wa find fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep on fetch it too till we know enough to keep still by and by we talk about what we better do and found there warn t no wai but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chanc to bui a cano to go back in we warn t go to borrow it when there warn t anybodi around the wai pap would do for that might set peopl after us so we shove out after dark on the raft anybodi that don t believ yet that it s foolish to handl a snakeskin after all that that snakeskin done for us will believ it now if thei read on and see what more it done for us the place to bui cano is off of raft lai up at shore but we didn t see no raft lai up so we went along dure three hour and more well the night got grai and ruther thick which is the next meanest thing to fog you can t tell the shape of the river and you can t see no distanc it got to be veri late and still and then along come a steamboat up the river we lit the lantern and judg she would see it upstream boat didn t generli come close to us thei go out and follow the bar and hunt for easi water under the reef but night like thi thei bull right up the channel against the whole river we could hear her pound along but we didn t see her good till she wa close she aim right for us often thei do that and try to see how close thei can come without touch sometim the wheel bite off a sweep and then the pilot stick hi head out and laugh and think he s mighti smart well here she come and we said she wa go to try and shave us but she didn t seem to be sheer off a bit she wa a big on and she wa come in a hurri too look like a black cloud with row of glowworm around it but all of a sudden she bulg out big and scari with a long row of wideopen furnac door shine like redhot teeth and her monstrou bow and guard hang right over us there wa a yell at us and a jingl of bell to stop the engin a powwow of cuss and whistl of steamand as jim went overboard on on side and i on the other she come smash straight through the raft i divedand i aim to find the bottom too for a thirtyfoot wheel had got to go over me and i want it to have plenti of room i could alwai stai under water a minut thi time i reckon i stai under a minut and a half then i bounc for the top in a hurri for i wa nearli bust i pop out to my armpit and blow the water out of my nose and puf a bit of cours there wa a boom current and of cours that boat start her engin again ten second after she stop them for thei never care much for raftsmen so now she wa churn along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though i could hear her i sung out for jim about a dozen time but i didn t get ani answer so i grab a plank that touch me while i wa tread water and struck out for shore shove it ahead of me but i made out to see that the drift of the current wa toward the lefthand shore which meant that i wa in a cross so i chang off and went that wai it wa on of these long slant twomil cross so i wa a good long time in get over i made a safe land and clumb up the bank i couldn t see but a littl wai but i went poke along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across a big oldfashion doubl loghous befor i notic it i wa go to rush by and get

hous in town there warn t no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heap of parlor in town ha bed in them there wa a big fireplac that wa brick on the bottom and the brick wa kept clean and red by pour water on them and scrub them with anoth brick sometim thei wash them over with red waterpaint that thei call spanishbrown same as thei do in town thei had big brass dogiron that could hold up a sawlog there wa a clock on the middl of the mantelpiec with a pictur of a town paint on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in the middl of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swing behind it it wa beauti to hear that clock tick and sometim when on of these peddler had been along and scour her up and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundr and fifti befor she got tucker out thei wouldn t took ani monei for her well there wa a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made out of someth like chalk and paint up gaudi by on of the parrot wa a cat made of crockeri and a crockeri dog by the other and when you press down on them thei squeak but didn t open their mouth nor look differ nor interest thei squeak through underneath there wa a coupl of big wildturkeyw fan spread out behind those thing on the tabl in the middl of the room wa a kind of a love crockeri basket that had appl and orang and peach and grape pile up in it which wa much redder and yellow and prettier than real on is but thei warn t real becaus you could see where piec had got chip off and show the white chalk or whatev it wa underneath thi tabl had a cover made out of beauti oilcloth with a red and blue spreadeagl paint on it and a paint border all around it come all the wai from philadelphia thei said there wa some book too pile up perfectli exact on each corner of the tabl on wa a big famili bibl full of pictur on wa pilgrim s progress about a man that left hi famili it didn t sai why i read consider in it now and then the statement wa interest but tough anoth wa friendship s offer full of beauti stuff and poetri but i didn t read the poetri anoth wa henri clai s speech and anoth wa dr gunn s famili medicin which told you all about what to do if a bodi wa sick or dead there wa a hymn book and a lot of other book and there wa nice splitbottom chair and perfectli sound toonot bag down in the middl and bust like an old basket thei had pictur hung on the wallsmainli washington and lafayett and battl and highland mari and on call sign the declar there wa some that thei call crayon which on of the daughter which wa dead made her own self when she wa onli fifteen year old thei wa differ from ani pictur i ever see beforeblack mostli than is common on wa a woman in a slim black dress belt small under the armpit with bulg like a cabbag in the middl of the sleev and a larg black scoopshovel bonnet with a black veil and white slim ankl cross about with black tape and veri wee black slipper like a chisel and she wa lean pensiv on a tombston on her right elbow under a weep willow and her other hand hang down her side hold a white handkerchief and a reticul and underneath the pictur it said shall i never see thee more ala anoth on wa a young ladi with her hair all comb up straight to the top of her head and knot there in front of a comb like a chairback and she wa cry into a handkerchief and had a dead bird lai on it back in her other hand with it heel up and underneath the pictur it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more ala there wa on where a young ladi wa at a window look up at the moon and tear run down her cheek and she had an open letter in on hand with black seal wax show on on edg of it and she wa mash a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneath the pictur it said and art thou gone ye thou art gone ala these wa all nice pictur i reckon but i didn t somehow seem to take to them becaus if ever i wa down a littl thei alwai give me the fantod everybodi wa sorri she di becaus she had laid out a lot more of these pictur to do and a bodi could see by what she had done what thei had lost but i reckon that with her disposit she wa have a better time in the graveyard she wa at work on what thei said wa her greatest pictur when she took sick and everi dai and everi night it wa her prayer to be allow to live till she got it done but she never got the chanc it wa a pictur of a young woman in a long white gown stand on the rail of a bridg all readi to jump off with her hair all down her back and look up to the moon with the tear run down her face and she had two arm fold across her breast and two arm stretch out in front and two more reach up toward the moonand the idea wa to see which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arm but as i wa sai she di befor she got her mind made up and now thei kept thi pictur over the head of the bed in her room and everi time her birthdai come thei hung flower on it other time it wa hid with a littl curtain the young woman in the pictur had a kind of a nice sweet face but there wa so mani arm it made her look too spideri seem to me thi young girl kept a scrapbook when she wa aliv and us to past obituari and accid and case of patient suffer in it out of the presbyterian observ and write poetri after them out of her own head it wa veri good poetri thi is what she wrote about a boi by the name of stephen dowl bot that fell down a well and wa drownd od to stephen dowl bot dec d and did young stephen sicken and did young stephen die and did the sad heart thicken and did the mourner cry no such wa not the fate of young stephen dowl bot though sad heart round him thicken twa not from sick shot no whoopingcough did rack hi frame nor measl drear with spot not these impair the sacr name of stephen dowl bot despis

gentleman all over and so wa hi famili he wa well born as the sai is and that s worth as much in a man as it is in a hors so the widow dougla said and nobodi ever deni that she wa of the first aristocraci in our town and pap he alwai said it too though he warn t no more qualiti than a mudcat himself col grangerford wa veri tall and veri slim and had a darkishpali complexion not a sign of red in it anywher he wa clean shave everi morn all over hi thin face and he had the thinnest kind of lip and the thinnest kind of nostril and a high nose and heavi eyebrow and the blackest kind of ey sunk so deep back that thei seem like thei wa look out of cavern at you as you mai sai hi forehead wa high and hi hair wa black and straight and hung to hi shoulder hi hand wa long and thin and everi dai of hi life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your ey to look at it and on sundai he wore a blue tailcoat with brass button on it he carri a mahogani cane with a silver head to it there warn t no frivolish about him not a bit and he warn t ever loud he wa as kind as he could beyou could feel that you know and so you had confid sometim he smile and it wa good to see but when he straighten himself up like a libertypol and the lightn begun to flicker out from under hi eyebrow you want to climb a tree first and find out what the matter wa afterward he didn t ever have to tell anybodi to mind their mannerseverybodi wa alwai goodmann where he wa everybodi love to have him around too he wa sunshin most alwaysi mean he made it seem like good weather when he turn into a cloudbank it wa aw dark for half a minut and that wa enough there wouldn t noth go wrong again for a week when him and the old ladi come down in the morn all the famili got up out of their chair and give them gooddai and didn t set down again till thei had set down then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the decant wa and mix a glass of bitter and hand it to him and he held it in hi hand and wait till tom s and bob s wa mix and then thei bow and said our duti to you sir and madam and thei bow the least bit in the world and said thank you and so thei drank all three and bob and tom pour a spoon of water on the sugar and the mite of whiski or appl brandi in the bottom of their tumbler and give it to me and buck and we drank to the old peopl too bob wa the oldest and tom nexttal beauti men with veri broad shoulder and brown face and long black hair and black ey thei dress in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and wore broad panama hat then there wa miss charlott she wa twentyf and tall and proud and grand but as good as she could be when she warn t stir up but when she wa she had a look that would make you wilt in your track like her father she wa beauti so wa her sister miss sophia but it wa a differ kind she wa gentl and sweet like a dove and she wa onli twenti each person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck too my nigger had a monstrou easi time becaus i warn t us to have anybodi do anyth for me but buck s wa on the jump most of the time thi wa all there wa of the famili now but there us to be morethre son thei got kill and emmelin that di the old gentleman own a lot of farm and over a hundr nigger sometim a stack of peopl would come there horseback from ten or fifteen mile around and stai five or six dai and have such junket round about and on the river and danc and picnic in the wood daytim and ball at the hous night these peopl wa mostli kinfolk of the famili the men brought their gun with them it wa a handsom lot of qualiti i tell you there wa anoth clan of aristocraci around theref or six familiesmostli of the name of shepherdson thei wa as highton and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerford the shepherdson and grangerford us the same steamboat land which wa about two mile abov our hous so sometim when i went up there with a lot of our folk i us to see a lot of the shepherdson there on their fine hors on dai buck and me wa awai out in the wood hunt and heard a hors come we wa cross the road buck sai quick jump for the wood we done it and then peep down the wood through the leav pretti soon a splendid young man come gallop down the road set hi hors easi and look like a soldier he had hi gun across hi pommel i had seen him befor it wa young harnei shepherdson i heard buck s gun go off at my ear and harnei s hat tumbl off from hi head he grab hi gun and rode straight to the place where we wa hid but we didn t wait we start through the wood on a run the wood warn t thick so i look over my shoulder to dodg the bullet and twice i seen harnei cover buck with hi gun and then he rode awai the wai he cometo get hi hat i reckon but i couldn t see we never stop run till we got home the old gentleman s ey blaze a minut twa pleasur mainli i judgedthen hi face sort of smooth down and he sai kind of gentl i don t like that shoot from behind a bush why didn t you step into the road my boi the shepherdson don t father thei alwai take advantag miss charlott she held her head up like a queen while buck wa tell hi tale and her nostril spread and her ey snap the two young men look dark but never said noth miss sophia she turn pale but the color come back when she found the man warn t hurt soon as i could get buck down by the corncrib under the tree by ourselv i sai did you want to kill him buck well i bet i did what did he do to you him he never done noth to me well then what did you want to kill him for why nothingonli it s on account of the feud what s a feud why where wa you rais don t you know what a feud is never heard of it beforetel me about it well sai buck a feud is thi wai a man ha a quarrel with anoth man and kill him then that other man s brother kill him then the other brother on both side goe for on anoth then the cousin chip inand by and by everybodi s kill off and there ain t no more feud but it s kind of slow and take a long time ha thi on been go on long buck well i should reckon it start thirti year ago or som er along there there wa troubl bout someth and then a lawsuit to settl it and the suit went agin on of the men and so he up and shot the man that won the suitwhich he would natur do of cours anybodi would what wa the troubl about buckland i reckon maybei don t know well who done the shoot wa it a grangerford or a shepherdson law how do i know it wa so long ago don t anybodi know oh ye pa know i reckon and some of the other old peopl but thei don t know now what the row wa about in the first place ha there been mani kill buck ye right smart chanc of funer but thei don t alwai kill pa s got a few buckshot in him but he don t mind it cuz he don t weigh much anywai bob s been carv up some with a bowi and tom s been hurt onc or twice ha anybodi been kill thi year buck ye we got on and thei got on bout three month ago my cousin bud fourteen year old wa ride through the wood on t other side of the river and didn t have no weapon with him which wa blame foolish and in a lonesom place he hear a hors acom behind him and see old baldi shepherdson alinkin after him with hi gun in hi hand and hi white hair afli in the wind and stead of jump off and take to the brush bud low he could outrun him so thei had it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man again all the time so at last bud seen it warn t ani us so he stop and face around so as to have the bullet hole in front you know and the old man he rode up and shot him down but he didn t git much chanc to enjoi hi luck for insid of a week our folk laid him out i reckon that old man wa a coward buck i reckon he warn t a coward not by a blame sight there ain t a coward amongst them shepherdsonsnot a on and there ain t no coward amongst the grangerford either why that old man kep up hi end in a fight on dai for half an hour against three grangerford and come out winner thei wa all ahorseback he lit off of hi hors and got behind a littl woodpil and kep hi hors befor him to stop the bullet but the grangerford stai on their hors and caper around the old man and pepper awai at him and he pepper awai at them him and hi hors both went home pretti leaki and crippl but the grangerford had to be fetch homeand on of em wa dead and anoth di the next dai no sir if a bodi s out hunt for coward he don t want to fool awai ani time amongst them shepherdson becuz thei don t breed ani of that kind next sundai we all went to church about three mile everybodi ahorseback the men took their gun along so did buck and kept them between their knee or stood them handi against the wall the shepherdson done the same it wa pretti orneri preachingal about brotherli love and suchlik tiresom but everybodi said it wa a good sermon and thei all talk it over go home and had such a power lot to sai about faith and good work and free grace and preforeordestin and i don t know what all that it did seem to me to be on of the roughest sundai i had run across yet about an hour after dinner everybodi wa doze around some in their chair and some in their room and it got to be pretti dull buck and a dog wa stretch out on the grass in the sun sound asleep i went up to our room and judg i would take a nap myself i found that sweet miss sophia stand in her door which wa next to our and she took me in her room and shut the door veri soft and ask me if i like her and i said i did and she ask me if i would do someth for her and not tell anybodi and i said i would then she said she d forgot her testament and left it in the seat at church between two other book and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not sai noth to nobodi i said i would so i slid out and slip off up the road and there warn t anybodi at the church except mayb a hog or two for there warn t ani lock on the door and hog like a puncheon floor in summertim becaus it s cool if you notic most folk don t go to church onli when thei ve got to but a hog is differ sai i to myself someth s up it ain t natur for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament so i give it a shake and out drop a littl piec of paper with halfpast two wrote on it

along under the tree and brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into the fork of a cottonwood that wa out of reach and watch there wa a woodrank four foot high a littl wai in front of the tree and first i wa go to hide behind that but mayb it wa luckier i didn t there wa four or five men cavort around on their hors in the open place befor the log store cuss and yell and try to get at a coupl of young chap that wa behind the woodrank alongsid of the steamboat land but thei couldn t come it everi time on of them show himself on the river side of the woodpil he got shot at the two boi wa squat back to back behind the pile so thei could watch both wai by and by the men stop cavort around and yell thei start ride toward the store then up get on of the boi draw a steadi bead over the woodrank and drop on of them out of hi saddl all the men jump off of their hors and grab the hurt on and start to carri him to the store and that minut the two boi start on the run thei got half wai to the tree i wa in befor the men notic then the men see them and jump on their hors and took out after them thei gain on the boi but it didn t do no good the boi had too good a start thei got to the woodpil that wa in front of my tree and slip in behind it and so thei had the bulg on the men again on of the boi wa buck and the other wa a slim young chap about nineteen year old the men rip around awhil and then rode awai as soon as thei wa out of sight i sung out to buck and told him he didn t know what to make of my voic come out of the tree at first he wa aw surpris he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again said thei wa up to some devil or otherwouldn t be gone long i wish i wa out of that tree but i dasn t come down buck begun to cry and rip and low that him and hi cousin joe that wa the other young chap would make up for thi dai yet he said hi father and hi two brother wa kill and two or three of the enemi said the shepherdson laid for them in ambush buck said hi father and brother ought to wait for their relationsth shepherdson wa too strong for them i ask him what wa becom of young harnei and miss sophia he said thei d got across the river and wa safe i wa glad of that but the wai buck did take on becaus he didn t manag to kill harnei that dai he shot at himi hain t ever heard anyth like it all of a sudden bang bang bang goe three or four gunsth men had slip around through the wood and come in from behind without their hors the boi jump for the riverboth of them hurtand as thei swum down the current the men run along the bank shoot at them and sing out kill them kill them it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree i ain t ago to tell all that happenedit would make me sick again if i wa to do that i wish i hadn t ever come ashor that night to see such thing i ain t ever go to get shut of themlot of time i dream about them i stai in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down sometim i heard gun awai off in the wood and twice i seen littl gang of men gallop past the log store with gun so i reckon the troubl wa still ago on i wa mighti downheart so i made up my mind i wouldn t ever go anear that hous again becaus i reckon i wa to blame somehow i judg that that piec of paper meant that miss sophia wa to meet harnei somewher at halfpast two and run off and i judg i ought to told her father about that paper and the curiou wai she act and then mayb he would a lock her up and thi aw mess wouldn t ever happen when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piec and found the two bodi lai in the edg of the water and tug at them till i got them ashor then i cover up their face and got awai as quick as i could i cri a littl when i wa cover up buck s face for he wa mighti good to me it wa just dark now i never went near the hous but struck through the wood and made for the swamp jim warn t on hi island so i tramp off in a hurri for the crick and crowd through the willow redhot to jump aboard and get out of that aw countri the raft wa gone my soul but i wa scare i couldn t get my breath for most a minut then i rais a yell a voic not twentyf foot from me sai

can i never felt easi till the raft wa two mile below there and out in the middl of the mississippi then we hung up our signal lantern and judg that we wa free and safe onc more i hadn t had a bite to eat sinc yesterdai so jim he got out some corndodg and buttermilk and pork and cabbag and greensther ain t noth in the world so good when it s cook rightand whilst i eat my supper we talk and had a good time i wa power glad to get awai from the feud and so wa jim to get awai from the swamp we said there warn t no home like a raft after all other place do seem so cramp up and smotheri but a raft don t you feel mighti free and easi and comfort on a raft chapter xix two or three dai and night went by i reckon i might sai thei swum by thei slid along so quiet and smooth and love here is the wai we put in the time it wa a monstrou big river down theresometim a mile and a half wide we run night and laid up and hid daytim soon as night wa most gone we stop navig and ti upnearli alwai in the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwood and willow and hid the raft with them then we set out the line next we slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off then we set down on the sandi bottom where the water wa about knee deep and watch the daylight come not a sound anywheresperfectli stilljust like the whole world wa asleep onli sometim the bullfrog aclutt mayb the first thing to see look awai over the water wa a kind of dull linethat wa the wood on t other side you couldn t make noth els out then a pale place in the sky then more pale spread around then the river soften up awai off and warn t black ani more but grai you could see littl dark spot drift along ever so far awaytrad scow and such thing and long black streaksraft sometim you could hear a sweep screak or jumbl up voic it wa so still and sound come so far and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there s a snag there in a swift current which break on it and make that streak look that wai and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the east redden up and the river and you make out a logcabin in the edg of the wood awai on the bank on t other side of the river be a woodyard like and pile by them cheat so you can throw a dog through it anywher then the nice breez spring up and come fan you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the wood and the flower but sometim not that wai becaus thei ve left dead fish lai around gar and such and thei do get pretti rank and next you ve got the full dai and everyth smile in the sun and the songbird just go it a littl smoke couldn t be notic now so we would take some fish off of the line and cook up a hot breakfast and afterward we would watch the lonesom of the river and kind of lazi along and by and by lazi off to sleep wake up by and by and look to see what done it and mayb see a steamboat cough along upstream so far off toward the other side you couldn t tell noth about her onli whether she wa a sternwheel or sidewheel then for about an hour there wouldn t be noth to hear nor noth to seejust solid lonesom next you d see a raft slide by awai off yonder and mayb a galoot on it chop becaus thei re most alwai do it on a raft you d see the ax flash and come downyou don t hear noth you see that ax go up again and by the time it s abov the man s head then you hear the k chunkit had took all that time to come over the water so we would put in the dai lazi around listen to the still onc there wa a thick fog and the raft and thing that went by wa beat tin pan so the steamboat wouldn t run over them a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talk and cuss and laughingheard them plain but we couldn t see no sign of them it made you feel crawli it wa like spirit carri on that wai in the air jim said he believ it wa spirit but i sai no spirit wouldn t sai dern the dern fog soon as it wa night out we shove when we got her out to about the middl we let her alon and let her float wherev the current want her to then we lit the pipe and dangl our leg in the water and talk about all kind of thingsw wa alwai nake dai and night whenev the mosquito would let usth new cloth buck s folk made for me wa too good to be comfort and besid i didn t go much on cloth nohow sometim we d have that whole river all to ourselv for the longest time yonder wa the bank and the island across the water and mayb a sparkwhich wa a candl in a cabin window and sometim on the water you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and mayb you could hear a fiddl or a song come over from on of them craft it s love to live on a raft we had the sky up there all speckl with star and we us to lai on our back and look up at them and discuss about whether thei wa made or onli just happen jim he allow thei wa made but i allow thei happen i judg it would have took too long to make so mani jim said the moon could a laid them well that look kind of reason so i didn t sai noth against it becaus i ve seen a frog lai most as mani so of cours it could be done we us to watch the star that fell too and see them streak down jim allow thei d got spoil and wa hove out of the nest onc or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slip along in the dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of spark up out of her chimblei and thei would rain down in the river and look aw pretti then she would turn a corner and her light would wink out and her powwow shut off and leav the river still again and by and by her wave would get to us a long time after she wa gone and joggl the raft a bit and after that you wouldn t hear noth for you couldn t tell how long except mayb frog or someth after midnight the peopl on shore went to bed and then for two or three hour the shore wa blackno more spark in the cabin window these spark wa our clockth first on that show again meant morn wa come so we hunt a place to hide and tie up right awai on morn about daybreak i found a cano and cross over a chute to the main shoreit wa onli two hundr yardsand paddl about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress wood to see if i couldn t get some berri just as i wa pass a place where a kind of a cowpath cross the crick here come a coupl of men tear up the path as tight as thei could foot it i thought i wa a goner for whenev anybodi wa after anybodi i judg it wa meor mayb jim i wa about to dig out from there in a hurri but thei wa pretti close to me then and sung out and beg me to save their livessaid thei hadn t been do noth and wa be chase for itsaid there wa men and dog acom thei want to jump right in but i sai don t you do it i don t hear the dog and hors yet you ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a littl wai then you take to the water and wade down to me and get inthat ll throw the dog off the scent thei done it and soon as thei wa aboard i lit out for our towhead and in about five or ten minut we heard the dog and the men awai off shout we heard them come along toward the crick but couldn t see them thei seem to stop and fool around a while then as we got further and further awai all the time we couldn t hardli hear them at all by the time we had left a mile of wood behind us and struck the river everyth wa quiet and we paddl over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwood and wa safe

awai and by and by the storm let up for good and all and the first cabinlight that show i roust him out and we slid the raft into hide quarter for the dai the king got out an old ratti deck of card after breakfast and him and the duke plai sevenup a while five cent a game then thei got tire of it and allow thei would lai out a campaign as thei call it the duke went down into hi carpetbag and

sort of laugh not the pleasant kind but the kind that make you feel like when you ar eat bread that s got sand in it then he sai slow and scorn the idea of you lynch anybodi it s amus the idea of you think you had pluck enough to lynch a man becaus you re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lai your hand on a man why a man s safe in the hand of ten thousand of your kinda long as it s daytim and you re not behind him do i know you i know you clear through i wa born and rais in the south and i ve live in the north so i know the averag all around the averag man s a coward in the north he let anybodi walk over him that want to and goe home and prai for a humbl spirit to bear it in the south on man all by himself ha stop a stage full of men in the daytim and rob the lot your newspap call you a brave peopl so much that you think you ar braver than ani other peoplewherea you re just as brave and no braver why don t your juri hang murder becaus thei re afraid the man s friend will shoot them in the back in the darkand it s just what thei would do so thei alwai acquit and then a man goe in the night with a hundr mask coward at hi back and lynch the rascal your mistak is that you didn t bring a man with you that s on mistak and the other is that you didn t come in the dark and fetch your mask you brought part of a manbuck hark thereand if you hadn t had him to start you you d a taken it out in blow you didn t want to come the averag man don t like troubl and danger you don t like troubl and danger but if onli half a manlik buck hark thereshout lynch him lynch him you re afraid to back downafraid you ll be found out to be what you arecowardsand so you rais a yell and hang yourselv on to that halfaman s coattail and come rage up here swear what big thing you re go to do the pitifulest thing out is a mob that s what an armi isa mob thei don t fight with courag that s born in them but with courag that s borrow from their mass and from their offic but a mob without ani man at the head of it is beneath piti now the thing for you to do is to droop your tail and go home and crawl in a hole if ani real lynch s go to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when thei come thei ll bring their mask and fetch a man along now leaveand take your halfaman with you toss hi gun up across hi left arm and cock it when he sai thi the crowd wash back sudden and then broke all apart and went tear off everi which wai and buck hark he heel it after them look toler cheap i could a stai if i want to but i didn t want to i went to the circu and loaf around the back side till the watchman went by and then dive in under the tent i had my twentydollar gold piec and some other monei but i reckon i better save it becaus there ain t no tell how soon you ar go to need it awai from home and amongst stranger that wai you can t be too care i ain t oppos to spend monei on circus when there ain t no other wai but there ain t no us in wast it on them it wa a real bulli circu it wa the splendidest sight that ever wa when thei all come ride in two and two a gentleman and ladi side by side the men just in their drawer and undershirt and no shoe nor stirrup and rest their hand on their thigh easi and comfortablether must a been twenti of themand everi ladi with a love complexion and perfectli beauti and look just like a gang of real sureenough queen and dress in cloth that cost million of dollar and just litter with diamond it wa a power fine sight i never see anyth so love and then on by on thei got up and stood and went aweav around the ring so gentl and wavi and grace the men look ever so tall and airi and straight with their head bob and skim along awai up there under the tentroof and everi ladi s roseleafi dress flap soft and silki around her hip and she look like the most loveliest parasol and then faster and faster thei went all of them danc first on foot out in the air and then the other the hors lean more and more and the ringmast go round and round the centerpol crack hi whip and shout hihi and the clown crack joke behind him and by and by all hand drop the rein and everi ladi put her knuckl on her hip and everi gentleman fold hi arm and then how the hors did lean over and hump themselv and so on after the other thei all skip off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scamper out and everybodi clap their hand and went just about wild well all through the circu thei done the most astonish thing and all the time that clown carri on so it most kill the peopl the ringmast couldn t ever sai a word to him but he wa back at him quick as a wink with the funniest thing a bodi ever said and how he ever could think of so mani of them and so sudden and so pat wa what i couldn t nowai understand why i couldn t a thought of them in a year and by and by a drunk man tri to get into the ringsaid he want to ride said he could ride as well as anybodi that ever wa thei argu and tri to keep him out but he wouldn t listen and the whole show come to a standstil then the peopl begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stir up the peopl and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the bench and swarm toward the ring sai knock him down throw him out and on or two women begun to scream so then the ringmast he made a littl speech and said he hope there wouldn t be no disturb and if the man would promis he wouldn t make no more troubl he would let him ride if he thought he could stai on the hors so everybodi laugh and said all right and the man got on the minut he wa on the hors begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circu men hang on to hi bridl try to hold him and the drunk man hang on to hi neck and hi heel fly in the air everi jump and the whole crowd of peopl stand up shout and laugh till tear roll down and at last sure enough all the circu men could do the hors broke loos and awai he went like the veri nation round and round the ring with that sot lai down on him and hang to hi neck with first on leg hang most to the ground on on side and then t other on on t other side and the peopl just crazi it warn t funni to me though i wa all of a trembl to see hi danger but pretti soon he struggl up astraddl and grab the bridl areel thi wai and that and the next minut he sprung up and drop the bridl and stood and the hors ago like a hous afir too he just stood up there asail around as easi and comfort as if he warn t ever drunk in hi lifeand then he begun to pull off hi cloth and sling them he shed them so thick thei kind of clog up the air and altogeth he shed seventeen suit and then there he wa slim and handsom and dress the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that hors with hi whip and made him fairli humand final skip off and made hi bow and danc off to the dressingroom and everybodi just ahowl with pleasur and astonish then the ringmast he see how he had been fool and he wa the sickest ringmast you ever see i reckon why it wa on of hi own men he had got up that joke all out of hi own head and never let on to nobodi well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldn t a been in that ringmast s place not for a thousand dollar i don t know there mai be bullier circus than what that on wa but i never struck them yet anywai it wa plenti good enough for me and wherev i run across it it can have all of my custom everi time well that night we had our show but there warn t onli about twelv peopl therejust enough to pai expens and thei laugh all the time and that made the duke mad and everybodi left anywai befor the show wa over but on boi which wa asleep so the duke said these arkansaw lunkhead couldn t come up to shakespear what thei want wa low comedyand mayb someth ruther wors than low comedi he reckon he said he could size their style so next morn he

duke s room and start to paw around it with my hand but i recollect it wouldn t be much like the king to let anybodi els take care of that monei but hi own self so then i went to hi room and begun to paw around there but i see i couldn t do noth without a candl and i dasn t light on of cours so i judg i d got to do the other thinglai for them and eavesdrop about that time i hear their footstep come and wa go to skip under the bed i reach for it but it wasn t where i thought it would be but i touch the curtain that hid mari jane s frock so i jump in behind that and snuggl in amongst the gown and stood there perfectli still thei come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done wa to get down and look under the bed then i wa glad i hadn t found the bed when i want it and yet you know it s kind of natur to hide under the bed when you ar up to anyth privat thei set down then and the king sai well what is it and cut it middlin short becaus it s better for us to be down there awhoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a chanc to talk us over well thi is it capet i ain t easi i ain t comfort that doctor lai on my mind i want to know your plan i ve got a notion and i think it s a sound on what is it duke that we better glide out of thi befor three in the morn and clip it down the river with what we ve got special see we got it so easygiven back to us flung at our head as you mai sai when of cours we allow to have to steal it back i m for knock off and light out that made me feel pretti bad about an hour or two ago it would a been a littl differ but now it made me feel bad and disappoint the king rip out and sai what and not sell out the rest o the properti march off like a passel of fool and leav eight or nine thou n dollar worth o properti layin around jest sufferin to be scoop inand all good salabl stuff too the duke he grumbl said the bag of gold wa enough and he didn t want to go no deeperdidn t want to rob a lot of orphan of everyth thei had why how you talk sai the king we sha n t rob em of noth at all but jest thi monei the peopl that bui the properti is the suff rer becaus as soon s it s found out at we didn t own itwhich won t be long after we ve slidth sale won t be valid and it ll all go back to the estat these yer orphan ll git their hous back agin and that s enough for them thei re young and spry and k n easi earn a livin thei ain t agoin to suffer why jest thinkther s thou n s and thou n s that ain t nigh so well off bless you thei ain t got noth n to complain of well the king he talk him blind so at last he give in and said all right but said he believ it wa blame foolish to stai and that doctor hang over them but the king sai cuss the doctor what do we k yer for him hain t we got all the fool in town on our side and ain t that a big enough major in ani town so thei got readi to go down stair again the duke sai i don t think we put that monei in a good place that cheer me up i d begun to think i warn t go to get a hint of no kind to help me the king sai why becaus mari jane ll be in mourn from thi out and first you know the nigger that doe up the room will get an order to box these dud up and put em awai and do you reckon a nigger can run across monei and not borrow some of it your head s level agin duke sai the king and he come afumbl under the curtain two or three foot from where i wa i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighti still though quiveri and i wonder what them fellow would sai to me if thei catch me and i tri to think what i d better do if thei did catch me but the king he got the bag befor i could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicion i wa around thei took and shove the bag through a rip in the straw tick that wa under the featherb and cram it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it wa all right now becaus a nigger onli make up the featherb and don t turn over the straw tick onli about twice a year and so it warn t in no danger of get stole now but i know better i had it out of there befor thei wa halfwai down stair i grope along up to my cubbi and hid it there till i could get a chanc to do better i judg i better hide it outsid of the hous somewher becaus if thei miss it thei would give the hous a good ransack i know that veri well then i turn in with my cloth all on but i couldn t a gone to sleep if i d a want to i wa in such a sweat to get through with the busi by and by i heard the king and the duke come up so i roll off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and wait to see if anyth wa go to happen but noth did so i held on till all the late sound had quit and the earli on hadn t begun yet and then i slip down the ladder chapter xxvii i crept to their door and listen thei wa snore so i tipto along and got down stair all right there warn t a sound anywher i peep through a crack of the diningroom door and see the men that wa watch the corps all sound asleep on their chair the door wa open into the parlor where the corps wa lai and there wa a candl in both room i pass along and the parlor door wa open but i see there warn t nobodi in there but the remaind of peter so i shove on by but the front door wa lock and the kei wasn t there just then i heard somebodi come down the stair back behind me i run in the parlor and took a swift look around and the onli place i see to hide the bag wa in the coffin the lid wa shove along about a foot show the dead man s face down in there with a wet cloth over it and hi shroud on i tuck the moneybag in under the lid just down beyond where hi hand wa cross which made me creep thei wa so cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the door the person come wa mari jane she went to the coffin veri soft and kneel down and look in then she put up her handkerchief and i see she begun to cry though i couldn t hear her and her back wa to me i slid out and as i pass the diningroom i thought i d make sure them watcher hadn t seen me so i look through the crack and everyth wa all right thei hadn t stir i slip up to bed feel ruther blue on account of the thing plai out that wai after i had took so much troubl and run so much resk about it sai i if it could stai where it is all right becaus when we get down the river a hundr mile or two i could write back to mari jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that ain t the thing that s go to happen the thing that s go to happen is the monei ll be found when thei come to screw on the lid then the king ll get it again and it ll be a long dai befor he give anybodi anoth chanc to smouch it from him of cours i want to slide down and get it out of there but i dasn t try it everi minut it wa get earlier now and pretti soon some of them watcher would begin to stir and i might get catchedcatch with six thousand dollar in my hand that nobodi hadn t hire me to take care of i don t wish to be mix up in no such busi as that i sai to myself when i got down stair in the morn the parlor wa shut up and the watcher wa gone there warn t nobodi around but the famili and the widow bartlei and our tribe i watch their face to see if anyth had been happen but i couldn t tell toward the middl of the dai the undertak come with hi man and thei set the coffin in the middl of the room on a coupl of chair and then set all our chair in row and borrow more from the neighbor till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom wa full i see the coffin lid wa the wai it wa befor but i dasn t go to look in under it with folk around then the peopl begun to flock in and the beat and the girl took seat in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the peopl file around slow in singl rank and look down at the dead man s face a minut and some drop in a tear and it wa all veri still and solemn onli the girl and the beat hold handkerchief to their ey and keep their head bent and sob a littl there warn t no other sound but the scrape of the feet on the floor and blow nosesbecaus peopl alwai blow them more at a funer than thei do at other place except church when the place wa pack full the undertak he slid around in hi black glove with hi softi soother wai put on the last touch and get peopl and thing all shipshap and comfort and make no more sound than a cat he never spoke he move peopl around he squeez in late on he open up passagewai and done it with nod and sign with hi hand then he took hi place over against the wall he wa the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there warn t no more smile to him than there is to a ham thei had borrow a melodeuma sick on and when everyth wa readi a young woman set down and work it and it wa pretti skreeki and colicki and everybodi join in and sung and peter wa the onli on that had a good thing accord to my notion then the reverend hobson open up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most outrag row bust out in the cellar a bodi ever heard it wa onli on dog but he made a most power racket and he kept it up right along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityou couldn t hear yourself think it wa right down awkward and nobodi didn t seem to know what to do but pretti soon thei see that longleg undertak make a sign to the preacher as much as to sai don t you worryjust depend on me then he stoop down and begun to glide along the wall just hi shoulder show over the peopl s head so he glide along and the powwow and racket get more and more outrag all the time and at last when he had gone around two side of the room he disappear down cellar then in about two second we heard a whack and the dog he finish up with a most amaz howl or two and then everyth wa dead still and the parson begun hi solemn talk where he left off in a minut or two here come thi undertak s back and shoulder glide along the wall again and so he glide and glide around three side of the room and then rose up and shade hi mouth with hi hand and stretch hi neck out toward the preacher over the peopl s head and sai in a kind of a coars whisper he had a rat then he droop down and glide along the wall again to hi place you could see it wa a great satisfact to the peopl becaus natur thei want to know a littl thing like that don t cost noth and it s just the littl thing that make a man to be look up to and like there warn t no more popular man in town than what that undertak wa well the funer sermon wa veri good but pison long and tiresom and then the king he shove in and got off some of hi usual rubbag and at last the job wa through and the undertak begun to sneak up on the coffin with hi screwdriv i wa in a sweat then and watch him pretti keen but he never meddl at all just slid the lid along as soft as mush and screw it down tight and fast so there i wa i didn t know whether the monei wa in there or not so sai i s pose somebodi ha hog that bag on the slynow how do i know whether to write to mari jane or not s pose she dug him up and didn t find noth what would she think of me blame it i sai i might get hunt up and jail i d better lai low and keep dark and not write at all the thing s aw mix now try to better it i ve worsen it a hundr time and i wish to good i d just let it alon dad fetch the whole busi thei buri him and we come back home and i went to watch face againi couldn t help it and i couldn t rest easi but noth come of it the face didn t tell me noth the king he visit around in the even and sweeten everybodi up and made himself ever so friendli and he give out the idea that hi congreg over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must hurri and settl up the estat right awai and leav for home he wa veri sorri he wa so push and so wa everybodi thei wish he could stai longer but thei said thei could see it couldn t be done and he said of cours him and william would take the girl home with them and that pleas everybodi too becaus then the girl would be well fix and amongst their own relat and it pleas the girl tootickl them so thei clean forgot thei ever had a troubl in the world and told him to sell out as quick as he want to thei would be readi them poor thing wa that glad and happi it made my heart ach to see them get fool and li to so but i didn t see no safe wai for me to chip in and chang the gener tune well blame if the king didn t bill the hous and the nigger and all the properti for auction straight offsal two dai after the funer but anybodi could bui privat beforehand if thei want to so the next dai after the funer along about noontim the girl joi got the first jolt a coupl of nigger trader come along and the king sold them the nigger reason for threedai draft as thei call it and awai thei went the two son up the river to memphi and their mother down the river to orlean i thought them poor girl and them nigger would break their heart for grief thei cri around each other and took on so it most made me down sick to see it the girl said thei hadn t ever dream of see the famili separ or sold awai from the town i can t ever get it out of my memori the sight of them poor miser girl and nigger hang around each other s neck and cry and i reckon i couldn t a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadn t know the sale warn t no account and the nigger would be back home in a week or two the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good mani come out flatfoot and said it wa scandal to separ the mother and the children that wai it injur the fraud some but the old fool he bull right along spite of all the duke could sai or do and i tell you the duke wa power uneasi next dai wa auction dai about broad dai in the morn the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look that there wa troubl the king sai wa you in my room night befor

straight for the graveyard which wa a mile and a half down the river and the whole town at our heel for we made nois enough and it wa onli nine in the even as we went by our hous i wish i hadn t sent mari jane out of town becaus now if i could tip her the wink she d light out and save me and blow on our deadbeat well we swarm along down the river road just carri on like wildcat and to make it more scari the sky wa dark up and the lightn begin to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst the leav thi wa the most aw troubl and most dangersom i ever wa in and i wa kinder stun everyth wa go so differ from what i had allow for stead of be fix so i could take my own time if i want to and see all the fun and have mari jane at my back to save me and set me free when the closefit come here wa noth in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomark if thei didn t find them i couldn t bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldn t think about noth els it got darker and darker and it wa a beauti time to give the crowd the slip but that big huski had me by the wristhinesand a bodi might as well try to give goliar the slip he drag me right along he wa so excit and i had to run to keep up when thei got there thei swarm into the graveyard and wash over it like an overflow and when thei got to the grave thei found thei had about a hundr time as mani shovel as thei want but nobodi hadn t thought to fetch a lantern but thei sail into dig anywai by the flicker of the lightn and sent a man to the nearest hous a half a mile off to borrow on so thei dug and dug like everyth and it got aw dark and the rain start and the wind swish and swush along and the lightn come brisker and brisker and the thunder boom but them peopl never took no notic of it thei wa so full of thi busi and on minut you could see everyth and everi face in that big crowd and the shovel of dirt sail up out of the grave and the next second the dark wipe it all out and you couldn t see noth at all at last thei got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then such anoth crowd and shoulder and shove as there wa to scroug in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that wai it wa aw hine he hurt my wrist dread pull and tug so and i reckon he clean forgot i wa in the world he wa so excit and pant all of a sudden the lightn let go a perfect sluic of white glare and somebodi sing out by the live jingo here s the bag of gold on hi breast hine let out a whoop like everybodi els and drop my wrist and give a big surg to bust hi wai in and get a look and the wai i lit out and shin for the road in the dark there ain t nobodi can tell i had the road all to myself and i fairli flewleastwai i had it all to myself except the solid dark and the nowandthen glare and the buzz of the rain and the thrash of the wind and the split of the thunder and sure as you ar born i did clip it along when i struck the town i see there warn t nobodi out in the storm so i never hunt for no back street but hump it straight through the main on and when i begun to get toward our hous i aim my ey and set it no light there the hous all darkwhich made me feel sorri and disappoint i didn t know why but at last just as i wa sail by flash come the light in mari jane s window and my heart swell up sudden like to bust and the same second the hous and all wa behind me in the dark and wasn t ever go to be befor me no more in thi world she wa the best girl i ever see and had the most sand the minut i wa far enough abov the town to see i could make the towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time the lightn show me on that wasn t chain i snatch it and shove it wa a cano and warn t fasten with noth but a rope the towhead wa a rattl big distanc off awai out there in the middl of the river but i didn t lose no time and when i struck the raft at last i wa so fag i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afford it but i didn t as i sprung aboard i sung out out with you jim and set her loos glori be to good we re shut of them jim lit out and wa acom for me with both arm spread he wa so full of joi but when i glimps him in the lightn my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backward for i forgot he wa old king lear and a drownd arab all in on and it most scare the liver and light out of me but jim fish me out and wa go to hug me and bless me and so on he wa so glad i wa back and we wa shut of the king and the duke but i sai not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast cut loos and let her slide so in two second awai we went aslid down the river and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselv on the big river and nobodi to bother us i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack my heel a few timesi couldn t help it but about the third crack i notic a sound that i know mighti well and held my breath and listen and wait and sure enough when the next flash bust out over the water here thei comeand just alai to their oar and make their skiff hum it wa the king and the duke so i wilt right down on to the plank then and give up and it wa all i could do to keep from cry chapter xxx when thei got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar and sai tryin to give us the slip wa ye you pup tire of our compani hei i sai no your majesti we warn tpleas don t your majesti quick then and

would you a done ani differ did you inquir around for him when you got loos i don t rememb it so the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybodi in it but the duke sai you better a blame sight give yourself a good cuss for you re the on that s entitl to it most you hain t done a thing from the start that had ani sens in it except come out so cool and cheeki with that imaginari bluearrow mark that wa brightit wa right down bulli and it wa the thing that save us for if it hadn t been for that thei d a jail us till them englishmen s baggag comeand thenth penitentiari you bet

warrant to wear toolong than we d need em thei wa still a minutethink then the king sai kind of absentmind like mf and we reckon the nigger stole it that made me squirm ye sai the duke kinder slow and deliber and sarcast we did after about a half a minut the king drawl out leastwai i did the duke sai the same wai on the contrari i did the king kind of ruffl up and sai looki here bilgewat what r you

ll b liev you and take back everyth i said you old scoundrel i didn t and you know i didn t there now well then i b liev you but answer me onli jest thi on morenow don t git mad didn t you have it in your mind to hook the monei and hide it the duke never said noth for a littl bit then he sai well i don t care if i did i didn t do it anywai but you not onli had it in mind to do it but you done it i wisht i never die if i done it duke and that s honest i won t sai i warn t goin to do it becaus i wa but youi mean somebodygot in ahead o me it s a lie you done it and you got to sai you done it or the king began to gurgl and then he gasp out noughi own up i wa veri glad to hear him sai that it made me feel much more easier than what i wa feel befor so the duke took hi hand off and sai if you ever deni it again i ll drown you it s well for you to set there and blubber like a babyit s fitten for you after the wai you ve act i never see such an old ostrich for want to gobbl everythingand i atrust you all the time like you wa my own father you ought to been asham of yourself to stand by and hear it saddl on to a lot of poor nigger and you never sai a word for em it make me feel ridicul to think i wa soft enough to believ that rubbag cuss you i can see now why you wa so anxiou to make up the deffisity want to get what monei i d got out of the nonesuch and on thing or anoth and scoop it all the king sai timid and still asnuffl why duke it wa you that said make up the deffisit it warn t me dry up i don t want to hear no more out of you sai the duke and now you see what you got by it thei ve got all their own monei back and all of ourn but a shekel or two besid g long to bed and don t you deffersit me no more deffersit long s you live so the king sneak into the wigwam and took to hi bottl for comfort and befor long the duke tackl hi bottl and so in about a half an hour thei wa as thick as thiev again and the tighter thei got the loving thei got and went off asnor in each other s arm thei both got power mellow but i notic the king didn t get mellow enough to forget to rememb to not deni about hide the moneybag again that made me feel easi and satisfi of cours when thei got to snore we had a long gabbl and i told jim everyth chapter xxxi we dasn t stop again at ani town for dai and dai kept right along down the river we wa down south in the warm weather now and a mighti long wai from home we begun to come to tree with spanish moss on them hang down from the limb like long grai beard it wa the first i ever see it grow and it made the wood look solemn and dismal so now the fraud reckon thei wa out of danger and thei begun to work the villag again first thei done a lectur on temper but thei didn t make enough for them both to get drunk on then in anoth villag thei start a dancingschool but thei didn t know no more how to danc than a kangaroo doe so the first pranc thei made the gener public jump in and pranc them out of town anoth time thei tri to go at yellocut but thei didn t yellocut long till the audienc got up and give them a solid good cuss and made them skip out thei tackl missionari and mesmer and doctor and tell fortun and a littl of everyth but thei couldn t seem to have no luck so at last thei got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she float along think and think and never sai noth by the half a dai at a time and dread blue and desper and at last thei took a chang and begun to lai their head togeth in the wigwam and talk low and confidenti two or three hour at a time jim and me got uneasi we didn t like the look of it we judg thei wa studi up some kind of wors deviltri than ever we turn it over and over and at last we made up our mind thei wa go to break into somebodi s hous or store or wa go into the counterfeitmonei busi or someth so then we wa pretti scare and made up an agreement that we wouldn t have noth in the world to do with such action and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leav them behind well earli on morn we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a littl bit of a shabbi villag name pikesvil and the king he went ashor and told us all to stai hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybodi had got ani wind of the royal nonesuch there yet hous to rob you mean sai i to myself and when you get through rob it you ll come back here and wonder what ha becom of me and jim and the raftand you ll have to take it out in wonder and he said if he warn t back by middai the duke and me would know it wa all right and we wa to come along so we stai where we wa the duke he fret and sweat around and wa in a mighti sour wai he scold us for everyth and we couldn t seem to do noth right he found fault with everi littl thing someth wa abrew sure i wa good and glad when middai come and no king we could have a chang anywayand mayb a chanc for the chang on top of it so me and the duke went up to the villag and hunt around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back room of a littl low doggeri veri tight and a lot of loafer bullyrag him for sport and he acuss and athreaten with all hi might and so tight he couldn t walk and couldn t do noth to them the duke he begun to abus him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back and the minut thei wa fairli at it i lit out and shook the reef out of my hind leg and spun down the river road like a deer for i see our chanc and i made up my mind that it would be a long dai befor thei ever see me and jim again i got down there all out of breath but load up with joi and sung out set her loos jim we re all right now but there warn t no answer and nobodi come out of the wigwam jim wa gone i set up a shoutand then anotherand then anoth on and run thi wai and that in the wood whoop and screech but it warn t no useold jim wa gone then i set down and cri i couldn t help it but i couldn t set still long pretti soon i went out on the road try to think what i better do and i run across a boi walk and ask him if he d seen a strang nigger dress so and so and he sai ye whereabout sai i down to sila phelp place two mile below here he s a runawai nigger and thei ve got him wa you look for him you bet i ain t i run across him in the wood about an hour or two ago and he said if i holler he d cut my liver outand told me to lai down and stai where i wa and i done it been there ever sinc afeard to come out well he sai you needn t be afeard no more becuz thei ve got him he run off f m down south som er it s a good job thei got him well i reckon there s two hunderd dollar reward on him it s like pick up monei out n the road ye it isand i could a had it if i d been big enough i see him first who nail him it wa an old fellowa strangerand he sold out hi chanc in him for forti dollar becuz he s got to go up the river and can t wait think o that now you bet i d wait if it wa seven year that s me everi time sai i but mayb hi chanc ain t worth no more than that if he ll sell it so cheap mayb there s someth ain t straight about it but it is thoughstraight as a string i see the handbil myself it tell all about him to a dotpaint him like a pictur and tell the plantat he s frum below newrlean nosirreebob thei ain t no troubl bout that specul you bet you sai gimm a chaw toback won t ye i didn t have none so he left i went to the raft and set down in the wigwam to think but i couldn t come to noth i thought till i wore my head sore but i couldn t see no wai out of the troubl after all thi long journei and after all we d done for them scoundrel here it wa all come to noth everyth all bust up and ruin becaus thei could have the heart to serv jim such a trick as that and make him a slave again all hi life and amongst stranger too for forti dirti dollar onc i said to myself it would be a thousand time better for jim to be a slave at home where hi famili wa as long as he d got to be a slave and so i d better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he wa but i soon give up that notion for two thing she d be mad and disgust at hi rascal and ungrat for leav her and so she d sell him straight down the river again and if she didn t everybodi natur despis an ungrat nigger and thei d make jim feel it all the time and so he d feel orneri and disgrac and then think of me it would get all around that huck finn help a nigger to get hi freedom and if i wa ever to see anybodi from that town again i d be readi to get down and lick hi boot for shame that s just the wai a person doe a lowdown thing and then he don t want to take no consequ of it think as long as he can hide it it ain t no disgrac that wa my fix exactli the more i studi about thi the more my conscienc went to grind me and the more wick and lowdown and orneri i got to feel and at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here wa the plain hand of provid slap me in the face and let me know my wicked wa be watch all the time from up there in heaven whilst i wa steal a poor old woman s nigger that hadn t ever done me no harm and now wa show me there s on that s alwai on the lookout and ain t ago to allow no such miser do to go onli just so fur and no further i most drop in my track i wa so scare well i tri the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by sai i wa brung up wick and so i warn t so much to blame but someth insid of me kept sai there wa the sundayschool you could a gone to it and if you d a done it thei d a learnt you there that peopl that act as i d been act about that nigger goe to everlast fire it made me shiver and i about made up my mind to prai and see if i couldn t try to quit be the kind of a boi i wa and be better so i kneel down but the word wouldn t come why wouldn t thei it warn t no us to try and hide it from him nor from me neither i know veri well why thei wouldn t come it wa becaus my heart warn t right it wa becaus i warn t squar it wa becaus i wa plai doubl i wa let on to give up sin but awai insid of me i wa hold on to the biggest on of all i wa try to make my mouth sai i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that nigger s owner and tell where he wa but deep down in me i know it wa a lie and he know it you can t prai a liei found that out so i wa full of troubl full as i could be and didn t know what to do at last i had an idea and i sai i ll go and write the letterand then see if i can prai why it wa astonish the wai i felt as light as a feather right straight off and my troubl all gone so i got a piec of paper and a pencil all glad and excit and set down and wrote miss watson your runawai nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesvil and mr phelp ha got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send huck finn i felt good and all wash clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life and i know i could prai now but i didn t do it straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthink how good it wa all thi happen so and how near i come to be lost and go to hell and went on think and got to think over our trip down the river and i see jim befor me all the time in the dai and in the nighttim sometim moonlight sometim storm and we afloat along talk and sing and laugh but somehow i couldn t seem to strike no place to harden me against him but onli the other kind i d see him stand my watch on top of hi n stead of call me so i could go on sleep and see him how glad he wa when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud wa and suchlik time and would alwai call me honei and pet me and do everyth he could think of for me and how good he alwai wa and at last i struck the time i save him by tell the men we had smallpox aboard and he wa so grate and said i wa the best friend old jim ever had in the world and the onli on he s got now and then i happen to look around and see that paper it wa a close place i took it up and held it in my hand i wa atrembl becaus i d got to decid forev betwixt two thing and i know it i studi a minut sort of hold my breath and then sai to myself all right then i ll go to hell and tore it up it wa aw thought and aw word but thei wa said and i let them stai said and never thought no more about reform i shove the whole thing out of my head and said i would take up wicked again which wa in my line be brung up to it and the other warn t and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slaveri again and if i could think up anyth wors i would do that too becaus as long as i wa in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog then i set to think over how to get at it and turn over some consider mani wai in my mind and at last fix up a plan that suit me so then i took the bear of a woodi island that wa down the river a piec and as soon as it wa fairli dark i crept out with my raft and went for it and hid it there and then turn in i slept the night through and got up befor it wa light and had my breakfast and put on my store cloth and ti up some other and on thing or anoth in a bundl and took the cano and clear for shore i land below where i judg wa phelp s place and hid my bundl in the wood and then fill up the cano with water and load rock into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i want her about a quarter of a mile below a littl steam sawmil that wa on the bank then i struck up the road and when i pass the mill i see a sign on it phelp s sawmil and when i come to the farmhous two or three hundr yard further along i kept my ey peel but didn t see nobodi around though it wa good daylight now but i didn t mind becaus i didn t want to see nobodi just yeti onli want to get the lai of the land accord to my plan i wa go to turn up there from the villag not from below so i just took a look and shove along straight for town well the veri first man i see when i got there wa the duke he wa stick up a bill for the royal nonesuchthreenight performancelik that other time thei had the cheek them fraud i wa right on him befor i could shirk he look astonish and sai hello where d you come from then he sai kind of glad and eager where s the raftgot her in a good place i sai why that s just what i wa go to ask your grace then he didn t look so joy and sai what wa your idea for ask me he sai well i sai when i see the king in that doggeri yesterdai i sai to myself we can t get him home for hour till he s sober so i went aloaf around town to put in the time and wait a man up and offer me ten cent to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep and so i went along but when we wa drag him to the boat and the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along he wa too strong for me and jerk loos and run and we after him we didn t have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the countri till we tire him out we never got him till dark then we fetch him over and i start down for the raft when i got there and see it wa gone i sai to myself thei ve got into troubl and had to leav and thei ve took my nigger which is the onli nigger i ve got in the world and now i m in a strang countri and ain t got no properti no more nor noth and no wai to make my live so i set down and cri i slept in the wood all night but what did becom of the raft thenand jimpoor jim blame if i knowthat is what s becom of the raft that old fool had made a trade and got forti dollar and when we found him in the doggeri the loafer had match halfdollar with him and got everi cent but what he d spent for whiski and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone we said that littl rascal ha stole our raft and shook us and run off down the river i wouldn t shake my nigger would ith onli nigger i had in the world and the onli properti we never thought of that fact is i reckon we d come to consid him our nigger ye we did consid him sogood know we had troubl enough for him so when we see the raft wa gone and we flat broke there warn t anyth for it but to try the royal nonesuch anoth shake and i ve peg along ever sinc dry as a powderhorn where s that ten cent give it here i had consider monei so i give him ten cent but beg him to spend it for someth to eat and give me some becaus it wa all the monei i had and i hadn t had noth to eat sinc yesterdai he never said noth the next minut he whirl on me and sai do you reckon that nigger would blow on us we d skin him if he done that how can he blow hain t he run off no that old fool sold him and never divid with me and the monei s gone sold him i sai and begun to cry why he wa my nigger and that wa my monei where is hei want my nigger well you can t get your nigger that s allso dry up your blubber looki heredo you think you d ventur to blow on us blame if i think i d trust you why if you wa to blow on us he stop but i never see the duke look so ugli out of hi ey befor i went on awhimp and sai i don t want to blow on nobodi and i ain t got no time to blow nohow i got to turn out and find my nigger he look kinder bother and stood there with hi bill flutter on hi arm think and wrinkl up hi forehead at last he sai i ll tell you someth we got to be here three dai if you ll promis you won t blow and won t let the nigger blow i ll tell you where to find him so i promis and he sai a farmer by the name of sila ph and then he stop you see he start to tell me the truth but when he stop that wai and begun to studi and think again i reckon he wa chang hi mind and so he wa he wouldn t trust me he want to make sure of have me out of the wai the whole three dai so pretti soon he sai the man that bought him is name abram fosterabram g fosterand he live forti mile back here in the countri on the road to

the same room and bed so be tire we bid goodnight and went up to bed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the lightningrod and shove for the town for i didn t believ anybodi wa go to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didn t hurri up and give them on thei d get into troubl sure on the road tom he told me all about how it wa reckon i wa murder and how pap disappear pretti soon and didn t come back no more and what a stir there wa when jim run awai and i told tom all about our royal nonesuch rapscallion and as much of the raft voyag as i had time to and as we struck into the town and up through the the middl of itit wa as much as halfaft eight thenher come a rage rush of peopl with torch and an aw whoop and yell and bang tin pan and blow horn and we jump to on side to let them go by and as thei went by i see thei had the king and the duke astraddl of a railthat is i know it wa the king and the duke though thei wa all over tar and feather and didn t look like noth in the world that wa humanjust look like a coupl of monstrou big soldierplum well it made me sick to see it and i wa sorri for them poor piti rascal it seem like i couldn t ever feel ani hard against them ani more in the world it wa a dread thing to see human be can be aw cruel to on anoth we see we wa too latecouldn t do no good we ask some straggler about it and thei said everybodi went to the show look veri innoc and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king wa in the middl of hi cavort on the stage then somebodi give a signal and the hous rose up and went for them so we poke along back home and i warn t feel so brash as i wa befor but kind of orneri and humbl and to blame somehowthough i hadn t done noth but that s alwai the wai it don t make no differ whether you do right or wrong a person s conscienc ain t got no sens and just goe for him anywai if i had a yaller dog that didn t know no more than a person s conscienc doe i would pison him it take up more room than all the rest of a person s insid and yet ain t no good nohow tom sawyer he sai the same chapter xxxiv we stop talk and got to think by and by tom sai looki here huck what fool we ar to not think of it befor i bet i know where jim is no where in that hut down by the ashhopp why looki here when we wa at dinner didn t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittl ye what did you think the vittl wa for for a dog so d i well it wasn t for a dog why becaus part of it wa watermelon so it wasi notic it well it doe beat all that i never thought about a dog not eat watermelon it show how a bodi can see and don t see at the same time well the nigger unlock the padlock when he went in and he lock it again when he came out he fetch uncl a kei about the time we got up from tablesam kei i bet watermelon show man lock show prison and it ain t like there s two prison on such a littl plantat and where the peopl s all so kind and good jim s the prison all righti m glad we found it out detect fashion i wouldn t give shuck for ani other wai now you work your mind and studi out a plan to steal jim and i will studi out on too and we ll take the on we like the best what a head for just a boi to have if i had tom sawyer s head i wouldn t trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in a circu nor noth i can think of i went to think out a plan but onli just to be do someth i know veri well where the right plan wa go to come from pretti soon tom sai readi ye i sai all rightbr it out my plan is thi i sai we can easi find out if it s jim in there then get up my cano tomorrow night and fetch my raft over from the island then the first dark night that come steal the kei out of the old man s britch after he goe to bed and shove off down the river on the raft with jim hide daytim and run night the wai me and jim us to do befor wouldn t that plan work work why cert nly it would work like rat afight but it s too blame simpl there ain t noth to it what s the good of a plan that ain t no more troubl than that it s as mild as goosemilk why huck it wouldn t make no more talk than break into a soap factori i never said noth becaus i warn t expect noth differ but i know mighti well that whenev he got hi plan readi it wouldn t have none of them object to it and it didn t he told me what it wa and i see in a minut it wa worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a man as mine would and mayb get us all kill besid so i wa satisfi and said we would waltz in on it i needn t tell what it wa here becaus i know it wouldn t stai the wai it wa i know he would be chang it around everi which wai as we went along and heav in new bulli wherev he got a chanc and that is what he done well on thing wa dead sure and that wa that tom sawyer wa in earnest and wa actuli go to help steal that nigger out of slaveri that wa the thing that wa too mani for me here wa a boi that wa respect and well brung up and had a charact to lose and folk at home that had charact and he wa bright and not leatherhead and know and not ignor and not mean but kind and yet here he wa without ani more pride or right or feel than to stoop to thi busi and make himself a shame and hi famili a shame befor everybodi i couldn t understand it no wai at all it wa outrag and i know i ought to just up and tell him so and so be hi true friend and let him quit the thing right where he wa and save himself and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and sai don t you reckon i know what i m about don t i generli know what i m about ye didn t i sai i wa go to help steal the nigger ye well then that s all he said and that s all i said it warn t no us to sai ani more becaus when he said he d do a thing he alwai done it but i couldn t make out how he wa will to go into thi thing so i just let it go and never bother no more about it if he wa bound to have it so i couldn t help it when we got home the hous wa all dark and still so we went on down to the hut by the ashhopp for to examin it we went through the yard so as to see what the hound would do thei know us and didn t make no more nois than countri dog is alwai do when anyth come by in the night when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two side and on the side i warn t acquaint withwhich wa the north sidew found a squar windowhol up toler high with just on stout board nail across it i sai here s the ticket thi hole s big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board tom sai it s as simpl as tittatto threeinarow and as easi as plai hooki i should hope we can find a wai that s a littl more complic than that huck finn well then i sai how ll it do to saw him out the wai i done befor i wa murder that time that s more like he sai it s real mysteri and troublesom and good he sai but i bet we can find a wai that s twice as long there ain t no hurri le s keep on look around betwixt the hut and the fenc on the back side wa a leanto that join the hut at the eav and wa made out of plank it wa as long as the hut but narrowonli about six foot wide the door to it wa at the south end and wa padlock tom he went to the soapkettl and search around and fetch back the iron thing thei lift the lid with so he took it and prize out on of the stapl the chain fell down and we open the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and see the shed wa onli built against a cabin and hadn t no connect with it and there warn t no floor to the shed nor noth in it but some old rusti playedout hoe and spade and pick and a crippl plow the match went out and so did we and shove in the stapl again and the door wa lock as good as ever tom wa joy he sai now we re all right we ll dig him out it ll take about a week then we start for the hous and i went in the back dooryou onli have to pull a buckskin latchstr thei don t fasten the doorsbut that warn t romant enough for tom sawyer no wai would do him but he must climb up the lightningrod but after he got up half wai about three time and miss fire and fell everi time and the last time most bust hi brain out he thought he d got to give it up but after he wa rest he allow he would give her on more turn for luck and thi time he made the trip in the morn we wa up at break of dai and down to the nigger cabin to pet the dog and make friend with the nigger that fed jimif it wa jim that wa be fed the nigger wa just get through breakfast and start for the field and jim s nigger wa pile up a tin pan with bread and meat and thing and whilst the other wa leav the kei come from the hous thi nigger had a goodnatur chucklehead face and hi wool wa all ti up in littl bunch with thread that wa to keep witch off he said the witch wa pester him aw these night and make him see all kind of strang thing and hear all kind of strang word and nois and he didn t believ he wa ever witch so long befor in hi life he got so work up and got to run on so about hi troubl he forgot all about what he d been ago to do so tom sai what s the vittl for go to feed the dog the nigger kind of smile around gradual over hi face like when you heav a brickbat in a mudpuddl and he sai ye mar sid a dog cur us dog too doe you want to go en look at im ye i hunch tom and whisper you go right here in the daybreak that warn t the plan no it warn t but it s the plan now so drat him we went along but i didn t like it much when we got in we couldn t hardli see anyth it wa so dark but jim wa there sure enough and could see us and he sing out why huck en good lan ain dat misto tom i just know how it would be i just expect it i didn t know noth to do and if i had i couldn t a done it becaus that nigger bust in and sai why de graciou sake do he know you genlmen we could see pretti well now tom he look at the nigger steadi and kind of wonder and sai doe who know us why disyer runawai nigger i don t reckon he doe but what put that into your head what put it dar didn he ji di minut sing out like he know you tom sai in a puzzledup kind of wai well that s mighti curiou who sung out when did he sing out what did he sing out and turn to me perfectli ca m and sai did you hear anybodi sing out of cours there warn t noth to be said but the on thing so i sai no i ain t heard nobodi sai noth then he turn to jim and look him over like he never see him befor and sai did you sing out no sah sai jim i hain t said noth sah not a word no sah i hain t said a word did you ever see us befor no sah not as i know on so tom turn to the nigger which wa look wild and distress and sai kind of sever what do you reckon s the matter with you anywai what made you think somebodi sung out oh it s de dadblam witch sah en i wisht i wa dead i do dei s awluz at it sah en dei do mo kill me dei sk yer me so pleas to don t tell nobodi bout it sah er ol mar sila he ll scole me kase he sai dei ain t no witch i ji wish to good he wa heah nowden what would he sai i ji bet he couldn fine no wai to git aroun it di time but it s awluz ji so peopl dat s sot stai sot dei won t look into noth n en fine it out f r deyselv en when you fine it out en tell um bout it dei doan b liev you tom give him a dime and said we wouldn t tell nobodi and told him to bui some more thread to tie up hi wool with and then look at jim and sai i wonder if uncl sila is go to hang thi nigger if i wa to catch a nigger that wa ungrat enough to run awai i wouldn t give him up i d hang him and whilst the nigger step to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it wa good he whisper to jim and sai don t ever let on to know us and if you hear ani dig go on night it s us we re go to set you free jim onli had time to grab us by the hand and squeez it then the nigger come back and we said we d come again some time if the nigger want us to and he said he would more particular if it wa dark becaus the witch went for him mostli in the dark and it wa good to have folk around then chapter xxxv it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down into the wood becaus tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by and a lantern make too much and might get us into troubl what we must have wa a lot of them rotten chunk that s call foxfir and just make a soft kind of a glow when you lai them in a dark place we fetch an arm and hid it in the weed and set down to rest and tom sai kind of dissatisfi blame it thi whole thing is just as easi and awkward as it can be and so it make it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan there ain t no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be a watchman there ain t even a dog to give a sleepingmixtur to and there s jim chain by on leg with a tenfoot chain to the leg of hi bed why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain and uncl sila he trust everybodi send the kei to the punkinhead nigger and don t send nobodi to watch the nigger jim could a got out of that windowhol befor thi onli there wouldn t be no us try to travel with a tenfoot chain on hi leg why drat it huck it s the stupidest arrang i ever see you got to invent all the difficulti well we can t help it we got to do the best we can with the materi we ve got anyhow there s on thingther s more honor in get him out through a lot of difficulti and danger where there warn t on of them furnish to you by the peopl who it wa their duti to furnish them and you had to contriv them all out of your own head now look at just that on thing of the lantern when you come down to the cold fact we simpli got to let on that a lantern s reski why we could work with a torchlight process if we want to i believ now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up someth to make a saw out of the first chanc we get what do we want of a saw what do we want of it hain t we got to saw the leg of jim s bed off so as to get the chain loos why you just said a bodi could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off well if that ain t just like you huck finn you can get up the infantschooliest wai of go at a thing why hain t you ever read ani book at allbaron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeni nor henri iv nor none of them hero who ever heard of get a prison loos in such an oldmaidi wai as that no the wai all the best author doe is to saw the bedleg in two and leav it just so and swallow the sawdust so it can t be found and put some dirt and greas around the saw place so the veri keenest senesk can t see no sign of it s be saw and think the bedleg is perfectli sound then the night you re readi fetch the leg a kick down she goe slip off your chain and there you ar noth to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlement shin down it break your leg in the moatbecaus a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowand there s your hors and your trusti vassl and thei scoop you up and fling you across a saddl and awai you go to your nativ langudoc or navarr or wherev it is it s gaudi huck i wish there wa a moat to thi cabin if we get time the night of the escap we ll dig on i sai what do we want of a moat when we re go to snake him out from under the cabin but he never heard me he had forgot me and everyth els he had hi chin in hi hand think pretti soon he sigh and shake hi head then sigh again and sai no it wouldn t dother ain t necess enough for it for what i sai why to saw jim s leg off he sai good land i sai why there ain t no necess for it and what would you want to saw hi leg off for anywai well some of the best author ha done it thei couldn t get the chain off so thei just cut their hand off and shove and a leg would be better still but we got to let that go there ain t necess enough in thi case and besid jim s a nigger and wouldn t understand the reason for it and how it s the custom in europ so we ll let it go but there s on thingh can have a rope ladder we can tear up our sheet and make him a rope ladder easi enough and we can send it to him in a pie it s mostli done that wai and i ve et wors pi why tom sawyer how you talk i sai jim ain t got no us for a rope ladder he ha got us for it how you talk you better sai you don t know noth about it he s got to have a rope ladder thei all do what in the nation can he do with it do with it he can hide it in hi bed can t he that s what thei all do and he s got to too huck you don t ever seem to want to do anyth that s regular you want to be start someth fresh all the time s pose he don t do noth with it ain t it there in hi bed for a clew after he s gone and don t you reckon thei ll want clew of cours thei will and you wouldn t leav them ani that would be a pretti howdydo wouldn t it i never heard of such a thing well i sai if it s in the regul and he s got to have it all right let him have it becaus i don t wish to go back on no regul but there s on thing tom sawyerif we go to tear up our sheet to make jim a rope ladder we re go to get into troubl with aunt salli just as sure as you re born now the wai i look at it a hickrybark ladder don t cost noth and don t wast noth and is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as ani rag ladder you can start and as for jim he ain t had no experi and so he don t care what kind of a oh shuck huck finn if i wa as ignor as you i d keep stillthat s what i d do who ever heard of a state prison escap by a hickrybark ladder why it s perfectli ridicul well all right tom fix it your own wai but if you ll take my advic you ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clotheslin he said that would do and that gave him anoth idea and he sai borrow a shirt too what do we want of a shirt tom want it for jim to keep a journal on journal your grannyjim can t write s pose he can t writeh can make mark on the shirt can t he if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piec of an old iron barrelhoop why tom we can pull a feather out of a goos and make him a better on and quicker too prison don t have gees run around the donjonkeep to pull pen out of you muggin thei alwai make their pen out of the hardest toughest troublesomest piec of old brass candlestick or someth like that thei can get their hand on and it take them week and week and month and month to file it out too becaus thei ve got to do it by rub it on the wall thei wouldn t us a goosequil if thei had it it ain t regular well then what ll we make him the ink out of mani make it out of ironrust and tear but that s the common sort and women the best author us their own blood jim can do that and when he want to send ani littl common ordinari mysteri messag to let the world know where he s captiv he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window the iron mask alwai done that and it s a blame good wai too jim ain t got no tin plate thei feed him in a pan that ain t noth we can get him some can t nobodi read hi plate that ain t got anyth to do with it huck finn all he s got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out you don t have to be abl to read it why half the time you can t read anyth a prison write on a tin plate or anywher els well then what s the sens in wast the plate why blame it all it ain t the prison s plate but it s somebodi s plate ain t it well spo n it is what doe the prison care whose he broke off there becaus we heard the breakfasthorn blow so we clear out for the hous along dure the morn i borrow a sheet and a white shirt off of the clotheslin and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went down and got the foxfir and put that in too i call it borrow becaus that wa what pap alwai call it but tom said it warn t borrow it wa steal he said we wa repres prison and prison don t care how thei get a thing so thei get it and nobodi don t blame them for it either it ain t no crime in a prison to steal the thing he need to get awai with tom said it s hi right and so as long as we wa repres a prison we had a perfect right to steal anyth on thi place we had the least us for to get ourselv out of prison with he said if we warn t prison it would be a veri differ thing and nobodi but a mean orneri person would steal when he warn t a prison so we allow we would steal everyth there wa that come handi and yet he made a mighti fuss on dai after that when i stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it and he made me go and give the nigger a dime without tell them what it wa for tom said that what he meant wa we could steal anyth we need well i sai i need the watermelon but he said i didn t need it to get out of prison with there s where the differ wa he said if i d a want it to hide a knife in and smuggl it to jim to kill the senesk with it would a been all right so i let it go at that though i couldn t see no advantag in my repres a prison if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinct like that everi time i see a chanc to hog a watermelon well as i wa sai we wait that morn till everybodi wa settl down to busi and nobodi in sight around the yard then tom he carri the sack into the leanto whilst i stood off a piec to keep watch by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpil to talk he sai everyth s all right now except tool and that s easi fix tool i sai ye tool for what why to dig with we ain t ago to gnaw him out ar we ain t them old crippl pick and thing in there good enough to dig a nigger out with i sai he turn on me look piti enough to make a bodi cry and sai huck finn did you ever hear of a prison have pick and shovel and all the modern conveni in hi wardrob to dig himself out with now i want to ask youif you got ani reason in you at allwhat kind of a show would that give him to be a hero why thei might as well lend him the kei and done with it pick and shovelswhi thei wouldn t furnish em to a king well then i sai if we don t want the pick and shovel what do we want a coupl of casekn to dig the foundat out from under that cabin with ye confound it it s foolish tom it don t make no differ how foolish it is it s the right wayand it s the regular wai and there ain t no other wai that ever i heard of and i ve read all the book that give ani inform about these thing thei alwai dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt mind you generli it s through solid rock and it take them week and week and week and for ever and ever why look at on of them prison in the bottom dungeon of the castl deef in the harbor of marseil that dug himself out that wai how long wa he at it you reckon i don t know well guess i don t know a month and a half thirtyseven yearand he come out in china that s the kind i wish the bottom of thi fortress wa solid rock jim don t know nobodi in china what s that got to do with it neither did that other fellow but you re alwai awand off on a side issu why can t you stick to the main point all righti don t care where he come out so he come out and jim don t either i reckon but there s on thing anywayjim s too old to be dug out with a caseknif he won t last ye he will last too you don t reckon it s go to take thirtyseven year to dig out through a dirt foundat do you how long will it take tom well we can t resk be as long as we ought to becaus it mayn t take veri long for uncl sila to hear from down there by new orlean he ll hear jim ain t from there then hi next move will be to advertis jim or someth like that so we can t resk be as long dig him out as we ought to by right i reckon we ought to be a coupl of year but we can t thing be so uncertain what i recommend is thi that we realli dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can let on to ourselv that we wa at it thirtyseven year then we can snatch him out and rush him awai the first time there s an alarm ye i reckon that ll be the best wai now there s sens in that i sai let on don t cost noth let on ain t no troubl and if it s ani object i don t mind let on we wa at it a hundr and fifti year it wouldn t strain me none after i got my hand in so i ll mosei along now and smouch a coupl of casekn smouch three he sai we want on to make a saw out of tom if it ain t unregular and irreligi to sejest it i sai there s an old rusti sawblad around yonder stick under the weatherboard behind the smokehous he look kind of weari and discouragedlik and sai it ain t no us to try to learn you noth huck run along and smouch the knivesthre of them so i done it chapter xxxvi as soon as we reckon everybodi wa asleep that night we went down the lightningrod and shut ourselv up in the leanto and got out our pile of foxfir and went to work we clear everyth out of the wai about four or five foot along the middl of the bottom log tom said he wa right behind jim s bed now and we d dig in under it and when we got through there couldn t nobodi in the cabin ever know there wa ani hole there becaus jim s counterpin hung down most to the ground and you d have to rais it up and look under to see the hole so we dug and dug with the casekn till most midnight and then we wa dogtir and our hand wa blister and yet you couldn t see we d done anyth hardli at last i sai thi ain t no thirtyseven year job thi is a thirtyeight year job tom sawyer he never said noth but he sigh and pretti soon he stop dig and then for a good littl while i know that he wa think then he sai it ain t no us huck it ain t ago to work if we wa prison it would becaus then we d have as mani year as we want and no hurri and we wouldn t get but a few minut to dig everi dai while thei wa chang watch and so our hand wouldn t get blister and we could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the wai it ought to be done but we can t fool along we got to rush we ain t got no time to spare if we wa to put in anoth night thi wai we d have to knock off for a week to let our hand get wellcouldn t touch a caseknif with them sooner well then what we go to do tom i ll tell you it ain t right and it ain t moral and i wouldn t like it to get out but there ain t onli just the on wai we got to dig him out with the pick and let on it s casekn now you re talk i sai your head get level and level all the time tom sawyer i sai pick is the thing moral or no moral and as for me i don t care shuck for the moral of it nohow when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sundayschool book i ain t no wai particular how it s done so it s done what i want is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my sundayschool book and if a pick s the handiest thing that s the thing i m ago to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sundayschool book out with and i don t give a dead rat what the author think about it nuther well he sai there s excus for pick and lettingon in a case like thi if it warn t so i wouldn t approv of it nor i wouldn t stand by and see the rule brokebecaus right is right and wrong is wrong and a bodi ain t got no busi do wrong when he ain t ignor and know better it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick without ani let on becaus you don t know no better but it wouldn t for me becaus i do know better gimm a caseknif he had hi own by him but i hand him mine he flung it down and sai gimm a caseknif i didn t know just what to dobut then i thought i scratch around amongst the old tool and got a pickax and give it to him and he took it and went to work and never said a word he wa alwai just that particular full of principl so then i got a shovel and then we pick and shovel turn about and made the fur fly we stuck to it about a half an hour which wa as long as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it when i got up stair i look out at the window and see tom do hi level best with the lightningrod but he couldn t come it hi hand wa so sore at last he sai it ain t no us it can t be done what you reckon i better do can t you think of no wai ye i sai but i reckon it ain t regular come up the stair and let on it s a lightningrod so he done it next dai tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the hous for to make some pen for jim out of and six tallow candl and i hung around the nigger cabin and laid for a chanc and stole three tin plate tom sai it wasn t enough but i said nobodi wouldn t ever see the plate that jim throw out becaus thei d fall in the dogfennel and jimpson weed under the windowholethen we could tote them back and he could us them over again so tom wa satisfi then he sai now the thing to studi out is how to get the thing to jim take them in through the hole i sai when we get it done he onli just look scorn and said someth about nobodi ever heard of such an idiot idea and then he went to studi by and by he said he had cipher out two or three wai but there warn t no need to decid on ani of them yet said we d got to post jim first that night we went down the lightningrod a littl after ten and took on of the candl along and listen under the windowhol and heard jim snore so we pitch it in and it didn t wake him then we whirl in with the pick and shovel and in about two hour and a half the job wa done we crept in under jim s bed and into the cabin and paw around and found the candl and lit it and stood over jim awhil and found him look hearti and healthi and then we woke him up gentl and gradual he wa so glad to see us he most cri and call us honei and all the pet name he could think of and wa for have us hunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of hi leg with right awai and clear out without lose ani time but tom he show him how unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plan and how we could alter them in a minut ani time there wa an alarm and not to be the least afraid becaus we would see he got awai sure so jim he said it wa all right and we set there and talk over old time awhil and then tom ask a lot of question and when jim told him uncl sila come in everi dai or two to prai with him and aunt salli come in to see if he wa comfort and had plenti to eat and both of them wa kind as thei could be tom sai now i know how to fix it we ll send you some thing by them i said don t do noth of the kind it s on of the most jackass idea i ever struck but he never paid no attent to me went right on it wa hi wai when he d got hi plan set so he told jim how we d have to smuggl in the ropeladd pie and other larg thing by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the lookout and not be surpris and not let nat see him open them and we would put small thing in uncl s coatpocket and he must steal them out and we would tie thing to aunt s apronstr or put them in her apronpocket if we got a chanc and told him what thei would be and what thei wa for and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with hi blood and all that he told him everyth jim he couldn t see no sens in the most of it but he allow we wa white folk and know better than him so he wa satisfi and said he

pewter spoon in uncl sila s coatpocket and aunt salli wasn t come yet so we had to wait a littl while and when she come she wa hot and red and cross and couldn t hardli wait for the bless and then she

along run her insurrect all by herself and everybodi els mighti meek and quiet and at last uncl sila look kind of foolish fish up that spoon out of hi pocket she stop with her mouth open and her hand up and as for me i wish i wa in jeruslem or somewher but not long becaus she sai it s just as i expect so you had it in your pocket all the time and like as not you ve got the other thing there too how d it get there i reeli don t know salli he sai kind of apolog or you know i would tell i wa astudi over my text in act seventeen befor breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not notic mean to put my testament in and it must be so becaus my testament ain t in but i ll go and see and if the testament is where i had it i ll know i didn t put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon and oh for the land s sake give a bodi a rest go long now the whole kit and bile of ye and don t come nigh me again till i ve got back my peac of mind i d a heard her if she d a said it to herself let alon speak it out and i d a got up and obei her if i d a been dead as we wa pass through the settingroom the old man he took up hi hat and the shinglenail fell out on the floor and he just mere pick it up and laid it on the mantelshelf and never said noth and went out tom see him do it and rememb about the spoon and sai well it ain t no us to send thing by him no more he ain t reliabl then he sai but he done us a good turn with the spoon anywai without know it and so we ll go and do him on without him know itstop up hi rathol there wa a nobl good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshap then we heard step on the stair and blow out our light and hid and here come the old man with a candl in on hand and a bundl of stuff in t other look as absentmind as year befor last he went a moon around first to on rathol and then anoth till he d been to them all then he stood about five minut pick tallowdrip off of hi candl and think then he turn off slow and dreami toward the stair sai well for the life of me i can t rememb when i done it i could show her now that i warn t to blame on account of the rat but never mindlet it go i reckon it wouldn t do no good and so he went on amumbl up stair and then we left he wa a mighti nice old man and alwai is tom wa a good deal bother about what to do for a spoon but he said we d got to have it so he took a think when he had cipher it out he told me how we wa to do then we went and wait around the spoonbasket till we see aunt salli come and then tom went to count the spoon and lai them out to on side and i slid on of them up my sleev and tom sai why aunt salli there ain t but nine spoon yet she sai go long to your plai and don t bother me i know better i count m myself well i ve count them twice aunti and i can t make but nine she look out of all patienc but of cours she come to countanybodi would i declar to graciou ther ain t but nine she sai why what in the worldplagu take the thing i ll count m again so i slip back the on i had and when she got done count she sai hang the troublesom rubbag ther s ten now and she look huffi and bother both but tom sai why aunti i don t think there s ten you numskul didn t you see me count m i know but well i ll count m again so i smouch on and thei come out nine same as the other time well she wa in a tear wayjust atrembl all over she wa so mad but she count and count till she got that addl she d start to count in the basket for a spoon sometim and so three time thei come out right and three time thei come out wrong then she grab up the basket and slam it across the hous and knock the cat galleywest and she said cle r out and let her have some peac and if we come bother around her again betwixt that and dinner she d skin us so we had the odd spoon and drop it in her apronpocket whilst she wa agiv us our sail order and jim got it all right along with her shingl nail befor noon we wa veri well satisfi with thi busi and tom allow it wa worth twice the troubl it took becaus he said now she couldn t ever count them spoon twice alik again to save her life and wouldn t believ she d count them right if she did and said that after she d about count her head off for the next three dai he judg she d give it up and offer to kill anybodi that want her to ever count them ani more so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole on out of her closet and kept on put it back and steal it again for a coupl of dai till she didn t know how mani sheet she had ani more and she didn t care and warn t ago to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it and wouldn t count them again not to save her life she druther die first so we wa all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candl by the help of the calf and the rat and the mixedup count and as to the candlestick it warn t no consequ it would blow over by and by but that pie wa a job we had no end of troubl with that pie we fix it up awai down in the wood and cook it there and we got it done at last and veri satisfactori too but not all in on dai and we had to us up three washpan full of flour befor we got through and we got burnt pretti much all over in place and ey put out with the smoke becaus you see we didn t want noth but a crust and we couldn t prop it up right and she would alwai cave in but of cours we thought of the right wai at lastwhich wa to cook the ladder too in the pie so then we laid in with jim the second night and tore up the sheet all in littl string and twist them togeth and long befor daylight we had a love rope that you could a hung a person with we let on it took nine month to make it and in the forenoon we took it down to the wood but it wouldn t go into the pie be made of a whole sheet that wai there wa rope enough for forti pi if we d a want them and plenti left over for soup or sausag or anyth you choos we could a had a whole dinner but we didn t need it all we need wa just enough for the pie and so we throw the rest awai we didn t cook none of the pi in the washpanafraid the solder would melt but uncl sila he had a nobl brass warmingpan which he thought consider of becaus it belong to on of hi ancest with a long wooden handl that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflow or on of them earli ship and wa hid awai up garret with a lot of other old pot and thing that wa valuabl not on account of be ani account becaus thei warn t but on account of them be relict you know and we snake her out privat and took her down there but she fail on the first pi becaus we didn t know how but she come up smile on the last on we took and line her with dough and set her in the coal and load her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put hot ember on top and stood off five foot with the long handl cool and comfort and in fifteen minut she turn out a pie that wa a satisfact to look at but the person that et it would want to fetch a coupl of kag of toothpick along for if that rope ladder wouldn t cramp him down to busi i don t know noth what i m talk about and lai him in enough stomachach to last him till next time too nat didn t look when we put the witch pie in jim s pan and we put the three tin plate in the bottom of the pan under the vittl and so jim got everyth all right and as soon as he wa by himself he bust into the pie and hid the rope ladder insid of hi straw tick and scratch some mark on a tin plate and throw it out of the windowhol chapter xxxviii make them pen wa a distressid tough job and so wa the saw and jim allow the inscript wa go to be the toughest of all that s the on which the prison ha to scrabbl on the wall but he had to have it tom said he d got to

reckon i know that tom sai but you bet he ll have on befor he goe out of thisbecaus he s go out right and there ain t go to be no flaw in hi record so whilst me and jim file awai at the pen on a brickbat apiec jim amak hi n out of the brass and i make mine out of the spoon tom set to work to think out the coat of arm by and by he said he d struck so mani good on he didn t hardli know which to

which on for jim to scrabbl on to the wall thei wa all so good but at last he allow he would let him scrabbl them all on jim said it would take him a year to scrabbl such a lot of truck on to the log with a nail and he didn t know how to make letter besid but tom said he would block them out for him and then he wouldn t have noth to do but just follow the line then pretti soon he sai come to think the log ain t ago to do thei don t have log wall in a dungeon we got to dig the inscript into a rock we ll fetch a rock jim said the rock wa wors than the log he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn t ever get out but tom said he would let me help him do it then he took a look to see how me and jim wa get along with the pen it wa most peski tediou hard work and slow and didn t give my hand no show to get well of the sore and we didn t seem to make no headwai hardli so tom sai i know how to fix it we got to have a rock for the coat of arm and mourn

mark out them thing on it with the nail and set jim to work on them with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbag in the leanto for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of hi candl quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindston under hi straw tick and sleep on it then we help him fix hi chain back on the bedleg and wa readi for bed ourselv but tom thought

said jim would have to worri along the best he could with an onion he promis he would go to the nigger cabin and drop on privat in jim s coffeepot in the morn jim said he would ji s soon have toback in hi coffe and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of rais the mullen and jewsharp the rat and pet and flatter up the snake and spider and thing on top of all the other work he had to do on pen and inscript and journal and thing which made it more troubl and worri and respons to be a prison than anyth he ever undertook that tom most lost all patienc with him and said he wa just loaden down with more gaudier chanc than a prison ever had in the world to make a name for himself and yet he didn t know enough to appreci them and thei wa just about wast on him so jim he wa sorri and said he wouldn t behav so no more and then me and tom shove for bed chapter xxxix in the morn we went up to the villag and bought a wire rattrap and fetch it down and unstop the best rathol and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of on and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt salli s bed but while we wa gone for spider littl thoma franklin benjamin jefferson elexand phelp found it there and open the door of it to see if the rat would come out and thei did and aunt salli she come in and when we got back she wa astand on top of the bed rais cain and the rat wa do what thei could to keep off the dull time for her so she took and dust us both with the hickri and we wa as much as two hour catch anoth fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesom cub and thei warn t the likeliest nuther becaus the first haul wa the pick of the flock i never see a likeli lot of rat than what that first haul wa we got a splendid stock of sort spider and bug and frog and caterpillar and on thing or anoth and we like to got a hornet s nest but we didn t the famili wa at home we didn t give it right up but stai with them as long as we could becaus we allow we d tire them out or thei d got to tire us out and thei done it then we got allycumpain and rub on the place and wa pretti near all right again but couldn t set down conveni and so we went for the snake and grab a coupl of dozen garter and housesnak and put them in a bag and put it in our room and by that time it wa suppertim and a rattl good honest dai s work and hungryoh no i reckon not and there warn t a bless snake up there when we went backw didn t half tie the sack and thei work out somehow and left but it didn t matter much becaus thei wa still on the premis somewher so we judg we could get some of them again no there warn t no real scarciti of snake about the hous for a consider spell you d see them drip from the rafter and place everi now and then and thei generli land in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of the time where you didn t want them well thei wa handsom and stripe and there warn t no harm in a million of them but that never made no differ to aunt salli she despis snake be the breed what thei might and she couldn t stand them no wai you could fix it and everi time on of them flop down on her it didn t make no differ what she wa do she would just lai that work down and light out i never see such a woman and you could hear her whoop to jericho you couldn t get her to take aholt of on of them with the tong and if she turn over and found on in bed she would scrambl out and lift a howl that you would think the hous wa afir she disturb the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn t ever been no snake creat why after everi last snake had been gone clear out of the hous for as much as a week aunt salli warn t over it yet she warn t near over it when she wa set think about someth you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stock it wa veri curiou but tom said all women wa just so he said thei wa made that wai for some reason or other we got a lick everi time on of our snake come in her wai and she allow these lick warn t noth to what she would do if we ever load up the place again with them i didn t mind the lick becaus thei didn t amount to noth but i mind the troubl we had to lai in anoth lot but we got them laid in and all the other thing and you never see a cabin as blithesom as jim s wa when thei d all swarm out for music and go for him jim didn t like the spider and the spider didn t like jim and so thei d lai for him and make it mighti warm for him and he said that between the rat and the snake and the grindston there warn t no room in bed for him skase and when there wa a bodi couldn t sleep it wa so live and it wa alwai live he said becaus thei never all slept at on time but took turn about so when the snake wa asleep the rat wa on deck and when the rat turn in the snake come on watch so he alwai had on gang under him in hi wai and t other gang have a circu over him and if he got up to hunt a new place the spider would take a chanc at him as he cross over he said if he ever got out thi time he wouldn t ever be a prison again not for a salari well by the end of three week everyth wa in pretti good shape the shirt wa sent in earli in a pie and everi time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a littl in hi journal whilst the ink wa fresh the pen wa made the inscript and so on wa all carv on the grindston the bedleg wa saw in two and we had et up the sawdust and it give us a most amaz stomachach we reckon we wa all go to die but didn t it wa the most undigest sawdust i ever see and tom said the same but as i wa sai we d got all the work done now at last and we wa all pretti much fag out too but mainli jim the old man had wrote a coupl of time to the plantat below orlean to come and get their runawai nigger but hadn t got no answer becaus there warn t no such plantat so he allow he would advertis jim in the st loui and new orlean paper and when he mention the st loui on it give me the cold shiver and i see we hadn t no time to lose so tom said now for the nonnam letter what s them i sai warn to the peopl that someth is up sometim it s done on wai sometim anoth but there s alwai somebodi spy around that give notic to the governor of the castl when loui xvi wa go to light out of the tooleri a servantgirl done it it s a veri good wai and so is the nonnam letter we ll us them both and it s usual for the prison s mother to chang cloth with him and she stai in and he slide out in her cloth we ll do that too but looki here tom what do we want to warn anybodi for that someth s up let them find it out for themselvesit s their lookout ye i know but you can t depend on them it s the wai thei ve act from the veri startleft us to do everyth thei re so confid and mullethead thei don t take notic of noth at all so if we don t give them notic there won t be nobodi nor noth to interfer with us and so after all our hard work and troubl thi escap ll go off perfectli flat won t amount to nothingwon t be noth to it well as for me tom that s the wai i d like shuck he sai and look disgust so i sai but i ain t go to make no complaint ani wai that suit you suit me what you go to do about the servantgirl you ll be her you slide in in the middl of the night and hook that yaller girl s frock why tom that ll make troubl next morn becaus of cours she prob bly hain t got ani but that on i know but you don t want it but fifteen minut to carri the nonnam letter and shove it under the front door all right then i ll do it but i could carri it just as handi in my own tog you wouldn t look like a servantgirl then would you no but there won t be nobodi to see what i look like anywai that ain t got noth to do with it the thing for us to do is just to do our duti and not worri about whether anybodi see us do it or not hain t you got no principl at all all right i ain t sai noth i m the servantgirl who s jim s mother i m hi mother i ll hook a gown from aunt salli well then you ll have to stai in the cabin when me

when a prison of style escap it s call an evas it s alwai call so when a king escap f rinstanc and the same with a king s son it don t make no differ whether he s a natur on or an unnatur on so tom he

unknown friend next night we stuck a pictur which tom draw in blood of a skull and crossbon on the front door and next night anoth on of a coffin on the back door i never see a famili in such a sweat

listen for the step to get further and when he nudg us jim must glide out first and him last so he set hi ear to the crack and listen and listen and listen and the step ascrap around out there all the time and at last he nudg us and we slid out and stoop down not breath and not make the least nois and slip stealthi toward the fenc in injun file and got to it all right and me and jim over it but tom s britch catch fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the step come so he had to pull loos which snap the splinter and made a nois and as he drop in our track and start somebodi sing out who s that answer or i ll shoot but we didn t answer we just unfurl our heel and shove then there wa a rush and a bang bang bang and the bullet fairli whizz around us we heard them sing out here thei ar thei ve broke for the river after em boi and turn loos the dog so here thei come full tilt we could hear them becaus thei wore boot and yell but we didn t wear no boot and didn t yell we wa in the path to the mill and when thei got pretti close on to us we dodg into the bush and let them go by and then drop in behind them thei d had all the dog shut up so thei wouldn t scare off the robber but by thi time somebodi had let them loos and here thei come make powwow enough for a million but thei wa our dog so we stop in our track till thei catch up and when thei see it warn t nobodi but us and no excit to offer them thei onli just said howdi and tore right ahead toward the shout and clatter and then we upsteam again and whizz along after them till we wa nearli to the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my cano wa ti and hop in and pull for dear life toward the middl of the river but didn t make no more nois than we wa obleeg to then we struck out easi and comfort for the island where my raft wa and we could hear them yell and bark at each other all up and down the bank till we wa so far awai the sound got dim and di out and when we step on to the raft i sai now old jim you re a free man again and i bet you won t ever be a slave no more en a mighti good job it wuz too huck it uz plan beauti en it uz done beauti en dei ain t nobodi kin git up a plan dat s mo mixedup en splendid den what dat on wuz we wa all glad as we could be but tom wa the gladdest of all becaus he had a bullet in the calf of hi leg when me and jim heard that we didn t feel so brash as what we did befor it wa hurt him consider and bleed so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up on of the duke s shirt for to bandag him but he sai gimm the rag i can do it myself don t stop now don t

ascend to heaven wrote down in hi biographi no sir we d a whoop him over the borderthat s what we d a done with himand done it just as slick as noth at all too man the sweepsman the sweep but me and

jim stuck to it and wouldn t budg so he wa for crawl out and set the raft loos himself but we wouldn t let him then he give us a piec of hi mind but it didn t do no good so when he see me get the cano readi he sai well then if you re bound to go i ll tell you the wai to do when you get to the villag shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purs full of gold in hi hand and then take and lead him all around the back allei and everywher in the dark and then fetch him here in the cano in a roundabout wai amongst the island and search him and take hi chalk awai from him and don t give it back to him till you get him back to the villag or els he will chalk thi raft so he can find it again it s the wai thei all do so i said i would and left and jim wa to hide in the wood when he see the doctor come till he wa gone again chapter xli the doctor wa an old man a veri nice kindlook old man when i got him up i told him me and my brother wa over on spanish island hunt yesterdai afternoon and camp on a piec of a raft we found and about midnight he must a kick hi gun in hi dream for it went off and shot him in the leg and we want him to go over there and fix it and not sai noth about it nor let anybodi know becaus we want to come home thi even and surpris the folk who is your folk he sai the phelps down yonder oh he sai and after a minut he sai how d you sai he got shot he had a dream i sai and it shot him singular dream he sai so he lit up hi lantern and got hi saddlebag and we start but when he see the cano he didn

gun that s what i mean oh he sai but he put hi foot on the gunnel and rock her and shook hi head and said he reckon he d look around for a bigger on but thei wa all lock and chain so he took my cano and said for me to wait till he come back or i could hunt around further or mayb i better go down home and get them readi for the surpris if i want to but i said i didn t so i told him just how to find the raft and then he start i struck an idea pretti soon i sai to myself spo n he can t fix that leg just in three shake of a sheep s tail as the sai is spo n it take him three or four dai what ar

take and tie him and keep him and shove out down the river and when tom s done with him we ll give him what it s worth or all we got and then let him get ashor so then i crept into a lumberpil to get some sleep and next time i wake up the sun wa awai up over my head i shot out and went for the doctor s hous but thei told me he d gone awai in the night some time or other and warn t back yet well think i that look power bad for tom and i ll dig out for the island right off so awai i shove and turn the corner and nearli ram my head into uncl sila s stomach he sai why tom where you been all thi

afraid thei d steal some o the famili i wa just to that pass i didn t have no reason faculti no more it look foolish enough now in the daytim but i sai to myself there s my two poor boi asleep wai up stair in that lonesom room and i declar to good i wa that uneasi t i crep up there and lock em in i did and anybodi would becaus you know when you get scare that wai and it keep run on and get wors and wors all the time and your wit get to addl and you get to do all sort o wild thing and by and by you think to yourself spo n i wa a boi and wa awai up there and the door ain t lock and you she stop look kind of wonder and then she turn her head around slow and when her ey lit on mei got up and took a walk sai i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room thi morn if i go out to on side and studi over it a littl so i done it but i dasn t go fur or she d a sent for me and when it wa late in the dai the peopl all went and then i come in and told her the nois and shoot wake up me and sid and the door wa lock and we want to see the fun so we went down the lightningrod and both of us got hurt a littl and we didn t never want to try that no more and then i went on and told her all what i told uncl sila befor and then she said she d forgiv us and mayb it wa all right enough anywai and about what a bodi might expect of boi for all boi wa a pretti harumscarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm hadn t come of it she judg she better put in her time be grate we wa aliv and well and she had us still stead of fret over what wa past and done so then she kiss me and pat me on the head and drop into a kind of a brown studi and pretti soon jump up and sai why lawsamerci it s most night and sid not come yet what ha becom of that boi i see my chanc so i skip up and sai i ll run right up to town and get him i sai no you won t she sai you ll stai right wher you ar on s enough to be lost at a time if he ain t here to supper your uncl ll go well he warn t there to supper so right after supper uncl went he come back about ten a littl bit uneasi hadn t run across tom s track aunt salli wa a good deal uneasi but uncl sila he said there warn t no occas to beboi will be boi he said and you ll see thi on turn up in the morn all sound and right so she had to be satisfi but she said she d set up for him a while anywai and keep a light burn so he could see it and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetch her candl and tuck me in and mother me so good i felt mean and like i couldn t look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talk with me a long time and said what a splendid boi sid wa and didn t seem to want to ever stop talk about him and kept ask me everi now and then if i reckon he could a got lost or hurt or mayb drownd and might be lai at thi minut somewher suffer or dead and she not by him to help him and so the tear would drip down silent and i would tell her that sid wa all right and would be home in the morn sure and she would squeez my hand or mayb kiss me and tell me to sai it again and keep on sai it becaus it done her good and she wa in so much troubl and when she wa go awai she look down in my ey so steadi and gentl and sai the door ain t go to be lock tom and there s the window and the rod but you ll be good won t you and you won t go for my sake law know i want to go bad enough to see about tom and wa all intend to go but after that i wouldn t a went not for kingdom but she wa on my mind and tom wa on my mind so i slept veri restless and twice i went down the rod awai in the night and slip around front and see her set there by her candl in the window with her ey toward the road and the tear in them and i wish i could do someth for her but i couldn t onli to swear that i wouldn t never do noth to griev her ani more and the third time i wake up at dawn and slid down and she wa there yet and her candl wa most out and her old grai head wa rest on her hand and she wa asleep chapter xlii the old man wa uptown again befor breakfast but couldn t get no track of tom and both of them set at the tabl think and not sai noth and look mourn and their coffe get cold and not eat anyth and by and by the old man sai did i give you the letter what letter the on i got yesterdai out of the postoffic no you didn t give me no letter well i must a forgot it so he rummag hi pocket and then went off somewher where he had laid it down and fetch it and give it to her she sai why it s from st petersburgit s from si i allow anoth walk would do me good but i couldn t stir but befor she could break it open she drop it and runfor she see someth and so did i it wa tom sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and jim in her calico dress with hi hand ti behind him and a lot of peopl i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handi and rush she flung herself at tom cry and sai oh he s dead he s dead i know he s dead and tom he turn hi head a littl and mutter someth or other which show he warn t in hi right mind then she flung up her hand and sai he s aliv thank god and that s enough and she snatch a kiss of him and flew for the hous to get the bed readi and scatter order right and left at the nigger and everybodi els as fast as her tongu could go everi jump of the wai i follow the men to see what thei wa go to do with jim and the old doctor and uncl sila follow after tom into the hous the men wa veri huffi and some of them want to hang jim for an exampl to all the other nigger around there so thei wouldn t be try to run awai like jim done and make such a raft of troubl and keep a whole famili scare most to death for dai and night but the other said don t do it it wouldn t answer at all he ain t our nigger and hi owner would turn up and make us pai for him sure so that cool them down a littl becaus the peopl that s alwai the most anxiou for to hang a nigger that hain t done just right is alwai the veri on that ain t the most anxiou to pai for him when thei ve got their satisfact out of him thei cuss jim considerbl though and give him a cuff or two side the head onc in a while but jim never said noth and he never let on to know me and thei took him to the same cabin and put hi own cloth on him and chain him again and not to no bedleg thi time but to a big stapl drove into the bottom log and chain hi hand too and both leg and said he warn t to have noth but bread and water to eat after thi till hi owner come or he wa sold at auction becaus he didn t come in a certain length of time and fill up our hole and said a coupl of farmer with gun must stand watch around about the cabin everi night and a bulldog ti to the door in the daytim and about thi time thei wa through with the job and wa taper off with a kind of generl goodby cuss and then the old doctor come and take a look and sai don t be no rougher on him than you re obleeg to becaus he ain t a bad nigger when i got to where i found the boi i see i couldn t cut the bullet out without some help and he warn t in no condit for me to leav to go and get help and he got a littl wors and a littl wors and after a long time he went out of hi head and wouldn t let me come anigh him ani more and said if i chalk hi raft he d kill me and no end of wild foolish like that and i see i couldn t do anyth at all with him so i sai i got to have help somehow and the minut i sai it out crawl thi nigger from somewher and sai he ll help and he done it too and done it veri well of cours i judg he must be a runawai nigger and there i wa and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the dai and all night it wa a fix i tell you i had a coupl of patient with the chill and of cours i d of like to run up to town and see them but i dasn t becaus the nigger might get awai and then i d be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail so there i had to stick plumb until daylight thi morn and i never see a nigger that wa a better nuss or faithful and yet he wa risk hi freedom to do it and wa all tire out too and i see plain enough he d been work main hard late i like the nigger for that i tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollarsand kind treatment too i had everyth i need and the boi wa do as well there as he would a done at homebett mayb becaus it wa so quiet but there i wa with both of m on my hand and there i had to stick till about dawn thi morn then some men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger wa set by the pallet with hi head prop on hi knee sound asleep so i motion them in quiet and thei slip up on him and grab him and ti him befor he know what he wa about and we never had no troubl and the boi be in a kind of a flighti sleep too we muffl the oar and hitch the raft on and tow her over veri nice and quiet and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start he ain t no bad nigger gentlemen that s what i think about him somebodi sai well it sound veri good doctor i m obleeg to sai then the other soften up a littl too and i wa mighti thank to that old doctor for do jim that good turn and i wa glad it wa accord to my judgment of him too becaus i thought he had a good heart in him and wa a good man the first time i see him then thei all agre that jim had act veri well and wa deserv to have some notic took of it and reward so everi on of them promis right out and hearti that thei wouldn t cuss him no more then thei come out and lock him up i hope thei wa go to sai he could have on or two of the chain took off becaus thei wa rotten heavi or could have meat and green with hi bread and water but thei didn t think of it and i reckon it warn t best for me to mix in but i judg i d get the doctor s yarn to aunt salli somehow or other as soon as i d got through the breaker that wa lai just ahead of meexplan i mean of how i forgot to mention about sid be shot when i wa tell how him and me put in that drat night paddl around hunt the runawai nigger but i had plenti time aunt salli she stuck to the sickroom all dai and all night and everi time i see uncl sila moon around i dodg him next morn i heard tom wa a good deal better and thei said aunt salli wa gone to get a nap so i slip to the sickroom and if i found him awak i reckon we could put up a yarn for the famili that would wash but he wa sleep and sleep veri peac too and pale not firefac the wai he wa when he come so i set down and laid for him to wake in about half an hour aunt salli come glide in and there i wa up a stump again she motion me to be still and set down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joy now becaus all the symptom wa firstrat and he d been sleep like that for ever so long and look better and peaceful all the time and ten to on he d wake up in hi right mind so we set there watch and by and by he stir a bit and open hi ey veri natur and take a look and sai hellowhi i m at home how s that where s the raft it s all right i sai and jim the same i sai but couldn t sai it pretti brash but he never notic but sai good splendid now we re all right and safe did you tell aunti i wa go to sai ye but she chip in and sai about what sid why about the wai

steal candl and the sheet and the shirt and your dress and spoon and tin plate and casekn and the warmingpan and the grindston and flour and just no end of thing and you can t think what work it wa to make the saw and pen and inscript and on thing or anoth and you can t think half the fun it wa and we had to make up the pictur of coffin and thing and nonnam letter from the robber and get up and down the lightningrod and dig the hole into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cook up in a pie and send in spoon and thing to work with in your apron pocket merci sake and load up the cabin with rat and snake and so on for compani for jim and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in hi hat that you come near spile the whole busi becaus the men come befor we wa out of the cabin and we had to rush and thei heard us and let drive at us and i got my share and we dodg out of the path and let them go by and when the dog come thei warn t interest in us but went for the most nois and we got our cano and made for the raft and wa all safe and jim wa a free man and we done it all by ourselv and wasn t it bulli aunti well i never heard the like of it in all my born dai so it wa you you littl rapscallion that s been make all thi troubl and turn everybodi s wit clean insid out and scare us all most to death i ve as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o you thi veri minut to think here i ve been night after night ayou just get well onc you young scamp and i lai i ll tan the old harri out o both o ye but tom he wa so proud and joy he just couldn t hold in and hi tongu just went itsh achip in and spit fire all along and both of them go it at onc like a cat convent and she sai well you get all the enjoy you can out of it now for mind i tell you if i

him loos he ain t no slave he s as free as ani cretur that walk thi earth what doe the child mean i mean everi word i sai aunt salli and if somebodi don t go i ll go i ve know him all hi life and so ha tom there old miss watson di two month ago and she wa asham she ever wa go to sell him down the river and said so and she set him free in her will then what on earth did you want to set him free for see he wa alreadi free well that is a question i must sai and just like women why i want the adventur of it and i d a wade neckdeep in blood togood aliv aunt polli if she warn t stand right there just insid the door look as sweet and content as an angel half full of pie i wish i mai never aunt salli jump for her and most hug the head off of her and cri over her and i found a good enough place for me under the bed for it wa get pretti sultri for us seem to me and i peep out and in a littl while tom s aunt polli shook herself loos and stood there look across at tom over her spectacleskind of grind him into the earth you know and then she sai ye you better turn y r head awayi would if i wa you tom oh deari me sai aunt salli is he chang so why that ain t tom it s sid tom stom swhy where is tom he wa here a minut ago you mean where s huck finnthat s what you mean i reckon i hain t rais such a scamp as my tom all these year not to know him when i see him that would be a pretti howdydo come out from under that bed huck finn so i done it but not feel brash aunt salli she wa on of the mixedupestlook person i ever seeexcept on and that wa uncl sila when he come in and thei told it all to him it kind of made him drunk as you mai sai and he didn t know noth at all the rest of the dai and preach a prayermeet sermon that night that gave him a rattl ruput becaus the oldest man in the world couldn t a understood it so tom s aunt polli she told all about who i wa and what and i had to up and tell how i wa in such a tight place that when mr phelp took me for tom sawyersh chip in and sai oh go on and call me aunt salli i m us to it now and tain t no need to chang that when aunt salli took me for tom sawyer i had to stand itther warn t no other wai and i know he wouldn t mind becaus it would be nut for him be a mysteri and he d make an adventur out of it and be perfectli satisfi and so it turn out and he let on to be sid and made thing as soft as he could for me and hi aunt polli she said tom wa right about old miss watson set jim free in her will and so sure enough tom sawyer had gone and took all that troubl and bother to set a free nigger free and i couldn t ever understand befor until that minut and that talk how he could help a bodi set a nigger free with hi bringingup well aunt polli she said that when aunt salli wrote to her that tom and sid had come all right and safe she sai to herself look at that now i might have expect it let him go off that wai without anybodi to watch him so now i got to go and traps all the wai down the river eleven hundr mile and find out what that creetur s up to thi time as long as i couldn t seem to get ani answer out of you about it why i never heard noth from you sai aunt salli well i wonder why i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid be here well i never got em si aunt polli she turn around slow and sever and sai you tom wellwhat he sai kind of pettish don t you what me you impud thinghand out them letter what letter them letter i be bound if i have to take aholt of you i ll thei re in the trunk there now and thei re just the same as thei wa when i got them out of the offic i hain t look into them i hain t touch them but i know thei d make troubl and i thought if you warn t in no hurri i d well you do need skin there ain t no mistak about it and i wrote anoth on to tell you i wa come and i s pose he no it come yesterdai i hain t read it yet but it s all right i ve got that on i want to offer to bet two dollar she hadn t but i reckon mayb it wa just as safe to not to so i never said noth chapter the last the first time i catch tom privat i ask him what wa hi idea time of the evasionwhat it wa he d plan to do if the evas work all right and he manag to set a nigger free that wa alreadi free befor and he said what he had plan in hi head from the start if we got jim out all safe wa for us to run him down the river on the raft and have adventur plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about hi be free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and pai him for hi lost time and write word ahead and get out all the nigger around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight process and a brassband and then he would be a hero and so would we but i reckon it wa about as well the wai it wa we had jim out of the chain in no time and when aunt polli and uncl sila and aunt salli found out how good he help the doctor nurs tom thei made a heap of fuss over him and fix him up prime and give him all he want to eat and a good time and noth to do and we had him up to the sickroom and had a high talk and tom give jim forti dollar for be prison for us so patient and do it up so good and jim wa pleas most to death and bust out and sai dah now huck what i tell youwhat i tell you up dah on jackson islan i tole you i got a hairi brea en what s de sign un it en i tole you i ben rich wunst en gwinet to be rich agin en it s come true en heah she

slide out of here on of these night and get an outfit and go for howl adventur amongst the injun over in the territori for a coupl of week or two and i sai all right that suit me but i ain t got no monei for to bui the outfit and i reckon i couldn t get none from home becaus it s like pap s been back befor now and got it all awai from judg thatcher and drunk it up no he hain t tom sai it s all
