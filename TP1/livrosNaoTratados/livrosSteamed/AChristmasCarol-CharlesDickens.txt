thei were a gloomi suit of room in a lower pile of build up a yard where it had so littl busi to be that on could scarc help fanci it must have run there when it wa a young hous plai at hideandseek with other hous and have forgotten the wai out again it wa old enough now and dreari enough for nobodi live in it but scroog the other room be all let out as offic the yard wa so dark that even scroog who knew it everi stone wa fain to grope with hi hand the fog and frost so hung about the black old gatewai of the hous that it seem as if the geniu of the weather sat in mourn medit on the threshold now it is a fact that there wa noth at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it wa veri larg it is also a fact that scroog had seen it night and morn dure hi whole resid in that place also that scroog had as littl of what is call fanci about him as ani man in the citi of london even includingwhich is a bold wordth corpor aldermen and liveri let it also be born in mind that scroog had not bestow on thought on marlei sinc hi last mention of hi sevenyearsdead partner that afternoon and then let ani man explain to me if he can how it happen that scroog have hi kei in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without it undergo ani intermedi process of changenot a knocker but marlei face marlei face it wa not in impenetr shadow as the other object in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar it wa not angri or feroci but look at scroog as marlei us to look with ghostli spectacl turn up on it ghostli forehead the hair wa curious stir as if by breath of hot air and though the ey were wide open thei were perfectli motionless that and it livid colour made it horribl but it horror seem to be in spite of the face and beyond it control rather than a part of it own express as scroog look fixedli at thi phenomenon it wa a knocker again to sai that he wa not startl or that hi blood wa not consciou of a terribl sensat to which it had been a stranger from infanc would be untru but he put hi hand upon the kei he had relinquish turn it sturdili walk in and light hi candl he did paus with a moment irresolut befor he shut the door and he did look cautious behind it first as if he half expect to be terrifi with the sight of marlei pigtail stick out into the hall but there wa noth on the back of the door except the screw and nut that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and close it with a bang the sound resound through the hous like thunder everi room abov and everi cask in the wine merchant cellar below appear to have a separ peal of echo of it own scroog wa not a man to be frighten by echo he fasten the door and walk across the hall and up the stair slowli too trim hi candl as he went you mai talk vagu about drive a coach and six up a good old flight of stair or through a bad young act of parliament but i mean to sai you might have got a hears up that staircas and taken it broadwis with the splinterbar toward the wall and the door toward the balustrad and done it easi there wa plenti of width for that and room to spare which is perhap the reason why scroog thought he saw a locomot hears go on befor him in the gloom halfadozen gaslamp out of the street wouldnt have light the entri too well so you mai suppos that it wa pretti dark with scroog dip up scroog went not care a button for that dark is cheap and scroog like it but befor he shut hi heavi door he walk through hi room to see that all wa right he had just enough recollect of the face to desir to do that sittingroom bedroom lumberroom all as thei should be nobodi under the tabl nobodi under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin readi and the littl saucepan of gruel scroog had a cold in hi head upon the hob nobodi under the bed nobodi in the closet nobodi in hi dressinggown which wa hang up in a suspici attitud against the wall lumberroom as usual old fireguard old shoe two fish basket washingstand on three leg and a poker quit satisfi he close hi door and lock himself in doubl lock himself in which wa not hi custom thu secur against surpris he took off hi cravat put on hi dressinggown and slipper and hi nightcap and sat down befor the fire to take hi gruel it wa a veri low fire inde noth on such a bitter night he wa oblig to sit close to it and brood over it befor he could extract the least sensat of warmth from such a hand of fuel the fireplac wa an old on built by some dutch merchant long ago and pave all round with quaint dutch tile design to illustr the scriptur there were cain and abel pharaoh daughter queen of sheba angel messeng descend through the air on cloud like feather bed abraham belshazzar apostl put off to sea in butterboat hundr of figur to attract hi thought and yet that face of marlei seven year dead came like the ancient prophet rod and swallow up the whole if each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape some pictur on it surfac from the disjoint fragment of hi thought there would have been a copi of old marlei head on everi on humbug said scroog and walk across the room after sever turn he sat down again as he threw hi head back in the chair hi glanc happen to rest upon a bell a disus bell that hung in the room and commun for some purpos now forgotten with a chamber in the highest stori of the build it wa with great astonish and with a strang inexplic dread that as he look he saw thi bell begin to swing it swung so softli in the outset that it scarc made a sound but soon it rang out loudli and so did everi bell in the hous thi might have last half a minut or a minut but it seem an hour the bell ceas as thei had begun togeth thei were succeed by a clank nois deep down below as if some person were drag a heavi chain over the cask in the wine merchant cellar scroog then rememb to have heard that ghost in haunt hous were describ as drag chain the cellar door flew open with a boom sound and then he heard the nois much louder on the floor below then come up the stair then come straight toward hi door it humbug still said scroog i wont believ it hi colour chang though when without a paus it came on through the heavi door and pass into the room befor hi ey upon it come in the dy flame leap up as though it cri i know him marlei ghost and fell again the same face the veri same marlei in hi pigtail usual waistcoat tight and boot the tassel on the latter bristl like hi pigtail and hi coatskirt and the hair upon hi head the chain he drew wa clasp about hi middl it wa long and wound about him like a tail and it wa made for scroog observ it close of cashbox kei padlock ledger deed and heavi purs wrought in steel hi bodi wa transpar so that scroog observ him and look through hi waistcoat could see the two button on hi coat behind scroog had often heard it said that marlei had no bowel but he had never believ it until now no nor did he believ it even now though he look the phantom through and through and saw it stand befor him though he felt the chill influenc of it deathcold ey and mark the veri textur of the fold kerchief bound about it head and chin which wrapper he had not observ befor he wa still incredul and fought against hi sens how now said scroog caustic and cold as ever what do you want with me muchmarlei voic no doubt about it who ar you ask me who i wa who were you then said scroog rais hi voic your particular for a shade he wa go to sai to a shade but substitut thi as more appropri in life i wa your partner jacob marlei can youcan you sit down ask scroog look doubtfulli at him i can do it then scroog ask the question becaus he didnt know whether a ghost so transpar might find himself in a condit to take a chair and felt that in the event of it be imposs it might involv the necess of an embarrass explan but the ghost sat down on the opposit side of the fireplac as if he were quit us to it you dont believ in me observ the ghost i dont said scroog what evid would you have of my realiti beyond that of your own sens i dont know said scroog why do you doubt your sens becaus said scroog a littl thing affect them a slight disord of the stomach make them cheat you mai be an undigest bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of chees a fragment of an underdon potato there more of gravi than of grave about you whatev you ar scroog wa not much in the habit of crack joke nor did

affront to your understand and would instantli have sidl off in the direct of the plump sister she often cri out that it wasnt fair and it realli wa not but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustl and her rapid flutter past him he got her into a corner whenc there wa no escap then hi conduct wa the most execr for hi pretend not to know her hi pretend that it wa necessari to
