deepen to dark and the confus to rise to clamour jump over form and creep under tabl i made my wai to on of the fireplac there kneel by the high wire fender i found burn absorb silent abstract from all round her by the companionship of a book which she read by the dim glare of the ember is it still rassela i ask come behind her ye she said and i have just finish it and in five minut more she shut it up i wa glad of thi now thought i i can perhap get her to talk i sat down by her on the floor what is your name besid burn helen do you come a long wai from here i come from a place farther north quit on the border of scotland will you ever go back i hope so but nobodi can be sure of the futur you must wish to leav lowood no why should i i wa sent to lowood to get an educ and it would be of no us go awai until i have attain that object but that teacher miss scatcherd is so cruel to you cruel not at all she is sever she dislik my fault and if i were in your place i should dislik her i should resist her if she struck me with that rod i should get it from her hand i should break it under her nose probabl you would do noth of the sort but if you did mr brocklehurst would expel you from the school that would be a great grief to your relat it is far better to endur patient a smart which nobodi feel but yourself than to commit a hasti action whose evil consequ will extend to all connect with you and besid the bibl bid us return good for evil but then it seem disgrac to be flog and to be sent to stand in the middl of a room full of peopl and you ar such a great girl i am far younger than you and i could not bear it yet it would be your duti to bear it if you could not avoid it it is weak and silli to sai you cannot bear what it is your fate to be requir to bear i heard her with wonder i could not comprehend thi doctrin of endur and still less could i understand or sympathis with the forbear she express for her chastis still i felt that helen burn consid thing by a light invis to my ey i suspect she might be right and i wrong but i would not ponder the matter deepli like felix i put it off to a more conveni season you sai you have fault helen what ar thei to me you seem veri good then learn from me not to judg by appear i am as miss scatcherd said slatternli i seldom put and never keep thing in order i am careless i forget rule i read when i should learn my

i ad but helen burn would not admit my addit she kept silenc is miss templ as sever to you as miss scatcherd at the utter of miss templ name a soft smile flit over her grave face miss templ is full of good it pain her to be sever to ani on even the worst in the school she see my error and tell me of them gentli and if i do anyth worthi of prais she give me my meed liber on strong proof of my wretchedli defect natur is that even her expostul so mild so ration have not influenc to cure me of my fault and even her prais though i valu it most highli cannot stimul me to continu care and

have to be awaken and have heard noth of what wa read for listen to the visionari brook i have no answer readi yet how well you repli thi afternoon it wa mere chanc the subject on which we had been read had interest me thi afternoon instead of dream of deepden i wa wonder how a man who wish to do right could act so unjustli and unwis as charl the first sometim did and i thought what a piti it wa that with hi integr and conscienti he could see no farther than the prerog of the crown if he had but been abl to look to a distanc and see how what thei call the spirit of the ag wa tend still i like charlesi respect himi piti him poor murder king ye hi enemi were the worst thei shed blood thei had no right to shed how dare thei kill him helen wa talk to herself now she had forgotten i could not veri well understand herthat i wa ignor or nearli so of the subject she discuss i recal her to my level and when miss templ teach you do your thought wander then no certainli not often becaus miss templ ha gener someth to sai which is newer than my own reflect her languag is singularli agreeabl to me and the inform she commun is often just what i wish to gain well then with miss templ you ar

yet you ar but a littl untaught girl but i feel thi helen i must dislik those who whatev i do to pleas them persist in dislik me i must resist those who punish me unjustli it is as natur as that i should love those who show me affect or submit to punish when i feel it is deserv heathen and savag tribe hold that doctrin but christian and civilis nation disown it how i dont understand it is not

it would be injudici to confin her too much at first so when i had talk to her a great deal and got her to learn a littl and when the morn had advanc to noon i allow her to return to her nurs i then propos to occupi myself till dinnertim in draw some littl sketch for her us as i wa go upstair to fetch my portfolio and pencil mr fairfax call to me your morn schoolhour ar over now i suppos said she she wa in a room the foldingdoor of which stood open i went in when she address me it wa a larg state apart with purpl chair and curtain a turkei carpet walnutpanel wall on vast window rich in slant

larg mirror repeat the gener blend of snow and fire in what order you keep these room mr fairfax said i no dust no canva cover except that the air feel chilli on would think thei were inhabit daili why miss eyr though mr rochest visit here ar rare thei ar alwai sudden and unexpect and as i observ that it put him out to find everyth swath up and to have a bustl of arrang on hi arriv i thought it best to keep the room in readi is mr rochest an exact fastidi sort of man not particularli so but he ha a gentleman tast and habit and he expect to have thing manag in conform to them do you like him is he gener like oh ye the famili have alwai been respect here almost all the land in thi neighbourhood as far as you can see ha belong to the rochest time out of mind well but leav hi land out of the question do you like him is he like for himself i have no caus to do otherwis than like him and i believ he is consid a just and liber landlord by hi tenant but he ha never live much amongst them but ha he no peculiar what in short is hi charact oh hi charact is unimpeach i suppos he is rather peculiar perhap he ha travel a great deal and seen a great deal of the world i should think i dare sai he is clever but i never had much convers with him in what wai is he peculiar i dont knowit is not easi to describenoth strike but you feel it when he speak to you you cannot be alwai sure whether he is in jest or earnest whether he is pleas or the contrari you dont thoroughli understand him in shortat least i dont but it is of no consequ he is a veri good master thi wa all the account i got from mr fairfax of her employ and mine there ar peopl who seem to have no notion of sketch a charact or observ and describ salient point either in person or thing the good ladi evid belong to thi class my

just what we hope and thought and you will marri him jane wont you and then he will stai in england far from that diana hi sole idea in propos to me is to procur a fit fellowlabour in hi indian toil what he wish you to go to india ye mad she exclaim you would not live three month there i am certain you never shall go you have not consent have you jane i have refus to marri him and have consequ displeas him she suggest deepli he will never forgiv me i fear yet i offer to accompani him as hi sister it wa frantic folli to do so jane think of the task you undertookon of incess fatigu where fatigu kill even the strong and you ar weak st johnyou know himwould urg you to imposs with him there would be no permiss to rest dure the hot hour and unfortun i have notic whatev he exact you forc

just now i repeat the offer of serv him for a deacon he express himself shock at my want of decenc he seem to think i had commit an improprieti in propos to accompani him unmarri as if i had not from the first hope to find in him a brother and habitu regard him as such what make you sai he doe not love you jane you should hear himself on the subject he ha again and again explain that it is not

ani of the furnitur could be save the fire broke out at dead of night and befor the engin arriv from millcot the build wa on mass of flame it wa a terribl spectacl i wit it myself at dead of night i mutter ye that wa ever the hour of fatal at thornfield wa it known how it origin i demand thei guess maam thei guess inde i should sai it wa ascertain beyond a doubt you ar not perhap awar he continu edg hi chair a littl nearer the tabl and speak low that there wa a ladyaa lunat kept in the hous i have heard someth of it she wa kept in veri close confin maam peopl even for some year wa not absolut certain of her exist no on saw her thei onli knew by rumour that such a person wa at the hall and who or what she wa it wa difficult to conjectur thei said mr edward had brought her from abroad and some believ she had been hi mistress but a queer thing happen a year sincea veri queer thing i fear now to hear my own stori i endeavour to recal him to the main fact and thi ladi thi ladi maam he answer turn out to be mr rochest wife the discoveri wa brought about in the strangest wai there wa a young ladi a gover at the hall that mr rochest fell in but the fire i suggest im come to that maamthat mr edward fell in love with the servant sai thei never saw anybodi so much in love as he wa he wa after her continu thei us to watch himserv will you know maamand he set store on her past everyth for all nobodi but him thought her so veri handsom she wa a littl small thing thei sai almost like a child i never saw her myself but iv heard leah the housemaid tell of her leah like her well enough mr rochest wa about forti and thi gover not twenti and you see when gentlemen of hi ag fall in love with girl thei ar often like as if thei were bewitch well he would marri her you shall tell me thi part of the stori anoth time i said but now i have a particular reason for wish to hear all about the fire wa it suspect that thi lunat mr rochest had ani hand in it youv hit it maam it quit certain that it wa her and nobodi but her that set it go she had a woman to take care of her call mr poolean abl woman in her line and veri trustworthi but for on faulta fault common to a deal of them nurs and matronssh kept a privat bottl of gin by her and now and then took a drop overmuch it is excus for she had a hard life of it but still it wa danger for when mr pool wa fast asleep after the gin and water the mad ladi who wa as cun as a witch would take the kei out of her pocket let herself out of her chamber and go roam about the hous do ani wild mischief that came into her head thei sai she had nearli burnt her husband in hi bed onc but i dont know about that howev on thi night she set fire first to the hang of the room next her own and then she got down to a lower storei and made her wai to the chamber that had been the governessssh wa like as if she knew somehow how matter had gone on and had a spite at herand she kindl the bed there but there wa nobodi sleep in it fortun the gover had run awai two month befor and for all mr rochest sought her as if she had been the most preciou thing he had in the world he never could hear a word of her and he grew savagequit savag on hi disappoint he never wa a wild man but he got danger after he lost her he would be alon too he sent mr fairfax the housekeep awai to her friend at a distanc but he did it handsom for he settl an annuiti on her for life and she deserv itsh wa a veri good woman miss adel a ward he had wa put to school he broke off acquaint with all the gentri and shut himself up like a hermit at the hall what did he not leav england leav england bless you no he would not cross the doorston of the hous except at night when he walk just like a ghost about the ground and in the orchard as if he had lost hi senseswhich it is my opinion he had for a more spirit bolder keener gentleman than he wa befor that midg of a gover cross him you never saw maam he wa not a man given to wine or card or race as some ar and he wa not so veri handsom but he had a courag and a will of hi own if ever man had i knew him from a boi you see and for my part i have often wish that miss eyr had been sunk in the sea befor she came to thornfield hall then mr rochest wa at home when the fire broke out ye inde wa he and he went up to the attic when all wa burn abov and below and got the servant out of their bed and help them down himself and went back to get hi mad wife out of her cell and then thei call out to him that she wa on the roof where she wa stand wave her arm abov the battlement and shout out till thei could hear her a mile off i saw her and heard her with my own ey she wa a big woman and had long black hair we could see it stream against the flame as she stood i wit and sever more wit mr rochest ascend through the skylight on to the roof we heard him call bertha we saw him approach her and then maam she yell and gave a spring and the next minut she lai smash on the pavement the next minut she lai smash on the pavement p jpg dead dead ay dead as the stone on which her brain and blood were scatter good god you mai well sai so maam it wa fright he shudder and afterward i urg well maam afterward the hous wa burnt to the ground there ar onli some bit of wall stand now were ani other live lost noperhap it would have been better if there had what do you mean poor mr edward he ejacul i
