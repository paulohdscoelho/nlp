the symptom beyond all mistak the chief among them be a gener disinclin to work of ani kind what i suffer in that wai no tongu can tell from my earliest infanc i have been a martyr to it as a boi the diseas hardli ever left me for a dai thei did not know then that it wa my liver medic scienc wa in a far less advanc state than now and thei us to put it down to lazi why you skulk littl devil you thei would sai get up and do someth for your live can t you not know of cours that i wa ill and thei didn t give me pill thei gave me clump on the side of the head and strang as it mai appear those clump on the head often cure me for the time be i have known on clump on the head have more effect upon my liver and make me feel more anxiou to go straight awai then and there and do what wa want to be done without further loss of time than a whole box of pill doe now you know it often is so those simpl oldfashion remedi ar sometim more efficaci than all the dispensari stuff we sat there for halfanhour describ to each other our maladi i explain to georg and william harri how i felt when i got up in the morn and william harri told us how he felt when he went to bed and georg stood on the hearthrug and gave us a clever and power piec of act illustr of how he felt in the night georg fanci he is ill but there s never anyth realli the matter with him you know at thi point mr poppet knock at the door to know if we were readi for supper we smile sadli at on anoth and said we suppos we had better try to swallow a bit harri said a littl someth in on s stomach often kept the diseas in check and mr poppet brought the trai in and we drew up to the tabl and toi with a littl steak and onion and some rhubarb tart i must have been veri weak at the time becaus i know after the first

health what it wa that wa actual the matter with us we none of us could be sure of but the unanim opinion wa that it whatev it wa had been brought on by overwork what we want is rest said harri rest and a complet chang said georg the overstrain upon our brain ha produc a gener depress throughout the system chang of scene and absenc of the necess for thought will restor the mental equilibrium georg ha a cousin who is usual describ in the chargesheet as a medic student so that he natur ha a somewhat familyphysicianari wai of put thing i agre with georg and suggest that we should seek out some retir and oldworld spot far from the mad crowd and dream awai a sunni week among it drowsi lane some halfforgotten nook hidden awai by the fairi out of reach of the noisi world some quaintperch eyri on the cliff of time from whenc the surg wave of the nineteenth centuri would sound faroff and faint harri said he thought it would be humpi he said he knew the sort of place i meant where everybodi went to bed at eight o clock and you couldn t get a refere for love or monei and had to walk ten mile to get your bacci no said harri if you want rest and chang you can t beat a sea trip i object to the sea trip strongli a sea trip doe you good when you ar go to have a coupl of month of it but for a week it is wick you start on mondai with the idea implant in your bosom that you ar go to enjoi yourself you wave an airi adieu to the boi on shore light your biggest pipe and swagger about the deck as if you were captain cook sir franci drake and christoph columbu all roll into on on tuesdai you wish you hadn t come on wednesdai thursdai and fridai you wish you were dead on saturdai you ar abl to swallow a littl beef tea and to sit up on deck and answer with a wan sweet smile when kindheart peopl ask you how you feel now on sundai you begin to walk about again and take solid food and on mondai morn as with your bag and umbrella in your hand you stand by the gunwal wait to step ashor you begin to thoroughli like it i rememb my brotherinlaw go for a short sea trip onc for the benefit of hi health he took a return berth from london to liverpool and when he got to liverpool the onli thing he wa anxiou about wa to sell that return ticket it wa offer round the town at a tremend reduct so i am told and wa eventu sold for eighteenp to a biliouslook youth who had just been advis by hi medic men to go to the seasid and take exercis seasid said my brotherinlaw press the ticket affection into hi hand why you ll have enough to last you a lifetim and as for exercis why you ll get more exercis sit down on that ship than you would turn somersault on dry land he himself my brotherinlaw came back by train he said the northwestern railwai wa healthi enough for him anoth fellow i knew went for a week s voyag round the coast and befor thei start the steward came to him to ask whether he would pai for each meal as he had it or arrang beforehand for the whole seri the steward recommend the latter cours as it would come so much cheaper he said thei would do him for the whole week at two pound five he said for breakfast there would be fish follow by a grill lunch wa at on and consist of four cours dinner at six soup fish entre joint poultri salad sweet chees and dessert and a light meat supper at ten my friend thought he would close on the twopoundf job he is a hearti eater and did so lunch came just as thei were off sheer he didn t feel so hungri as he thought he should and so content himself with a bit of boil beef and some strawberri and cream he ponder a good deal dure the afternoon and at on time it seem to him that he had been eat noth but boil beef for week and at other time it seem that he must have been live on strawberri and cream for year neither the beef nor the strawberri and cream seem happi either seem discont like at six thei came and told him dinner wa readi the announc arous no enthusiasm within him but he felt that there wa some of that twopoundf to be work off and he held on to rope and thing and went down a pleasant odour of onion and hot ham mingl with fri fish and green greet him at the bottom of the ladder and then the steward came up with an oili smile and said what can i get you sir pictur man feel ill get me out of thi wa the feebl repli and thei ran him up quick and prop him up over to leeward and left him for the next four dai he live a simpl and blameless life on thin captain s biscuit i mean that the biscuit were thin not the captain and sodawat but toward saturdai he got uppish and went in for weak tea and dry toast and on mondai he wa gorg himself on chicken broth he left the ship on tuesdai and as it steam awai from the landingstag he gaze after it regretfulli there she goe he said there she goe with two pound worth of food on board that belong to me and that i haven t had he said that if thei had given him anoth dai he thought he could have put it straight so i set my face against the sea trip not as i explain upon my own account i wa never queer but i wa afraid for georg georg said he should be all right and would rather like it but he would advis harri and me not to think of it as he felt sure we should both be ill harri said that to himself it wa alwai a mysteri how peopl manag to get sick at sea said he thought peopl must do it on purpos from affect said he had often wish to be but had never been abl then he told us anecdot of how he had gone across the channel when it wa so rough that the passeng had to be ti into their berth and he and the captain were the onli two live soul on board who were not ill sometim it wa he and the second mate who were not ill but it wa gener he and on other man if not he and anoth man then it wa he by himself it is a curiou fact but nobodi ever is seasick on land at sea you come across plenti of peopl veri bad inde whole boatload of them but i never met a man yet on land who had ever known at all what it wa to be seasick where the thousand upon thousand of bad sailor that swarm in everi ship hide themselv when thei ar on land is a mysteri if most men were like a fellow i saw on the yarmouth boat on dai i could account for the seem enigma easili enough it wa just off southend pier i recollect and he wa lean out through on of the porthol in a veri danger posit i went up to him to try and save him hi come further in i said shake him by the shoulder you ll be overboard oh my i wish i wa wa the onli answer i could get and there i had to leav him three week afterward i met him in the coffeeroom of a bath hotel talk about hi voyag and explain with enthusiasm how he love the sea good sailor he repli in answer to a mild young man s enviou queri well i did feel a littl queer onc i confess it wa off cape horn the vessel wa wreck the next morn i said weren t you a littl shaki by southend pier on dai and want to be thrown overboard southend pier he repli with a puzzl express ye go down to yarmouth last fridai three week oh ah ye he answer brighten up i rememb now i did have a headach that afternoon it wa the pickl you know thei were the most disgrac pickl i ever tast in a respect boat did you have ani for myself i have discov an excel prevent against seasick in balanc myself you stand in the centr of the deck and as the ship heav and pitch you move your bodi about so as to keep it alwai straight when the front of the ship rise you lean forward till the deck almost touch your nose and when it back end get up you lean backward thi is all veri well for an hour or two but you can t balanc yourself for a week georg said let s go up the river he said we should have fresh air exercis and quiet the constant chang of scene would occupi our mind includ what there wa of harri s and the hard work would give us a good appetit and make us sleep well harri said he didn t think georg ought to do anyth that would have a tendenc to make him sleepier than he alwai wa as it might be danger he said he didn t veri well understand how georg wa go to sleep ani more than he did now see that there were onli twentyfour hour in each dai summer and winter alik but thought that if he did sleep ani more he might just as well be dead and so save hi board and lodg harri said howev that the river would suit him to a t i don t know what a t is except a sixpenni on which includ breadandbutt and cake ad lib and is cheap at the price if you haven t had ani dinner it seem to suit everybodi howev which is greatli to it credit it suit me to a t too and harri and i both said it wa a good idea of georg s and we said it in a tone that seem to somehow impli that we were surpris that georg should have come out so sensibl pictur montmor the onli on who wa not struck with the suggest wa montmor he never did care for the river did montmor it s all veri well for you fellow he sai you like it but i don t there s noth for me to do sceneri is not in my line and i don t smoke if i see a rat you won t stop and if i go to sleep you get fool about with the boat and slop me overboard if you ask me i call the whole thing balli foolish we were three to on howev and the motion wa carri chapter ii plan discuss pleasur of campingout on fine night ditto wet night compromis decid on montmor first impress of fear lest he is too good for thi world fear subsequ dismiss as groundless meet adjourn we pull out the map and discuss plan we arrang to start on the follow saturdai from kingston harri and i would go down in the morn and take the boat up to chertsei and georg who would not be abl to get awai from the citi till the afternoon georg goe to sleep at a bank from ten to four each dai except saturdai when thei wake him up and put him outsid at two would meet us there should we camp out or sleep at inn georg and i were for camp out we said it would be so wild and free so patriarch like slowli the golden memori of the dead sun fade from the heart of the cold sad cloud silent like sorrow children the bird have ceas their song and onli the moorhen s plaintiv cry and the harsh croak of the corncrak stir the aw hush around the couch of water where the dy dai breath out her last from the dim wood on either bank night s ghostli armi the grei shadow creep out with noiseless tread to chase awai the linger rearguard of the light and pass with noiseless unseen feet abov the wave rivergrass and through the sigh rush and night upon her sombr throne fold her black wing abov the darken world and from her phantom palac lit by the pale star reign in still pictur river scene then we run our littl boat into some quiet nook and the tent is pitch and the frugal supper cook and eaten then the big pipe ar fill and light and the pleasant chat goe round in music underton while in the paus of our talk the river plai round the boat prattl strang old tale and secret sing low the old child s song that it ha sung so mani thousand year will sing so mani thousand year to come befor it voic grow harsh and old a song that we who have learnt to love it chang face who have so often nestl on it yield bosom think somehow we understand though we could not tell you in mere word the stori that we listen to and we sit there by it margin while the moon who love it too stoop down to kiss it with a sister s kiss and throw her silver arm around it clingingli and we watch it as it flow ever sing ever whisper out to meet it king the sea till our voic die awai in silenc and the pipe go out till we commonplac everydai young men enough feel strang full of thought half sad half sweet and do not care or want to speak till we laugh and rise knock the ash from our burntout pipe and sai goodnight and lull by the lap water and the rustl tree we fall asleep beneath the great still star and dream that the world is young again young and sweet as she us to be er the centuri of fret and care had furrow her fair face er her children s sin and folli had made old her love heart sweet as she wa in those bygon dai when a newmad mother she nurs us her children upon her own deep breast er the wile of paint civil had lure us awai from her fond arm and the poison sneer of artifici had made us asham of the simpl life we led with her and the simpl state home where mankind wa born so mani thousand year ago harri said how about when it rain you can never rous harri there is no poetri about harri no wild yearn for the unattain harri never weep he know not why if harri s ey fill with tear you can bet it is becaus harri ha been eat raw onion or ha put too much worcest over hi chop pictur mermaid if you were to stand at night by the

veri quarrelsom and you swear at each other in hoars whisper dure the whole of breakfast time we therefor decid that we would sleep out on fine night and hotel it and inn it and pub it like respect folk when it wa wet or when we felt inclin for a chang montmor hail thi compromis with much approv he doe not revel in romant solitud give him someth noisi and if a trifl low so much the jollier to look at montmor you would imagin that he wa an angel sent upon the earth for some reason withheld from mankind in the shape of a small foxterri there is a sort of ohwhatawickedworldthisisandhowiwishicoulddosomethingto makeitbetterandnobl express about montmor that ha been known to bring the tear into the ey of piou old ladi and gentlemen when first he came to live at my expens i never thought i should be abl to get him to stop long i us to sit down and look at him as he sat on the rug and look up at me and think oh that dog will never live he will be snatch up to the bright ski in a chariot that is what will happen to him but when i had paid for about a dozen chicken that he had kill and had drag him growl and kick by the scruff of hi neck out of a hundr and fourteen street fight and had had a dead cat brought round for my inspect by an irat femal who call me a murder and had been summon by the man next door but on for have a feroci dog at larg that had kept him pin up in hi own toolsh afraid to ventur hi nose outsid the door for over two hour on a cold night and had learn that the garden unknown to myself had won thirti shill by back him to kill rat against time then i began to think that mayb thei d let him remain on earth for a bit longer after all to hang about a stabl and collect a gang of the most disreput dog to be found in the town and lead them out to march round the slum to fight other disreput dog is montmor s idea of life and so as i befor observ he gave to the suggest of inn and pub and hotel hi most emphat approb have thu settl the sleep arrang to the satisfact of all four of us the onli thing left to discuss wa what we should take with us and thi we had begun to argu when harri said he d had enough oratori for on night and propos that we should go out and have a smile sai that he had found a place round by the squar where you could realli get a drop of irish worth drink pictur whiski glass georg said he felt thirsti i never knew georg when he didn t and as i had a presenti that a littl whiski warm with a slice of lemon would do my complaint good the debat wa by common assent adjourn to the follow night and the assembl put on it hat and went out chapter iii arrang settl harri s method of do work how the elderli familyman put up a pictur georg make a sensibl remark delight of earli morn bath provis for get upset so on the follow even we again assembl to discuss and arrang our plan harri said now the first thing to settl is what to take with us now you get a bit of paper and write down j and you get the groceri catalogu georg and somebodi give me a bit of pencil and then i ll make out a list that s harri all over so readi to take the burden of everyth himself and put it on the back of other peopl he alwai remind me of my poor uncl podger you never saw such a commot up and down a hous in all your life as when my uncl podger undertook to do a job a pictur would have come home from the framemak s and be stand in the diningroom wait to be put up and aunt podger would ask what wa to be done with it and uncl podger would sai oh you leav that to me don t you ani of you worri yourselv about that i ll do all that and then he would take off hi coat and begin he would send the girl out for sixpen orth of nail and then on of the boi after her to tell her what size to get and from that he would gradual work down and start the whole hous pictur candl now you go and get me my hammer will he would shout and you bring me the rule tom and i shall want the stepladd and i had better have a kitchenchair too and jim you run round to mr goggl and tell him pa s kind regard and hope hi leg s better and will he lend him hi spiritlevel and don t you go maria becaus i shall want somebodi to hold me the light and when the girl come back she must go out again for a bit of picturecord and tom where s tom tom you come here i shall want you to hand me up the pictur and then he would lift up the pictur and drop it and it would come out of the frame and he would try to save the glass and cut himself and then he would spring round the room look for hi handkerchief he could not find hi handkerchief becaus it wa in the pocket of the coat he had taken off and he did not know where he had put the coat and all the hous had to leav off look for hi tool and start look for hi coat while he would danc round and hinder them pictur nail etc doesn t anybodi in the whole hous know where my coat is i never came across such a set in all my life upon my word i didn t six of you and you

as well ask the cat to find anyth as expect you peopl to find it and when half an hour had been spent in ty up hi finger and a new glass had been got and the tool and the ladder and the chair and the candl had been brought he would have anoth go the whole famili includ the girl and the charwoman stand round in a semicircl readi to help two peopl would have to hold the chair and a third would help him up on it and hold him there and a fourth would hand him a nail and a fifth would pass him up the hammer and he would take hold of the nail and drop it there he would sai in an injur tone now the nail s gone and we would all have to go down on our knee and grovel for it while he would stand on the chair and grunt and want to know if he wa to be kept there all the even the nail would be found at last but by that time he would have lost the hammer where s the hammer what did i do with the hammer great heaven seven of you gape round there and you don t know what i did with the hammer we

find it and we would each discov it in a differ place and he would call us all fool on after anoth and tell us to get down and he would take the rule and remeasur and find that he want half thirtyon and threeeighth inch from the corner and would try to do it in hi head and go mad and we would all try to do it in our head and all arriv at differ result and sneer at on anoth and in the gener row the origin number would be forgotten and uncl podger would have to measur it again he would us a bit of string thi time and at the critic moment when the old fool wa lean over the chair at an angl of fortyf and try to reach a point three inch beyond what wa possibl for him to reach the string would slip and down he would slide on to the piano a realli fine music effect be produc by the sudden with which hi head and bodi struck all the note at the same time and aunt maria would sai that she would not allow the children to stand round and hear such languag at last uncl podger would get the spot fix again and put the point of the nail on it with hi left hand and take the hammer in hi right hand and with the first blow he would smash hi thumb and drop the hammer with a yell on somebodi s toe aunt maria would mildli observ that next time uncl podger wa go to hammer a nail into the wall she hope he d let her know in time so that she could make arrang to go and spend a week with her mother while it wa be done oh you women you make such a fuss over everyth uncl podger would repli pick himself up why i like do a littl job of thi sort pictur uncl podger admir hi work and then he would have anoth try and at the second blow the nail would go clean through the plaster and half the hammer after it and uncl podger be precipit against the wall with forc nearli suffici to flatten hi nose then we had to find the rule and the string again and a new hole wa made and about midnight the pictur would be up veri crook and insecur the wall for yard round look as if it had been smooth down with a rake and everybodi dead beat and wretch except uncl podger there you ar he would sai step heavili off the chair on to the charwoman s corn and survei the mess he had made with evid pride why some peopl would have had a man in to do a littl thing like that harri will be just that sort of man when he grow up i know and i told him so i said i could not permit him to take so much labour upon himself i said no you get the paper and the pencil and the catalogu and georg write down and i ll do the work the first list we made out had to be discard it wa clear that the upper reach of the thame would not allow of the navig of a boat suffici larg to take the thing we had set down as indispens so we tore the list up and look at on anoth georg said you know we ar on a wrong track altogeth we must not think of the thing we could do with but onli of the thing that we can t do without georg come out realli quit sensibl at time you d be surpris i call that downright wisdom not mere as regard the present case but with refer to our trip up the river of life gener how mani peopl on that voyag load up the boat till it is ever in danger of swamp with a store of foolish thing which thei think essenti to the pleasur and comfort of the trip but which ar realli onli useless lumber how thei pile the poor littl craft masthigh with fine cloth and big hous with useless servant and a host of swell friend that do not care twopenc for them and that thei do not care three ha penc for with expens entertain that nobodi enjoi with formal and fashion with pretenc and ostent and with oh heaviest maddest lumber of all the dread of what will my neighbour think with luxuri that onli cloi with pleasur that bore with empti show that like the crimin s iron crown of yore make to bleed and swoon the ach head that wear it it is lumber man all lumber throw it overboard it make the boat so heavi to pull you nearli faint at the oar it make it so cumbersom and danger to manag you never know a moment s freedom from anxieti and care never gain a moment s rest for dreami lazi no time to watch the windi shadow skim lightli o er the shallow or the glitter sunbeam flit in and out among the rippl or the great tree by the margin look down at their own imag or the wood all green and golden or the lili white and yellow or the sombrewav rush or the sedg or the orchi or the blue forgetmenot throw the lumber over man let your boat of life be light pack with onli what you need a home home and simpl pleasur on or two friend worth the name someon to love and someon to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a littl more than enough to drink for thirst is a danger thing you will find the boat easier to pull then and it will not be so liabl to upset and it will not matter so much if it doe upset good plain merchandis will stand water you will have time to think as well as to work time to drink in life s sunshin time to listen to the olian music that the wind of god draw from the human heartstr around us time to i beg your pardon realli i quit forgot well we left the list to georg and he began it pictur tent we won t take a tent suggest georg we will have a boat with a cover it is ever so much simpler and more comfort it seem a good thought and we adopt it i do not know whether you have ever seen the thing i mean you fix iron hoop up over the boat and stretch a huge canva over them and fasten it down all round from stem to stern and it convert the boat into a sort of littl hous and it is beautifulli cosi though a trifl stuffi but there everyth ha it drawback as the man said when hi motherinlaw di and thei came down upon him for the funer expens georg said that in that case we must take a rug each a lamp some soap a brush and comb between us a toothbrush each a basin some toothpowd some shave tackl sound like a french exercis doesn t it and a coupl of bigtowel for bath i notic that peopl alwai make gigant arrang for bath when thei ar go anywher near the water but that thei don t bath much when thei ar there pictur seasid scene it is the same when you go to the seasid i alwai determin when think over the matter in london that i ll get up earli everi morn and go and have a dip befor breakfast and i religi pack up a pair of drawer and a bath towel i alwai get red bath drawer i rather fanci myself in red drawer thei suit my complexion so but when i get to the sea i don t feel somehow that i want that earli morn bath nearli so much as i did when i wa in town on the contrari i feel more that i want to stop in bed till the last moment and then come down and have my breakfast onc or twice virtu ha triumph and i have got out at six and halfdress myself and have taken my drawer and towel and stumbl dismal off but i haven t enjoi it thei seem to keep a special cut east wind wait for me when i go to bath in the earli morn and thei pick out all the threecorn stone and put them on the top and thei sharpen up the rock and cover the point over with a bit of sand so that i can t see them and thei take the sea and put it two mile out so that i have to huddl myself up in my arm and hop shiver through six inch of water and when i do get to the sea it is rough and quit insult on huge wave catch me up and chuck me in a sit postur as hard as ever it can down on to a rock which ha been put there for me and befor i ve said oh ugh and found out what ha gone the wave come back and carri me out to midocean i begin to strike out frantic for the shore and wonder if i shall ever see home and friend again and wish i d been kinder to my littl sister when a boi when i wa a boi i mean just when i have given up all hope a wave retir and leav me sprawl like a starfish on the sand and i get up and look back and find that i ve been swim for my life in two feet of water i hop back and dress and crawl home where i have to pretend i like it in the present instanc we all talk as if we were go to have a long swim everi morn georg said it wa so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the fresh morn and plung into the limpid river harri said there wa noth like a swim befor breakfast to give you an appetit he said it alwai gave him an appetit georg said that if it wa go to make harri eat more than harri ordinarili at then he should protest against harri have a bath at all he said there would be quit enough hard work in tow suffici food for harri up against stream as it wa i urg upon georg howev how much pleasant it would be to have harri clean and fresh about the boat even if we did have to take a few more hundredweight of provis and he got to see it in my light and withdrew hi opposit to harri s bath agre final that we should take three bath towel so as not to keep each other wait for cloth georg said two suit of flannel would be suffici as we could wash them ourselv in the river when thei got dirti we ask him if he had ever tri wash flannel in the river and he repli no not exactli himself like but he knew some fellow who had and it wa easi enough and harri and i were weak enough to fanci he knew what he wa talk about and that three respect young men without posit or influenc and with no experi in wash could realli clean their own shirt and trouser in the river thame with a bit of soap we were to learn in the dai to come when it wa too late that georg wa a miser impostor who could evid have known noth whatev about the matter if you had seen these cloth after but as the shill shocker sai we anticip georg impress upon us to take a chang of underth and plenti of sock in case we got upset and want a chang also plenti of handkerchief as thei would do to wipe thing and a pair of leather boot as well as our boat shoe as we should want them if we got upset chapter iv the food question object to paraffin oil as an atmospher advantag of chees as a travel companion a marri woman desert her home further provis for get upset i pack cussed of toothbrush georg and harri pack aw behaviour of montmor we retir to rest then we discuss the food question georg said begin with breakfast georg is so practic now for breakfast we shall want a fryingpan harri said it wa indigest but we mere urg him not to be an ass and georg went on a teapot and a kettl and a methyl spirit stove no oil said georg with a signific look and harri and i agre we had taken up an oilstov onc but never again it had been like live in an oilshop that week it ooz i never saw such a thing as paraffin oil is to ooz we kept it in the nose of the boat and from there it ooz down to the rudder impregn the whole boat and everyth in it on it wai and it ooz over the river and satur the sceneri and spoilt the atmospher sometim a westerli oili wind blew and at other time an easterli oili wind and sometim it blew a northerli oili wind and mayb a southerli oili wind but whether it came from the arctic snow or wa rais in the wast of the desert sand it came alik to us laden with the fragranc of paraffin oil and that oil ooz up and ruin the sunset and as for the moonbeam thei posit reek of paraffin we tri to get awai from it at marlow we left the boat by the bridg and took a walk through the town to escap it but it follow us the whole town wa full of oil we pass through the churchyard and it seem as if the peopl had been buri in oil the high street stunk of oil we wonder how peopl could live in it and we walk mile upon mile out birmingham wai but it wa no us the countri wa steep in oil at the end of that trip we met togeth at midnight in a lone field under a blast oak and took an aw oath we had been swear for a whole week about the thing in an ordinari middleclass wai but thi wa a swell affair an aw oath never to take paraffin oil with us in a boat againexcept of cours in case of sick therefor in the present instanc we confin ourselv to methyl spirit even that is bad enough you get methyl pie and methyl cake but methyl spirit is more wholesom when taken into the system in larg quantiti than paraffin oil for other breakfast thing georg suggest egg and bacon which were easi to cook cold meat tea bread and butter and jam for lunch he said we could have biscuit cold meat bread and butter and jam but no chees chees like oil make too much of itself it want the whole boat to itself it goe through the hamper and give a cheesi flavour to everyth els there you can t tell whether you ar eat applepi or german sausag or strawberri and cream it all seem chees there is too much odour about chees i rememb a friend of mine bui a coupl of chees at liverpool splendid chees thei were ripe and mellow and with a two hundr horsepow scent about them that might have been warrant to carri three mile and knock a man over at two hundr yard i wa in liverpool at the time and my friend said that if i didn t mind he would get me to take them back with me to london as he should not be come up for a dai or two himself and he did not think the chees ought to be kept much longer oh with pleasur dear boi i repli with pleasur i call for the chees and took them awai in a cab it wa a ramshackl affair drag along by a knockkne brokenwind somnambulist which hi owner in a moment of enthusiasm dure convers refer to as a hors i put the chees on the top and we start off at a shambl that would have done credit to the swiftest steamrol ever built and all went merri as a funer bell until we turn the corner there the wind carri a whiff from the chees full on to our steed it woke him up and with a snort of terror he dash off at three mile an hour the wind still blew in hi direct and befor we reach the end of the street he wa lai himself out at the rate of nearli four mile an hour leav the crippl and stout old ladi simpli nowher it took two porter as well as the driver to hold him in at the station and i do not think thei would have done it even then had not on of the men had the presenc of mind to put a handkerchief over hi nose and to light a bit of brown paper i took my ticket and march proudli up the platform with my chees the peopl fall back respectfulli on either side the train wa crowd and i had to get into a carriag where there were alreadi seven other peopl on crusti old gentleman object but i got in notwithstand and put my chees upon the rack squeez down with a pleasant smile and said it wa a warm dai a few moment pass and then the old gentleman began to fidget veri close in here he said quit oppress said the man next him and then thei both began snif and at the third sniff thei caught it right on the chest and rose up without anoth word and went out and then a stout ladi got up and said it wa disgrac that a respect marri woman should be harri about in thi wai and gather up a bag and eight parcel and went the remain four passeng sat on for a while until a solemnlook man in the corner who from hi dress and gener appear seem to belong to the undertak class said it put him in mind of dead babi and the other three passeng tri to get out of the door at the same time and hurt themselv pictur railwai carriag i smile at the black gentleman and said i thought we were go to have the carriag to ourselv and he laugh pleasantli and said that some peopl made such a fuss over a littl thing but even he grew strang depress after we had start and so when we reach crew i ask him to come and have a drink he accept and we forc our wai into the buffet where we yell and stamp and wave our umbrella for a quarter of an hour and then a young ladi came and ask us if we want anyth what s your i said turn to my friend i ll have halfacrown s worth of brandi neat if you pleas miss he respond and he went off quietli after he had drunk it and got into anoth carriag which i thought mean from crew i had the compart to myself though the train wa crowd as we drew up at the differ station the peopl see my empti carriag would rush for it here y ar maria come along plenti of room all right tom we ll get in here thei would shout and thei would run along carri heavi bag and fight round the door to get in first and on would open the door and mount the step and stagger back into the arm of the man behind him and thei would all come and have a sniff and then droop off and squeez into other carriag or pai the differ and go first from euston i took the chees down to my friend s hous when hi wife came into the room she smelt round for an instant then she said what is it tell me the worst i said it s chees tom bought them in liverpool and ask me to bring them up with me and i ad that i hope she understood that it had noth to do with me and she said that she wa sure of that but that she would speak to tom about it when he came back my friend wa detain in liverpool longer than he expect and three dai later as he hadn t return home hi wife call on me she said what did tom sai about those chees i repli that he had direct thei were to be kept in a moist place and that nobodi wa to touch them she said nobodi s like to touch them had he smelt them i thought he had and ad that he seem greatli attach to them you think he would be upset she queri if i gave a man a sovereign to take them awai and buri them i answer that i thought he would never smile again an idea struck her she said do you mind keep them for him let me send them round to you madam i repli for myself i like the smell of chees and the journei the other dai with them from liverpool i shall ever look back upon as a happi end to a pleasant holidai but in thi world we must consid other the ladi under whose roof i have the honour of resid is a widow and for all i know possibl an orphan too she ha a strong i mai sai an eloqu object to be what she term put upon the presenc of your husband s chees in her hous she would i instinct feel regard as a put upon and it shall never be said that i put upon the widow and the orphan veri well then said my friend s wife rise all i have to sai is that i shall take the children and go to an hotel until those chees ar eaten i declin to live ani longer in the same hous with them she kept her word leav the place in charg of the charwoman who when ask if she could stand the smell repli what smell and who when taken close to the chees and told to sniff hard said she could detect a faint odour of melon it wa argu from thi that littl injuri could result to the woman from the atmospher and she wa left the hotel bill came to fifteen guinea and my friend after reckon everyth up found that the chees had cost him eightandsixp a pound he said he dearli love a bit of chees but it wa beyond hi mean so he determin to get rid of them he threw them into the canal but had to fish them out again as the bargemen complain thei said it made them feel quit faint and after that he took them on dark night and left them in the parish mortuari but the coron discov them and made a fear fuss he said it wa a plot to depriv him of hi live by wake up the corps my friend got rid of them at last by take them down to a seasid town and buri them on the beach it gain the place quit a reput visitor said thei had never notic befor how strong the air wa and weakchest and consumpt peopl us to throng there for year afterward fond as i am of chees therefor i hold that georg wa right in declin to take ani we shan t want ani tea said georg harri s face fell at thi but we ll have a good round squar slapup meal at seven dinner tea and supper combin harri grew more cheer georg suggest meat and fruit pi cold meat tomato fruit and green stuff for drink we took some wonder sticki concoct of harri s which you mix with water and call lemonad plenti of tea and a bottl of whiski in case as georg said we got upset it seem to me that georg harp too much on the gettingupset idea it seem to me the wrong spirit to go about the trip in but i m glad we took the whiski we didn t take beer or wine thei ar a mistak up the river thei make you feel sleepi and heavi a glass in the even when you ar do a mouch round the town and look at the girl is all right enough but don t drink when the sun is blaze down on your head and you ve got hard work to do we made a list of the thing to be taken and a pretti lengthi on it wa befor we part that even the next dai which wa fridai we got them all togeth and met in the even to pack we got a big gladston for the cloth and a coupl of hamper for the victual and the cook utensil we move the tabl up against the window pile everyth in a heap in the middl of the floor and sat round and look at it i said i d pack i rather pride myself on my pack pack is on of those mani thing that i feel i know more about than ani other person live it surpris me myself sometim how mani of these subject there ar i impress the fact upon georg and harri and told them that thei had better leav the whole matter entir to me thei fell into the suggest with a readi that had someth uncanni about it georg put on a pipe and spread himself over the easychair and harri cock hi leg on the tabl and lit a cigar thi wa hardli what i intend what i had meant of cours wa that i should boss the job and that harri and georg should potter about under my direct i push them asid everi now and then with oh you here let me do it there you ar simpl enough realli teach them as you might sai their take it in the wai thei did irrit me there is noth doe irrit me more than see other peopl sit about do noth when i m work i live with a man onc who us to make me mad that wai he would loll on the sofa and watch me do thing by the hour togeth follow me round the room with hi ey wherev i went he said it did him real good to look on at me mess about he said it made him feel that life wa not an idl dream to be gape and yawn through but a nobl task full of duti and stern work he said he often wonder now how he could have gone on befor he met me never have anybodi to look at while thei work now i m not like that i can t sit still and see anoth man slave and work i want to get up and superintend and walk round with my hand in my pocket and tell him what to do it is my energet natur i can t help it howev i did not sai anyth but start the pack it seem a longer job than i had thought it wa go to be but i got the bag finish at last and i sat on it and strap it ain t you go to put the boot in said harri and i look round and found i had forgotten them that s just like harri he couldn t have said a word until i d got the bag shut and strap of cours and georg laugh on of those irrit senseless chucklehead crackjaw laugh of hi thei do make me so wild i open the bag and pack the boot in and then just as i wa go to close it a horribl idea occur to me had i pack my toothbrush i don t know how it is but i never do know whether i ve pack my toothbrush my toothbrush is a thing that haunt me when i m travel and make my life a miseri i dream that i haven t pack it and wake up in a cold perspir and get out of bed and hunt for it and in the morn i pack it befor i have us it and have to unpack again to get it and it is alwai the last thing i turn out of the bag and then i repack and forget it and have to rush upstair for it at the last moment and carri it to the railwai station wrap up in my pockethandkerchief pictur boot of cours i had to turn everi mortal thing out now and of cours i could not find it i rummag the thing up into much the same state that thei must have been befor the world wa creat and when chao reign of cours i found georg s and harri s eighteen time over but i couldn t find my own i put the thing back on by on and held everyth up and shook it then i found it insid a boot i repack onc more when i had finish georg ask if the

up final at pm and then there remain the hamper to do harri said that we should be want to start in less than twelv hour time and thought that he and georg had better do the rest and i agre and sat down and thei had a go thei began in a lightheart spirit evid intend to show me how to do it i made no comment i onli wait when georg is hang harri will be the worst packer in thi world and i look at the pile of plate and cup and kettl and bottl and jar and pi and stove and cake and tomato c and felt that the thing would soon becom excit it did thei start with break a cup that wa the first thing thei did thei did that just to show you what thei could do and to get you interest then harri pack the strawberri jam on top of a tomato and squash it and thei had to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon and then it wa georg s turn and he trod on the butter i didn t sai anyth but i came over and sat on the edg of the tabl and watch them it irrit them more than anyth i could have said i felt that it made them nervou and excit and thei step on thing and put thing behind them and then couldn t find them when thei want them and thei pack the pi at the bottom and put heavi thing on top and smash the pi in thei upset salt over everyth and as for the butter i never saw two men do more with oneandtwop worth of butter in my whole life than thei did after georg had got it off hi slipper thei tri to put it in the kettl it wouldn t go in and what wa in wouldn t come out thei did scrape it out at last and put it down on a chair and harri sat on it and it stuck to him and thei went look for it all over the room i ll take my oath i put it down on that chair said georg stare at the empti seat i saw you do it myself not a minut ago said harri then thei start round the room again look for it and then thei met again in the centr and stare at on anoth most extraordinari thing i ever heard of said georg so mysteri said harri then georg got round at the back of harri and saw it why here it is all the time he exclaim indignantli where cri harri spin round stand still can t you roar georg fly after him and thei got it off and pack it in the teapot montmor wa in it all of cours montmor s ambit in life is to get in the wai and be sworn at if he can squirm in anywher where he particularli is not want and be a perfect nuisanc and make peopl mad and have thing thrown at hi head then he feel hi dai ha not been wast to get somebodi to stumbl over him and curs him steadili for an hour is hi highest aim and object and when he ha succeed in accomplish thi hi conceit becom quit unbear he came and sat down on thing just when thei were want to be pack and he labour under the fix belief that whenev harri or georg reach out their hand for anyth it wa hi cold damp nose that thei want he put hi leg into the jam and he worri the teaspoon and he pretend that the lemon were rat and got into the hamper and kill three of them befor harri could land him with the fryingpan harri said i encourag him i didn t encourag him a dog like that don t want ani encourag it s the natur origin sin that is born in him that make him do thing like that the pack wa done at and harri sat on the big hamper and said he hope noth would be found broken georg said that if anyth wa broken it wa broken which reflect seem to comfort him he also said he wa readi for bed we were all readi for bed harri wa

would come home with cold and rheumat all over us and go to bed the weather is a thing that is beyond me altogeth i never can understand it the baromet is useless it is as mislead as the newspap forecast there wa on hang up in a hotel at oxford at which i wa stai last spring and when i got there it wa point to set fair it wa simpli pour with rain outsid and had been all dai and i couldn t quit make matter out i tap the baromet and it jump up and point to veri dry the boot stop as he wa pass and said he expect it meant tomorrow i fanci that mayb it wa think of the week befor last but boot said no he thought not i tap it again the next morn and it went up still higher and the rain came down faster than ever on wednesdai i went and hit it again and the pointer went round toward set fair veri dry and much heat until it wa stop by the peg and couldn t go ani further it tri it best but the instrument wa built so that it couldn t prophesi fine weather ani harder than it did without break itself it evid want to go on and prognost drought and water famin and sunstrok and simoom and such thing but the peg prevent it and it had to be content with point to the mere commonplac veri dry meanwhil the rain came down in a steadi torrent and the lower part of the town wa under water ow to the river have overflow boot said it wa evid that we were go to have a prolong spell of grand weather some time and read out a poem which wa print over the top of the oracl about long foretold long last short notic soon past the fine weather never came that summer i expect that machin must have been refer to the follow spring then there ar those new style of baromet the long straight on i never can make head or tail of those there is on side for am yesterdai and on side for am todai but you can t alwai get there as earli as ten you know it rise or fall for rain and fine with much or less wind and on end is nly and the other eli what s eli got to do with it and if you tap it it doesn t tell you anyth and you ve got to correct it to sealevel and reduc it to fahrenheit and even then i don t know the answer but who want to be foretold the weather it is bad enough when it come without our have the miseri of know about it beforehand the prophet we like is the old man who on the particularli gloomylook morn of some dai when we particularli want it to be fine look round the horizon with a particularli know ey and sai oh no sir i think it will clear up all right it will break all right enough sir ah he know we sai as we wish him goodmorn and start off wonder how these old fellow

ought to be done to encourag thi sort of thing ask our hero if he would like to see some fine old carv oak my friend said he would and the shopman thereupon took him through the shop and up the staircas of the hous the balust were a superb piec of workmanship and the wall all the wai up wa oakpanel with carv that would have done credit to a palac from the stair thei went into the drawingroom which wa a larg bright room decor with a somewhat startl though cheer paper of a blue ground there wa noth howev remark about the apart and my friend wonder why he had been brought there the

thei will be struck by the wonder depth of the colour on the nose and specul as to how beauti the bit of the tail that is lost no doubt wa we in thi ag do not see the beauti of that dog we ar too

which wa us and which wa the middlesex bank of the river but we found out after a while and separ ourselv harri howev said he had done enough for a bit and propos that i should take a turn so as we were in i got out and took the towlin and ran the boat on past hampton court what a dear old wall that is that run along by the river there i never pass it without feel better for the sight of it such a mellow bright sweet old wall what a charm pictur it would make with the lichen creep here and the moss grow there a shy young vine peep over the top at thi spot to see what is go on upon the busi river and the sober old ivi cluster a littl farther down there ar fifti shade and tint and hue in everi ten yard of that old wall if i could onli draw and knew how to paint i could make a love sketch of that old wall i m sure i ve often thought i should like to live at hampton court it look so peac and so quiet and it is such a dear old place to rambl round in the earli morn befor mani peopl ar about but there i don t suppos i should realli care for it when it came to actual practic it would be so ghastli dull and depress in the even when your lamp cast uncanni shadow on the panel wall and the echo of distant feet rang through the cold stone corridor and now drew nearer and now di awai and all wa deathlik silenc save the beat of on s own heart we ar creatur of the sun we men and women we love light and life that is why we crowd into the town and citi and the countri grow more and more desert everi year in the sunlight in the daytim when natur is aliv and busi all around us we like the open hillsid and the deep wood well enough but in the night when our mother earth ha gone to sleep and left us wake oh the world seem so lonesom and we get frighten like children in a silent hous then we sit and sob and long for the gaslit street and the sound of human voic and the answer throb of human life we feel so helpless and so littl in the great still when the dark tree rustl in the nightwind there ar so mani ghost about and their silent sigh make us feel so sad let us gather togeth in the great citi and light huge bonfir of a million gasjet and shout and sing togeth and feel brave pictur peopl at hampton maze harri ask me if i d ever been in the maze at hampton court he said he went in onc to show somebodi els the wai he had studi it up in a map and it wa so simpl that it seem foolish hardli worth the twopenc charg for admiss harri said he thought that map must have been got up as a practic joke becaus it wasn t a bit like the real thing and onli mislead it wa a countri cousin that harri took in he said we ll just go in here so that you can sai you ve been but it s veri simpl it s absurd to call it a maze you keep on take the first turn to the right we ll just walk round for ten minut and then go and get some lunch thei met some peopl soon after thei had got insid who said thei had been there for threequart of an hour and had had about enough of it harri told them thei could follow him if thei like he wa just go in and then should turn round and come out again thei said it wa veri kind of him and fell behind and follow thei pick up variou other peopl who want to get it over as thei went along until thei had absorb all the person in the maze peopl who had given up all hope of ever get either in or out or of ever see their home and friend again pluck up courag at the sight of harri and hi parti and join the process bless him harri said he should judg there must have been twenti peopl follow him in all and on woman with a babi who had been there all the morn insist on take hi arm for fear of lose him harri kept on turn to the right but it seem a long wai and hi cousin said he suppos it wa a veri big maze oh on of the largest in europ said harri ye it must be repli the cousin becaus we ve walk a good two mile alreadi harri began to think it rather strang himself but he held on until at last thei pass the half of a penni bun on the ground that harri s cousin swore he had notic there seven minut ago harri said oh imposs but the woman with the babi said not at all as she herself had taken it from the child and thrown it down there just befor she met harri she also ad that she wish she never had met harri and express an opinion that he wa an impostor that made harri mad and he produc hi map and explain hi theori the map mai be all right enough said on of the parti if you know whereabout in it we ar now harri didn t know and suggest that the best thing to do would be to go back to the entranc and begin again for the begin again part of it there wa not much enthusiasm but with regard to the advis of go back to the entranc there wa complet unanim and so thei turn and trail after harri again in the opposit direct about ten minut more pass and then thei found themselv in the centr harri thought at first of pretend that that wa what he had been aim at but the crowd look danger and he decid to treat it as an accid anyhow thei had got someth to start from then thei did know where thei were and the map wa onc more consult and the thing seem simpler than ever and off thei start for the third time and three minut later thei were back in the centr again after that thei simpli couldn t get anywher els whatev wai thei turn brought them back to the middl it becam so regular at length that some of the peopl stop there and wait for the other to take a walk round and come back to them harri drew out hi map again after a while but the sight of it onli infuri the mob and thei told him to go and curl hi hair with it harri said that he couldn t help feel that to a certain extent he had becom unpopular thei all got crazi at last and sang out for the keeper and the man came and climb up the ladder outsid and shout out direct to them but all their head were by thi time in such a confus whirl that thei were incap of grasp anyth and so the man told them to stop where thei were and he would come to them thei huddl togeth and wait and he climb down and came in he wa a young keeper as luck would have it and new to the busi and when he got in he couldn t find them and he wander about try to get to them and then he got lost thei caught sight of him everi now and then rush about the other side of the hedg and he would see them and rush to get to them and thei would wait there for about five minut and then he would reappear again in exactli the same spot and ask them where thei had been thei had to wait till on of the old keeper came back from hi dinner befor thei got out harri said he thought it wa a veri fine maze so far as he wa a judg and we agre that we would try to get georg to go into it on our wai back chapter vii the river in it sundai garb dress on the river a chanc for the men

but onli a brilliant tangl of bright blazer and gai cap and sauci hat and manycolour parasol and silken rug and cloak and stream ribbon and dainti white when look down into the lock from the quai you might fanci it wa a huge box into which flower of everi hue and shade had been thrown pellmel and lai pile up in a rainbow heap that cover everi corner on a fine sundai it present thi appear nearli all dai long while up the stream and down the stream lie wait their turn outsid the gate long line of still more boat and boat ar draw near and pass awai so that the sunni river from the palac up to hampton church is dot and deck with yellow and blue and orang and white and red and pink all the inhabit of hampton and moulsei dress themselv up in boat costum and come and mouch round the lock with their dog and flirt and smoke and watch the boat and altogeth what with the cap and jacket of the men the pretti colour dress of the women the excit dog the move boat the white sail the pleasant landscap and the sparkl water it is on of the gayest sight i know of near thi dull old london town the river afford a good opportun for dress for onc in a wai we men ar abl to show our tast in colour and i think we come out veri natti if you ask me i alwai like a littl red in my thing red and black you know my hair is a sort of golden brown rather a pretti shade i ve been told and a dark red match it beautifulli and then i alwai think a lightblu neckti goe so well with it and a pair of those russianleath shoe and a red silk handkerchief round the waist a handkerchief look so much better than a belt harri alwai keep to shade or mixtur of orang or yellow but i don t think he is at all wise in thi hi complexion is too dark for yellow yellow don t suit him there can be no question about it i want him to take to blue as a background with white or cream for relief but there the less tast a person ha in dress the more obstin he alwai seem to be it is a great piti becaus he will never be a success as it is while there ar on or two colour in which he might not realli look so bad with hi hat on georg ha bought some new thing for thi trip and i m rather vex about them the blazer is loud i should not like georg to know that i thought so but there realli is no other word for it he brought it home and show it to us on thursdai even we ask him what colour he call it and he said he didn t know he didn t think there wa a name for the colour the man had told him it wa an orient design georg put it on and ask us what we thought of it harri said that as an object to hang over a flowerb in earli spring to frighten the bird awai he should respect it but that consid as an articl of dress for ani human be except a margat nigger it made him ill georg got quit huffi but as harri said if he didn t want hi opinion why did he ask for it what troubl harri and myself with regard to it is that we ar afraid it will attract attent to the boat pictur young ladi girl also don t look half bad in a boat if prettili dress noth is more fetch to my think than a tast boat costum but a boat costum it would be as well if all ladi would understand ought to be a costum that can be worn in a boat and not mere under a glasscas it utterli spoil an excurs if you have folk in the boat who ar think all the time a good deal more of their dress than of the trip it wa my misfortun onc to go for a water picnic

wa hi duti to turn us off harri said that if it wa a duti it ought to be done and ask the man what wa hi idea with regard to the best mean for accomplish it harri is what you would call a wellmad man of about number on size and look hard and boni and the man measur him up and down and said he would go and consult hi master and then come back and chuck us both into the river of cours we never saw

instinct of justic to degener into mere vindict it wa a long while befor i could get harri to take a more christian view of the subject but i succeed at last and he promis me that he would spare the friend and relat at all event and would not sing comic song on the ruin you have never heard harri sing a comic song or you would understand the servic i had render to mankind it is on of harri s fix idea that he can sing a comic song the fix idea on the contrari among those of harri s friend who have heard him try is that he can t and never will be abl to and that he ought not to be allow to try when harri is at a parti and is ask to sing he repli well i can onli sing a comic song you know and he sai it in a tone that impli that hi sing of that howev is a thing that you ought to hear onc and

from all over the hous and crowd into the drawingroom and sit round all smirk in anticip then harri begin well you don t look for much of a voic in a comic song you don t expect correct phrase or vocal you don t mind if a man doe find out when in the middl of a note that he is too high and come down with a jerk you don t bother about time you don t mind a man be two bar in front of the accompani and eas up in the middl of a line to argu it out with the pianist and then start the vers afresh but you do expect the word you don t expect a man to never rememb more than the first three line of the first vers and to keep on repeat these until it is time to begin the choru you don t expect a man to break off in the middl of a line and snigger and sai it s veri funni but he s blest if he can think of the rest of it and then try and make it up for himself and afterward suddenli recollect it when he ha got to an entir differ part of the song and break off without a word of warn to go back and let you have it then and there you don t well i will just give you an idea of harri s comic sing and then you can judg of it for yourself pictur harri harri stand up in front of piano and

song after supper speak of comic song and parti remind me of a rather curiou incid at which i onc assist which as it throw much light upon the inner mental work of human natur in gener ought i think to be record in these page we were a fashion and highli cultur parti we had on our best cloth and we talk pretti and were veri happi all except two young fellow student just return from germani commonplac young men who seem restless and uncomfort as if thei found the proceed slow the truth wa we were too clever for them our brilliant but polish convers and our highclass tast were beyond them thei were out of place among us thei never ought to have been there at all everybodi agre upon that later on we plai morceaux from the old german master we discuss philosophi and ethic we flirt with grace digniti we were even humor in a highclass wai somebodi recit a french poem after supper and we said it wa beauti and then a ladi sang a sentiment ballad in spanish and it made on or two of us weep it wa so pathet and then those two young men got up and ask us if we had ever heard herr slossenn boschen who had just arriv and wa then down in the supperroom sing hi great german comic song none of us had heard it that we could rememb the young men said it wa the funniest song that had ever been written and that if we like thei would get herr slossenn boschen whom thei knew veri well to sing it thei said it wa so funni that when herr slossenn boschen had sung it onc befor the german emperor he the german emperor had had to be carri off to bed thei said nobodi could sing it like herr slossenn boschen he wa so intens seriou all through it that you might fanci he wa recit a tragedi and that of cours made it all the funnier thei said he never onc suggest by hi tone or manner that he wa sing anyth funni that would spoil it it wa hi air of serious almost of patho that made it so irresist amus we said we yearn to hear it that we want a good laugh and thei went downstair and fetch herr slossenn boschen he appear to be quit pleas to sing it for he came up at onc and sat down to the piano without anoth word oh it will amus you you will laugh whisper the two young men as thei pass through the room and took up an unobtrus posit behind the professor s back herr slossenn boschen accompani himself the prelud did not suggest a comic song exactli it wa a weird soul air it quit made on s flesh creep but we murmur to on anoth that it wa the german method and prepar to enjoi it i don t understand german myself i learn it at school but forgot everi word of it two year after i had left and have felt much better ever sinc still i did not want the peopl there to guess my ignor so i hit upon what i thought to be rather a good idea i kept my ey on the two young student and follow them when thei titter i titter when thei roar i roar and i also threw in a littl snigger all by myself now and then as if i had seen a bit of humour that had escap the other i consid thi particularli art on my part i notic as the song progress that a good mani other peopl seem to have their ey fix on the two young men as well as myself these other peopl also titter when the young men titter and roar when the young men roar and as the two young men titter and roar and explod with laughter pretti continu all through the song it went exceedingli well and yet that german professor did not seem happi at first when we began to laugh the express of hi face wa on of intens surpris as if laughter were the veri last thing he had expect to be greet with we thought thi veri funni we said hi earnest manner wa half the humour the slightest hint on hi part that he knew how funni he wa would have complet ruin it all as we continu to laugh hi surpris gave wai to an air of annoy and indign and he scowl fierc round upon us all except upon the two young men who be behind him he could not see that sent us into convuls we told each other that it would be the death of us thi thing the word alon we said were enough to send us into fit but ad to hi mock serious oh it wa too much in the last vers he surpass himself he glower round upon us with a look of such concentr feroc that but for our be forewarn as to the german method of comic sing we should have been nervou and he threw such a wail note of agoni into the weird music that if we had not known it wa a funni song we might have wept he finish amid a perfect shriek of laughter we said it wa the funniest thing we had ever heard in all our live we said how strang it wa that in the face of thing like these there should be a popular notion that the german hadn t ani sens of humour and we ask the professor why he didn t translat the song into english so that the common peopl could understand it and hear what a real comic song wa like then herr slossenn boschen got up and went on aw he swore at us in german which i should judg to be a singularli effect languag for that purpos and he danc and shook hi fist and call us all the english he knew he said he had never been so insult in all hi life it appear that the song wa not a comic song at all it wa about a young girl who live in the hartz mountain and who had given up her life to save her lover s soul and he di and met her spirit in the air and then in the last vers he jilt her spirit and went on with anoth spirit i m not quit sure of the detail but it wa someth veri sad i know herr boschen said he had sung it onc befor the german emperor and he the german emperor had sob like a littl child he herr boschen said it wa gener acknowledg to be on of the most tragic and pathet song in the german languag it wa a try situat for us veri try there seem to be no answer we look around for the two young men who had done thi thing but thei had left the hous in an unostentati manner immedi after the end of the song that wa the end of that parti i never saw a parti break up so quietli and with so littl fuss we never said goodnight even to on anoth we came downstair on at a time walk softli and keep the shadi side we ask the servant for our hat and coat in whisper and open the door for ourselv and slip out and got round the corner quickli avoid each other as much as possibl i have never taken much interest in german song sinc then we reach sunburi lock at halfpast three the river is sweetli pretti just there befor you come to the gate and the backwat is charm but don t attempt to row up it i tri to do so onc i wa scull and ask the fellow who were steer if thei thought it could be done and thei said oh ye thei thought so if i pull hard we were just under the littl footbridg that cross it between the two weir when thei said thi and i bent down over the scull and set myself up and pull i pull splendidli i got well into a steadi rhythmic swing i put my arm and my leg and my back into it i set myself a good quick dash stroke and work in realli grand style my two friend said it wa a pleasur to watch me at the end of five minut i thought we ought to be pretti near the weir and i look up we were under the bridg in exactli the same spot that we were when i began and there were those two idiot injur themselv by violent laugh i had been grind awai like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that bridg i let other peopl pull up backwat against strong stream now we scull up to walton a rather larg place for a riversid town as with all riversid place onli the tiniest corner of it come down to the water so that from the boat you might fanci it wa a villag of some halfdozen hous all told windsor and abingdon ar the onli town between london and oxford that you can realli see anyth of from the stream all the other hide round corner and mere peep at the river down on street my thank to them for be so consider and leav the riverbank to wood and field and waterwork even read though it doe it best to spoil and sulli and make hideou as much of the river as it can reach is goodnatur enough to keep it ugli face a good deal out of

go where you will cromwel and bradshaw not the guid man but the king charl s head man likewis sojourn here thei must have been quit a pleasant littl parti altogeth there is an iron scold s bridl in walton church thei us these thing in ancient dai for curb women s tongu thei have given up the attempt now i suppos iron wa get scarc and noth els would be strong enough there ar also tomb of note in the church and i wa afraid i should never get harri past them but he didn t seem to think of them and we went on abov the bridg the river wind tremend thi make it look picturesqu but it irrit you from a tow or scull point of view and caus argument between the man who is pull and the man who is steer you pass oatland park on the right bank here it is a famou old place henri viii stole it from some on or the other i forget whom now and live in it there is a grotto in the park which you can see for a fee and which is suppos to be veri wonder but i cannot see much in it myself the late duchess of york who live at oatland wa veri fond of dog and kept an immens number she had a special graveyard made in which to buri them when thei di and there thei lie about fifti of them with a tombston over each and an epitaph inscrib thereon well i dare sai thei deserv it quit as much as the averag christian doe at corwai stake the first bend abov walton bridg wa fought a battl between c sar and cassivelaunu cassivelaunu had prepar the river for c sar by plant it full of stake and had no doubt put up a noticeboard but c sar cross in spite of thi you couldn t choke c sar off that river he is the sort of man we want round the backwat now halliford and shepperton ar both pretti littl spot where thei touch the river but there is noth remark about either of them there is a tomb in shepperton churchyard howev with a poem on it and i wa nervou lest harri should want to get out and fool round it i saw him fix a long ey on the landingstag as we drew near it so i manag by an adroit movement to

towlin you roll it up with as much patienc and care as you would take to fold up a new pair of trouser and five minut afterward when you pick it up it is on ghastli soulrevolt tangl i do not wish to be insult but i firmli believ that if you took an averag towlin and stretch it out straight across the middl of a field and then turn your back on it for thirti second that when you look round again you would find that it had got itself altogeth in a heap in the middl of the field and had twist itself up and ti itself into knot and lost it two end and becom all loop and it would take you a good halfhour sit down there on the grass and swear all the while to disentangl it again that is my opinion of towlin in gener of cours there mai be honour except i do not sai that there ar not there mai be towlin that ar a credit to their profess conscienti respect towlin towlin that do not imagin thei ar crochetwork and try to knit themselv up into antimacassar the instant thei ar left to themselv i sai there mai be such towlin i sincer hope there ar but i have not met with them thi towlin i had taken in myself just befor we had got to the lock i would not let harri touch it becaus he is careless i had loop it round slowli and cautious and ti it up in the middl and fold it in two and laid it down gentli at the bottom of the boat harri had lift it up scientif and had put it into georg s hand georg had taken it firmli and held it awai from him and had begun to unravel it as if he were take the swaddl cloth off a newborn infant and befor he had unwound a dozen yard the thing wa more like a badlymad doormat than anyth els it is alwai the same and the same sort of thing alwai goe on in connect with it the man on the bank who is try to disentangl it think all the fault li with the man who roll it up and when a man up the river think a thing he sai it what have you been try to do with it make a fishingnet of it you ve made a nice mess you have why couldn t you wind it up properli you silli dummi he grunt from time to time as he struggl wildli with it and lai it out flat on the towpath and run round and round it try to find the end on the other hand the man who wound it up think the whole caus of the muddl rest with the man who is try to unwind it it wa all right when you took it he exclaim indignantli why don t you think what you ar do you go about thing in such a slapdash style you d get a scaffold pole entangl you would and thei feel so angri with on anoth that thei would like to hang each other with the thing ten minut go by and the first man give a yell and goe mad and danc on the rope and tri to pull it straight by seiz hold of the first piec that come to hi hand and haul at it of cours thi onli get it into a tighter tangl than ever then the second man climb out of the boat and come to help him and thei get in each other s wai and hinder on anoth thei both get hold of the same bit of line and pull at it in opposit direct and wonder where it is caught in the end thei do get it clear and then turn round and find that the boat ha drift off and is make straight for the weir thi realli happen onc to my own knowledg it wa up by bovenei on rather windi morn we were pull down stream and as we came round the bend we notic a coupl of men on the bank thei were look at each other with as bewild and helplessli miser express as i have ever wit on ani human counten befor or sinc and thei held a long towlin between them it wa clear that someth had happen so we eas up and ask them what wa the matter why our boat s gone off thei repli in an indign tone we just got out to disentangl the towlin and when we look round it wa gone and thei seem hurt at what thei evid regard as a mean and ungrat act on the part of the boat we found the truant for them half a mile further down held by some rush and we brought it back to them i bet thei did not give that boat anoth chanc for a week i shall never forget the pictur of those two men walk up and down the bank with a towlin look for their boat on see a good mani funni incid up the river in connect with tow on of the most common is the sight of a coupl of tower walk briskli along deep in an anim discuss while the man in the boat a hundr yard behind them is vainli shriek to them to stop and make frantic sign of distress with a scull someth ha gone wrong the rudder ha come off or the boathook ha slip overboard or hi hat ha drop into the water and is float rapidli down stream he call to them to stop quit gentli and polit at first pictur hat in the water hi stop a minut will you he shout cheerili i ve drop my hat overboard then hi tom dick can t you hear not quit so affabl thi time then hi confound you you dunderhead idiot hi stop oh you after that he spring up and danc about and roar himself red in the face and curs everyth he know and the small boi on the bank stop and jeer at him and pitch stone at him as he is pull along past them at the rate of four mile an hour and can t get out much of thi sort of troubl would be save if those who ar tow would keep rememb that thei ar tow and give a pretti frequent look round to see how their man is get on it is best to let on person tow when two ar do it thei get chatter and forget and the boat itself offer as it doe but littl resist is of no real servic in remind them of the fact as an exampl of how utterli oblivi a pair of tower can be to their work georg told us later on in the even when we were discuss the subject after supper of a veri curiou instanc pictur two peopl tow boat adrift he and three other men so he said were scull a veri heavili laden boat up from maidenhead on even and a littl abov cookham lock thei notic a fellow and a girl walk along the towpath both deep in an appar interest and absorb convers thei were carri a boathook between them and attach to the boathook wa a towlin which trail behind them it end in the water no boat wa near no boat wa in sight there must have been a boat attach to that towlin at some time or other that wa certain but what had becom of it what ghastli fate had overtaken it and those who had been left in it wa buri in mysteri whatev the accid mai have been howev it had in no wai disturb the young ladi and gentleman who were tow thei had the boathook and thei had the line and that seem to be all that thei thought necessari to their work georg wa about to call out and wake them up but at that moment a bright idea flash across him and he didn t he got the hitcher instead and reach over and drew in the end of the towlin and thei made a loop in it and put it over their mast and then thei tidi up the scull and went and sat down in the stern and lit their pipe and that young man and young woman tow those four hulk chap and a heavi boat up to marlow georg said he never saw so much thought sad concentr into on glanc befor as when at the lock that young coupl grasp the idea that for the last two mile thei had been tow the wrong boat georg fanci that if it had not been for the restrain influenc of the sweet woman at hi side the young man might have given wai to violent languag the maiden wa the first to recov from her surpris and when she did she clasp her hand and said wildli oh henri then where is aunti did thei ever recov the old ladi ask harri georg repli he did not know anoth exampl of the danger want of sympathi between tower and tow wa wit by georg and myself onc up near walton it wa where the towpath shelv gentli down into the water and we were camp on the opposit bank notic thing in gener byandbi a small boat came in sight tow through the water at a tremend pace by a power barg hors on which sat a veri small boi scatter about the boat in dreami and repos attitud lai five fellow the man who wa steer have a particularli rest appear i should like to see him pull the wrong line murmur georg as thei pass and at that precis moment the man did it and the boat rush up the bank with a nois like the rip up of forti thousand linen sheet two men a hamper and three oar immedi left the boat on the larboard side and reclin on the bank and on and a half moment afterward two other men disembark from the starboard and sat down among boathook and sail and carpetbag and bottl the last man went on twenti yard further and then got out on hi head thi seem to sort of lighten the boat and it went on much easier the small boi shout at the top of hi voic and urg hi steed into a gallop the fellow sat up and stare at on anoth it wa some second befor thei realis what had happen to them but when thei did thei began to shout lustili for the boi to stop he howev wa too much occupi with the hors to hear them and we watch them fly after him until the distanc hid them from view i cannot sai i wa sorri at their mishap inde i onli wish that all the young fool who have their boat tow in thi fashion and plenti do could meet with similar misfortun besid the risk thei run themselv thei becom a danger and an annoy to everi other boat thei pass go at the pace thei do it is imposs for them to get out of anybodi els s wai or for anybodi els to get out of their their line get hitch across your mast and overturn you or it catch somebodi in the boat and either throw them into the water or cut their face open the best plan is to stand your ground and be prepar to keep them off with the buttend of a mast of all experi in connect with tow the most excit is be tow by girl it is a sensat that nobodi ought to miss it take three girl to tow alwai two hold the rope and the other on run round and round and giggl thei gener begin by get themselv ti up thei get the line round their leg and have to sit down on the path and undo each other and then thei twist it round their neck and ar nearli strangl thei fix it straight howev at last and start off at a run pull the boat along at quit a danger pace at the end of a hundr yard thei ar natur breathless and suddenli stop and all sit down on the grass and laugh and your boat drift out to midstream and turn round befor you know what ha happen or can get hold of a scull then thei stand up and ar surpris oh look thei sai he s gone right out into the middl pictur ladi pin up frock thei pull on pretti steadili for a bit after thi and then it all at onc occur to on of them that she will pin up her frock and thei eas up for the purpos and the boat run aground you jump up and push it off and you shout to them not to stop ye what s the matter thei shout back don t stop you roar don t what don t stop go on go on go back emili and see what it is thei want sai on and emili come back and ask what it is what do you want she sai anyth happen no you repli it s all right onli go on you know don t stop why not why we can t steer if you keep stop you must keep some wai on the boat keep some what some wai you must keep the boat move oh all right i ll tell em ar we do it all right oh ye veri nice inde onli don t stop it doesn t seem difficult at all i thought it wa so hard oh no it s simpl enough you want to keep on steadi at it that s all i see give me out my red shawl it s under the cushion you find the shawl and hand it out and by thi time anoth on ha come back and think she will have her too and thei take mari s on chanc and mari doe not want it so thei bring it back and have a pocketcomb instead it is about twenti minut befor thei get off again and at the next corner thei see a cow and you have to leav the boat to chivi the cow out of their wai there is never a dull moment in the boat while girl ar tow it georg got the line right after a while and tow us steadili on to penton hook there we discuss the import question of camp we had decid to sleep on board that night and we had either to lai up just about there or go on past stain it seem earli to think about shut up then howev with the sun still in the heaven and we settl to push straight on for runnymead three and a half mile further a quiet wood part of the river and where there is good shelter we all wish howev afterward that we had stop at penton hook three or four mile up stream is a trifl earli in the morn but it is a weari pull at the end of a long dai you take no interest in the sceneri dure these last few mile you do not chat and laugh everi halfmil you cover seem like two you can hardli believ you ar onli where you ar and you ar convinc that the map must be wrong and when you have trudg along for what seem to you at least ten mile and still the lock is not in sight you begin to serious fear that somebodi must have sneak it and run off with it i rememb be terribl upset onc up the river in a figur sens i mean i wa out with a young ladi cousin on my mother s side and we were pull down to gore it wa rather late and we were anxiou to get in at least she wa anxiou to get in it wa halfpast six when we reach benson s lock and dusk wa draw on and she began to get excit then she said she must be in to supper i said it wa a thing i felt i want to be in at too and i drew out a map i had with me to see exactli how far it wa i saw it wa just a mile and a half to the next lock wallingford and five on from there to cleev oh it s all right i said we ll be through the next lock befor seven and then there is onli on more and i settl down and pull steadili awai we pass the bridg and soon after that i ask if she saw the lock she said no she did not see ani lock and i said oh and pull on anoth five minut went by and then i ask her to look again no she said i can t see ani sign of a lock you you ar sure you know a lock when you do see on i ask hesitatingli not wish to offend her the question did offend her howev and she suggest that i had better look for myself so i laid down the scull and took a view the river stretch out straight befor us in the twilight for about a mile not a ghost of a lock wa to be seen you don t think we have lost our wai do you ask my companion i did not see how that wa possibl though as i suggest we might have somehow got into the weir stream and be make for the fall thi idea did not comfort her in the least and she began to cry she said we should both be drown and that it wa a judgment on her for come out with me it seem an excess punish i thought but my cousin thought not and hope it would all soon be over i tri to reassur her and to make light of the whole affair i said that the fact evid wa that i wa not row as fast as i fanci i wa but that we should soon reach the lock now and i pull on for anoth mile then i began to get nervou myself i look again at the map there wa wallingford lock clearli mark a mile and a half below benson s it wa a good reliabl map and besid i recollect the lock myself i had been through it twice where were we what had happen to us i began to think it must be all a dream and that i wa realli asleep in bed and should wake up in a minut and be told it wa past ten i ask my cousin if she thought it could be a dream and she repli that she wa just about to ask me the same question and then we both wonder if we were both asleep and if so who wa the real on that wa dream and who wa the on that wa onli a dream it got quit interest i still went on pull howev and still no lock came in sight and the river grew more and more gloomi and mysteri under the gather shadow of night and thing seem to be get weird and uncanni i thought of hobgoblin and banshe and willo thewisp and those wick girl who sit up all night on rock and lure peopl into whirlpool and thing and i wish i had been a better man and knew more hymn and in the middl of these reflect i heard the bless strain of he s got em on plai badli on a concertina and knew that we were save i do not admir the tone of a concertina as a rule but oh how beauti the music seem to us both then far far more beauti than the voic of orpheu or the lute of apollo or anyth of that sort could have sound heavenli melodi in our then state of mind would onli have still further harrow us a soulmov harmoni correctli perform we should have taken as a spiritwarn and have given up all hope but about the strain of he s got em on jerk spasmod and with involuntari variat out of a wheezi accordion there wa someth singularli human and reassur the sweet sound drew nearer and soon the boat from which thei were work lai alongsid us it contain a parti of provinci arri and arriet out for a moonlight sail there wa not ani moon but that wa not their fault i never saw more attract lovabl peopl in all my life i hail them and ask if thei could tell me the wai to wallingford lock and i explain that i had been look for it for the last two hour wallingford lock thei answer lor love you sir that s been done awai with for over a year there ain t no wallingford lock now sir you re close to cleev now blow me tight if er ain t a gentleman been look for wallingford lock bill i had never thought of that i want to fall upon all their neck and bless them but the stream wa run too strong just there to allow of thi so i had to content myself with mere coldsound word of gratitud we thank them over and over again and we said it wa a love night and we wish them a pleasant trip and i think i invit them all to come and spend a week with me and my cousin said her mother would be so pleas to see them and we sang the soldier choru out of faust and got home in time for supper after all pictur peopl in row boat chapter x our first night under canva an appeal for help contrari of teakettl how to overcom supper how to feel virtuou want a comfortablyappoint welldrain desert island neighbourhood of south pacif ocean prefer funni thing that happen to georg s father a restless night harri and i began to think that bell weir lock must have been done awai with after the same manner georg had tow us up to stain and we had taken the boat from there and it seem that we were drag fifti ton after us and were walk forti mile it wa halfpast seven when we were through and we all got in and scull up close to the left bank look out for a spot to haul up in we had origin intend to go on to magna charta island a sweetli pretti part of the river where it wind through a soft green vallei and to camp in on of the mani picturesqu inlet to be found round that tini shore but somehow we did not feel that we yearn for the picturesqu nearli so much now as we had earlier in the dai a bit of water between a coalbarg and a gaswork would have quit satisfi us for that night we did not want sceneri we want to have our supper and go to bed howev we did pull up to the point picnic point it is call and drop into a veri pleasant nook under a great elmtre to the spread root of which we fasten the boat then we thought we were go to have supper we had dispens with tea so as to save time but georg said no that we had better get the canva up first befor it got quit dark and while we could see what we were do then he said all our work would be done and we could sit down to eat with an easi mind that canva want more put up than i think ani of us had bargain for it look so simpl in the abstract you took five iron arch like gigant croquet hoop and fit them up over the boat and then stretch the canva over them and fasten it down it would take quit ten minut we thought that wa an underestim we took up the hoop and began to drop them into the socket place for them you would not imagin thi to be danger work but look back now the wonder to me is that ani of us ar aliv to tell the tale thei were not hoop thei were demon first thei would not fit into their socket at all and we had to jump on them and kick them and hammer at them with the boathook and when thei were in it turn out that thei were the wrong hoop for those particular socket and thei had to come out again but thei would not come out until two of us had gone and struggl with them for five minut when thei would jump up suddenli and try and throw us into the water and drown us thei had hing in the middl and when we were not look thei nip us with these hing in delic part of the bodi and while we were wrestl with on side of the hoop and endeavour to persuad it to do it duti the other side would come behind us in a cowardli manner and hit us over the head we got them fix at last and then all that wa to be done wa to arrang the cover over them georg unrol it and fasten on end over the nose of the boat harri stood in the middl to take it from georg and roll it on to me and i kept by the stern to receiv it it wa a long time come down to me georg did hi part all right but it wa new work to harri and he bungl it how he manag it i do not know he could not explain himself but by some mysteri process or other he succeed after ten minut of superhuman effort in get himself complet roll up in it he wa so firmli wrap round and tuck in and fold over that he could not get out he of cours made frantic struggl for freedom the birthright of everi englishman and in do so i learn thi afterward knock over georg and then georg swear at harri began to struggl too and got himself entangl and roll up pictur watch and wait i knew noth about all thi at the time i did not understand the busi at all myself i had been told to stand where i wa and wait till the canva came to me and montmor and i stood there and wait both as good as gold we could see the canva be violent jerk and toss about pretti consider but we suppos thi wa part of the method and did not interfer we also heard much smother languag come from underneath it and we guess that thei were find the job rather troublesom and conclud that we would wait until thing had got a littl simpler befor we join in we wait some time but matter seem to get onli more and more involv until at last georg s head came wriggl out over the side of the boat and spoke up it said give us a hand here can t you you cuckoo stand there like a stuf mummi when you see we ar both be suffoc you dummi i never could withstand an appeal for help so i went and undid them not befor it wa time either for harri wa nearli black in the face it took us half an hour s hard labour after that befor it wa properli up and then we clear the deck and got out supper we put the kettl on to boil up in the nose of the boat and went down to the stern and pretend to take no notic of it but set to work to get the other thing out that is the onli wai to get a kettl to boil up the river if it see that you ar wait for it and ar anxiou it will never even sing you have to go awai and begin your meal as if you were not go to have ani tea at all you must not even look round at it then you will soon hear it sputter awai mad to be made into tea it is a good plan too if you ar in a great hurri to talk veri loudli to each other about how you don t need ani tea and ar not go to have ani you get near the kettl so that it can overhear you and then you shout out i don t want ani tea do you georg to which georg shout back oh no i don t like tea we ll have lemonad instead tea s so indigest upon which the kettl boil over and put the stove out we adopt thi harmless bit of trickeri and the result wa that by the time everyth els wa readi the tea wa wait then we lit the lantern and squat down to supper we want that supper for fiveandthirti minut not a sound wa heard throughout the length and breadth of that boat save the clank of cutleri and crockeri and the steadi grind of four set of molar at the end of fiveandthirti minut harri said ah and took hi left leg out from under him and put hi right on there instead five minut afterward georg said ah too and threw hi plate out on the bank and three minut later than that montmor gave the first sign of content he had exhibit sinc we had start and roll over on hi side and spread hi leg out and then i said ah and bent my head back and bump it against on of the hoop but i did not mind it i did not even swear how good on feel when on is full how satisfi with ourselv and with the world peopl who have tri it tell me that a clear conscienc make you veri happi and content but a full stomach doe the busi quit as well and is cheaper and more easili obtain on feel so forgiv and gener after a substanti and welldigest meal so noblemind so kindlyheart it is veri strang thi domin of our intellect by our digest organ we cannot work we cannot think unless our stomach will so it dictat to us our emot our passion after egg and bacon it sai work after beefsteak and porter it sai sleep after a cup of tea two spoons for each cup and don t let it stand more than three minut it sai to the brain now rise and show your strength be eloqu and deep and tender see with a clear ey into natur and into life spread your white wing of quiver thought and soar a godlik spirit over the whirl world beneath you up through long lane of flame star to the gate of etern after hot muffin it sai be dull and soulless like a beast of the field a brainless anim with listless ey unlit by ani rai of fanci or of hope or fear or love or life and after brandi taken in suffici quantiti it sai now come fool grin and tumbl that your fellowmen mai laugh drivel in folli and splutter in senseless sound and show what a helpless ninni is poor man whose wit and will ar drown like kitten side by side in half an inch of alcohol we ar but the veriest sorriest slave of our stomach reach not after moral and righteous my friend watch vigilantli your stomach and diet it with care and judgment then virtu and content will come and reign within your heart unsought by ani effort of your own and you will be a good citizen a love husband and a tender father a nobl piou man befor our supper harri and georg and i were quarrelsom and snappi and illtemp after our supper we sat and beam on on anoth and we beam upon the dog too we love each other we love everybodi harri in move about trod on georg s corn had thi happen befor supper georg would have express wish and desir concern harri s fate in thi world and the next that would have made a thought man shudder as it wa he said steadi old man ware wheat and harri instead of mere observ in hi most unpleas tone that a fellow could hardli help tread on some bit of georg s foot if he had to move about at all within ten yard of where georg wa sit suggest that georg never ought to come into an ordinari size boat with feet that length and advis him to hang them over the side as he would have done befor supper now said oh i m so sorri old chap i hope i haven t hurt you pictur smoke pipe and georg said not at all that it wa hi fault and harri said no it wa hi it wa quit pretti to hear them we lit our pipe and sat look out on the quiet night and talk georg said why could not we be alwai like thi awai from the world with it sin and temptat lead sober peac live and do good i said it wa the sort of thing i had often long for myself and we discuss the possibl of our go awai we four to some handi wellfit desert island and live there in the wood harri said that the danger about desert island as far as he had heard wa that thei were so damp but georg said no not if properli drain and then we got on to drain and that put georg in mind of a veri funni thing that happen to hi father onc he said hi father wa travel with anoth fellow through wale and on night thei stop at a littl inn where there were some other fellow and thei join the other fellow and spent the even with them thei had a veri jolli even and sat up late and by the time thei came to go to bed thei thi wa when georg s father wa a veri young man were slightli jolli too thei georg s father and georg s father s friend were to sleep in the same room but in differ bed thei took the candl and went up the candl lurch up against the wall when thei got into the room and went out and thei had to undress and grope into bed in the dark thi thei did but instead of get into separ bed as thei thought thei were do thei both climb into the same on without know it on get in with hi head at the top and the other crawl in from the opposit side of the compass and ly with hi feet on the pillow there wa silenc for a moment and then georg s father said joe what s the matter tom repli joe s voic from the other end of the bed why there s a man in my bed said georg s father here s hi feet on my pillow well it s an extraordinari thing tom answer the other but i m blest if there isn t a man in my bed too what ar you go to do ask georg s father well i m go to chuck him out repli joe so am i said georg s father valiantli there wa a brief struggl follow by two heavi bump on the floor and then a rather dole voic said i sai tom ye how have you got on well to tell you the truth my man s chuck me out so s mine i sai i don t think much of thi inn do you what wa the name of that inn said harri the pig and whistl said georg why ah no then it isn t the same repli harri what do you mean queri georg why it s so curiou murmur harri but precis that veri same thing happen to my father onc at a countri inn i ve often heard him tell the tale i thought it might have been the same inn we turn in at ten that night and i thought i should sleep well be tire but i didn t as a rule i undress and put my head on the pillow and then somebodi bang at the door and sai it is halfpast eight but tonight everyth seem against me the novelti of it all the hard of the boat the cramp posit i wa ly with my feet under on seat and my head on anoth the sound of the lap water round the boat and the wind among the branch kept me restless and disturb i did get to sleep for a few hour and then some part of the boat which seem to have grown up in the night for it certainli wa not there when we start and it had disappear by the morn kept dig into my spine i slept through it for a while dream that i had swallow a sovereign and that thei were cut a hole in my back with a gimlet so as to try and get it out i thought it veri unkind of them and i told them i would ow them the monei and thei should have it at the end of the month but thei would not hear of that and said it would be much better if thei had it then becaus otherwis the interest would accumul so i got quit cross with them after a bit and told them what i thought of them and then thei gave the gimlet such an excruci wrench that i woke up the boat seem stuffi and my head ach so i thought i would step out into the cool nightair i slip on what cloth i could find about some of my own and some of georg s and harri s and crept under the canva on to the bank it wa a gloriou night the moon had sunk and left the quiet earth alon with the star it seem as if in the silenc and the hush while we her children slept thei were talk with her their sister convers of mighti mysteri in voic too vast and deep for childish human ear to catch the sound thei aw us these strang star so cold so clear we ar as children whose small feet have strai into some dimlit templ of the god thei have been taught to worship but know not and stand where the echo dome span the long vista of the shadowi light glanc up half hope half afraid to see some aw vision hover there and yet it seem so full of comfort and of strength the night in it great presenc our small sorrow creep awai asham the dai ha been so full of fret and care and our heart have been so full of evil and of bitter thought and the world ha seem so hard and wrong to us then night like some great love mother gentli lai her hand upon our fever head and turn our littl tearstain face up to her and smile and though she doe not speak we know what she would sai and lai our hot flush cheek against her bosom and the pain is gone sometim our pain is veri deep and real and we stand befor her veri silent becaus there is no languag for our pain onli a moan night s heart is full of piti for us she cannot eas our ach she take our hand in her and the littl world grow veri small and veri far awai beneath us and born on her dark wing we pass for a moment into a mightier presenc than her own and in the wondrou light of that great presenc all human life li like a book befor us and we know that pain and sorrow ar but the angel of god onli those who have worn the crown of suffer can look upon that wondrou light and thei when thei return mai not speak of it or tell the mysteri thei know onc upon a time through a strang countri there rode some goodli knight and their path lai by a deep wood where tangl briar grew veri thick and strong and tore the flesh of them that lost their wai therein and the leav of the tree that grew in the wood were veri dark and thick so that no rai of light came through the branch to lighten the gloom and sad and as thei pass by that dark wood on knight of those that rode miss hi comrad wander far awai and return to them no more and thei sore griev rode on without him mourn him as on dead now when thei reach the fair castl toward which thei had been journei thei stai there mani dai and made merri and on night as thei sat in cheer eas around the log that burn in the great hall and drank a love measur there came the comrad thei had lost and greet them hi cloth were rag like a beggar s and mani sad wound were on hi sweet flesh but upon hi face there shone a great radianc of deep joi and thei question him ask him what had befallen him and he told them how in the dark wood he had lost hi wai and had wander mani dai and night till torn and bleed he had lain him down to die then when he wa nigh unto death lo through the savag gloom there came to him a state maiden and took him by the hand and led him on through deviou path unknown to ani man until upon the dark of the wood there dawn a light such as the light of dai wa unto but as a littl lamp unto the sun and in that wondrou light our wayworn knight saw as in a dream a vision and so gloriou so fair the vision seem that of hi bleed wound he thought no more but stood as on entranc whose joi is deep as is the sea whereof no man can tell the depth and the vision fade and the knight kneel upon the ground thank the good saint who into that sad wood had strai hi step so he had seen the vision that lai there hid and the name of the dark forest wa sorrow but of the vision that the good knight saw therein we mai not speak nor tell chapter xi how georg onc upon a time got up earli in the morn georg harri and montmor do not like the look of the cold water heroism and determin on the part of j georg and hi shirt stori with a moral harri as cook histor retrospect special insert for the us of school i woke at six the next morn and found georg awak too we both turn round and tri to go to sleep again but we could not had there been ani particular reason why we should not have gone to sleep again but have got up and dress then and there we should have drop off while we were look at our watch and have slept till ten as there wa no earthli necess for our get up under anoth two hour at the veri least and our get up at that time wa an utter absurd it wa onli in keep with the natur cussed of thing in gener that we should both feel that ly down for five minut more would be death to us georg said that the same kind of thing onli wors had happen to him some eighteen month ago when he wa lodg by himself in the hous of a certain mr gip he said hi watch went wrong on even and stop at a quarterpast eight he did not know thi at the time becaus for some reason or other he forgot to wind it up when he went to bed an unusu occurr with him and hung it up over hi pillow without ever look at the thing it wa in the winter when thi happen veri near the shortest dai and a week of fog into the bargain so the fact that it wa still veri dark when georg woke in the morn wa no guid to him as to the time he reach up and haul down hi watch it wa a quarterpast eight angel and minist of grace defend us exclaim georg and here have i got to be in the citi by nine why didn t somebodi call me oh thi is a shame and he flung the watch down and sprang out of bed and had a cold bath and wash himself and dress himself and shave himself in cold water becaus there wa not time to wait for the hot and then rush and had anoth look at the watch whether the shake it had receiv in be thrown down on the bed had start it or how it wa georg could not sai but certain it wa that from a quarterpast eight it had begun to go and now point to twenti minut to nine georg snatch it up and rush downstair in the sittingroom all wa dark and silent there wa no fire no breakfast georg said it wa a wick shame of mr g and he made up hi mind to tell her what he thought of her when he came home in the even then he dash on hi greatcoat and hat and seiz hi umbrella made for the front door the door wa not even unbolt georg anathemat mr g for a lazi old woman and thought it wa veri strang that peopl could not get up at a decent respect time unlock and unbolt the door and ran out he ran hard for a quarter of a mile and at the end of that distanc it began to be born in upon him as a strang and curiou thing that there were so few peopl about and that there were no shop open it wa certainli a veri dark and foggi morn but still it seem an unusu cours to stop all busi on that account he had to go to busi why should other peopl stop in bed mere becaus it wa dark and foggi at length he reach holborn not a shutter wa down not a bu wa about there were three men in sight on of whom wa a policeman a marketcart full of cabbag and a dilapid look cab georg pull out hi watch and look at it it wa five minut to nine he stood still and count hi puls he stoop down and felt hi leg then with hi watch still in hi hand he went up to the policeman and ask him if he knew what the time wa pictur georg and the policeman what s the time said the man ey georg up and down with evid suspicion why if you listen you will hear it strike georg listen and a neighbour clock immedi oblig but it s onli gone three said georg in an injur tone when it had finish well and how mani did you want it to go repli the constabl why nine said georg show hi watch do you know where you live said the guardian of public order sever georg thought and gave the address oh that s where it is is it repli the man well you take my advic and go there quietli and take that watch of your with you and don t let s have ani more of it and georg went home again muse as he walk along and let himself in at first when he got in he determin to undress and go to bed again but when he thought of the redress and rewash and the have of anoth bath he determin he would not but would sit up and go to sleep in the easychair but he could not get to sleep he never felt more wake in hi life so he lit the lamp and got out the chessboard and plai himself a game of chess but even that did not enliven him it seem slow somehow so he gave chess up and tri to read he did not seem abl to take ani sort of interest in read either so he put on hi coat again and went out for a walk it wa horribl lonesom and dismal and all the policemen he met regard him with undisguis suspicion and turn their lantern on him and follow him about and thi had such an effect upon him at last that he began to feel as if he realli had done someth and he got to slink down the bystreet and hide in dark doorwai when he heard the regul flipflop approach of cours thi conduct made the forc onli more distrust of him than ever and thei would come and rout him out and ask him what he wa do there and when he answer noth he had mere come out for a stroll it wa then four o clock in the morn thei look as though thei did not believ him and two plaincloth constabl came home with him to see if he realli did live where he had said he did thei saw him go in with hi kei and then thei took up a posit opposit and watch the hous he thought he would light the fire when he got insid and make himself some breakfast just to pass awai the time but he did not seem abl to handl anyth from a scuttl of coal to a teaspoon without drop it or fall over it and make such a nois that he wa in mortal fear that it would wake mr g up and that she would think it wa burglar and open the window and call polic and then these two detect would rush in and handcuff him and march him off to the policecourt he wa in a morbidli nervou state by thi time and he pictur the trial and hi try to explain the circumst to the juri and nobodi believ him and hi be sentenc to twenti year penal servitud and hi mother dy of a broken heart so he gave up try to get breakfast and wrap himself up in hi overcoat and sat in the easychair till mr g came down at halfpast seven he said he had never got up too earli sinc that morn it had been such a warn to him we had been sit huddl up in our rug while georg had been tell me thi true stori and on hi finish it i set to work to wake up harri with a scull the third prod did it and he turn over on the other side and said he would be down in a minut and that he would have hi laceup boot we soon let him know where he wa howev by the aid of the hitcher and he sat up suddenli send montmor who had been sleep the sleep of the just right on the middl of hi chest sprawl across the boat then we pull up the canva and all four of us poke our head out over the offsid and look down at the water and shiver the idea overnight had been that we should get up earli in the morn fling off our rug and shawl and throw back the canva spring into the river with a joyou shout and revel in a long delici swim somehow now the morn had come the notion seem less tempt the water look damp and chilli the wind felt cold well who s go to be first in said harri at last there wa no rush for preced georg settl the matter so far as he wa concern by retir into the boat and pull on hi sock montmor gave vent to an involuntari howl as if mere think of the thing had given him the horror and harri said it would be so difficult to get into the boat again and went back and sort out hi trouser i did not altogeth like to give in though i did not relish the plung there might be snag about or weed i thought i meant to compromis matter by go down to the edg and just throw the water over myself so i took a towel and crept out on the bank and worm my wai along on to the branch of a tree that dip down into the water pictur in the thame it wa bitterli cold the wind cut like a knife i thought i would not throw the water over myself after all i would go back into the boat and dress and i turn to do so and as i turn the silli branch gave wai and i and the towel went in togeth with a tremend splash and i wa out midstream with a gallon of thame water insid me befor i knew what had happen by jove old j s gone in i heard harri sai as i came blow to the surfac i didn t think he d have the pluck to

persuad them rather an amus thing happen while dress that morn i wa veri cold when i got back into the boat and in my hurri to get my shirt on i accident jerk it into the water it made me awfulli wild especi as georg burst out laugh i could not see anyth to laugh at and i told georg so and he onli laugh the more i never saw a man laugh so much i quit lost my temper with him at last and i point out to him what a drivel maniac of an imbecil idiot he wa but he onli roar the louder and then just as i wa land the shirt i notic that it wa not my shirt at all but georg s which i had mistaken for mine whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for the first time and i began to laugh and the more i look from georg s wet shirt to georg roar with laughter the more i wa amus and i laugh so much that i had to let the shirt fall back into the water again ar n t you you go to get it out said georg between hi shriek i could not answer him at all for a while i wa laugh so but at last between my peal i

you re do why the deuc don t you go and dress on the bank you re not fit to be in a boat you re not gimm the hitcher i tri to make him see the fun of the thing but he could not georg is veri dens at see a joke sometim harri propos that we should have scrambl egg for breakfast he said he would cook them it seem from hi account that he wa veri good at do scrambl egg he often did them at picnic and when out on yacht he wa quit famou for them peopl who had onc tast hi scrambl egg so we gather from hi convers never care for ani other food afterward but pine awai and di when thei could not get them it made our mouth water to hear him talk about the thing and we hand him out the stove and the fryingpan and all the egg that had not smash and gone over everyth in the hamper and beg him to begin he had some troubl in break the egg or rather not so much troubl in break them exactli as in get them into the fryingpan when broken and keep them off hi trouser and prevent them from run up hi sleev but he fix some halfadozen into the pan at last and then squat down by the side of the stove and chivi them about with a fork it seem harass work so far as georg and i could judg whenev he went near the pan he burn himself and then he would drop everyth and danc round the stove flick hi finger about and curs the thing inde everi time georg and i look round at him he wa sure to be perform thi feat we thought at first that it wa a necessari part of the culinari arrang we did not know what scrambl egg were and we fanci that it must be some red indian or sandwich island sort of dish that requir danc and incant for it proper cook montmor went and put hi nose over it onc and the fat splutter up and scald him and then he began danc and curs altogeth it wa on of the most interest and excit oper i have ever wit georg and i were both quit sorri when it wa over the result wa not altogeth the success that harri had anticip there seem so littl to show for the busi six egg had gone into the fryingpan and all that came out wa a teaspoon of burnt and unappet look mess harri said it wa the fault of the fryingpan and thought it would have gone better if we had had a fishkettl and a gasstov and we decid not to attempt the dish again until we had those aid to housekeep by us the sun had got more power by the time we had finish breakfast and the wind had drop and it wa as love a morn as on could desir littl wa in sight to remind us of the nineteenth centuri and as we look out upon the river in the morn sunlight we could almost fanci that the centuri between us and that evertobefam june

don t think i ever in my life befor or sinc felt i want mustard as badli as i felt i want it then i don t care for mustard as a rule and it is veri seldom that i take it at all but i would have given world for it then i don t know how mani world there mai be in the univers but anyon who had brought me a spoon of mustard at that precis moment could have had them all i grow reckless like that when i want a thing and can t get it harri said he would have given world for mustard too it would have been a good thing for anybodi who had come up to that spot with a can of mustard then he would have been set up in world for the rest of hi life but there i daresai both harri and i would have tri to back out of the bargain after we had got the mustard on make these extravag offer in moment of excit but of cours when on come to think of it on see how absurdli out of proport thei ar with the valu of the requir articl i heard a man go up a mountain in switzerland onc sai he would give world for a glass of beer and when he came to a littl shanti where thei kept it he kick up a most fear row becaus thei charg him five franc for a bottl of bass he said it wa a scandal imposit and he wrote to the time about it it cast a gloom over the boat there be no mustard we at our beef in silenc exist seem hollow and uninterest we thought of the happi dai of childhood and sigh we brighten up a bit howev over the appletart and when georg drew out a tin of pineappl from the bottom of the hamper and roll it into the middl of the boat we felt that life wa worth live after all we ar veri fond of pineappl all three of us we look at the pictur on the tin we thought of the juic we smile at on anoth and harri got a spoon readi then we look for the knife to open the tin with we turn out everyth in the hamper we turn out the bag we pull up the board at the bottom of the boat we took everyth out on to the bank and shook it there wa no tinopen to be found then harri tri to open the tin with a pocketknif and broke the knife and cut himself badli and georg tri a pair of scissor and the scissor flew up and nearli put hi ey out while thei were dress their wound i tri to make a hole in the thing with the spiki end of the hitcher and the hitcher slip and jerk me out between the boat and the bank into two feet of muddi water and the tin roll over uninjur and broke a teacup then we all got mad we took that tin out on the bank and harri went up into a field and got a big sharp stone and i went back into the boat and brought out the mast and georg held the tin and harri held the sharp end of hi stone against the top of it and i took the mast and pois it high up in the air and gather up all my strength and brought it down it wa georg s straw hat that save hi life that dai he keep that hat now what is left of it and of a winter s even when the pipe ar lit and the boi ar tell stretcher about the danger thei have pass through georg bring it down and show it round and the stir tale is told anew with fresh exagger everi time harri got off with mere a flesh wound after that i took the tin off myself and hammer at it with the mast till i wa worn out and sick at heart whereupon harri took it in hand pictur flatten tin we beat it out flat we beat it back squar we batter it into everi form known to geometri but we could not make a hole in it then georg went at it and knock it into a shape so strang so weird so unearthli in it wild hideous that he got frighten and threw awai the mast then we all three sat round it on the grass and look at it there wa on great dent across the top that had the appear of a mock grin and it drove us furiou so that harri rush at the thing and caught it up and flung it far into the middl of the river and as it sank we hurl our curs at it and we got into the boat and row awai from the spot and never paus till we reach maidenhead maidenhead itself is too snobbi to be pleasant it is the haunt of the river swell and hi overdress femal companion it

had tea and when we were through the lock it wa even a stiffish breez had sprung up in our favour for a wonder for as a rule on the river the wind is alwai dead against you whatev wai you go it is against you in the morn when you start for a dai s trip and you pull a long distanc think how easi it will be to come back with the sail then after tea the wind veer round and you have to pull hard in

upward thi even howev thei had evid made a mistak and had put the wind round at our back instead of in our face we kept veri quiet about it and got the sail up quickli befor thei found it out and then we spread ourselv about the boat in thought attitud and the sail belli out and strain and grumbl at the mast and the boat flew i steer there is no more thrill sensat i know of than sail it come as

night we seem like knight of some old legend sail across some mystic lake into the unknown realm of twilight unto the great land of the sunset we did not go into the realm of twilight we went slap into that punt where those three old men were fish we did not know what had happen at first becaus the sail shut out the view but from the natur of the languag that rose up upon the even air we gather that we had come into the neighbourhood of human be and that thei were vex and discont harri let the sail down and then we saw what had happen we had knock those three old gentlemen off their chair into a gener heap at the bottom of the boat and thei were now slowli and painfulli sort themselv out from each other and pick fish off themselv and as thei work thei curs us not with a common cursori

or chat genial to some old lockkeep as he pass through until well the other side of henlei it is somewhat bare and dull we got up toler earli on the mondai morn at marlow and went for a bath befor breakfast and come back montmor made an aw ass of himself the onli subject on which montmor and i have ani seriou differ of opinion is cat i like cat montmor doe not pictur cat when i meet a cat i sai poor pussi and stop down and tickl the side of it head and the cat stick up it tail in a rigid castiron manner arch it back and wipe it nose up against my trouser and all is gentl and peac when montmor meet a cat the whole street know about it and there is enough bad languag wast in ten second to last an ordinarili respect man all hi life with care i do not blame the dog content myself as a rule with mere clout hi head or throw stone at him becaus i take it that it is hi natur foxterri ar born with about four time as much origin sin in them as other dog ar and it will take year and year of patient effort on the part of us christian to bring about ani appreci reform in the rowdi of the foxterri natur i rememb be in the lobbi of the haymarket store on dai and all round about me were dog wait for the return of their owner who were shop insid there were a mastiff and on or two colli and a st bernard a few retriev and newfoundland a boarhound a french poodl with plenti of hair round it head but mangi about the middl a bulldog a few lowther arcad sort of anim about the size of rat and a coupl of yorkshir tyke there thei sat patient good and thought a solemn peac seem to reign in that lobbi an air of calm and resign of gentl sad pervad the room then a sweet young ladi enter lead a meeklook littl foxterri and left him chain up there between the bulldog and the poodl he sat and look about him for a minut then he cast up hi ey to the ceil and seem judg from hi express to be think of hi mother then he yawn then he look round at the other dog all silent grave and dignifi he look at the bulldog sleep dreamlessli on hi right he look at the poodl erect and haughti on hi left then without a word of warn without the shadow of a provoc he bit that poodl s near foreleg and a yelp of agoni rang through the quiet shade of that lobbi the result of hi first experi seem highli satisfactori to him and he determin to go on and make thing live all round he sprang over the poodl and vigor attack a colli and the colli woke up and immedi commenc a fierc and noisi contest with the poodl then foxei came back to hi own place and caught the bulldog by the ear and tri to throw him awai and the bulldog a curious imparti anim went for everyth he could reach includ the hallport which gave that dear littl terrier the opportun to enjoi an uninterrupt fight of hi own with an equal will yorkshir tyke anyon who know canin natur need hardli be told that by thi time all the other dog in the place were fight as if their hearth and home depend on the frai the big dog fought each other indiscrimin and the littl dog fought among themselv and fill up their spare time by bite the leg of the big dog the whole lobbi wa a perfect pandemonium and the din wa terrif a crowd assembl outsid in the haymarket and ask if it wa a vestri meet or if not who wa be murder and why men came with pole and rope and tri to separ the dog and the polic were sent for and in the midst of the riot that sweet young ladi return and snatch up that sweet littl dog of her he had laid the tyke up for a month and had on the express now of a newborn lamb into her arm and kiss him and ask him if he wa kill and what those great nasti brute of dog had been do to him and he nestl up against her and gaze up into her face with a look that seem to sai oh i m so glad you ve come to take me awai from thi disgrac scene she said that the peopl at the store had no right to allow great savag thing like those other dog to be put with respect peopl s dog and that she had a great mind to summon somebodi such is the natur of foxterri and therefor i do not blame montmor for hi tendenc to row with cat but he wish he had not given wai to it that morn we were as i have said return from a dip and halfwai up the high street a cat dart out from on of the hous in front of us and began to trot across the road montmor gave a cry of joi the cry of a stern warrior who see hi enemi given over to hi hand the sort of cry cromwel might have utter when the scot came down the hill and flew after hi prei hi victim wa a larg black tom i never saw a larger cat nor a more disreputablelook cat it had lost half it tail on of it ear and a fairli appreci proport of it nose it wa a long sinewylook anim it had a calm content air about it montmor went for that poor cat at the rate of twenti mile an hour but the cat did not hurri up did not seem to have grasp the idea that it life wa in danger it trot quietli on until it wouldb assassin wa within a yard of it and then it turn round and sat down in the middl of the road and look at montmor with a gentl inquir express that said ye you want me montmor doe not lack pluck but there wa someth about the look of that cat that might have chill the heart of the boldest dog he stop abruptli and look back at tom neither spoke but the convers that on could imagin wa clearli as follow the cat can i do anyth for you montmor no no thank the cat don t you mind speak if you realli want anyth you know montmor back down the high street oh no not at all certainli don t you troubl i i am afraid i ve made a mistak i thought i knew you sorri i disturb you the cat not at all quit a pleasur sure you don t want anyth now montmor still back not at all thank not at all veri kind of you good morn the cat goodmorn then the cat rose and continu hi trot and montmor fit what he call hi tail carefulli into it groov came back to us and took up an unimport posit in the rear to thi dai if you sai the word cat to montmor he will visibl shrink and look up piteous at you as if to sai pleas don t we did our market after breakfast and revictual the boat for three dai georg said we ought to take veget that it wa unhealthi not to eat veget he said thei were easi enough to cook and that he would see to that so we got ten pound of potato a bushel of pea and a few cabbag we got a beefsteak pie a coupl of gooseberri tart and a leg of mutton from the hotel and fruit and cake and bread and butter and jam and bacon and egg and other thing we forag round about the town for our departur from marlow i regard as on of our greatest success it wa dignifi and impress without be ostentati we had insist at all the shop we had been to that the thing should be sent with us then and there none of your ye sir i will send them off at onc the boi will be down there befor you ar sir and then fool about on the landingstag and go back to the shop twice to have a row about them for us we wait while the basket wa pack and took the boi with us we went to a good mani shop adopt thi principl at each on and the consequ wa that by the time we had finish we had as fine a collect of boi with basket follow us around as heart could desir and our final march down the middl of the high street to the river must have been as impos a spectacl as marlow had seen for mani a long dai the order of the process wa as follow montmor carri a stick two disreputablelook cur friend of montmor s georg carri

with steam launch that morn it wa just befor the henlei week and thei were go up in larg number some by themselv some tow houseboat i do hate steam launch i suppos everi row man doe i never see a steam launch but i feel i should like to lure it to a lone part of the river and there in the silenc and the solitud strangl it there is a blatant bumptious about a steam launch that ha the knack of rous everi evil instinct in my natur and i yearn for the good old dai when you could go about and tell peopl what you thought of them with a hatchet and a bow and arrow the express on the face of the man who with hi hand in hi pocket stand by the stern smoke a cigar is suffici to excus a breach of the peac by itself and the lordli whistl for you to get out of the wai would i am confid ensur a verdict of justifi homicid from ani juri of river men thei us to have to whistl for us to get out of their wai if i mai do so without appear boast i think i can honestli sai that our on small boat dure that week caus more annoy and delai and aggrav to the steam launch that we came across than all the other craft on the river put togeth steam launch come on of us would cry out on sight the enemi in the distanc and in an instant everyth wa got readi to receiv her i would take the line and harri and georg would sit down besid me all of us with our back to the launch and the boat would drift out quietli into midstream on would come the launch whistl and on we would go drift at about a hundr yard off she would start whistl like mad and the peopl would come and lean over the side and roar at us but we never heard them harri would be tell us an anecdot about hi mother and georg and i would not have miss a word of it for world then that launch would give on final shriek of a whistl that would nearli burst the boiler and she would revers her engin and blow off steam and swing round and get aground everyon on board of it would rush to the bow and yell at us and the peopl on the bank would stand and shout to us and all the other pass boat would stop and join in till the whole river for mile up and down wa in a state of frantic commot and then harri would break off in the most interest part of hi narr and look up with mild surpris and sai to georg why georg bless me if here isn t a steam launch and georg would answer well do you know i thought i heard someth upon which we would get nervou and confus and not know how to get the boat out of the wai and the peopl in the launch would crowd round and instruct us pull your right you you idiot back with your left no not you the other on leav the line alon can t you now both togeth not that wai oh you then thei would lower a boat and come to our assist and after quarter of an hour s effort would get us clean out of their wai so that thei could go on and we would thank them so much and ask them to give us a tow but thei never would anoth good wai we discov of irrit the aristocrat type of steam launch wa to mistak them for a beanfeast and ask them if thei were messr cubit s lot or the bermondsei good templar and could thei lend us a saucepan old ladi not accustom to the river ar alwai intens nervou of steam launch i rememb go up onc from stain to windsor a stretch of water peculiarli rich in these mechan monstros with a parti contain three ladi of thi descript it wa veri excit at the first glimps of everi steam launch that came in view thei insist on land and sit down on the bank until it wa out of sight again thei said thei were veri sorri but that thei ow it to their famili not to be foolhardi we found ourselv short of water at hambledon lock so we took our jar and went up to the lockkeep s hous to beg for some georg wa our spokesman he put on a win smile and said oh pleas could you spare us a littl water certainli repli the old gentleman take as much as you want and leav the rest thank you so much murmur georg look about him where where do you keep it it s alwai in the same place my boi wa the stolid repli just behind you i don t see it said georg turn round why bless us where s your ey wa the man s comment as he twist georg round and point up and down the stream there s enough of it to see ain t there oh exclaim georg grasp the idea but we can t drink the river you know no but you can drink some of it repli the old fellow it s what i ve drunk for the last fifteen year georg told him that hi appear after the cours did not seem a suffici good advertis for the brand and that he would prefer it out of a pump we got some from a cottag a littl higher up i daresai that wa onli river water if we had known but we did not know so it wa all right what the ey doe not see the stomach doe not get upset over we tri river water onc later on in the season but it wa not a success we were come down stream and had pull up to have tea in a backwat near windsor our jar wa empti and it wa a case of go without our tea or take water from the river harri wa for chanc it he said it must be all right if we boil the water he said that the variou germ of poison present in the water would be kill by the boil so we fill our kettl with thame backwat and boil it and veri care we were to see that it did boil we had made the tea and were just settl down comfort to drink it when georg with hi cup halfwai to hi lip paus and exclaim what s that what s what ask harri and i why that said georg look westward pictur the dog harri and i follow hi gaze and saw come down toward us on the sluggish current a dog it wa on of the quietest and peacefullest dog i have ever seen i never met a dog who seem more content more easi in it mind it wa float dreamili on it back with it four leg stuck up straight into the air it wa what i should call a fullbodi dog with a welldevelop chest on he came seren dignifi and calm until he wa abreast of our boat and there among the rush he eas up and settl down cosili for the even georg said he didn t want ani tea and empti hi cup into the water harri did not feel thirsti either and follow suit i had drunk half mine but i wish i had not i ask georg if he thought i wa like to have typhoid he said oh no he thought i had a veri good chanc inde of escap it anyhow i should know in about a fortnight whether i had or had not we went up the backwat to wargrav it is a short cut lead out of the righthand bank about half a mile abov marsh lock and is well worth take be a pretti shadi littl piec of stream besid save nearli half a mile of distanc of cours it entranc is stud with post and chain and surround with notic board menac all kind of tortur imprison and death to everyon who dare set scull upon it water i wonder some of these riparian boor don t claim the air of the river and threaten everyon with forti shill fine who breath it but the post and chain a littl skill will easili avoid and as for the board you might if you have five minut to spare and there is nobodi about take on or two of them down and throw them into the river halfwai up the backwat we got out and lunch and it wa dure thi lunch that georg and i receiv rather a try shock harri receiv a shock too but i do not think harri s shock could have been anyth like so bad as the shock that georg and i had over the busi you see it wa in thi wai we were sit in a meadow about ten yard from the water s edg and we had just settl down comfort to feed harri had the beefsteak pie between hi knee and wa carv it and georg and i were wait with our plate readi have you got a spoon there sai harri i want a spoon to help the gravi with the hamper wa close behind us and georg and i both turn round to reach on out we were not five second get it when we look round again harri and the pie were gone it wa a wide open field there wa not a tree or a bit of hedg for hundr of yard he could not have tumbl into the river becaus we were on the water side of him and he would have had to climb over us to do it georg and i gaze all about then we gaze at each other ha he been snatch up to heaven i queri thei d hardli have taken the pie too said georg there seem weight in thi object and we discard the heavenli theori i suppos the truth of the matter is suggest georg descend to the commonplac and practic that there ha been an earthquak and then he ad with a touch of sad in hi voic i wish he hadn t been carv that pie with a sigh we turn our ey onc more toward the spot where harri and the pie had last been seen on earth and there as our blood froze in our vein and our hair stood up on end we saw harri s head and noth but hi head stick bolt upright among the tall grass the face veri red and bear upon it an express of great indign georg wa the first to recov speak he cri and tell us whether you ar aliv or dead and where is the rest of you oh don t be a stupid

brick and mortar everi hous is smother in rose and now in earli june thei were burst forth in cloud of dainti splendour if you stop at son put up at the bull behind the church it is a verit pictur of an old countri inn with green squar courtyard in front where on seat beneath the tree the old men group of an even to drink their al and gossip over villag polit with low quaint room and lattic window and awkward stair and wind passag we roam about sweet son for an hour or so and then it be too late to push on past read we decid to go back to on of the shiplak island and put up there for the night it wa still earli when we got settl and georg said that as we had plenti of time it would be a splendid opportun to try a good slapup supper he said he would show us what could be done up the river in the wai of cook and suggest that with the veget and the remain of the cold beef and gener odd and end we should make an irish stew it seem a fascin idea georg gather wood and made a fire and harri and i start to peel the potato i should never have thought that peel potato wa such an undertak the job turn out to be the biggest thing of it kind that i had ever been in we began cheerfulli on might almost sai skittishli but our lighthearted wa gone by the time the first potato wa finish the more we peel the more peel there seem to be left on by the time we had got all the peel off and all the ey out there wa no potato left at least none worth speak of georg came and had a look at it it wa about the size of a peanut he said oh that won t do you re wast them you must scrape them so we scrape them and that wa harder work than peel thei ar such an extraordinari shape potato all bump and wart and hollow we work steadili for fiveandtwenti minut and did four potato then we struck we said we should requir the rest of the even for scrape ourselv i never saw such a thing as potatoscrap for make a fellow in a mess it seem difficult to believ that the potatoscrap in which harri and i stood half smother could have come off four potato it show you what can be done with economi and care georg said it wa absurd to have onli four potato in an irish stew so we wash halfadozen or so more and put them in without peel we also put in a cabbag and about half a peck of pea georg stir it all up and then he said that there seem to be a lot of room to spare so we overhaul both the hamper and pick out all the odd and end and the remnant and ad them to the stew there were half a pork pie and a bit of cold boil bacon left and we put them in then georg found half a tin of pot salmon and he empti that into the pot he said that wa the advantag of irish stew you got rid of such a lot of thing i fish out a coupl of egg that had got crack and put those in georg said thei would thicken the gravi i forget the other ingredi but i know noth wa wast and i rememb that toward the end montmor who had evinc great interest in the proceed throughout stroll awai with an earnest and thought air reappear a few minut afterward with a dead waterrat in hi mouth which he evid wish to present as hi contribut to the dinner whether in a sarcast spirit or with a genuin desir to assist i cannot sai we had a discuss as to whether the rat should go in or not harri said that he thought it would be all right mix up with the other thing and that everi littl help but georg stood up for preced he said he had never heard of waterrat in irish stew and he would rather be on the safe side and not try experi harri said if you never try a new thing how can you tell what it s like it s men such as you that hamper the world s progress think of the man who first tri german sausag it wa a great success that irish stew i don t think i ever enjoi a meal more there wa someth so fresh and piquant about it on s palat get so tire of the old hacknei thing here wa a dish with a new flavour with a tast like noth els on earth and it wa nourish too as georg said there wa good stuff in it the pea and potato might have been a bit softer but we all had good teeth so that did not matter much and as for the gravi it wa a poem a littl too rich perhap for a weak stomach but nutriti we finish up with tea and cherri tart montmor had a fight with the kettl dure teatim and came off a poor second throughout the trip he had manifest great curios concern the kettl he would sit and watch it as it boil with a puzzl express and would try and rous it everi now and then by growl at it when it began to splutter and steam he regard it as a challeng and would want to fight it onli at that precis moment some on would alwai dash up and bear off hi prei befor he could get at it todai he determin he would be beforehand at the first sound the kettl made he rose growl and advanc toward it in a threaten attitud it wa onli a littl kettl but it wa full of pluck and it up and spit at him pictur montmor and the kettl ah would ye growl montmor show hi teeth i ll teach ye to cheek a hardwork respect dog ye miser longnos dirtylook scoundrel ye come on and he rush at that poor littl kettl and seiz it by the spout then across the even still broke a bloodcurdl yelp and montmor left the boat and did a constitut three time round the island at the rate of thirtyf mile an hour stop everi now and then to buri hi nose in a bit of cool mud from that dai montmor regard the kettl with a mixtur of aw suspicion and hate whenev he saw it he would growl and back at a rapid rate with hi tail shut down and the moment it wa put upon the stove he would promptli climb out of the boat and sit on the bank till the whole tea busi wa over georg got out hi banjo after supper and want to plai it but harri object he said he had got a headach and did not feel strong enough to stand it georg thought the music might do him good said music often sooth the nerv and took awai a headach and he twang two or three note just to show harri what it wa like harri said he would rather have the headach georg ha never learn to plai the banjo to thi dai he ha had too much allround discourag to meet he tri on two or three even while we were up the river to get a littl practic but it wa never a success harri s languag us to be enough to unnerv ani man ad to which montmor would sit and howl steadili right through the perform it wa not give the man a fair chanc what s he want to howl like that for when i m plai georg would exclaim indignantli while take aim at him with a boot what do you want to plai like that for when he is howl harri would retort catch the boot you let him alon he can t help howl he s got a music ear and your plai make him howl so georg determin to postpon studi of the banjo until he reach home but he did not get much opportun even there mr p us to come up and sai she wa veri sorri for herself she like to hear him but the ladi upstair wa in a veri delic state and the doctor wa afraid it might injur the child then georg tri take it out with him late at night and practis round the squar but the inhabit complain to the polic about it and a watch wa set for him on night and he wa captur the evid against him wa veri clear and he wa bound over to keep the peac for six month he seem to lose heart in the busi after that he did make on or two feebl effort to take up the work again when the six month had elaps but there wa alwai the same cold the same want of sympathi on the part of the world to fight against and after awhil he despair altogeth and advertis the instrument for sale at a great sacrific owner have no further us for same and took to learn card trick instead it must be dishearten work learn a music instrument you would think that societi for it own sake would do all it could to assist a man to acquir the art of plai a music instrument but it doesn t i knew a young fellow onc who wa studi to plai the bagpip and you would be surpris at the amount of opposit he had to contend with why not even from the member of hi own famili did he receiv what you could call activ encourag hi father wa dead against the busi from the begin and spoke quit unfeelingli on the subject my friend us to get up earli in the morn to practis but he had to give that plan up becaus of hi sister she wa somewhat religi inclin and she said it seem such an aw thing to begin the dai like that so he sat up at night instead and plai after the famili had gone to bed but that did not do as it got the hous such a bad name peopl go home late would stop outsid to listen and then put it about all over the town the next morn that a fear murder had been commit at mr jefferson s the night befor and would describ how thei had heard the victim s shriek and the brutal oath and curs of the murder follow by the prayer for merci and the last dy gurgl of the corps so thei let him practis in the daytim in the backkitchen with all the door shut but hi more success passag could gener be heard in the sittingroom in spite of these precaut and would affect hi mother almost to tear she said it put her in mind of her poor father he had been swallow by a shark poor man while bath off the coast of new guinea where the connect came in she could not explain then thei knock up a littl place for him at the bottom of the garden about quarter of a mile from the hous and made him take the machin down there when he want to work it and sometim a visitor would come to the hous who knew noth of the matter and thei would forget to tell him all about it and caution him and he would go out for a stroll round the garden and suddenli get within earshot of those bagpip without be prepar for it or know what it wa if he were a man of strong mind it onli gave him fit but a person of mere averag intellect it usual sent mad there is it must be confess someth veri sad about the earli effort of an amateur in bagpip i have felt that myself when listen to my young friend thei appear to be a try instrument to perform upon you have to get enough breath for the whole tune befor you start at least so i gather from watch jefferson he would begin magnific with a wild full cometothebattl sort of a note that quit rous you but he would get more and more piano as he went on and the last vers gener collaps in the middl with a splutter and a hiss you want to be in good health to plai the bagpip young jefferson onli learnt to plai on tune on those bagpip but i never heard ani complaint about the insuffici of hi repertoir none whatev thi tune wa the campbel ar come hoorai hoorai so he said though hi father alwai held that it wa the blue bell of scotland nobodi seem quit sure what it wa exactli but thei all agre that it sound scotch stranger were allow three guess and most of them guess a differ tune each time harri wa disagre after supper i think it must have been the stew that had upset him he is not us to high live so georg and i left him in the boat and settl to go for a mouch round henlei he said he should have a glass of whiski and a pipe and fix thing up for the night we were to shout when we return and he would row over from the island and fetch us don t go to sleep old man we said as we start not much fear of that while thi stew s on he grunt as he pull back to the island henlei wa get readi for the regatta and wa full of bustl we met a goodish number of men we knew about the town and in their pleasant compani the time slip by somewhat quickli so that it wa nearli eleven o clock befor we set off on our fourmil walk home as we had learn to call our littl craft by thi time it wa a dismal night coldish with a thin rain fall and as we trudg through the dark silent field talk low to each other and wonder if we were go right or not we thought of the cosi boat with the bright light stream through the tightdrawn canva of harri and montmor and the whiski and wish that we were there we conjur up the pictur of ourselv insid tire and a littl hungri of the gloomi river and the shapeless tree and like a giant glowworm underneath them our dear old boat so snug and warm and cheer we could see ourselv at supper there peck awai at cold meat and pass each other chunk of bread we could hear the cheeri clatter of our knive the laugh voic fill all the space and overflow through the open out into the night and we hurri on to realis the vision we struck the towpath at length and that made us happi becaus prior to thi we had not been sure whether we were walk toward the river or awai from it and when you ar tire and want to go to bed uncertainti like that worri you we pass skiplak as the clock wa strike the quarter to twelv and then georg said thoughtfulli you don t happen to rememb which of the island it wa do you no i repli begin to grow thought too i don t how mani ar there onli four answer georg it will be all right if he s awak and if not i queri but we dismiss that train of thought we shout when we came opposit the first island but there wa no respons so we went to the second and tri there and obtain the same result oh i rememb now said georg it wa the third on and we ran on hopefulli to the third on and halloo no answer the case wa becom seriou it wa now past midnight the hotel at skiplak and henlei would be cram and we could not go round knock up cottag and household in the middl of the night to know if thei let apart georg suggest walk back to henlei and assault a policeman and so get a night s lodg in the stationhous but then there wa the thought suppos he onli hit us back and refus to lock us up we could not pass the whole night fight policemen besid we did not want to overdo the thing and get six month we despairingli tri what seem in the dark to be the fourth island but met with no better success the rain wa come down fast now and evid meant to last we were wet to the skin and cold and miser we began to wonder whether there were onli four island or more or whether we were near the island at all or whether we were anywher within a mile of where we ought to be or in the wrong part of the river altogeth everyth look so strang and differ in the dark we began to understand the suffer of the babe in the wood just when we had given up all hope ye i know that is alwai the time that thing do happen in novel and tale but i can t help it i resolv when i began to write thi book that i would be strictli truth in all thing and so i will be even if i have to emploi hacknei phrase for the purpos it wa just when we had given up all hope and i must therefor sai so just when we had given up all hope then i suddenli caught sight a littl wai below us of a strang weird sort of glimmer flicker among the tree on the opposit bank for an instant i thought of ghost it wa such a shadowi mysteri light the next moment it flash across me that it wa our boat and i sent up such a yell across the water that made the night seem to shake in it bed we wait breathless for a minut and then oh divinest music of the dark we heard the answer bark of montmor we shout back loud enough to wake the seven sleeper i never could understand myself why it should take more nois to wake seven sleeper than on and after what seem an hour but what wa realli i suppos about five minut we saw the light boat creep slowli over the black and heard harri s sleepi voic ask where we were there wa an unaccount strang about harri it wa someth more than mere ordinari tired he pull the boat against a part of the bank from which it wa quit imposs for us to get into it and immedi went to sleep it took us an immens amount of scream and roar to wake him up again and put some sens into him but we succeed at last and got safe on board harri had a sad express on him so we notic when we got into the boat he gave you the idea of a man who had been through troubl we ask him if anyth had happen and he said pictur swan swan it seem we had moor close to a swan s nest and soon after georg and i had gone the femal swan came back and kick up a row about it harri had chivi her off and she had gone awai and fetch up her old man harri said he had had quit a fight with these two swan but courag and skill had prevail in the end and he had defeat them halfanhour afterward thei return with eighteen other swan it must have been a fear battl so far as we could understand harri s account of it the swan had tri to drag him and montmor out of the boat and drown them and he had defend himself like a hero for four hour and had kill the lot and thei had all paddl awai to die how mani swan did you sai there were ask georg thirtytwo repli harri sleepili you said eighteen just now said georg no i didn t grunt harri i said twelv think i can t count what were the real fact about these swan we never found out we question harri on the subject in the morn and he said what swan and seem to think that georg and i had been dream oh how delight it wa to be safe in the boat after our trial and fear we at a hearti supper georg and i and we should have had some toddi after it if we could have found the whiski but we could not we examin harri as to what he had done with it but he did not seem to know what we meant by whiski or what we were talk about at all montmor look as if he knew someth but said noth i slept well that night and should have slept better if it had not been for harri i have a vagu recollect of have been woke up at least a dozen time dure the night by harri wander about the boat with the lantern look for hi cloth he seem to be worri about hi cloth all night twice he rout up georg and myself to see if we were ly on hi trouser georg got quit wild the second time what the thunder do you want your trouser for in the middl of the night he ask indignantli why don t you lie down and go to sleep i found him in troubl the next time i awok becaus he could not find hi sock and my last hazi remembr is of be roll over on my side and of hear harri mutter someth about it be an extraordinari thing where hi umbrella could have got to chapter xv household duti love of work the old river hand what he doe and what he tell you he ha done sceptic of the new gener earli boat recollect raft georg doe the thing in style the old boatman hi method so calm so full of peac the beginn punt a sad accid pleasur of friendship sail my first experi possibl reason why we were not drown pictur woman at housework we woke late the next morn and at harri s earnest desir partook of a plain breakfast with non dainti then we clean up and put everyth straight a continu labour which wa begin to afford me a pretti clear insight into a question that had often pose me name how a woman with the work of onli on hous on her hand manag to pass awai her time and at about ten set out on what we had determin should be a good dai s journei we agre that we would pull thi morn as a chang from tow and harri thought the best arrang would be that georg and i should scull and he steer i did not chime in with thi idea at all i said i thought harri would have been show a more proper spirit if he had suggest that he and georg should work and let me rest a bit it seem to me that i wa do more than my fair share of the work on thi trip and i wa begin to feel strongli on the subject it alwai doe seem to me that i am do more work than i should do it is not that i object to the work mind you i like work it fascin me i can sit and look at it for hour i love to keep it by me the idea of get rid of it nearli break my heart you cannot give me too much work to accumul work ha almost becom a passion with me my studi is so full of it now that there is hardli an inch of room for ani more i shall have to throw out a wing soon and i am care of my work too why some of the work that i have by me now ha been in my possess for year and year and there isn t a fingermark on it i take a great pride in my work i take it down now and then and dust it no man keep hi work in a better state of preserv than i do but though i crave for work i still like to be fair i do not ask for more than my proper share but i get it without ask for it at least so it appear to me and thi worri me georg sai he doe not think i need troubl myself on the subject he think it is onli my overscrupul natur that make me fear i am have more than my due and that as a matter of fact i don t have half as much as i ought but i expect he onli sai thi to comfort me in a boat i have alwai notic that it is the fix idea of each member of the crew that he is do everyth harri s notion wa that it wa he alon who had been work and that both georg and i had been impos upon him georg on the other hand ridicul the idea of harri s have done anyth more than eat and sleep and had a castiron opinion that it wa he georg himself who had done all the labour worth speak of he said he had never been out with such a coupl of lazili skulk as harri and i that amus harri fanci old georg talk about work he laugh why about halfanhour of it would kill him have you ever seen georg work he ad turn to me i agre with harri that i never had most certainli not sinc we had start on thi trip well i don t see how you can know much about it on wai or the other georg retort on harri for i m blest if you haven t been asleep half the time have you ever seen harri fulli awak except at mealtim ask georg address me truth compel me to support georg harri had been veri littl good in the boat so far as help wa concern from the begin well hang it all i ve done more than old j anyhow rejoin harri well you couldn t veri well have done less ad georg i suppos j think he is the passeng continu harri and that wa their gratitud to me for have brought them and their wretch old boat all the wai up from kingston and for have superintend and manag everyth for them and taken care of them and slave for them it is the wai of the world we settl the present difficulti by arrang that harri and georg should scull up past read and that i should tow the boat on from there pull a heavi boat against a strong stream ha few attract for me now there wa a time long ago when i us to clamour for the hard work now i like to give the youngster a chanc i notic that most of the old river hand ar similarli retir whenev there is ani stiff pull to be done you can alwai tell the old river hand by the wai in which he stretch himself out upon the cushion at the bottom of the boat and encourag the rower by tell them anecdot about the marvel feat he perform last season call what you re do hard work he drawl between hi content whiff address the two perspir novic who have been grind awai steadili up stream for the last hour and a half why jim biffl and jack and i last season pull up from marlow to gore in on afternoon never stop onc do you rememb that jack jack who ha made himself a bed up in the prow of all the rug and coat he can collect and who ha been ly there asleep for the last two hour partial wake up on be thu appeal to and recollect all about the matter and also rememb that there wa an unusu strong stream against them all the wai likewis a stiff wind about thirtyfour mile i suppos it must have been add the first speaker reach down anoth cushion to put under hi head no no don t exagger tom murmur jack reprovingli thirtythre at the outsid and jack and tom quit exhaust by thi convers effort drop off to sleep onc more and the two simplemind youngster at the scull feel quit proud of be allow to row such wonder oarsmen as jack and tom and strain awai harder than ever when i wa a young man i us to listen to these tale from my elder and take them in and swallow them and digest everi word of them and then come up for more but the new gener do not seem to have the simpl faith of the old time we georg harri and myself took a raw un up with us onc last season and we pli him with the customari stretcher about the wonder thing we had done all the wai up we gave him all the regular on the timehonour li that have done duti up the river with everi boatingman for year past and ad seven entir origin on that we had invent for ourselv includ a realli quit like stori found to a certain extent on an all but true episod which had actual happen in a modifi degre some year ago to friend of our a stori that a mere child could have believ without injur itself much and that young man mock at them all and want us to repeat the feat then and there and to bet us ten to on that we didn t we got to chat about our row experi thi morn and to recount stori of our first effort in the art of oarsmanship my own earliest boat recollect is of five of us contribut threepenc each and take out a curious construct craft on the regent s park lake dry ourselv subsequ in the parkkeep s lodg after that have acquir a tast for the water i did a good deal of raft in variou suburban brickfield an exercis provid more interest and excit than might be imagin especi when you ar in the middl of the pond and the proprietor of the materi of which the raft is construct suddenli appear on the bank with a big stick in hi hand your first sensat on see thi gentleman is that somehow or other you don t feel equal to compani and convers and that if you could do so without appear rude you would rather avoid meet him and your object is therefor to get off on the opposit side of the pond to which he is and to go home quietli and quickli pretend not to see him he on the contrari is yearn to take you by the hand and talk to you it appear that he know your father and is intim acquaint with yourself but thi doe not draw you toward him he sai he ll teach you to take hi board and make a raft of them but see that you know how to do thi pretti well alreadi the offer though doubtless kindli meant seem a superflu on on hi part and you ar reluct to put him to ani troubl by accept it hi anxieti to meet you howev is proof against all your cool and the energet manner in which he dodg up and down the pond so as to be on the spot to greet you when you land is realli quit flatter if he be of a stout and shortwind build you can easili avoid hi advanc but when he is of the youth and longleg type a meet is inevit the interview is howev extrem brief most of the convers be on hi part your remark be mostli of an exclamatori and monosyllab order and as soon as you can tear yourself awai you do so i devot some three month to raft and be then as profici as there wa ani need to be at that branch of the art i determin to go in for row proper and join on of the lea boat club be out in a boat on the river lea especi on saturdai afternoon soon make you smart at handl a craft and spry at escap be run down by rough or swamp by barg and it also afford plenti of opportun for acquir the most prompt and grace method of ly down flat at the bottom of the boat so as to avoid be chuck out into the river by pass towlin but it doe not give you style it wa not till i came to the thame that i got style my style of row is veri much admir now peopl sai it is so quaint georg never went near the water until he wa sixteen then he and eight other gentlemen of about the same ag went down in a bodi to kew on saturdai with the idea of hire a boat there and pull to richmond and back on of their number a shockhead youth name joskin who had onc or twice taken out a boat on the serpentin told them it wa jolli fun boat the tide wa run out pretti rapidli when thei reach the landingstag and there wa a stiff breez blow across the river but thi did not troubl them at all and thei proceed to select their boat there wa an eightoar race outrigg drawn up on the stage that wa the on that took their fanci thei said thei d have that on pleas the boatman wa awai and onli hi boi wa in charg the boi tri to damp their ardour for the outrigg and show them two or three veri comfortablelook boat of the familyparti build but those would not do at all the outrigg wa the boat thei thought thei would look best in so the boi launch it and thei took off their coat and prepar to take their seat the boi suggest that georg who even in those dai wa alwai the heavi man of ani parti should be number four georg said he should be happi to be number four and promptli step into bow s place and sat down with hi back to the stern thei got him into hi proper posit at last and then the other follow a particularli nervou boi wa appoint cox and the steer principl explain to him by joskin joskin himself took stroke he told the other that it wa simpl enough all thei had to do wa to follow him thei said thei were readi and the boi on the land stage took a boathook and shove him off what then follow georg is unabl to describ in detail he ha a confus recollect of have immedi on start receiv a violent blow in the small of the back from the buttend of number five s scull at the same time that hi own seat seem to disappear from under him by magic and leav him sit on the board he also notic as a curiou circumst that number two wa at the same instant ly on hi back at the bottom of the boat with hi leg in the air appar in a fit thei pass under kew bridg broadsid at the rate of eight mile an hour joskin be the onli on who wa row georg on recov hi seat tri to help him but on dip hi oar into the water it immedi to hi intens surpris disappear under the boat and nearli took him with it and then cox threw both rudder line overboard and burst into tear how thei got back georg never knew but it took them just forti minut a dens crowd watch the entertain from kew bridg with much interest and everybodi shout out to them differ direct three time thei manag to get the boat back through the arch and three time thei were carri under it again and everi time cox look up and saw the bridg abov him he broke out into renew sob georg said he littl thought that afternoon that he should ever come to realli like boat harri is more accustom to sea row than to river work and sai that as an exercis he prefer it i don t i rememb take a small boat out at eastbourn last summer i us to do a good deal of sea row year ago and i thought i should be all right but i found i had forgotten the art entir when on scull wa deep down underneath the water the other would be flourish wildli about in the air to get a grip of the water with both at the same time i had to stand up the parad wa crowd with nobil and gentri and i had to pull past them in thi ridicul fashion i land halfwai down the beach and secur the servic of an old boatman to take me back i like to watch an old boatman row especi on who ha been hire by the hour there is someth so beautifulli calm and rest about hi method it is so free from that fret hast that vehement strive that is everi dai becom more and more the bane of nineteenthcenturi life he is not for ever strain himself to pass all the other boat if anoth boat overtak him and pass him it doe not annoi him as a matter of fact thei all do overtak him and pass him all those that ar go hi wai thi would troubl and irrit some peopl the sublim equanim of the hire boatman under the ordeal afford us a beauti lesson against ambit and uppish plain practic row of the gettheboatalong order is not a veri difficult art to acquir but it take a good deal of practic befor a man feel comfort when row past girl it is the time that worri a youngster it s jolli funni he sai as for the twentieth time within five minut he disentangl hi scull from your i can get on all right when i m by myself to see two novic try to keep time with on anoth is veri amus bow find it imposs to keep pace with stroke becaus stroke row in such an extraordinari fashion stroke is intens indign at thi and explain that what he ha been endeavour to do for the last ten minut is to adapt hi method to bow s limit capac bow in turn then becom insult and request stroke not to troubl hi head about him bow but to devot hi mind to set a sensibl stroke pictur two novic in a boat or shall i take stroke he add with the evid idea that that would at onc put the whole matter right thei splash along for anoth hundr yard with still moder success and then the whole secret of their troubl burst upon stroke like a flash of inspir i tell you what it is you ve got my scull he cri turn to bow pass your over well do you know i ve been wonder how it wa i couldn t get on with these answer bow quit brighten up and most willingli assist in the exchang now we shall be all right but thei ar not not even then stroke ha to stretch hi arm nearli out of their socket to reach hi scull now while bow s pair at each recoveri hit him a violent blow in the chest so thei chang back again and come to the conclus that the man ha given them the wrong set altogeth and over their mutual abus of thi man thei becom quit friendli and sympathet georg said he had often long to take to punt for a chang punt is not as easi as it look as in row you soon learn how to get along and handl the craft but it take long practic befor you can do thi with digniti and without get the water all up your sleev on young man i knew had a veri sad accid happen to him the first time he went punt he had been get on so well that he had grown quit cheeki over the busi and wa walk up and down the punt work hi pole with a careless grace that wa quit fascin to watch up he would march to the head of the punt plant hi pole and then run along right to the other end just like an old punter oh it wa grand pictur man and pole and it would all have gone on be grand if he had not unfortun while look round to enjoi the sceneri taken just on step more than there wa ani necess for and walk off the punt altogeth the pole wa firmli fix in the mud and he wa left cling to it while the punt drift awai it wa an undignifi posit for him a rude boi on the bank immedi yell out to a lag chum to hurri up and see a real monkei on a stick i could not go to hi assist becaus as illluck would have it we had not taken the proper precaut to bring out a spare pole with us i could onli sit and look at him hi express as the pole slowli sank with him i shall never forget there wa so much thought in it i watch him gentli let down into the water and saw him scrambl out sad and wet i could not help laugh he look such a ridicul figur i continu to chuckl to myself about it for some time and then it wa suddenli forc in upon me that realli i had got veri littl to laugh at when i came to think of it here wa i alon in a punt without a pole drift helplessli down midstream possibl toward a weir i began to feel veri indign with my friend for have step overboard and gone off in that wai he might at all event have left me the pole i drift on for about a quarter of a mile and then i came in sight of a fishingpunt moor in midstream in which sat two old fishermen thei saw me bear down upon them and thei call out to me to keep out of their wai i can t i shout back but you don t try thei answer i explain the matter to them when i got nearer and thei caught me and lent me a pole the weir wa just fifti yard below i am glad thei happen to be there the first time i went punt wa in compani with three other fellow thei were go to show me how to do it we could not all start togeth so i said i would go down first and get out the punt and then i could potter about and practic a bit until thei came i could not get a punt out that afternoon thei were all engag so i had noth els to do but to sit down on the bank watch the river and wait for my friend i had not been sit there long befor my attent becam attract to a man in a punt who i notic with some surpris wore a jacket and cap exactli like mine he wa evid a novic at punt and hi perform wa most interest you never knew what wa go to happen when he put the pole in he evid did not know himself sometim he shot up stream and sometim he shot down stream and at other time he simpli spun round and came up the other side of the pole and with everi result he seem equal surpris and annoi the peopl about the river began to get quit absorb in him after a while and to make bet with on anoth as to what would be the outcom of hi next push in the cours of time my friend arriv on the opposit bank and thei stop and watch him too hi back wa toward them and thei onli saw hi jacket and cap from thi thei immedi jump to the conclus that it wa i their belov companion who wa make an exhibit of himself and their delight knew no bound thei commenc to chaff him unmercifulli i did not grasp their mistak at first and i thought how rude of them to go on like that with a perfect stranger too but befor i could call out and reprov them the explan of the matter occur to me and i withdrew behind a tree oh how thei enjoi themselv ridicul that young man for five good minut thei stood there shout ribaldri at him derid him mock him jeer at him thei pepper him with stale joke thei even made a few new on and threw at him thei hurl at him all the privat famili joke belong to our set and which must have been perfectli unintellig to him and then unabl to stand their brutal jibe ani longer he turn round on them and thei saw hi face i wa glad to notic that thei had suffici decenc left in them to look veri foolish thei explain to him that thei had thought he wa some on thei knew thei said thei hope he would not deem them capabl of so insult ani on except a person friend of their own pictur bath of cours their have mistaken him for a friend excus it i rememb harri tell me onc of a bath experi he had at boulogn he wa swim about there near the beach when he felt himself suddenli seiz by the neck from behind and forcibl plung under water he struggl violent but whoever had got hold of him seem to be a perfect hercul in strength and all hi effort to escap were unavail he had given up kick and wa try to turn hi thought upon solemn thing when hi captor releas him he regain hi feet and look round for hi wouldb murder the assassin wa stand close by him laugh heartili but the moment he caught sight of harri s face as it emerg from the water he start back and seem quit concern i realli beg your pardon he stammer confusedli but i took you for a friend of mine harri thought it wa lucki for him the man had not mistaken him for a relat or he would probabl have been drown outright sail is a thing that want knowledg and practic too though as a boi i did not think so i had an idea it came natur to a bodi like rounder and touch i knew anoth boi who held thi view likewis and so on windi dai we thought we would try the sport we were stop down at yarmouth and we decid we would go for a trip up the yare we hire a sail boat at the yard by the bridg and start off it s rather a rough dai said the man to us as we put off better take in a reef and luff sharp when you get round the bend we said we would make a point of it and left him with a cheeri goodmorn wonder to ourselv how you luf and where we were to get a reef from and what we were to do with it when we had got it we row until we were out of sight of the town and then with a wide stretch of water in front of us and the wind blow a perfect hurrican across it we felt that the time had come to commenc oper hector i think that wa hi name went on pull while i unrol the sail it seem a complic job but i accomplish it at length and then came the question which wa the top end by a sort of natur instinct we of cours eventu decid that the bottom wa the top and set to work to fix it upsidedown but it wa a long time befor we could get it up either that wai or ani other wai the impress on the mind of the sail seem to be that we were plai at funer and that i wa the corps and itself wa the windingsheet when it found that thi wa not the idea it hit me over the head with the boom and refus to do anyth wet it said hector drop it over and get it wet he said peopl in ship alwai wet the sail befor thei put them up so i wet it but that onli made matter wors than thei were befor a dry sail cling to your leg and wrap itself round your head is not pleasant but when the sail is sop wet it becom quit vex we did get the thing up at last the two of us togeth we fix it not exactli upsid down more sidewai like and we ti it up to the mast with the painter which we cut off for the purpos that the boat did not upset i simpli state as a fact why it did not upset i am unabl to offer ani reason i have often thought about the matter sinc but i have never succeed in arriv at ani satisfactori explan of the phenomenon possibl the result mai have been brought about by the natur obstinaci of all thing in thi world the boat mai possibl have come to the conclus judg from a cursori view of our behaviour that we had come out for a morn s suicid and had thereupon determin to disappoint us that is the onli suggest i can offer by cling like grim death to the gunwal we just manag to keep insid the boat but it wa exhaust work hector said that pirat and other seafar peopl gener lash the rudder to someth or other and haul in the main topjib dure sever squall and thought we ought to try to do someth of the kind but i wa for let her have her head to the wind as my advic wa by far the easiest to follow we end by adopt it and contriv to embrac the gunwal and give her her head the boat travel up stream for about a mile at a pace i have never sail at sinc and don t want to again then at a bend she heel over till half her sail wa under water then she right herself by a miracl and flew for a long low bank of soft mud that mudbank save us the boat plough it wai into the middl of it and then stuck find that we were onc more abl to move accord to our idea instead of be pitch and thrown about like pea in a bladder we crept forward and cut down the sail we had had enough sail we did not want to overdo the thing and get a surfeit of it we had had a sail a good allround excit interest sail and now we thought we would have a row just for a chang like we took the scull and tri to push the boat off the mud and in do so we broke on of the scull after that we proceed with great caution but thei were a wretch old pair and the second on crack almost easier than the first and left us helpless the mud stretch out for about a hundr yard in front of us and behind us wa the water the onli thing to be done wa to sit and wait until someon came by it wa not the sort of dai to attract peopl out on the river and it wa three hour befor a soul came in sight it wa an old fisherman who with immens difficulti at last rescu us and we were tow back in an ignomini fashion to the boatyard what between tip the man who had brought us home and pai for the broken scull and for have been out four hour and a half it cost us a pretti consider number of week pocketmonei that sail but we learn experi and thei sai that is alwai cheap at ani price chapter xvi read we ar tow by steam launch

took the scull i had not been pull for more than a minut or so when georg notic someth black float on the water and we drew up to it georg leant over as we near it and laid hold of it and then he drew back with a cry and a blanch face it wa the dead bodi of a woman it lai veri lightli on the water and the face wa sweet and calm it wa not a beauti face it wa too prematur agedlook too thin and drawn to be that but it wa a gentl lovabl face in spite of it stamp of pinch and poverti and upon it wa that look of rest peac that come to the face of the sick sometim when at last the pain ha left them fortun for us we have no desir to be kept hang about coron court some men on the bank had seen the bodi too and now took charg of it from us we found out the woman s stori afterward of cours it wa the old old vulgar tragedi she had love and been deceiv or had deceiv herself anyhow she had sin some of us do now and then and her famili and friend natur shock and indign had close their door against

want to get awai from each other when there is onli such a veri slight bond as that between them and on dai i suppos the pain and the dull monotoni of it all had stood befor her ey plainer than usual and the mock spectr had frighten her she had made on last appeal to friend but against the chill wall of their respect the voic of the er outcast fell unheed and then she had gone to see her child had held it in her arm and kiss it in a weari dull sort of wai and without betrai ani particular emot of ani kind and had left it after put into it hand a penni box of chocol she had bought it and afterward with her last few shill had taken a ticket and come down to gore pictur woman in the water it seem that the bitterest thought of her life must have centr about the wood reach and the bright green meadow around gore but women strang hug the knife that stab them and perhap amidst the gall there mai have mingl also sunni memori of sweetest hour spent upon those shadow deep over which the great tree bend their branch down so low she had wander about the wood by the river s brink all dai and then when even fell and the grei twilight spread it duski robe upon the water she stretch her

reach down to pangbourn woo on for a sunni sail or for a moonlight row and the countri round about is full of beauti we had intend to push on to wallingford that dai but the sweet smile face of the river here lure us to linger for a while and so we left our boat at the bridg and went up into streatlei and lunch at the bull much to montmor s satisfact thei sai that the hill on each ride of the stream here onc join and form a barrier across what is now the thame and that then the river end there abov gore in on vast lake i am not in a posit either to contradict or affirm thi statement i

flyfish a fishi stori pictur wash line we stai two dai at streatlei and got our cloth wash we had tri wash them ourselv in the river under georg s superintend and it had been a failur inde it had been more than a failur becaus we were wors off after we had wash our cloth than we were befor befor we had wash them thei had been veri veri dirti it is true but thei were just wearabl after we had wash them well the river between read and henlei wa much cleaner after we had wash our cloth in it than it wa befor all the dirt contain in the river between read and henlei we collect dure that wash and work it into our cloth the washerwoman at streatlei said she felt she ow it to herself to charg us just three time the usual price for that wash she said it had not been like wash it had been more in the natur of excav we paid the bill without a murmur the neighbourhood of streatlei and gore is a great fish centr there is some excel fish to be had here the river abound in pike roach dace gudgeon and eel just here and you can sit and fish for them all dai some peopl do thei never catch them i never knew anybodi catch anyth up the thame except minnow and dead cat but that ha noth to do of cours with fish the local fisherman s guid doesn t sai a word about catch anyth all it sai is the place is a good station for fish and from what i have seen of the district i am quit prepar to bear out thi statement there is no spot in the world where you can get more fish or where you can fish for a longer period some fishermen come here and fish for a dai and other stop and fish for a month you can hang on and fish for a year if you want to it will be all the same the angler s guid to the thame sai that jack and perch ar also to be had about here but there the angler s guid is wrong jack and perch mai be about there inde i know for a fact that thei ar you can see them there in shoal when you ar out for a walk along the bank thei come and stand half out of the water with their mouth open for biscuit and if you go for a bath thei crowd round and get in your wai and irrit you but thei ar not to be had by a bit of worm on the end of a hook nor anyth like it not thei i am not a good fisherman myself i devot a consider amount of attent to the subject at on time and wa get on as i thought fairli well but the old hand told me that i should never be ani real good at it and advis me to give it up thei said that i wa an extrem neat thrower and that i seem to have plenti of gumption for the thing and quit enough constitut lazi but thei were sure i should never make anyth of a fisherman i had not got suffici imagin thei said that as a poet or a shill shocker or a report or anyth of that kind i might be satisfactori but that to gain ani posit as a thame angler would requir more plai of fanci more power of invent than i appear to possess some peopl ar under the impress that all that is requir to make a good fisherman is the abil to tell li easili and without blush but thi is a mistak mere bald fabric is useless the veriest tyro can manag that it is in the circumstanti detail the embellish touch of probabl the gener air of scrupul almost of pedant verac that the experienc angler is seen anybodi can come in and sai oh i caught fifteen dozen perch yesterdai even or last mondai i land a gudgeon weigh eighteen pound and measur three feet from the tip to the tail there is no art no skill requir for that sort of thing it show pluck but that is all no your accomplish angler would scorn to tell a lie that wai hi method is a studi in itself he come in quietli with hi hat on appropri the most comfort chair light hi pipe and commenc to puff in silenc he let the youngster brag awai for a while and then dure a momentari lull he remov the pipe from hi mouth and remark as he knock the ash out against the bar well i had a haul on tuesdai even that it s not much good my tell anybodi about oh why s that thei ask becaus i don t expect anybodi would believ me if i did repli the old fellow calmli and without even a ting of bitter in hi tone as he refil hi pipe and request the landlord to bring him three of scotch cold there is a paus after thi nobodi feel suffici sure of himself to contradict the old gentleman so he ha to go on by himself without ani encourag no he continu thoughtfulli i shouldn t believ it myself if anybodi told it to me but it s a fact for all that i had been sit there all the afternoon and had caught liter noth except a few dozen dace and a score of jack and i wa just about give it up as a bad job when i suddenli felt a rather smart pull at the line i thought it wa anoth littl on and i went to jerk it up hang me if i could move the rod it took me halfanhour halfanhour sir to land that fish and everi moment i thought the line wa go to snap i reach him at last and what do you think it wa a sturgeon a forti pound sturgeon taken on a line sir ye you mai well look surpris i ll have anoth three of scotch landlord pleas and then he goe on to tell of the astonish of everybodi who saw it and what hi wife said when he got home and of what joe buggl thought about it i ask the landlord of an inn up the river onc if it did not injur him sometim listen to the tale that the fishermen about there told him and he said oh no not now sir it did us to knock me over a bit at first but lor love you me and the missu we listen to em all dai now it s what you re us to you know it s what you re us to i knew a young man onc he wa a most conscienti fellow and when he took to flyfish he determin never to exagger hi haul by more than twentyf per cent when i have caught forti fish said he then i will tell peopl that i have caught fifti and so on but i will not lie ani more than that becaus it is sin to lie but the twentyf per cent plan did not work well at all he never wa abl to us it the greatest number of fish he ever caught in on dai wa three and you can t add twentyf per cent to three at least not in fish so he increas hi percentag to thirtythreeandathird but that again wa awkward when he had onli caught on or two so to simplifi matter he made up hi mind to just doubl the quantiti he stuck to thi arrang for a coupl of month and then he grew dissatisfi with it nobodi believ him when he told them that he onli doubl and he therefor gain no credit that wai whatev while hi moder put him at a disadvantag among the other angler when he had realli caught three small fish and said he had caught six it us to make him quit jealou to hear a man whom he knew for a fact had onli caught on go about tell peopl he had land two dozen so eventu he made on final arrang with himself which he ha religi held to ever sinc and that wa to count each fish that he caught as ten and to assum ten to begin with for exampl if he did not catch ani fish at all then he said he had caught ten fish you could never catch less than ten fish by hi system that wa the foundat of it then if by ani chanc he realli did catch on fish he call it twenti while two fish would count thirti three forti and so on it is a simpl and easili work plan and there ha been some talk late of it be made us of by the angl fratern in gener inde the committe of the thame angler s associ did recommend it adopt about two year ago but some of the older member oppos it thei said thei would consid the idea if the number were doubl and each fish count as twenti if ever you have an even to spare up the river i should advis you to drop into on of the littl villag inn and take a seat in the taproom you will be nearli sure to meet on or two old rodmen sip their toddi there and thei will tell you enough fishi stori in half an hour to give you indigest for a month georg and i i don t know what had becom of harri he had gone out and had a shave earli in the afternoon and had then come back and spent full forti minut in pipeclai hi shoe we had not seen him sinc georg and i therefor and the dog left to ourselv went for a walk to wallingford on the second even and come home we call in at a littl riversid inn for a rest and other thing we went into the parlour and sat down there wa an old fellow there smoke a long clai pipe and we natur began chat he told us that it had been a fine dai todai and we told him that it had been a fine dai yesterdai and then we all told each other that we thought it would be a fine dai tomorrow and georg said the crop seem to be come up nice after that it came out somehow or other that we were stranger in the neighbourhood and that we were go awai the next morn pictur the trout then a paus ensu in the convers dure which our ey wander round the room thei final rest upon a dusti old glasscas fix veri high up abov the chimneypiec and contain a trout it rather fascin me that trout it wa such a monstrou fish in fact at first glanc i thought it wa a cod ah said the old gentleman follow the direct of my gaze fine fellow that ain t he quit uncommon i murmur and georg ask the old man how much he thought it weigh eighteen pound six ounc said our friend rise and take down hi coat ye he continu it wur sixteen year ago come the third o next month that i land him i caught him just below the bridg with a minnow thei told me he wur in the river and i said i d have him and so i did you don t see mani fish that size about here now i m think goodnight gentlemen goodnight and out he went and left us alon we could not take our ey off the fish after that it realli wa a remark fine fish we were still look at it when the local carrier who had just stop at the inn came to the door of the room with a pot of beer in hi hand and he also look at the fish goodsiz trout that said georg turn round to him ah you mai well sai that sir repli the man and then after a pull at hi beer he ad mayb you wasn t here sir when that fish wa caught no we told him we were stranger in the neighbourhood ah said the carrier then of cours how should you it wa nearli five year ago that i caught that trout oh wa it you who caught it then said i ye sir repli the genial old fellow i caught him just below the lock leastwai what wa the lock then on fridai afternoon and the remark thing about it is that i caught him with a fly i d gone out pike fish bless you never think of a trout and when i saw that whopper on the end of my line blest if it didn t quit take me aback well you see he weigh twentysix pound goodnight gentlemen goodnight five minut afterward a third man came in and describ how he had caught it earli on morn with bleak and then he left and a stolid solemnlook middleag individu came in and sat down over by the window none of us spoke for a while but at length georg turn to the new comer and said i beg your pardon i hope you will forgiv the liberti that we perfect stranger in the neighbourhood ar take but my friend here and myself would be so much oblig if you would tell us how you caught that trout up there why who told you i caught that trout wa the surpris queri we said that nobodi had told us so but somehow or other we felt instinct that it wa he who had done it well it s a most remark thing most remark answer the stolid stranger laugh becaus as a matter of fact you ar quit right i did catch it but fanci your guess it like that dear me it s realli a most remark thing and then he went on and told us how it had taken him half an hour to land it and how it had broken hi rod he said he had weigh it carefulli when he reach home and it had turn the scale at thirtyfour pound he went in hi turn and when he wa gone the landlord came in to us we told him the variou histori we had heard about hi trout and he wa immens amus and we all laugh veri heartili fanci jim bate and joe muggl and mr jone and old billi maunder all tell you that thei had caught it ha ha ha well that is good said the honest old fellow laugh heartili ye thei ar the sort to give it me to put up in my parlour if thei had caught it thei ar ha ha ha and then he told us the real histori of the fish it seem that he had caught it himself year ago when he wa quit a lad not by ani art or skill but by that unaccount luck that appear to alwai wait upon a boi when he plai the wag from school and goe out fish on a sunni afternoon with a bit of string ti on to the end of a tree he said that bring home that trout had save him from a whack and that even hi schoolmast had said it wa worth the ruleofthre and practic put togeth he wa call out of the room at thi point and georg and i again turn our gaze upon the fish it realli wa a most astonish trout the more we look at it the more we marvel at it it excit georg so much that he climb up on the back of a chair to get a better view of it and then the chair slip and georg clutch wildli at the troutcas to save himself and down it came with a crash georg and the chair on top of it you haven t injur the fish have you i cri in alarm rush up i hope not said georg rise cautious and look about but he had that trout lai shatter into a thousand fragment i sai a thousand but thei mai have onli been nine hundr i did not count them we thought it strang and unaccount that a stuf trout should break up into littl piec like that and so it would have been strang and unaccount if it had been a stuf trout but it wa not that trout wa plasterofpari chapter xviii lock georg and i ar photograph wallingford dorchest abingdon a famili man a good spot for drown a difficult bit of water demor effect of river air we left streatlei earli the next morn and pull up to culham and slept under the canva in the backwat there the river is not extraordinarili interest

common practic up the river a specul photograph wa take a pictur of us all as we lai upon the rise water i did not catch what wa go on at first and wa therefor extrem surpris at notic georg hurriedli smooth out hi trouser ruffl up hi hair and stick hi cap on in a rakish manner at the back of hi head and then assum an express of mingl affabl and sad sit down in a grace attitud and try to hide hi feet my first idea wa that he had suddenli caught sight of some girl he knew and i look about to see who it wa everybodi in the lock seem to have been suddenli struck wooden thei were all stand or sit about in the most quaint and curiou attitud i have ever seen off a japanes fan all the girl were smile oh thei did look so sweet and all the fellow were frown and look stern and nobl and then at last the truth flash across me and i wonder if i should be in time our wa the first boat and it would be unkind of me to spoil the man s pictur i thought so i face round quickli and took up a posit in the prow where i leant with careless grace upon the hitcher in an attitud suggest of agil and strength i arrang my hair with a curl over the forehead and threw an air of tender wist into my express mingl with a touch of cynic which i am told suit me as we stood wait for the event moment i heard someon behind call out hi look at your nose i could not turn round to see what wa the matter and whose nose it wa that wa to be look at i stole a sidegl at georg s nose it wa all right at all event there wa noth wrong with it that could be alter i squint down at my own and that seem all that could be expect

sink there ar place in them to sit down on and thei ar complet with all the necessari arrang or nearli all to enabl you to row them and steer them but thei ar not ornament the boat you hire up the river abov marlow is not the sort of boat in which you can flash about and give yourself air the hire upriv boat veri soon put a stop to ani nonsens of that sort on the part of it occup that is it chief on mai sai it onli recommend pictur dog the man in the hire upriv boat is modest and retir he like to keep on the shadi side underneath the tree and to do most of hi travel earli in the morn or late at night when there ar not mani peopl about on the river to look at him when the man in the hire upriv boat see anyon he know he get out on to the bank and hide behind a tree i wa on of a parti who hire an upriv boat on summer for a few dai trip we had none of us ever seen the hire upriv boat befor and we did not know what it wa when we did see it we had written for a boat a doubl scull skiff and when we went down with our bag to the yard and gave our name the man said pictur the pride of the thame oh ye you re the parti that wrote for a doubl scull skiff it s all right jim fetch round the pride of the thame the boi went and reappear five minut afterward struggl with an antediluvian chunk of wood that look as though it had been recent dug out of somewher and dug out carelessli so as to have been unnecessarili damag in the process my own idea on first catch sight of the object wa that it wa a roman relic of some sort relic of what i do not know possibl of a coffin the neighbourhood of the upper thame is rich in roman relic and my surmis seem to me a veri probabl on but our seriou young man who is a bit of a geologist poohpooh my roman relic theori and said it wa clear to the meanest intellect in which categori he seem to be griev that he could not conscienti includ mine that the thing the boi had found wa the fossil of a whale and he point out to us variou evid prove that it must have belong to the preglaci period to settl the disput we appeal to the boi we told him not to be afraid but to speak the plain truth wa it the fossil of a preadamit whale or wa it an earli roman coffin the boi said it wa the pride of the thame we thought thi a veri humor answer on the part of the boi at first and somebodi gave him twopenc as a reward for hi readi wit but when he persist in keep up the joke as we thought too long we got vex with him come come my lad said our captain sharpli don t let us have ani nonsens you take your mother s washingtub home again and bring us a boat the boatbuild himself came up then and assur us on hi word as a practic man that the thing realli wa a boat wa in fact the boat the doubl scull skiff select to take us on our trip down the river we grumbl a good deal we thought he might at least have had it whitewash or tar had someth done to it to distinguish it from a bit of a wreck but he could not see ani fault in it he even seem offend at our remark he said he had pick us out the best boat in all hi stock and he thought we might have been more grate he said it the pride of the thame had been in us just as it now stood or rather as it now hung togeth for the last forti year to hi knowledg and nobodi had complain of it befor and he did not see why we should be the first to begin we argu no more we fasten the socal boat togeth with some piec of string got a bit of wallpap and past over the shabbier place said our prayer and step on board thei charg us thirtyf shill for the loan of the remnant for six dai and we could

the rush peep laugh from each inlet gleam gai on mani a far sail make soft the air with glori is a golden fairi stream but the river chill and weari with the ceaseless raindrop fall on it brown and sluggish water with a sound as of a woman weep low in some dark chamber while the wood all dark and silent shroud in their mist of vapour stand like ghost upon the margin silent ghost with ey reproach like the ghost of evil action like the ghost of friend neglect is a spirithaunt water through the land of vain regret sunlight is the lifeblood of natur mother earth look at us with such dull soulless ey when the sunlight ha di awai from out of her it make us sad to be with her then she doe not seem to know us or to care for us she is as a widow who ha lost the husband she love and her children touch her hand and look up into her ey but gain no smile from her we row on all that dai through the rain and veri melancholi work it wa we pretend at first that we enjoi it we said it wa a chang and that we like to see the river under all it differ aspect we said we could not expect to have it all sunshin nor should we wish it we told each other that natur wa beauti even in her tear pictur the boat in the rain inde harri and i were quit enthusiast about the busi for the first few hour and we sang a song about a gipsi s life and how delight a gipsi s exist wa free to storm and sunshin and to everi wind that blew and how he enjoi the rain and what a lot of good it did him and how he laugh at peopl who didn t like it georg took the fun more soberli and stuck to the umbrella we hoist the cover befor we had lunch and kept it up all the afternoon just leav a littl space in the bow from which on of us could paddl and keep a lookout in thi wai we made nine mile and pull up for the night a littl below dai s lock i cannot honestli sai that we had a merri even the rain pour down with quiet persist everyth in the boat wa damp and clammi supper wa not a success cold veal pie when you don t feel hungri is apt to cloi i felt i want whitebait and a cutlet harri babbl of sole and whitesauc and pass the remain of hi pie to montmor who declin it and appar insult by the offer went and sat over at the other end of the boat by himself georg request that we would not talk about these thing at all event until he had finish hi cold boil beef without mustard we plai penni nap after supper we plai for about an hour and a half by the end of which time georg had won fourpenc georg alwai is lucki at card and harri and i had lost exactli twopenc each we thought we would give up gambl then as harri said it breed an unhealthi excit when carri too far georg offer to go on and give us our reveng but harri and i decid not to battl ani further against fate after that we mix ourselv some toddi and sat round and talk georg told us about a man he had known who had come up the river two year ago and who had slept out in a damp boat on just such anoth night as that wa and it had given him rheumat fever and noth wa abl to save him and he had di in great agoni ten dai afterward georg said he wa quit a young man and wa engag to be marri he said it wa on of the saddest thing he had ever known and that put harri in mind of a friend of hi who had been in the volunt and who had slept out under canva on wet night down at aldershot on just such anoth night as thi said harri and he had woke up in the morn a crippl for life harri said he would introduc us both to the man when we got back to town it would make our heart bleed to see him thi natur led to some pleasant chat about sciatica fever chill lung diseas and bronchiti and harri said how veri awkward it would be if on of us were taken serious ill in the night see how far awai we were from a doctor there seem to be a desir for someth frolicksom to follow upon thi convers and in a weak moment i suggest that georg should get out hi banjo and see if he could not give us a comic song i will sai for georg that he did not want ani press there wa no nonsens about have left hi music at home or anyth of that sort he at onc fish out hi instrument and commenc to plai two love black ey i had alwai regard two love black ey as rather a commonplac tune until that even the rich vein of sad that georg extract from it quit surpris me the desir that grew upon harri and myself as the mourn strain progress wa to fall upon each other s neck and weep but by great effort we kept back the rise tear and listen to the wild yearn melodi in silenc when the choru came we even made a desper effort to be merri we refil our glass and join in harri in a voic trembl with emot lead and georg and i follow a few word behind two love black ey oh what a surpris onli for tell a man he wa wrong two there we broke down the unutter patho of georg s accompani to that two we were in our then state of depress unabl to bear harri sob like a littl child and the dog howl till i thought hi heart or hi jaw must sure break georg want to go on with anoth vers he thought that when he had got a littl more into the tune and could throw more abandon as it were into the render it might not seem so sad the feel of the major howev wa oppos to the experi there be noth els to do we went to bed that is we undress ourselv and toss about at the bottom of the boat for some three or four hour after which we manag to get some fit slumber until five am when we all got up and had breakfast the second dai wa exactli like the first the rain continu to pour down and we sat wrap up in our mackintosh underneath the canva and drift slowli down on of us i forget which on now but i rather think it wa myself made a few feebl attempt dure the cours of the morn to work up the old gipsi foolish about be children of natur and enjoi the wet but it did not go down well at all that i care not for the rain not i wa so painfulli evid as express the sentiment of each of us that to sing it seem unnecessari on on point we were all agre and that wa that come what might we would go through with thi job to the bitter end we had come out for a fortnight s enjoy on the river and a fortnight s enjoy on the river we meant to have if it kill us well that would be a sad thing for our friend and relat but it could not be help we felt that to give in to the weather in a climat such as our would be a most disastr preced it s onli two dai more said harri and we ar young and strong we mai get over it all right after all at about four o clock we began to discuss our arrang for the even we were a littl past gore then and we decid to paddl on to pangbourn and put up there for the night anoth jolli even murmur georg we sat and muse on the prospect we should be in at pangbourn by five we should finish dinner at sai halfpast six after that we could walk about the villag in the pour rain until bedtim or we could sit in a dimlylit barparlour and read the almanac pictur ladi in skirt why the alhambra would be almost more live said harri ventur hi head outsid the

silenc for a while if we hadn t made up our mind to contract our certain death in thi balli old coffin observ georg cast a glanc of intens malevol over the boat it might be worth while to mention that there s a train leav pangbourn i know soon after five which would just land us in town in comfort time to get a chop and then go on to the place you mention afterward nobodi spoke we look at on anoth and each on seem to see hi own mean and guilti thought reflect in the face of the other in silenc we drag out and overhaul the gladston we look up the river and down the river not a soul wa in sight
