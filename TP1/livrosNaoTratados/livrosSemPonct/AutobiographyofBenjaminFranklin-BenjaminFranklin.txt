INTRODUCTION


We Americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tell
us the secret of success in life yet how often we are disappointed to
find nothing but commonplace statements or receipts that we know by
heart but never follow Most of the life stories of our famous and
successful men fail to inspire because they lack the human element
that makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp
While we are searching far and near for some Aladdins Lamp to give
coveted fortune there is ready at our hand if we will only reach out
and take it like the charm in Miltons Comus

  Unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain
   Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon

the interesting human and vividly told story of one of the wisest
and most useful lives in our own history and perhaps in any history
In Franklins Autobiography is offered not so much a readymade
formula for success as the companionship of a real flesh and blood
man of extraordinary mind and quality whose daily walk and
conversation will help us to meet our own difficulties much as does
the example of a wise and strong friend While we are fascinated by
the story we absorb the human experience through which a strong and
helpful character is building

The thing that makes Franklins Autobiography different from every
other life story of a great and successful man is just this human
aspect of the account Franklin told the story of his life as he
himself says for the benefit of his posterity He wanted to help them
by the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminence
and wealth He is not unmindful of the importance of his public
services and their recognition yet his accounts of these achievements
are given only as a part of the story and the vanity displayed is
incidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital There is
nothing of the impossible in the method and practice of Franklin as he
sets them forth The youth who reads the fascinating story is
astonished to find that Franklin in his early years struggled with the
same everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences
and he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a
realization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain

There are other reasons why the Autobiography should be an intimate
friend of American young people Here they may establish a close
relationship with one of the foremost Americans as well as one of the
wisest men of his age

The life of Benjamin Franklin is of importance to every American
primarily because of the part he played in securing the independence
of the United States and in establishing it as a nation Franklin
shares with Washington the honors of the Revolution and of the events
leading to the birth of the new nation While Washington was the
animating spirit of the struggle in the colonies Franklin was its
ablest champion abroad To Franklins cogent reasoning and keen
satire we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the American
case in England and France while to his personality and diplomacy as
well as to his facile pen we are indebted for the foreign alliance
and the funds without which Washingtons work must have failed His
patience fortitude and practical wisdom coupled with
selfsacrificing devotion to the cause of his country are hardly less
noticeable than similar qualities displayed by Washington In fact
Franklin as a public man was much like Washington especially in the
entire disinterestedness of his public service

Franklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings
he has done more than any other American to advance the material
prosperity of his countrymen It is said that his widely and
faithfully read maxims made Philadelphia and Pennsylvania wealthy
while Poor Richards pithy sayings translated into many languages
have had a worldwide influence

Franklin is a good type of our American manhood Although not the
wealthiest or the most powerful he is undoubtedly in the versatility
of his genius and achievements the greatest of our selfmade men The
simple yet graphic story in the Autobiography of his steady rise
from humble boyhood in a tallowchandler shop by industry economy
and perseverance in selfimprovement to eminence is the most
remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our selfmade men It is
in itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be
attained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following Franklins
maxims

Franklins fame however was not confined to his own country
Although he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of
scientific and political thought and activity yet no less a keen
judge and critic than Lord Jeffrey the famous editor of the
Edinburgh Review a century ago said that in one point of view
the name of Franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of
the others which illustrated the eighteenth century Distinguished as
a statesman he was equally great as a philosopher thus uniting in
himself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits to excel
in either of which is deemed the highest praise

Franklin has indeed been aptly called manysided He was eminent in
science and public service in diplomacy and in literature He was the
Edison of his day turning his scientific discoveries to the benefit
of his fellowmen He perceived the identity of lightning and
electricity and set up the lightning rod He invented the Franklin
stove still widely used and refused to patent it He possessed a
masterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs Carlyle called
him the father of all the Yankees He founded a fire company assisted
in founding a hospital and improved the cleaning and lighting of
streets He developed journalism established the American
Philosophical Society the public library in Philadelphia and the
University of Pennsylvania He organized a postal system for the
colonies which was the basis of the present United States Post
Office Bancroft the eminent historian called him the greatest
diplomatist of his century He perfected the Albany Plan of Union for
the colonies He is the only statesman who signed the Declaration of
Independence the Treaty of Alliance with France the Treaty of Peace
with England and the Constitution As a writer he has produced in
his Autobiography and in Poor Richards Almanac two works that
are not surpassed by similar writing He received honorary degrees
from Harvard and Yale from Oxford and St Andrews and was made a
fellow of the Royal Society which awarded him the Copley gold medal
for improving natural knowledge He was one of the eight foreign
associates of the French Academy of Science

The careful study of the Autobiography is also valuable because of
the style in which it is written If Robert Louis Stevenson is right
in believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then
the youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly
forcibly and interestingly cannot do better than to study Franklins
method Franklins fame in the scientific world was due almost as much
to his modest simple and sincere manner of presenting his
discoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which
he described his experiments as to the results he was able to
announce Sir Humphry Davy the celebrated English chemist himself an
excellent literary critic as well as a great scientist said A
singular felicity guided all Franklins researches and by very small
means he established very grand truths The style and manner of his
publication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the
doctrine it contains

Franklins place in literature is hard to determine because he was not
primarily a literary man His aim in his writings as in his life work
was to be helpful to his fellowmen For him writing was never an end
in itself but always a means to an end Yet his success as a
scientist a statesman and a diplomat as well as socially was in no
little part due to his ability as a writer His letters charmed all
and made his correspondence eagerly sought His political arguments
were the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents His
scientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simple
and so clear that plowboy and exquisite could follow his thought or
his experiment to its conclusion1

    1 The ManySided Franklin Paul L Ford

As far as American literature is concerned Franklin has no
contemporaries Before the Autobiography only one literary work of
importance had been produced in this countryCotton Mathers
Magnalia a church history of New England in a ponderous stiff
style Franklin was the first American author to gain a wide and
permanent reputation in Europe The Autobiography Poor Richard
Father Abrahams Speech or The Way to Wealth as well as some of
the Bagatelles are as widely known abroad as any American writings
Franklin must also be classed as the first American humorist

English literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by the
development of prose Periodical literature reached its perfection
early in the century in The Tatler and The Spectator of Addison
and Steele Pamphleteers flourished throughout the period The
homelier prose of Bunyan and Defoe gradually gave place to the more
elegant and artificial language of Samuel Johnson who set the
standard for prose writing from 1745 onward This century saw the
beginnings of the modern novel in Fieldings Tom Jones
Richardsons Clarissa Harlowe Sternes Tristram Shandy and
Goldsmiths Vicar of Wakefield Gibbon wrote The Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire Hume his History of England and Adam Smith
the Wealth of Nations

In the simplicity and vigor of his style Franklin more nearly
resembles the earlier group of writers In his first essays he was not
an inferior imitator of Addison In his numerous parables moral
allegories and apologues he showed Bunyans influence But Franklin
was essentially a journalist In his swift terse style he is most
like Defoe who was the first great English journalist and master of
the newspaper narrative The style of both writers is marked by
homely vigorous expression satire burlesque repartee Here the
comparison must end Defoe and his contemporaries were authors Their
vocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative or
creative power they displayed To authorship Franklin laid no claim
He wrote no work of the imagination He developed only incidentally a
style in many respects as remarkable as that of his English
contemporaries He wrote the best autobiography in existence one of
the most widely known collections of maxims and an unsurpassed series
of political and social satires because he was a man of unusual scope
of power and usefulness who knew how to tell his fellowmen the
secrets of that power and that usefulness


The Story of the Autobiography

The account of how Franklins Autobiography came to be written and
of the adventures of the original manuscript forms in itself an
interesting story The Autobiography is Franklins longest work
and yet it is only a fragment The first part written as a letter to
his son William Franklin was not intended for publication and the
composition is more informal and the narrative more personal than in
the second part from 1730 on which was written with a view to
publication The entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision
In fact the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson
William Temple Franklin in editing the work changed some of the
phrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar

Franklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend
Bishop Shipley at Twyford in Hampshire southern England in 1771
He took the manuscript completed to 1731 with him when he returned
to Philadelphia in 1775 It was left there with his other papers when
he went to France in the following year and disappeared during the
confusion incident to the Revolution Twentythree pages of closely
written manuscript fell into the hands of Abel James an old friend
who sent a copy to Franklin at Passy near Paris urging him to
complete the story Franklin took up the work at Passy in 1784 and
carried the narrative forward a few months He changed the plan to
meet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader His work
was soon interrupted and was not resumed until 1788 when he was at
home in Philadelphia He was now old infirm and suffering and was
still engaged in public service Under these discouraging conditions
the work progressed slowly It finally stopped when the narrative
reached the year 1757 Copies of the manuscript were sent to friends
of Franklin in England and France among others to Monsieur Le
Veillard at Paris

The first edition of the Autobiography was published in French at
Paris in 1791 It was clumsily and carelessly translated and was
imperfect and unfinished Where the translator got the manuscript is
not known Le Veillard disclaimed any knowledge of the publication
From this faulty French edition many others were printed some in
Germany two in England and another in France so great was the
demand for the work

In the meantime the original manuscript of the Autobiography had
started on a varied and adventurous career It was left by Franklin
with his other works to his grandson William Temple Franklin whom
Franklin designated as his literary executor When Temple Franklin
came to publish his grandfathers works in 1817 he sent the original
manuscript of the Autobiography to the daughter of Le Veillard in
exchange for her fathers copy probably thinking the clearer
transcript would make better printers copy The original manuscript
thus found its way to the Le Veillard family and connections where it
remained until sold in 1867 to Mr John Bigelow United States
Minister to France By him it was later sold to Mr E Dwight Church
of New York and passed with the rest of Mr Churchs library into the
possession of Mr Henry E Huntington The original manuscript of
Franklins Autobiography now rests in the vault in Mr Huntingtons
residence at Fifth Avenue and Fiftyseventh Street New York City

When Mr Bigelow came to examine his purchase he was astonished to
find that what people had been reading for years as the authentic
Life of Benjamin Franklin by Himself was only a garbled and
incomplete version of the real Autobiography Temple Franklin had
taken unwarranted liberties with the original Mr Bigelow says he
found more than twelve hundred changes in the text In 1868
therefore Mr Bigelow published the standard edition of Franklins
Autobiography It corrected errors in the previous editions and was
the first English edition to contain the short fourth part
comprising the last few pages of the manuscript written during the
last year of Franklins life Mr Bigelow republished the
Autobiography with additional interesting matter in three volumes
in 1875 in 1905 and in 1910 The text in this volume is that of Mr
Bigelows editions2

    2 For the division into chapters and the chapter
    titles however the present editor is responsible

The Autobiography has been reprinted in the United States many
scores of times and translated into all the languages of Europe It
has never lost its popularity and is still in constant demand at
circulating libraries The reason for this popularity is not far to
seek For in this work Franklin told in a remarkable manner the story
of a remarkable life He displayed hard common sense and a practical
knowledge of the art of living He selected and arranged his material
perhaps unconsciously with the unerring instinct of the journalist
for the best effects His success is not a little due to his plain
clear vigorous English He used short sentences and words homely
expressions apt illustrations and pointed allusions Franklin had a
most interesting varied and unusual life He was one of the greatest
conversationalists of his time

His book is the record of that unusual life told in Franklins own
unexcelled conversational style It is said that the best parts of
Boswells famous biography of Samuel Johnson are those parts where
Boswell permits Johnson to tell his own story In the Autobiography
a no less remarkable man and talker than Samuel Johnson is telling his
own story throughout

AUTOBIOGRAPHY
OF
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN




I

ANCESTRY AND EARLY YOUTH IN
BOSTON


  Twyford3 at the Bishop of St Asaphs 1771

Dear son I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes
of my ancestors You may remember the inquiries I made among the
remains of my relations when you were with me in England and the
journey I undertook for that purpose Imagining it may be equally
agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life many of which
you are yet unacquainted with and expecting the enjoyment of a weeks
uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement I sit down to
write them for you To which I have besides some other inducements
Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and
bred to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the
world and having gone so far through life with a considerable share
of felicity the conducing means I made use of which with the
blessing of God so well succeeded my posterity may like to know as
they may find some of them suitable to their own situations and
therefore fit to be imitated

    3 A small village not far from Winchester in
    Hampshire southern England Here was the country seat
    of the Bishop of St Asaph Dr Jonathan Shipley the
    good Bishop as Dr Franklin used to style him Their
    relations were intimate and confidential In his pulpit
    and in the House of Lords as well as in society the
    bishop always opposed the harsh measures of the Crown
    toward the ColoniesBigelow

That felicity when I reflected on it has induced me sometimes to
say that were it offered to my choice I should have no objection to
a repetition of the same life from its beginning only asking the
advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of
the first So I might besides correcting the faults change some
sinister accidents and events of it for others more favourable But
though this were denied I should still accept the offer Since such a
repetition is not to be expected the next thing most like living
ones life over again seems to be a recollection of that life and to
make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in
writing

Hereby too I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men to
be talking of themselves and their own past actions and I shall
indulge it without being tiresome to others who through respect to
age might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing since
this may be read or not as anyone pleases And lastly I may as well
confess it since my denial of it will be believed by nobody perhaps
I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity4 Indeed I scarce ever
heard or saw the introductory words Without vanity I may say
etc but some vain thing immediately followed Most people dislike
vanity in others whatever share they have of it themselves but I
give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it being persuaded that it
is often productive of good to the possessor and to others that are
within his sphere of action and therefore in many cases it would
not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity
among the other comforts of life

    4 In this connection Woodrow Wilson says And yet the
    surprising and delightful thing about this book the
    Autobiography is that take it all in all it has not
    the low tone of conceit but is a staunch mans sober
    and unaffected assessment of himself and the
    circumstances of his career

    Gibbon and Hume the great British historians who were
    contemporaries of Franklin express in their
    autobiographies the same feeling about the propriety of
    just selfpraise

And now I speak of thanking God I desire with all humility to
acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His
kind providence which lead me to the means I used and gave them
success My belief of this induces me to hope though I must not
presume that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me
in continuing that happiness or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse
which I may experience as others have done the complexion of my
future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless
to us even our afflictions

The notes one of my uncles who had the same kind of curiosity in
collecting family anecdotes once put into my hands furnished me with
several particulars relating to our ancestors From these notes I
learned that the family had lived in the same village Ecton in
Northamptonshire5 for three hundred years and how much longer he
knew not perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin that before
was the name of an order of people6 was assumed by them as a
surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom on a freehold
of about thirty acres aided by the smiths business which had
continued in the family till his time the eldest son being always
bred to that business a custom which he and my father followed as to
their eldest sons When I searched the registers at Ecton I found an
account of their births marriages and burials from the year 1555
only there being no registers kept in that parish at any time
preceding By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of
the youngest son for five generations back My grandfather Thomas who
was born in 1598 lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow
business longer when he went to live with his son John a dyer at
Banbury in Oxfordshire with whom my father served an apprenticeship
There my grandfather died and lies buried We saw his gravestone in
1758 His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton and left it
with the land to his only child a daughter who with her husband
one Fisher of Wellingborough sold it to Mr Isted now lord of the
manor there My grandfather had four sons that grew up viz Thomas
John Benjamin and Josiah I will give you what account I can of them
at this distance from my papers and if these are not lost in my
absence you will among them find many more particulars

Thomas was bred a smith under his father but being ingenious and
encouraged in learning as all my brothers were by an Esquire Palmer
then the principal gentleman in that parish he qualified himself for
the business of scrivener became a considerable man in the county
was a chief mover of all publicspirited undertakings for the county
or town of Northampton and his own village of which many instances
were related of him and much taken notice of and patronized by the
then Lord Halifax He died in 1702 January 6 old style7 just four
years to a day before I was born The account we received of his life
and character from some old people at Ecton I remember struck you as
something extraordinary from its similarity to what you knew of mine
Had he died on the same day you said one might have supposed a
transmigration

    reckoning since Christ is not divisible by 4 as well as
    every year whose number is divisible by 100 but not by
    400 shall have 365 days and all other years shall have
    366 days In the eighteenth century there was a
    difference of eleven days between the old and the new
    style of reckoning which the English Parliament
    canceled by making the 3rd of September 1752 the 14th
    The Julian calendar or old style is still retained

    13 days behind those of other Christian countries

John was bred a dyer I believe of woollens Benjamin was bred a silk
dyer serving an apprenticeship at London He was an ingenious man I
remember him well for when I was a boy he came over to my father in
Boston and lived in the house with us some years He lived to a
great age His grandson Samuel Franklin now lives in Boston He left
behind him two quarto volumes MS of his own poetry consisting of
little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations of
which the following sent to me is a specimen8 He had formed a
shorthand of his own which he taught me but never practising it I
have now forgot it I was named after this uncle there being a
particular affection between him and my father He was very pious a
great attender of sermons of the best preachers which he took down in
his shorthand and had with him many volumes of them He was also
much of a politician too much perhaps for his station There fell
lately into my hands in London a collection he had made of all the
principal pamphlets relating to public affairs from 1641 to 1717
many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering but
there still remain eight volumes in folio and twentyfour in quarto
and in octavo A dealer in old books met with them and knowing me by
my sometimes buying of him he brought them to me It seems my uncle
must have left them here when he went to America which was about
fifty years since There are many of his notes in the margins

This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation and
continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary when they were
sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against
popery They had got an English Bible and to conceal and secure it
it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a
jointstool When my greatgreatgrandfather read it to his family he
turned up the jointstool upon his knees turning over the leaves then
under the tapes One of the children stood at the door to give notice
if he saw the apparitor coming who was an officer of the spiritual
court In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet
when the Bible remained concealed under it as before This anecdote I
had from my uncle Benjamin The family continued all of the Church of
England till about the end of Charles the Seconds reign when some of
the ministers that had been outed for nonconformity holding
conventicles9 in Northamptonshire Benjamin and Josiah adhered to
them and so continued all their lives the rest of the family
remained with the Episcopal Church

Josiah my father married young and carried his wife with three
children into New England about 1682 The conventicles having been
forbidden by law and frequently disturbed induced some considerable
men of his acquaintance to remove to that country and he was
prevailed with to accompany them thither where they expected to enjoy
their mode of religion with freedom By the same wife he had four
children more born there and by a second wife ten more in all
seventeen of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his
table who all grew up to be men and women and married I was the
youngest son and the youngest child but two and was born in Boston
New England10 My mother the second wife was Abiah Folger
daughter of Peter Folger one of the first settlers of New England of
whom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather11 in his church
history of that country entitled Magnalia Christi Americana as a
godly learned Englishman if I remember the words rightly I have
heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces but only one of
them was printed which I saw now many years since It was written in
1675 in the homespun verse of that time and people and addressed to
those then concerned in the government there It was in favour of
liberty of conscience and in behalf of the Baptists Quakers and
other sectaries that had been under persecution ascribing the Indian
wars and other distresses that had befallen the country to that
persecution as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an
offense and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws The whole
appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and
manly freedom The six concluding lines I remember though I have
forgotten the two first of the stanza but the purport of them was
that his censures proceeded from goodwill and therefore he would
be known to be the author

My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades I was
put to the grammarschool at eight years of age my father intending
to devote me as the tithe13 of his sons to the service of the
Church My early readiness in learning to read which must have been
very early as I do not remember when I could not read and the
opinion of all his friends that I should certainly make a good
scholar encouraged him in this purpose of his My uncle Benjamin
too approved of it and proposed to give me all his shorthand
volumes of sermons I suppose as a stock to set up with if I would
learn his character14 I continued however at the grammarschool
not quite one year though in that time I had risen gradually from the
middle of the class of that year to be the head of it and farther was
removed into the next class above it in order to go with that into
the third at the end of the year But my father in the meantime from
a view of the expense of a college education which having so large a
family he could not well afford and the mean living many so educated
were afterwards able to obtainreasons that he gave to his friends in
my hearingaltered his first intention took me from the
grammarschool and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic
kept by a then famous man Mr George Brownell very successful in
his profession generally and that by mild encouraging methods Under
him I acquired fair writing pretty soon but I failed in the
arithmetic and made no progress in it At ten years old I was taken
home to assist my father in his business which was that of a
tallowchandler and sopeboiler a business he was not bred to but
had assumed on his arrival in New England and on finding his dyeing
trade would not maintain his family being in little request
Accordingly I was employed in cutting wick for the candles filling
the dipping mould and the moulds for cast candles attending the shop
going of errands etc

I disliked the trade and had a strong inclination for the sea but my
father declared against it however living near the water I was much
in and about it learnt early to swim well and to manage boats and
when in a boat or canoe with other boys I was commonly allowed to
govern especially in any case of difficulty and upon other occasions
I was generally a leader among the boys and sometimes led them into
scrapes of which I will mention one instance as it shows an early
projecting public spirit tho not then justly conducted

There was a saltmarsh that bounded part of the millpond on the edge
of which at high water we used to stand to fish for minnows By much
trampling we had made it a mere quagmire My proposal was to build a
wharf there fit for us to stand upon and I showed my comrades a large
heap of stones which were intended for a new house near the marsh
and which would very well suit our purpose Accordingly in the
evening when the workmen were gone I assembled a number of my
playfellows and working with them diligently like so many emmets
sometimes two or three to a stone we brought them all away and built
our little wharf The next morning the workmen were surprised at
missing the stones which were found in our wharf Inquiry was made
after the removers we were discovered and complained of several of
us were corrected by our fathers and though I pleaded the usefulness
of the work mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not
honest

I think you may like to know something of his person and character He
had an excellent constitution of body was of middle stature but well
set and very strong he was ingenious could draw prettily was
skilled a little in music and had a clear pleasing voice so that
when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal as he
sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over it
was extremely agreeable to hear He had a mechanical genius too and
on occasion was very handy in the use of other tradesmens tools but
his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment
in prudential matters both in private and publick affairs In the
latter indeed he was never employed the numerous family he had to
educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to
his trade but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading
people who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of
the church he belonged to and showed a good deal of respect for his
judgment and advice he was also much consulted by private persons
about their affairs when any difficulty occurred and frequently
chosen an arbitrator between contending parties At his table he liked
to have as often as he could some sensible friend or neighbor to
converse with and always took care to start some ingenious or useful
topic for discourse which might tend to improve the minds of his
children By this means he turned our attention to what was good
just and prudent in the conduct of life and little or no notice was
ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table whether it
was well or ill dressed in or out of season of good or bad flavor
preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind so
that I was brot up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as
to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me and so
unobservant of it that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a
few hours after dinner what I dined upon This has been a convenience
to me in traveling where my companions have been sometimes very
unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate
because better instructed tastes and appetites

My mother had likewise an excellent constitution she suckled all her
ten children I never knew either my father or mother to have any
sickness but that of which they dyd he at 89 and she at 85 years of
age They lie buried together at Boston where I some years since
placed a marble over their grave15 with this inscription

                     Josiah Franklin
                           and
                     Abiah his wife
                   lie here interred
         They lived lovingly together in wedlock
                    fiftyfive years
       Without an estate or any gainful employment
             By constant labor and industry
                  with Gods blessing
             They maintained a large family
                      comfortably
            and brought up thirteen children
                 and seven grandchildren
                       reputably
               From this instance reader
        Be encouraged to diligence in thy calling
               And distrust not Providence
             He was a pious and prudent man
           She a discreet and virtuous woman
                 Their youngest son
            In filial regard to their memory
                  Places this stone
          J F born 1655 died 1744 Ætat 89
          A F born 1667 died 175285

    15 This marble having decayed the citizens of Boston
    in 1827 erected in its place a granite obelisk
    twentyone feet high bearing the original inscription
    quoted in the text and another explaining the erection
    of the monument

By my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old I usd
to write more methodically But one does not dress for private company
as for a publick ball Tis perhaps only negligence

To return I continued thus employed in my fathers business for two
years that is till I was twelve years old and my brother John who
was bred to that business having left my father married and set up
for himself at Rhode Island there was all appearance that I was
destined to supply his place and become a tallowchandler But my
dislike to the trade continuing my father was under apprehensions
that if he did not find one for me more agreeable I should break away
and get to sea as his son Josiah had done to his great vexation He
therefore sometimes took me to walk with him and see joiners
bricklayers turners braziers etc at their work that he might
observe my inclination and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other
on land It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen
handle their tools and it has been useful to me having learnt so
much by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a
workman could not readily be got and to construct little machines for
my experiments while the intention of making the experiment was fresh
and warm in my mind My father at last fixed upon the cutlers trade
and my uncle Benjamins son Samuel who was bred to that business in
London being about that time established in Boston I was sent to be
with him some time on liking But his expectations of a fee with me
displeasing my father I was taken home again

BEGINNING LIFE AS A PRINTER


From a child I was fond of reading and all the little money that came
into my hands was ever laid out in books Pleased with the Pilgrims
Progress my first collection was of John Bunyans works in separate
little volumes I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R Burtons
Historical Collections they were small chapmens books16 and
cheap 40 or 50 in all My fathers little library consisted chiefly
of books in polemic divinity most of which I read and have since
often regretted that at a time when I had such a thirst for
knowledge more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was
now resolved I should not be a clergyman Plutarchs Lives there was
in which I read abundantly and I still think that time spent to great
advantage There was also a book of DeFoes called an Essay on
Projects and another of Dr Mathers called Essays to do Good
which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on
some of the principal future events of my life

    16 Small books sold by chapmen or peddlers

This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a
printer though he had already one son James of that profession In
1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters
to set up his business in Boston I liked it much better than that of
my father but still had a hankering for the sea To prevent the
apprehended effect of such an inclination my father was impatient to
have me bound to my brother I stood out some time but at last was
persuaded and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years
old I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twentyone years of
age only I was to be allowed journeymans wages during the last year
In a little time I made great proficiency in the business and became
a useful hand to my brother I now had access to better books An
acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes
to borrow a small one which I was careful to return soon and clean
Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night when
the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the
morning lest it should be missed or wanted

And after some time an ingenious tradesman Mr Matthew Adams who
had a pretty collection of books and who frequented our
printinghouse took notice of me invited me to his library and
very kindly lent me such books as I chose to read I now took a fancy
to poetry and made some little pieces my brother thinking it might
turn to account encouraged me and put me on composing occasional
ballads One was called The Lighthouse Tragedy and contained an
account of the drowning of Captain Worthilake with his two daughters
the other was a sailors song on the taking of Teach or
Blackbeard the pirate They were wretched stuff in the
Grubstreetballad style17 and when they were printed he sent me
about the town to sell them The first sold wonderfully the event
being recent having made a great noise This flattered my vanity but
my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances and telling me
versemakers were generally beggars So I escaped being a poet most
probably a very bad one but as prose writing has been of great use to
me in the course of my life and was a principal means of my
advancement I shall tell you how in such a situation I acquired
what little ability I have in that way

    17 Grubstreet famous in English literature as the
    home of poor writers

There was another bookish lad in the town John Collins by name with
whom I was intimately acquainted We sometimes disputed and very fond
we were of argument and very desirous of confuting one another
which disputatious turn by the way is apt to become a very bad
habit making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the
contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice and thence
besides souring and spoiling the conversation is productive of
disgusts and perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for
friendship I had caught it by reading my fathers books of dispute
about religion Persons of good sense I have since observed seldom
fall into it except lawyers university men and men of all sorts
that have been bred at Edinborough

A question was once somehow or other started between Collins and me
of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning and their
abilities for study He was of opinion that it was improper and that
they were naturally unequal to it I took the contrary side perhaps a
little for disputes sake He was naturally more eloquent had a ready
plenty of words and sometimes as I thought bore me down more by his
fluency than by the strength of his reasons As we parted without
settling the point and were not to see one another again for some
time I sat down to put my arguments in writing which I copied fair
and sent to him He answered and I replied Three or four letters of
a side had passed when my father happened to find my papers and read
them Without entering into the discussion he took occasion to talk
to me about the manner of my writing observed that though I had the
advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing which I
owd to the printinghouse I fell far short in elegance of
expression in method and in perspicuity of which he convinced me by
several instances I saw the justice of his remarks and thence grew
more attentive to the manner in writing and determined to endeavor at
improvement

About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator18 It was
the third I had never before seen any of them I bought it read it
over and over and was much delighted with it I thought the writing
excellent and wished if possible to imitate it With this view I
took some of the papers and making short hints of the sentiment in
each sentence laid them by a few days and then without looking at
the book tryd to compleat the papers again by expressing each
hinted sentiment at length and as fully as it had been expressed
before in any suitable words that should come to hand Then I
compared my Spectator with the original discovered some of my
faults and corrected them But I found I wanted a stock of words or
a readiness in recollecting and using them which I thought I should
have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses since
the continual occasion for words of the same import but of different
length to suit the measure or of different sound for the rhyme
would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for
variety and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind and make
me master of it Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them
into verse and after a time when I had pretty well forgotten the
prose turned them back again I also sometimes jumbled my collections
of hints into confusion and after some weeks endeavored to reduce
them into the best order before I began to form the full sentences
and compleat the paper This was to teach me method in the arrangement
of thoughts By comparing my work afterwards with the original I
discovered many faults and amended them but I sometimes had the
pleasure of fancying that in certain particulars of small import I
had been lucky enough to improve the method of the language and this
encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable
English writer of which I was extremely ambitious My time for these
exercises and for reading was at night after work or before it began
in the morning or on Sundays when I contrived to be in the
printinghouse alone evading as much as I could the common attendance
on public worship which my father used to exact of me when I was under
his care and which indeed I still thought a duty thought I could
not as it seemed to me afford time to practise it

    18 A daily London journal comprising satirical essays
    on social subjects published by Addison and Steele in
    17111712 The Spectator and its predecessor the
    Tatler 1709 marked the beginning of periodical
    literature

When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book written by
one Tryon recommending a vegetable diet I determined to go into it
My brother being yet unmarried did not keep house but boarded
himself and his apprentices in another family My refusing to eat
flesh occasioned an inconveniency and I was frequently chid for my
singularity I made myself acquainted with Tryons manner of preparing
some of his dishes such as boiling potatoes or rice making hasty
pudding and a few others and then proposed to my brother that if he
would give me weekly half the money he paid for my board I would
board myself He instantly agreed to it and I presently found that I
could save half what he paid me This was an additional fund for
buying books But I had another advantage in it My brother and the
rest going from the printinghouse to their meals I remained there
alone and dispatching presently my light repast which often was no
more than a bisket or a slice of bread a handful of raisins or a tart
from the pastrycooks and a glass of water had the rest of the time
till their return for study in which I made the greater progress
from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which
usually attend temperance in eating and drinking

And now it was that being on some occasion made ashamd of my
ignorance in figures which I had twice failed in learning when at
school I took Cockers book of Arithmetick and went through the
whole by myself with great ease I also read Sellers and Shermys
books of Navigation and became acquainted with the little geometry
they contain but never proceeded far in that science And I read
about this time Locke On Human Understanding19 and the Art of
Thinking by Messrs du Port Royal20

    19 John Locke 16321704 a celebrated English
    philosopher founder of the socalled commonsense
    school of philosophers He drew up a constitution for
    the colonists of Carolina

    20 A noted society of scholarly and devout men
    occupying the abbey of Port Royal near Paris who
    published learned works among them the one here
    referred to better known as the Port Royal Logic

While I was intent on improving my language I met with an English
grammar I think it was Greenwoods at the end of which there were
two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic the latter
finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic21 method and
soon after I procurd Xenophons Memorable Things of Socrates wherein
there are many instances of the same method I was charmd with it
adopted it dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation
and put on the humble inquirer and doubter And being then from
reading Shaftesbury and Collins become a real doubter in many points
of our religious doctrine I found this method safest for myself and
very embarrassing to those against whom I used it therefore I took a
delight in it practisd it continually and grew very artful and
expert in drawing people even of superior knowledge into
concessions the consequences of which they did not foresee
entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate
themselves and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my
cause always deserved I continud this method some few years but
gradually left it retaining only the habit of expressing myself in
terms of modest diffidence never using when I advanced anything that
may possibly be disputed the words certainly undoubtedly or any
others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion but rather
say I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so it appears to
me or I should think it so or so for such and such reasons or I
imagine it to be so or it is so if I am not mistaken This habit
I believe has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion
to inculcate my opinions and persuade men into measures that I have
been from time to time engaged in promoting and as the chief ends of
conversation are to inform or to be informed to please or to
persuade I wish wellmeaning sensible men would not lessen their
power of doing good by a positive assuming manner that seldom fails
to disgust tends to create opposition and to defeat everyone of
those purposes for which speech was given to us to wit giving or
receiving information or pleasure For if you would inform a
positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may
provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention If you wish
information and improvement from the knowledge of others and yet at
the same time express yourself as firmly fixd in your present
opinions modest sensible men who do not love disputation will
probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error And by
such a manner you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing
your hearers or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire
Pope22 says judiciously

  Men should be taught as if you taught them not
   And things unknown proposd as things forgot

farther recommending to us

  To speak tho sure with seeming diffidence

And he might have coupled with this line that
which he has coupled with another I think
less properly

  For want of modesty is want of sense

If you ask Why less properly I must repeat the lines

  Immodest words admit of no defense
   For want of modesty is want of sense

Now is not want of sense where a man is so unfortunate as to want
it some apology for his want of modesty and would not the lines
stand more justly thus

  Immodest words admit but this defense
   That want of modesty is want of sense

This however I should submit to better judgments

My brother had in 1720 or 1721 begun to print a newspaper It was
the second that appeared in America23 and was called the New England
Courant The only one before it was the Boston NewsLetter I remember
his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking as
not likely to succeed one newspaper being in their judgment enough
for America At this time 1771 there are not less than
fiveandtwenty He went on however with the undertaking and after
having worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets I
was employed to carry the papers thro the streets to the customers

    23 Franklins memory does not serve him correctly here

He had some ingenious men among his friends who amusd themselves by
writing little pieces for this paper which gaind it credit and made
it more in demand and these gentlemen often visited us Hearing their
conversations and their accounts of the approbation their papers were
received with I was excited to try my hand among them but being
still a boy and suspecting that my brother would object to printing
anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine I contrived to
disguise my hand and writing an anonymous paper I put it in at
night under the door of the printinghouse It was found in the
morning and communicated to his writing friends when they calld in
as usual They read it commented on it in my hearing and I had the
exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation and that
in their different guesses at the author none were named but men of
some character among us for learning and ingenuity I suppose now that
I was rather lucky in my judges and that perhaps they were not really
so very good ones as I then esteemd them

Encouragd however by this I wrote and conveyed in the same way to
the press several more papers which were equally approvd and I kept
my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty
well exhausted and then I discovered24 it when I began to be
considered a little more by my brothers acquaintance and in a manner
that did not quite please him as he thought probably with reason
that it tended to make me too vain And perhaps this might be one
occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time
Though a brother he considered himself as my master and me as his
apprentice and accordingly expected the same services from me as he
would from another while I thought he demeand me too much in some he
requird of me who from a brother expected more indulgence Our
disputes were often brought before our father and I fancy I was
either generally in the right or else a better pleader because the
judgment was generally in my favor But my brother was passionate
and had often beaten me which I took extreamly amiss and thinking
my apprenticeship very tedious I was continually wishing for some
opportunity of shortening it which at length offered in a manner
unexpected

    24 Disclosed

Illustration I was employed to carry the papers thro the streets
to the customers

One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point which I
have now forgotten gave offense to the Assembly He was taken up
censurd and imprisond for a month by the speakers warrant I
suppose because he would not discover his author I too was taken up
and examind before the council but tho I did not give them any
satisfaction they contented themselves with admonishing me and
dismissed me considering me perhaps as an apprentice who was bound
to keep his masters secrets

During my brothers confinement which I resented a good deal
notwithstanding our private differences I had the management of the
paper and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it which my
brother took very kindly while others began to consider me in an
unfavorable light as a young genius that had a turn for libeling and
satyr My brothers discharge was accompanyd with an order of the
House a very odd one that James Franklin should no longer print
the paper called the New England Courant

There was a consultation held in our printinghouse among his friends
what he should do in this case Some proposed to evade the order by
changing the name of the paper but my brother seeing inconveniences
in that it was finally concluded on as a better way to let it be
printed for the future under the name of Benjamin Franklin and to
avoid the censure of the Assembly that might fall on him as still
printing it by his apprentice the contrivance was that my old
indenture should be returnd to me with a full discharge on the back
of it to be shown on occasion but to secure to him the benefit of my
service I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term
which were to be kept private A very flimsy scheme it was however
it was immediately executed and the paper went on accordingly under
my name for several months

At length a fresh difference arising between my brother and me I
took upon me to assert my freedom presuming that he would not venture
to produce the new indentures It was not fair in me to take this
advantage and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of my
life but the unfairness of it weighed little with me when under the
impressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged
him to bestow upon me though he was otherwise not an illnaturd man
perhaps I was too saucy and provoking

When he found I would leave him he took care to prevent my getting
employment in any other printinghouse of the town by going round and
speaking to every master who accordingly refusd to give me work I
then thought of going to New York as the nearest place where there
was a printer and I was rather inclind to leave Boston when I
reflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the
governing party and from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly
in my brothers case it was likely I might if I stayd soon bring
myself into scrapes and farther that my indiscreet disputations
about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people
as an infidel or atheist I determind on the point but my father now
siding with my brother I was sensible that if I attempted to go
openly means would be used to prevent me My friend Collins
therefore undertook to manage a little for me He agreed with the
captain of a New York sloop for my passage under the notion of my
being a young acquaintance of his So I sold some of my books to raise
a little money was taken on board privately and as we had a fair
wind in three days I found myself in New York near 300 miles from
home a boy of but 17 without the least recommendation to or
knowledge of any person in the place and with very little money in
my pocket

ARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA


My inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out or I might
now have gratifyd them But having a trade and supposing myself a
pretty good workman I offerd my service to the printer in the place
old Mr William Bradford who had been the first printer in
Pennsylvania but removed from thence upon the quarrel of George
Keith He could give me no employment having little to do and help
enough already but says he My son at Philadelphia has lately lost
his principal hand Aquilla Rose by death if you go thither I
believe he may employ you Philadelphia was a hundred miles further
I set out however in a boat for Amboy leaving my chest and things
to follow me round by sea

In crossing the bay we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails
to pieces prevented our getting into the Kill25 and drove us upon
Long Island In our way a drunken Dutchman who was a passenger too
fell overboard when he was sinking I reached through the water to
his shock pate and drew him up so that we got him in again His
ducking sobered him a little and he went to sleep taking first out
of his pocket a book which he desird I would dry for him It proved
to be my old favorite author Bunyans Pilgrims Progress in Dutch
finely printed on good paper with copper cuts a dress better than I
had ever seen it wear in its own language I have since found that it
has been translated into most of the languages of Europe and suppose
it has been more generally read than any other book except perhaps
the Bible Honest John was the first that I know of who mixd
narration and dialogue a method of writing very engaging to the
reader who in the most interesting parts finds himself as it were
brought into the company and present at the discourse De Foe in his
Cruso his Moll Flanders Religious Courtship Family Instructor and
other pieces has imitated it with success and Richardson26 has done
the same in his Pamela etc

    25 Kill van Kull the channel separating Staten Island
    from New Jersey on the north

    26 Samuel Richardson the father of the English novel
    wrote Pamela Clarissa Harlowe and the History of
    Sir Charles Grandison novels published in the form of
    letters

When we drew near the island we found it was at a place where there
could be no landing there being a great surff on the stony beach So
we dropt anchor and swung round towards the shore Some people came
down to the water edge and hallowd to us as we did to them but the
wind was so high and the surff so loud that we could not hear so as
to understand each other There were canoes on the shore and we made
signs and hallowd that they should fetch us but they either did not
understand us or thought it impracticable so they went away and
night coming on we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should
abate and in the meantime the boatman and I concluded to sleep if
we could and so crowded into the scuttle with the Dutchman who was
still wet and the spray beating over the head of our boat leakd
thro to us so that we were soon almost as wet as he In this manner
we lay all night with very little rest but the wind abating the
next day we made a shift to reach Amboy before night having been
thirty hours on the water without victuals or any drink but a bottle
of filthy rum and the water we saild on being salt

In the evening I found myself very feverish and went in to bed but
having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a
fever I followd the prescription sweat plentifully most of the
night my fever left me and in the morning crossing the ferry I
proceeded on my journey on foot having fifty miles to Burlington
where I was told I should find boats that would carry me the rest of
the way to Philadelphia

Illustration It rained very hard all the day

It rained very hard all the day I was thoroughly soakd and by noon
a good deal tired so I stopt at a poor inn where I staid all night
beginning now to wish that I had never left home I cut so miserable a
figure too that I found by the questions askd me I was suspected
to be some runaway servant and in danger of being taken up on that
suspicion However I proceeded the next day and got in the evening
to an inn within eight or ten miles of Burlington kept by one Dr
Brown He entered into conversation with me while I took some
refreshment and finding I had read a little became very sociable
and friendly Our acquaintance continud as long as he livd He had
been I imagine an itinerant doctor for there was no town in
England or country in Europe of which he could not give a very
particular account He had some letters and was ingenious but much
of an unbeliever and wickedly undertook some years after to
travesty the Bible in doggrel verse as Cotton had done Virgil By
this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light and
might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published but it
never was

At his house I lay that night and the next morning reachd
Burlington but had the mortification to find that the regular boats
were gone a little before my coming and no other expected to go
before Tuesday this being Saturday wherefore I returned to an old
woman in the town of whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the
water and askd her advice She invited me to lodge at her house till
a passage by water should offer and being tired with my foot
traveling I accepted the invitation She understanding I was a
printer would have had me stay at that town and follow my business
being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with She was very
hospitable gave me a dinner of oxcheek with great good will
accepting only of a pot of ale in return and I thought myself fixed
till Tuesday should come However walking in the evening by the side
of the river a boat came by which I found was going towards
Philadelphia with several people in her They took me in and as
there was no wind we rowd all the way and about midnight not
having yet seen the city some of the company were confident we must
have passed it and would row no farther the others knew not where we
were so we put toward the shore got into a creek landed near an old
fence with the rails of which we made a fire the night being cold
in October and there we remained till daylight Then one of the
company knew the place to be Coopers Creek a little above
Philadelphia which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek and
arrivd there about eight or nine oclock on the Sunday morning and
landed at the Marketstreet wharf

I have been the more particular in this description of my journey and
shall be so of my first entry into that city that you may in your
mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since
made there I was in my working dress my best clothes being to come
round by sea I was dirty from my journey my pockets were stuffd out
with shirts and stockings and I knew no soul nor where to look for
lodging I was fatigued with traveling rowing and want of rest I
was very hungry and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch
dollar and about a shilling in copper The latter I gave the people
of the boat for my passage who at first refusd it on account of my
rowing but I insisted on their taking it A man being sometimes more
generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty
perhaps thro fear of being thought to have but little

Then I walked up the street gazing about till near the markethouse I
met a boy with bread I had made many a meal on bread and inquiring
where he got it I went immediately to the bakers he directed me to
in Secondstreet and askd for bisket intending such as we had in
Boston but they it seems were not made in Philadelphia Then I
asked for a threepenny loaf and was told they had none such So not
considering or knowing the difference of money and the greater
cheapness nor the names of his bread I bade him give me threepenny
worth of any sort He gave me accordingly three great puffy rolls I
was surprisd at the quantity but took it and having no room in my
pockets walkd off with a roll under each arm and eating the other
Thus I went up Marketstreet as far as Fourthstreet passing by the
door of Mr Read my future wifes father when she standing at the
door saw me and thought I made as I certainly did a most awkward
ridiculous appearance Then I turned and went down Chestnutstreet and
part of Walnutstreet eating my roll all the way and coming round
found myself again at Marketstreet wharf near the boat I came in to
which I went for a draught of the river water and being filled with
one of my rolls gave the other two to a woman and her child that came
down the river in the boat with us and were waiting to go farther

Illustration She standing at the door saw me and thought I made
as I certainly did a most awkward ridiculous appearance

Thus refreshed I walked again up the street which by this time had
many cleandressed people in it who were all walking the same way I
joined them and thereby was led into the great meetinghouse of the
Quakers near the market I sat down among them and after looking round
awhile and hearing nothing said being very drowsy thro labour and want
of rest the preceding night I fell fast asleep and continud so till
the meeting broke up when one was kind enough to rouse me This was
therefore the first house I was in or slept in in Philadelphia

Walking down again toward the river and looking in the faces of
people I met a young Quaker man whose countenance I likd and
accosting him requested he would tell me where a stranger could get
lodging We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners Here
says he is one place that entertains strangers but it is not a
reputable house if thee wilt walk with me Ill show thee a better
He brought me to the Crooked Billet in Waterstreet Here I got a
dinner and while I was eating it several sly questions were asked
me as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance that I
might be some runaway

After dinner my sleepiness returnd and being shown to a bed I lay
down without undressing and slept till six in the evening was calld
to supper went to bed again very early and slept soundly till next
morning Then I made myself as tidy as I could and went to Andrew
Bradford the printers I found in the shop the old man his father
whom I had seen at New York and who traveling on horseback had got
to Philadelphia before me He introducd me to his son who receivd
me civilly gave me a breakfast but told me he did not at present
want a hand being lately supplid with one but there was another
printer in town lately set up one Keimer who perhaps might employ
me if not I should be welcome to lodge at his house and he would
give me a little work to do now and then till fuller business should
offer

The old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer and
when we found him Neighbour says Bradford I have brought to see
you a young man of your business perhaps you may want such a one He
askd me a few questions put a composing stick in my hand to see how
I workd and then said he would employ me soon though he had just
then nothing for me to do and taking old Bradford whom he had never
seen before to be one of the towns people that had a good will for
him enterd into a conversation on his present undertaking and
prospects while Bradford not discovering that he was the other
printers father on Keimers saying he expected soon to get the
greatest part of the business into his own hands drew him on by
artful questions and starting little doubts to explain all his
views what interest he relid on and in what manner he intended to
proceed I who stood by and heard all saw immediately that one of
them was a crafty old sophister and the other a mere novice Bradford
left me with Keimer who was greatly surprisd when I told him who the
old man was

Keimers printinghouse I found consisted of an old shatterd press
and one small wornout font of English which he was then using
himself composing an Elegy on Aquilla Rose before mentioned an
ingenious young man of excellent character much respected in the
town clerk of the Assembly and a pretty poet Keimer made verses
too but very indifferently He could not be said to write them for
his manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head
So there being no copy27 but one pair of cases and the Elegy likely
to require all the letter no one could help him I endeavourd to put
his press which he had not yet usd and of which he understood
nothing into order fit to be workd with and promising to come and
print off his Elegy as soon as he should have got it ready I
returnd to Bradfords who gave me a little job to do for the
present and there I lodged and dieted A few days after Keimer sent
for me to print off the Elegy And now he had got another pair of
cases28 and a pamphlet to reprint on which he set me to work

These two printers I found poorly qualified for their business
Bradford had not been bred to it and was very illiterate and Keimer
tho something of a scholar was a mere compositor knowing nothing of
presswork He had been one of the French prophets29 and could act
their enthusiastic agitations At this time he did not profess any
particular religion but something of all on occasion was very
ignorant of the world and had as I afterward found a good deal of
the knave in his composition He did not like my lodging at Bradfords
while I workd with him He had a house indeed but without
furniture so he could not lodge me but he got me a lodging at Mr
Reads before mentioned who was the owner of his house and my chest
and clothes being come by this time I made rather a more respectable
appearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first
happend to see me eating my roll in the street

    29 Protestants of the South of France who became
    fanatical under the persecutions of Louis XIV and
    thought they had the gift of prophecy They had as
    mottoes No Taxes and Liberty of Conscience

I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the
town that were lovers of reading with whom I spent my evenings very
pleasantly and gaining money by my industry and frugality I lived
very agreeably forgetting Boston as much as I could and not desiring
that any there should know where I resided except my friend Collins
who was in my secret and kept it when I wrote to him At length an
incident happened that sent me back again much sooner than I had
intended I had a brotherinlaw Robert Holmes master of a sloop
that traded between Boston and Delaware He being at Newcastle forty
miles below Philadelphia heard there of me and wrote me a letter
mentioning the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure
assuring me of their good will to me and that everything would be
accommodated to my mind if I would return to which he exhorted me
very earnestly I wrote an answer to his letter thankd him for his
advice but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a
light as to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended

FIRST VISIT TO BOSTON


Sir William Keith governor of the province was then at Newcastle
and Captain Holmes happening to be in company with him when my letter
came to hand spoke to him of me and showd him the letter The
governor read it and seemd surprisd when he was told my age He
said I appeard a young man of promising parts and therefore should
be encouraged the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones and
if I would set up there he made no doubt I should succeed for his
part he would procure me the public business and do me every other
service in his power This my brotherinlaw afterwards told me in
Boston but I knew as yet nothing of it when one day Keimer and I
being at work together near the window we saw the governor and
another gentleman which proved to be Colonel French of Newcastle
finely dressd come directly across the street to our house and
heard them at the door

Keimer ran down immediately thinking it a visit to him but the
governor inquird for me came up and with a condescension and
politeness I had been quite unusd to made me many compliments
desired to be acquainted with me blamd me kindly for not having made
myself known to him when I first came to the place and would have me
away with him to the tavern where he was going with Colonel French to
taste as he said some excellent Madeira I was not a little
surprised and Keimer stard like a pig poisond30 I went however
with the governor and Colonel French to a tavern at the corner of
Thirdstreet and over the Madeira he proposd my setting up my
business laid before me the probabilities of success and both he and
Colonel French assurd me I should have their interest and influence
in procuring the public business of both governments31 On my
doubting whether my father would assist me in it Sir William said he
would give me a letter to him in which he would state the advantages
and he did not doubt of prevailing with him So it was concluded I
should return to Boston in the first vessel with the governors
letter recommending me to my father In the meantime the intention was
to be kept a secret and I went on working with Keimer as usual the
governor sending for me now and then to dine with him a very great
honour I thought it and conversing with me in the most affable
familiar and friendly manner imaginable

    30 Temple Franklin considered this specific figure
    vulgar and changed it to stared with astonishment

    31 Pennsylvania and Delaware

About the end of April 1724 a little vessel offerd for Boston I
took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends The governor gave me
an ample letter saying many flattering things of me to my father and
strongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as
a thing that must make my fortune We struck on a shoal in going down
the bay and sprung a leak we had a blustering time at sea and were
obligd to pump almost continually at which I took my turn We
arrivd safe however at Boston in about a fortnight I had been
absent seven months and my friends had heard nothing of me for my
br Holmes was not yet returnd and had not written about me My
unexpected appearance surprisd the family all were however very
glad to see me and made me welcome except my brother I went to see
him at his printinghouse I was better dressd than ever while in his
service having a genteel new suit from head to foot a watch and my
pockets lind with near five pounds sterling in silver He receivd me
not very frankly lookd me all over and turnd to his work again

Illustration The journeymen were inquisitive

The journeymen were inquisitive where I had been what sort of a
country it was and how I likd it I praisd it much and the happy
life I led in it expressing strongly my intention of returning to it
and one of them asking what kind of money we had there I producd a
handful of silver and spread it before them which was a kind of
rareeshow32 they had not been usd to paper being the money of
Boston33 Then I took an opportunity of letting them see my watch
and lastly my brother still grum and sullen I gave them a piece
of eight34 to drink and took my leave This visit of mine offended
him extreamly for when my mother some time after spoke to him of a
reconciliation and of her wishes to see us on good terms together
and that we might live for the future as brothers he said I had
insulted him in such a manner before his people that he could never
forget or forgive it In this however he was mistaken

    32 A peepshow in a box

    33 There were no mints in the colonies so the metal
    money was of foreign coinage and not nearly so common as
    paper money which was printed in large quantities in
    America even in small denominations

    34 Spanish dollar about equivalent to our dollar

My father received the governors letter with some apparent surprise
but said little of it to me for some days when Capt Holmes returning
he showd it to him asked him if he knew Keith and what kind of man
he was adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to
think of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of
being at mans estate Holmes said what he could in favour of the
project but my father was clear in the impropriety of it and at
last gave a flat denial to it Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir
William thanking him for the patronage he had so kindly offered me
but declining to assist me as yet in setting up I being in his
opinion too young to be trusted with the management of a business so
important and for which the preparation must be so expensive

My friend and companion Collins who was a clerk in the postoffice
pleasd with the account I gave him of my new country determined to
go thither also and while I waited for my fathers determination he
set out before me by land to Rhode Island leaving his books which
were a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy to
come with mine and me to New York where he proposd to wait for me

My father tho he did not approve Sir Williams proposition was yet
pleasd that I had been able to obtain so advantageous a character
from a person of such note where I had resided and that I had been so
industrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a
time therefore seeing no prospect of an accommodation between my
brother and me he gave his consent to my returning again to
Philadelphia advisd me to behave respectfully to the people there
endeavour to obtain the general esteem and avoid lampooning and
libeling to which he thought I had too much inclination telling me
that by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I might save enough by
the time I was oneandtwenty to set me up and that if I came near
the matter he would help me out with the rest This was all I could
obtain except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mothers love
when I embarkd again for New York now with their approbation and
their blessing

The sloop putting in at Newport Rhode Island I visited my brother
John who had been married and settled there some years He received
me very affectionately for he always lovd me A friend of his one
Vernon having some money due to him in Pennsylvania about
thirtyfive pounds currency desired I would receive it for him and
keep it till I had his directions what to remit it in Accordingly he
gave me an order This afterwards occasiond me a good deal of
uneasiness

At Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York among
which were two young women companions and a grave sensible
matronlike Quaker woman with her attendants I had shown an obliging
readiness to do her some little services which impressd her I
suppose with a degree of good will toward me therefore when she saw
a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women which
they appeard to encourage she took me aside and said Young man I
am concernd for thee as thou hast no friend with thee and seems not
to know much of the world or of the snares youth is exposd to
depend upon it those are very bad women I can see it in all their
actions and if thee art not upon thy guard they will draw thee into
some danger they are strangers to thee and I advise thee in a
friendly concern for thy welfare to have no acquaintance with them
As I seemd at first not to think so ill of them as she did she
mentioned some things she had observd and heard that had escapd my
notice but now convincd me she was right I thankd her for her kind
advice and promisd to follow it When we arrivd at New York they
told me where they livd and invited me to come and see them but I
avoided it and it was well I did for the next day the captain missd
a silver spoon and some other things that had been taken out of his
cabin and knowing that these were a couple of strumpets he got a
warrant to search their lodgings found the stolen goods and had the
thieves punishd So tho we had escapd a sunken rock which we
scrapd upon in the passage I thought this escape of rather more
importance to me

At New York I found my friend Collins who had arrivd there some time
before me We had been intimate from children and had read the same
books together but he had the advantage of more time for reading and
studying and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning in which
he far outstript me While I livd in Boston most of my hours of
leisure for conversation were spent with him and he continud a sober
as well as an industrious lad was much respected for his learning by
several of the clergy and other gentlemen and seemed to promise
making a good figure in life But during my absence he had acquird
a habit of sotting with brandy and I found by his own account and
what I heard from others that he had been drunk every day since his
arrival at New York and behavd very oddly He had gamd too and
lost his money so that I was obligd to discharge his lodgings and
defray his expenses to and at Philadelphia which provd extremely
inconvenient to me

The then governor of New York Burnet son of Bishop Burnet hearing
from the captain that a young man one of his passengers had a great
many books desird he would bring me to see him I waited upon him
accordingly and should have taken Collins with me but that he was not
sober The govr treated me with great civility showd me his
library which was a very large one and we had a good deal of
conversation about books and authors This was the second governor who
had done me the honour to take notice of me which to a poor boy like
me was very pleasing

We proceeded to Philadelphia I received on the way Vernons money
without which we could hardly have finishd our journey Collins
wished to be employd in some countinghouse but whether they
discoverd his dramming by his breath or by his behaviour tho he
had some recommendations he met with no success in any application
and continud lodging and boarding at the same house with me and at
my expense Knowing I had that money of Vernons he was continually
borrowing of me still promising repayment as soon as he should be in
business At length he had got so much of it that I was distressd to
think what I should do in case of being calld on to remit it

His drinking continud about which we sometimes quarreld for when
a little intoxicated he was very fractious Once in a boat on the
Delaware with some other young men he refused to row in his turn I
will be rowd home says he We will not row you says I You
must or stay all night on the water says he just as you please
The others said Let us row what signifies it But my mind being
soured with his other conduct I continud to refuse So he swore he
would make me row or throw me overboard and coming along stepping
on the thwarts toward me when he came up and struck at me I clapped
my hand under his crutch and rising pitched him headforemost into
the river I knew he was a good swimmer and so was under little
concern about him but before he could get round to lay hold of the
boat we had with a few strokes pulld her out of his reach and ever
when he drew near the boat we askd if he would row striking a few
strokes to slide her away from him He was ready to die with
vexation and obstinately would not promise to row However seeing
him at last beginning to tire we lifted him in and brought him home
dripping wet in the evening We hardly exchangd a civil word
afterwards and a West India captain who had a commission to procure
a tutor for the sons of a gentleman at Barbados happening to meet
with him agreed to carry him thither He left me then promising to
remit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge the
debt but I never heard of him after

The breaking into this money of Vernons was one of the first great
errata of my life and this affair showd that my father was not much
out in his judgment when he supposd me too young to manage business
of importance But Sir William on reading his letter said he was too
prudent There was great difference in persons and discretion did not
always accompany years nor was youth always without it And since he
will not set you up says he I will do it myself Give me an
inventory of the things necessary to be had from England and I will
send for them You shall repay me when you are able I am resolvd to
have a good printer here and I am sure you must succeed This was
spoken with such an appearance of cordiality that I had not the least
doubt of his meaning what he said I had hitherto kept the proposition
of my setting up a secret in Philadelphia and I still kept it Had
it been known that I depended on the governor probably some friend
that knew him better would have advisd me not to rely on him as I
afterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises
which he never meant to keep Yet unsolicited as he was by me how
could I think his generous offers insincere I believd him one of the
best men in the world

I presented him an inventory of a little printhouse amounting by my
computation to about one hundred pounds sterling He likd it but
askd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types and
see that everything was good of the kind might not be of some
advantage Then says he when there you may make acquaintances
and establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way
I agreed that this might be advantageous Then says he get
yourself ready to go with Annis which was the annual ship and the
only one at that time usually passing between London and Philadelphia
But it would be some months before Annis saild so I continued
working with Keimer fretting about the money Collins had got from me
and in daily apprehensions of being calld upon by Vernon which
however did not happen for some years after

I believe I have omitted mentioning that in my first voyage from
Boston being becalmd off Block Island our people set about catching
cod and hauled up a great many Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution
of not eating animal food and on this occasion I considerd with my
master Tryon the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder
since none of them had or ever could do us any injury that might
justify the slaughter All this seemed very reasonable But I had
formerly been a great lover of fish and when this came hot out of
the fryingpan it smelt admirably well I balancd some time between
principle and inclination till I recollected that when the fish were
opened I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs then thought
I If you eat one another I dont see why we maynt eat you So I
dind upon cod very heartily and continued to eat with other people
returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet So
convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature since it
enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to
do

EARLY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA


Keimer and I livd on a pretty good familiar footing and agreed
tolerably well for he suspected nothing of my setting up He retained
a great deal of his old enthusiasms and lovd argumentation We
therefore had many disputations I used to work him so with my
Socratic method and had trepannd him so often by questions
apparently so distant from any point we had in hand and yet by
degrees led to the point and brought him into difficulties and
contradictions that at last he grew ridiculously cautious and would
hardly answer me the most common question without asking first
What do you intend to infer from that However it gave him so
high an opinion of my abilities in the confuting way that he
seriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he had of
setting up a new sect He was to preach the doctrines and I was to
confound all opponents When he came to explain with me upon the
doctrines I found several conundrums which I objected to unless I
might have my way a little too and introduce some of mine

Keimer wore his beard at full length because somewhere in the Mosaic
law it is said Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard He
likewise kept the Seventh day Sabbath and these two points were
essentials with him I dislikd both but agreed to admit them upon
condition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food I
doubt said he my constitution will not bear that I assurd him
it would and that he would be the better for it He was usually a
great glutton and I promised myself some diversion in half starving
him He agreed to try the practice if I would keep him company I did
so and we held it for three months We had our victuals dressd and
brought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood who had from
me a list of forty dishes to be prepard for us at different times
in all which there was neither fish flesh nor fowl and the whim
suited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it not
costing us above eighteenpence sterling each per week I have since
kept several Lents most strictly leaving the common diet for that
and that for the common abruptly without the least inconvenience so
that I think there is little in the advice of making those changes by
easy gradations I went on pleasantly but poor Keimer suffered
grievously tired of the project longd for the fleshpots of Egypt
and orderd a roast pig He invited me and two women friends to dine
with him but it being brought too soon upon table he could not
resist the temptation and ate the whole before we came

I had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read I had a great
respect and affection for her and had some reason to believe she had
the same for me but as I was about to take a long voyage and we
were both very young only a little above eighteen it was thought
most prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present as
a marriage if it was to take place would be more convenient after my
return when I should be as I expected set up in my business
Perhaps too she thought my expectations not so well founded as I
imagined them to be

My chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne Joseph
Watson and James Ralph all lovers of reading The two first were
clerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town Charles
Brockden the other was clerk to a merchant Watson was a pious
sensible young man of great integrity the others rather more lax in
their principles of religion particularly Ralph who as well as
Collins had been unsettled by me for which they both made me suffer
Osborne was sensible candid frank sincere and affectionate to his
friends but in literary matters too fond of criticizing Ralph was
ingenious genteel in his manners and extremely eloquent I think I
never knew a prettier talker Both of them were great admirers of
poetry and began to try their hands in little pieces Many pleasant
walks we four had together on Sundays into the woods near
Schuylkill where we read to one another and conferrd on what we
read

Illustration Many pleasant walks we four had together

Ralph was inclind to pursue the study of poetry not doubting but he
might become eminent in it and make his fortune by it alleging that
the best poets must when they first began to write make as many
faults as he did Osborne dissuaded him assurd him he had no genius
for poetry and advisd him to think of nothing beyond the business he
was bred to that in the mercantile way tho he had no stock he
might by his diligence and punctuality recommend himself to
employment as a factor and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his
own account I approvd the amusing ones self with poetry now and
then so far as to improve ones language but no farther

On this it was proposd that we should each of us at our next
meeting produce a piece of our own composing in order to improve by
our mutual observations criticisms and corrections As language and
expression were what we had in view we excluded all considerations of
invention by agreeing that the task should be a version of the
eighteenth Psalm which describes the descent of a Deity When the
time of our meeting drew nigh Ralph called on me first and let me
know his piece was ready I told him I had been busy and having
little inclination had done nothing He then showd me his piece for
my opinion and I much approvd it as it appeard to me to have great
merit Now says he Osborne never will allow the least merit in
anything of mine but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy He is
not so jealous of you I wish therefore you would take this piece
and produce it as yours I will pretend not to have had time and so
produce nothing We shall then see what he will say to it It was
agreed and I immediately transcribd it that it might appear in my
own hand

We met Watsons performance was read there were some beauties in it
but many defects Osbornes was read it was much better Ralph did it
justice remarked some faults but applauded the beauties He himself
had nothing to produce I was backward seemed desirous of being
excused had not had sufficient time to correct etc but no excuse
could be admitted produce I must It was read and repeated Watson
and Osborne gave up the contest and joind in applauding it Ralph
only made some criticisms and proposd some amendments but I
defended my text Osborne was against Ralph and told him he was no
better a critic than poet so he dropt the argument As they two went
home together Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor
of what he thought my production having restraind himself before as
he said lest I should think it flattery But who would have
imagind said he that Franklin had been capable of such a
performance such painting such force such fire He has even
improvd the original In his common conversation he seems to have no
choice of words he hesitates and blunders and yet good God how he
writes When we next met Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid
him and Osborne was a little laughed at

This transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet I
did all I could to dissuade him from it but he continued scribbling
verses till Pope cured him35 He became however a pretty good
prose writer More of him hereafter But as I may not have occasion
again to mention the other two I shall just remark here that Watson
died in my arms a few years after much lamented being the best of
our set Osborne went to the West Indies where he became an eminent
lawyer and made money but died young He and I had made a serious
agreement that the one who happend first to die should if possible
make a friendly visit to the other and acquaint him how he found
things in that separate state But he never fulfilld his promise

    35 In one of the later editions of the Dunciad occur
    the following lines

       Silence ye wolves while Ralph to Cynthia howls
       And makes night hideousanswer him ye owls

    To this the poet adds the following note

    James Ralph a name inserted after the first editions
    not known till he writ a swearingpiece called Sawney
    very abusive of Dr Swift Mr Gay and myself

FIRST VISIT TO LONDON


The governor seeming to like my company had me frequently to his
house and his setting me up was always mentiond as a fixed thing I
was to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends
besides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money
for purchasing the press and types paper etc For these letters I
was appointed to call at different times when they were to be ready
but a future time was still named Thus he went on till the ship
whose departure too had been several times postponed was on the point
of sailing Then when I calld to take my leave and receive the
letters his secretary Dr Bard came out to me and said the governor
was extremely busy in writing but would be down at Newcastle before
the ship and there the letters would be delivered to me

Ralph though married and having one child had determined to
accompany me in this voyage It was thought he intended to establish a
correspondence and obtain goods to sell on commission but I found
afterwards that thro some discontent with his wifes relations he
purposed to leave her on their hands and never return again Having
taken leave of my friends and interchangd some promises with Miss
Read I left Philadelphia in the ship which anchord at Newcastle
The governor was there but when I went to his lodging the secretary
came to me from him with the civillest message in the world that he
could not then see me being engaged in business of the utmost
importance but should send the letters to me on board wished me
heartily a good voyage and a speedy return etc I returned on board a
little puzzled but still not doubting

Mr Andrew Hamilton a famous lawyer of Philadelphia had taken
passage in the same ship for himself and son and with Mr Denham a
Quaker merchant and Messrs Onion and Russel masters of an iron work
in Maryland had engaged the great cabin so that Ralph and I were
forced to take up with a berth in the steerage and none on board
knowing us were considered as ordinary persons But Mr Hamilton and
his son it was James since governor returnd from Newcastle to
Philadelphia the father being recalld by a great fee to plead for a
seized ship and just before we saild Colonel French coming on
board and showing me great respect I was more taken notice of and
with my friend Ralph invited by the other gentlemen to come into the
cabin there being now room Accordingly we removd thither

Understanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governors
despatches I askd the captain for those letters that were to be
under my care He said all were put into the bag together and he could
not then come at them but before we landed in England I should have
an opportunity of picking them out so I was satisfied for the
present and we proceeded on our voyage We had a sociable company in
the cabin and lived uncommonly well having the addition of all Mr
Hamiltons stores who had laid in plentifully In this passage Mr
Denham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life
The voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one as we had a great deal of
bad weather

When we came into the Channel the captain kept his word with me and
gave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governors
letters I found none upon which my name was put as under my care I
picked out six or seven that by the handwriting I thought might be
the promised letters especially as one of them was directed to
Basket the kings printer and another to some stationer We arrivd
in London the 24th of December 1724 I waited upon the stationer who
came first in my way delivering the letter as from Governor Keith I
dont know such a person says he but opening the letter O this
is from Riddlesden I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal
and I will have nothing to do with him nor receive any letters from
him So putting the letter into my hand he turnd on his heel and
left me to serve some customer I was surprized to find these were not
the governors letters and after recollecting and comparing
circumstances I began to doubt his sincerity I found my friend
Denham and opened the whole affair to him He let me into Keiths
character told me there was not the least probability that he had
written any letters for me that no one who knew him had the
smallest dependence on him and he laught at the notion of the
governors giving me a letter of credit having as he said no credit
to give On my expressing some concern about what I should do he
advised me to endeavour getting some employment in the way of my
business Among the printers here said he you will improve
yourself and when you return to America you will set up to greater
advantage

Illustration So putting the letter into my hand

We both of us happend to know as well as the stationer that
Riddlesden the attorney was a very knave He had half ruind Miss
Reads father by persuading him to be bound for him By this letter it
appeard there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of
Hamilton supposd to be then coming over with us and that Keith was
concerned in it with Riddlesden Denham who was a friend of
Hamiltons thought he ought to be acquainted with it so when he
arrivd in England which was soon after partly from resentment and
illwill to Keith and Riddlesden and partly from goodwill to him I
waited on him and gave him the letter He thankd me cordially the
information being of importance to him and from that time he became
my friend greatly to my advantage afterwards on many occasions

But what shall we think of a governors playing such pitiful tricks
and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy It was a habit he had
acquired He wishd to please everybody and having little to give
he gave expectations He was otherwise an ingenious sensible man a
pretty good writer and a good governor for the people tho not for
his constituents the proprietaries whose instructions he sometimes
disregarded Several of our best laws were of his planning and passed
during his administration

Ralph and I were inseparable companions We took lodgings together in
Little Britain36 at three shillings and sixpence a weekas much as
we could then afford He found some relations but they were poor and
unable to assist him He now let me know his intentions of remaining
in London and that he never meant to return to Philadelphia He had
brought no money with him the whole he could muster having been
expended in paying his passage I had fifteen pistoles37 so he
borrowed occasionally of me to subsist while he was looking out for
business He first endeavoured to get into the playhouse believing
himself qualifyd for an actor but Wilkes38 to whom he applyd
advisd him candidly not to think of that employment as it was
impossible he should succeed in it Then he proposd to Roberts a
publisher in Paternoster Row39 to write for him a weekly paper like
the Spectator on certain conditions which Roberts did not approve
Then he endeavoured to get employment as a hackney writer to copy for
the stationers and lawyers about the Temple40 but could find no
vacancy

    Thames

I immediately got into work at Palmers then a famous printinghouse
in Bartholomew Close and here I continud near a year I was pretty
diligent but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to
plays and other places of amusement We had together consumed all my
pistoles and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth He seemd quite
to forget his wife and child and I by degrees my engagements with
Miss Read to whom I never wrote more than one letter and that was to
let her know I was not likely soon to return This was another of the
great errata of my life which I should wish to correct if I were to
live it over again In fact by our expenses I was constantly kept
unable to pay my passage

At Palmers I was employed in composing for the second edition of
Wollastons Religion of Nature Some of his reasonings not appearing
to me well founded I wrote a little metaphysical piece in which I
made remarks on them It was entitled A Dissertation on Liberty and
Necessity Pleasure and Pain I inscribed it to my friend Ralph I
printed a small number It occasiond my being more considerd by Mr
Palmer as a young man of some ingenuity tho he seriously
expostulated with me upon the principles of my pamphlet which to him
appeard abominable My printing this pamphlet was another erratum

While I lodgd in Little Britain I made an acquaintance with one
Wilcox a bookseller whose shop was at the next door He had an
immense collection of secondhand books Circulating libraries were
not then in use but we agreed that on certain reasonable terms
which I have now forgotten I might take read and return any of his
books This I esteemd a great advantage and I made as much use of it
as I could

My pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons a
surgeon author of a book entitled The Infallibility of Human
Judgment it occasioned an acquaintance between us He took great
notice of me called on me often to converse on those subjects
carried me to the Horns a pale alehouse inLane Cheapside
and introduced me to Dr Mandeville author of the Fable of the
Bees who had a club there of which he was the soul being a most
facetious entertaining companion Lyons too introduced me to Dr
Pemberton at Batsons Coffeehouse who promisd to give me an
opportunity sometime or other of seeing Sir Isaac Newton of which I
was extreamly desirous but this never happened

I had brought over a few curiosities among which the principal was a
purse made of the asbestos which purifies by fire Sir Hans Sloane
heard of it came to see me and invited me to his house in Bloomsbury
Square where he showd me all his curiosities and persuaded me to
let him add that to the number for which he paid me handsomely

In our house there lodgd a young woman a milliner who I think had
a shop in the Cloisters She had been genteelly bred was sensible and
lively and of most pleasing conversation Ralph read plays to her in
the evenings they grew intimate she took another lodging and he
followed her They livd together some time but he being still out
of business and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her
child he took a resolution of going from London to try for a country
school which he thought himself well qualified to undertake as he
wrote an excellent hand and was a master of arithmetic and accounts
This however he deemed a business below him and confident of future
better fortune when he should be unwilling to have it known that he
once was so meanly employed he changed his name and did me the
honour to assume mine for I soon after had a letter from him
acquainting me that he was settled in a small village in Berkshire I
think it was where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen
boys at sixpence each per week recommending Mrs T to my care
and desiring me to write to him directing for Mr Franklin
schoolmaster at such a place

He continued to write frequently sending me large specimens of an
epic poem which he was then composing and desiring my remarks and
corrections These I gave him from time to time but endeavourd
rather to discourage his proceeding One of Youngs Satires41 was
then just published I copyd and sent him a great part of it which
set in a strong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope of
advancement by them All was in vain sheets of the poem continued to
come by every post In the meantime Mrs T having on his account
lost her friends and business was often in distresses and usd to
send for me and borrow what I could spare to help her out of them I
grew fond of her company and being at that time under no religious
restraint and presuming upon my importance to her I attempted
familiarities another erratum which she repulsd with a proper
resentment and acquainted him with my behaviour This made a breach
between us and when he returned again to London he let me know he
thought I had cancelld all the obligations he had been under to me
So I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him or
advancd for him This however was not then of much consequence as
he was totally unable and in the loss of his friendship I found
myself relieved from a burthen I now began to think of getting a
little money beforehand and expecting better work I left Palmers
to work at Wattss near Lincolns Inn Fields a still greater
printinghouse42 Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London

    satires Vol III Epist ii page 70

    42 The printing press at which Franklin worked is
    preserved in the Patent Office at Washington

At my first admission into this printinghouse I took to working at
press imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been usd
to in America where presswork is mixd with composing I drank only
water the other workmen near fifty in number were great guzzlers of
beer On occasion I carried up and down stairs a large form of types
in each hand when others carried but one in both hands They wondered
to see from this and several instances that the WaterAmerican as
they called me was stronger than themselves who drank strong
beer We had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to
supply the workmen My companion at the press drank every day a pint
before breakfast a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese a
pint between breakfast and dinner a pint at dinner a pint in the
afternoon about six oclock and another when he had done his days
work I thought it a detestable custom but it was necessary he
supposd to drink strong beer that he might be strong to labour
I endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by
beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley
dissolved in the water of which it was made that there was more flour
in a pennyworth of bread and therefore if he would eat that with a
pint of water it would give him more strength than a quart of beer
He drank on however and had four or five shillings to pay out of his
wages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor an expense I was
free from And thus these poor devils keep themselves always under

Illustration I took to working at press

Watts after some weeks desiring to have me in the composingroom43
I left the pressmen a new bien venu or sum for drink being five
shillings was demanded of me by the compositors I thought it an
imposition as I had paid below the master thought so too and forbade
my paying it I stood out two or three weeks was accordingly considered
as an excommunicate and had so many little pieces of private mischief
done me by mixing my sorts transposing my pages breaking my matter
etc etc if I were ever so little out of the room and all ascribed
to the chappel ghost which they said ever haunted those not regularly
admitted that notwithstanding the masters protection I found myself
obligd to comply and pay the money convincd of the folly of being on
ill terms with those one is to live with continually

    43 Franklin now left the work of operating the printing
    presses which was largely a matter of manual labor and
    began setting type which required more skill and
    intelligence

I was now on a fair footing with them and soon acquird considerable
influence I proposd some reasonable alterations in their chappel
laws44 and carried them against all opposition From my example a
great part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer and bread
and cheese finding they could with me be supplyd from a neighbouring
house with a large porringer of hot watergruel sprinkled with
pepper crumbd with bread and a bit of butter in it for the price
of a pint of beer viz three halfpence This was a more comfortable
as well as cheaper breakfast and keep their heads clearer Those who
continued sotting with beer all day were often by not paying out of
credit at the alehouse and usd to make interest with me to get beer
their light as they phrased it being out I watchd the
paytable on Saturday night and collected what I stood engagd for
them having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their
accounts This and my being esteemd a pretty good riggite that
is a jocular verbal satirist supported my consequence in the
society My constant attendance I never making a St Monday45
recommended me to the master and my uncommon quickness at composing
occasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch which was generally
better paid So I went on now very agreeably

    44 A printing house is called a chapel because Caxton
    the first English printer did his printing in a chapel
    connected with Westminster Abbey

    Saturdays wages

My lodging in Little Britain being too remote I found another in
Dukestreet opposite to the Romish Chapel It was two pair of stairs
backwards at an Italian warehouse A widow lady kept the house she
had a daughter and a maid servant and a journeyman who attended the
warehouse but lodgd abroad After sending to inquire my character at
the house where I last lodgd she agreed to take me in at the same
rate 3s 6d per week cheaper as she said from the protection she
expected in having a man lodge in the house She was a widow an
elderly woman had been bred a Protestant being a clergymans
daughter but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband
whose memory she much revered had lived much among people of
distinction and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the
times of Charles the Second She was lame in her knees with the gout
and therefore seldom stirred out of her room so sometimes wanted
company and hers was so highly amusing to me that I was sure to
spend an evening with her whenever she desired it Our supper was
only half an anchovy each on a very little strip of bread and butter
and half a pint of ale between us but the entertainment was in her
conversation My always keeping good hours and giving little trouble
in the family made her unwilling to part with me so that when I
talkd of a lodging I had heard of nearer my business for two
shillings a week which intent as I now was on saving money made
some difference she bid me not think of it for she would abate me
two shillings a week for the future so I remained with her at one
shilling and sixpence as long as I staid in London

In a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy in the
most retired manner of whom my landlady gave me this account that
she was a Roman Catholic had been sent abroad when young and lodgd
in a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun but the country not
agreeing with her she returned to England where there being no
nunnery she had vowd to lead the life of a nun as near as might be
done in those circumstances Accordingly she had given all her estate
to charitable uses reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on
and out of this sum she still gave a great deal in charity living
herself on watergruel only and using no fire but to boil it She had
lived many years in that garret being permitted to remain there
gratis by successive Catholic tenants of the house below as they
deemed it a blessing to have her there A priest visited her to
confess her every day I have askd her says my landlady how she
as she livd could possibly find so much employment for a confessor
Oh said she it is impossible to avoid vain thoughts I was
permitted once to visit her She was cheerful and polite and
conversd pleasantly The room was clean but had no other furniture
than a matras a table with a crucifix and book a stool which she
gave me to sit on and a picture over the chimney of Saint Veronica
displaying her handkerchief with the miraculous figure of Christs
bleeding face on it46 which she explained to me with great
seriousness She lookd pale but was never sick and I give it as
another instance on how small an income life and health may be
supported

At Wattss printinghouse I contracted an acquaintance with an
ingenious young man one Wygate who having wealthy relations had
been better educated than most printers was a tolerable Latinist
spoke French and lovd reading I taught him and a friend of his to
swim at twice going into the river and they soon became good
swimmers They introducd me to some gentlemen from the country who
went to Chelsea by water to see the College and Don Salteros
curiosities47 In our return at the request of the company whose
curiosity Wygate had excited I stripped and leaped into the river
and swam from near Chelsea to Blackfriars48 performing on the way
many feats of activity both upon and under water that surprisd and
pleasd those to whom they were novelties

    46 The story is that she met Christ on His way to
    crucifixion and offered Him her handkerchief to wipe the
    blood from His face after which the handkerchief always
    bore the image of Christs bleeding face

    47 James Salter a former servant of Hans Sloane lived
    in Cheyne Walk Chelsea His house a barbershop was
    known as Don Salteros CoffeeHouse The curiosities
    were in glass cases and constituted an amazing and
    motley collectiona petrified crab from China a
    lignified hog Jobs tears Madagascar lances William
    the Conquerors flaming sword and Henry the Eighths
    coat of mailSmyth

    48 About three miles

I had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise had studied
and practisd all Thevenots motions and positions added some of my
own aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful All these
I took this occasion of exhibiting to the company and was much
flatterd by their admiration and Wygate who was desirous of
becoming a master grew more and more attachd to me on that account
as well as from the similarity of our studies He at length proposed
to me traveling all over Europe together supporting ourselves
everywhere by working at our business I was once inclined to it but
mentioning it to my good friend Mr Denham with whom I often spent an
hour when I had leisure he dissuaded me from it advising me to think
only of returning to Pennsylvania which he was now about to do

I must record one trait of this good mans character He had formerly
been in business at Bristol but failed in debt to a number of people
compounded and went to America There by a close application to
business as a merchant he acquired a plentiful fortune in a few
years Returning to England in the ship with me he invited his old
creditors to an entertainment at which he thankd them for the easy
composition they had favoured him with and when they expected
nothing but the treat every man at the first remove found under his
plate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaid
remainder with interest

He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia and should
carry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there
He proposd to take me over as his clerk to keep his books in which
he would instruct me copy his letters and attend the store He
added that as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantile
business he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and
bread etc to the West Indies and procure me commissions from
others which would be profitable and if I managd well would
establish me handsomely The thing pleasd me for I was grown tired
of London remembered with pleasure the happy months I had spent in
Pennsylvania and wishd again to see it therefore I immediately
agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year49 Pennsylvania money
less indeed than my present gettings as a compositor but affording
a better prospect

    49 About 167

I now took leave of printing as I thought forever and was daily
employed in my new business going about with Mr Denham among the
tradesmen to purchase various articles and seeing them packd up
doing errands calling upon workmen to dispatch etc and when all
was on board I had a few days leisure On one of these days I was
to my surprise sent for by a great man I knew only by name a Sir
William Wyndham and I waited upon him He had heard by some means or
other of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriars and of my teaching
Wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours He had two sons
about to set out on their travels he wishd to have them first taught
swimming and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them
They were not yet come to town and my stay was uncertain so I could
not undertake it but from this incident I thought it likely that
if I were to remain in England and open a swimmingschool I might get
a good deal of money and it struck me so strongly that had the
overture been sooner made me probably I should not so soon have
returned to America After many years you and I had something of more
importance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham
become Earl of Egremont which I shall mention in its place

Thus I spent about eighteen months in London most part of the time I
workd hard at my business and spent but little upon myself except in
seeing plays and in books My friend Ralph had kept me poor he owed
me about twentyseven pounds which I was now never likely to receive
a great sum out of my small earnings I lovd him notwithstanding
for he had many amiable qualities I had by no means improvd my
fortune but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance whose
conversation was of great advantage to me and I had read
considerably

BEGINNING BUSINESS IN
PHILADELPHIA


We saild from Gravesend on the 23rd of July 1726 For the incidents
of the voyage I refer you to my Journal where you will find them all
minutely related Perhaps the most important part of that journal is
the plan50 to be found in it which I formed at sea for
regulating my future conduct in life It is the more remarkable as
being formed when I was so young and yet being pretty faithfully
adhered to quite thro to old age

    50 Not found in the manuscript journal which was left
    among Franklins papersBigelow

We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October where I found sundry
alterations Keith was no longer governor being superseded by Major
Gordon I met him walking the streets as a common citizen He seemd a
little ashamd at seeing me but passd without saying anything I
should have been as much ashamd at seeing Miss Read had not her
friends despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my
letter persuaded her to marry another one Rogers a potter which
was done in my absence With him however she was never happy and
soon parted from him refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name
it being now said that he had another wife He was a worthless fellow
tho an excellent workman which was the temptation to her friends He
got into debt ran away in 1727 or 1728 went to the West Indies and
died there Keimer had got a better house a shop well supplyd with
stationery plenty of new types a number of hands tho none good
and seemd to have a great deal of business

Mr Denham took a store in Waterstreet where we opend our goods I
attended the business diligently studied accounts and grew in a
little time expert at selling We lodgd and boarded together he
counselld me as a father having a sincere regard for me I respected
and loved him and we might have gone on together very happy but in
the beginning of February 17267 when I had just passd my
twentyfirst year we both were taken ill My distemper was a
pleurisy which very nearly carried me off I suffered a good deal
gave up the point in my own mind and was rather disappointed when I
found myself recovering regretting in some degree that I must now
some time or other have all that disagreeable work to do over again
I forget what his distemper was it held him a long time and at
length carried him off He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative
will as a token of his kindness for me and he left me once more to
the wide world for the store was taken into the care of his
executors and my employment under him ended

Illustration Mr Denham took a store in Waterstreet

My brotherinlaw Holmes being now at Philadelphia advised my
return to my business and Keimer tempted me with an offer of large
wages by the year to come and take the management of his
printinghouse that he might better attend his stationers shop I
had heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and her
friends and was not fond of having any more to do with him I trid
for farther employment as a merchants clerk but not readily meeting
with any I closd again with Keimer I found in his house these
hands Hugh Meredith a Welsh Pennsylvanian thirty years of age bred
to country work honest sensible had a great deal of solid
observation was something of a reader but given to drink Stephen
Potts a young countryman of full age bred to the same of uncommon
natural parts and great wit and humor but a little idle These he
had agreed with at extream low wages per week to be raisd a shilling
every three months as they would deserve by improving in their
business and the expectation of these high wages to come on
hereafter was what he had drawn them in with Meredith was to work at
press Potts at bookbinding which he by agreement was to teach
them though he knew neither one nor tother John a wild
Irishman brought up to no business whose service for four
years Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship he too was
to be made a pressman George Webb an Oxford scholar whose time for
four years he had likewise bought intending him for a compositor of
whom more presently and David Harry a country boy whom he had taken
apprentice

I soon perceivd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much
higher than he had been usd to give was to have these raw cheap
hands formd thro me and as soon as I had instructed them then
they being all articled to him he should be able to do without me I
went on however very chearfully put his printinghouse in order
which had been in great confusion and brought his hands by degrees to
mind their business and to do it better

It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a
bought servant He was not more than eighteen years of age and gave
me this account of himself that he was born in Gloucester educated
at a grammarschool there had been distinguishd among the scholars
for some apparent superiority in performing his part when they
exhibited plays belongd to the Witty Club there and had written
some pieces in prose and verse which were printed in the Gloucester
newspapers thence he was sent to Oxford where he continued about a
year but not well satisfid wishing of all things to see London and
become a player At length receiving his quarterly allowance of
fifteen guineas instead of discharging his debts he walkd out of
town hid his gown in a furze bush and footed it to London where
having no friend to advise him he fell into bad company soon spent
his guineas found no means of being introducd among the players
grew necessitous pawnd his cloaths and wanted bread Walking the
street very hungry and not knowing what to do with himself a crimps
bill51 was put into his hand offering immediate entertainment and
encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America He
went directly signd the indentures was put into the ship and came
over never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of
him He was lively witty goodnaturd and a pleasant companion but
idle thoughtless and imprudent to the last degree

    51 A crimp was the agent of a shipping company Crimps
    were sometimes employed to decoy men into such service
    as is here mentioned

John the Irishman soon ran away with the rest I began to live very
agreeably for they all respected me the more as they found Keimer
incapable of instructing them and that from me they learned something
daily We never worked on Saturday that being Keimers Sabbath so I
had two days for reading My acquaintance with ingenious people in the
town increased Keimer himself treated me with great civility and
apparent regard and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon
which I was yet unable to pay being hitherto but a poor æconomist
He however kindly made no demand of it

Our printinghouse often wanted sorts and there was no letterfounder
in America I had seen types cast at Jamess in London but without
much attention to the manner however I now contrived a mould made
use of the letters we had as puncheons struck the mattrices in lead
and thus supplyd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies I also
engravd several things on occasion I made the ink I was
warehouseman and everything and in short quite a factotum

But however serviceable I might be I found that my services became
every day of less importance as the other hands improvd in the
business and when Keimer paid my second quarters wages he let me
know that he felt them too heavy and thought I should make an
abatement He grew by degrees less civil put on more of the master
frequently found fault was captious and seemd ready for an
outbreaking I went on nevertheless with a good deal of patience
thinking that his encumberd circumstances were partly the cause At
length a trifle snapt our connections for a great noise happening
near the courthouse I put my head out of the window to see what was
the matter Keimer being in the street lookd up and saw me calld
out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business adding
some reproachful words that nettled me the more for their publicity
all the neighbours who were looking out on the same occasion being
witnesses how I was treated He came up immediately into the
printinghouse continud the quarrel high words passd on both
sides he gave me the quarters warning we had stipulated expressing
a wish that he had not been obligd to so long a warning I told him
his wish was unnecessary for I would leave him that instant and so
taking my hat walkd out of doors desiring Meredith whom I saw
below to take care of some things I left and bring them to my
lodgings

Meredith came accordingly in the evening when we talked my affair
over He had conceivd a great regard for me and was very unwilling
that I should leave the house while he remaind in it He dissuaded me
from returning to my native country which I began to think of he
reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possessd that his
creditors began to be uneasy that he kept his shop miserably sold
often without profit for ready money and often trusted without
keeping accounts that he must therefore fail which would make a
vacancy I might profit of I objected my want of money He then let me
know that his father had a high opinion of me and from some
discourse that had passd between them he was sure would advance
money to set us up if I would enter into partnership with him My
time says he will be out with Keimer in the spring by that time
we may have our press and types in from London I am sensible I am no
workman if you like it your skill in the business shall be set
against the stock I furnish and we will share the profits equally

The proposal was agreeable and I consented his father was in town
and approvd of it the more as he saw I had great influence with his
son had prevailed on him to abstain long from dramdrinking and he
hopd might break him of that wretched habit entirely when we came to
be so closely connected I gave an inventory to the father who
carryd it to a merchant the things were sent for the secret was to
be kept till they should arrive and in the meantime I was to get
work if I could at the other printinghouse But I found no vacancy
there and so remained idle a few days when Keimer on a prospect of
being employd to print some paper money in New Jersey which would
require cuts and various types that I only could supply and
apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him sent
me a very civil message that old friends should not part for a few
words the effect of sudden passion and wishing me to return
Meredith persuaded me to comply as it would give more opportunity for
his improvement under my daily instructions so I returnd and we
went on more smoothly than for some time before The New Jersey jobb
was obtained I contrivd a copperplate press for it the first that
had been seen in the country I cut several ornaments and checks for
the bills We went together to Burlington where I executed the whole
to satisfaction and he received so large a sum for the work as to be
enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water

At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the
province Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a
committee to attend the press and take care that no more bills were
printed than the law directed They were therefore by turns
constantly with us and generally he who attended brought with him a
friend or two for company My mind having been much more improvd by
reading than Keimers I suppose it was for that reason my
conversation seemd to be more valud They had me to their houses
introduced me to their friends and showd me much civility while he
tho the master was a little neglected In truth he was an odd fish
ignorant of common life fond of rudely opposing receivd opinions
slovenly to extream dirtiness enthusiastic in some points of
religion and a little knavish withal

We continud there near three months and by that time I could reckon
among my acquired friends Judge Allen Samuel Bustill the secretary
of the Province Isaac Pearson Joseph Cooper and several of the
Smiths members of Assembly and Isaac Decow the surveyorgeneral
The latter was a shrewd sagacious old man who told me that he began
for himself when young by wheeling clay for brickmakers learned to
write after he was of age carrid the chain for surveyors who taught
him surveying and he had now by his industry acquird a good
estate and says he I foresee that you will soon work this man out
of his business and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia He had not
then the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere
These friends were afterwards of great use to me as I occasionally
was to some of them They all continued their regard for me as long as
they lived

Before I enter upon my public appearance in business it may be well
to let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles
and morals that you may see how far those influencd the future
events of my life My parents had early given me religious
impressions and brought me through my childhood piously in the
Dissenting way But I was scarce fifteen when after doubting by
turns of several points as I found them disputed in the different
books I read I began to doubt of Revelation itself Some books
against Deism52 fell into my hands they were said to be the
substance of sermons preached at Boyles Lectures It happened that
they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by
them for the arguments of the Deists which were quoted to be
refuted appeared to me much stronger than the refutations in short
I soon became a thorough Deist My arguments perverted some others
particularly Collins and Ralph but each of them having afterwards
wrongd me greatly without the least compunction and recollecting
Keiths conduct towards me who was another freethinker and my own
towards Vernon and Miss Read which at times gave me great trouble I
began to suspect that this doctrine tho it might be true was not
very useful My London pamphlet which had for its motto these lines
of Dryden53

  Whatever is is right Though purblind man
   Sees but a part o the chain the nearest link
   His eyes not carrying to the equal beam
   That poises all above

and from the attributes of God his infinite wisdom goodness and
power concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world
and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions no such things
existing appeard now not so clever a performance as I once thought
it and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself
unperceivd into my argument so as to infect all that followd as is
common in metaphysical reasonings

    52 The creed of an eighteenth century theological sect
    which while believing in God refused to credit the
    possibility of miracles and to acknowledge the validity
    of revelation

    53 A great English poet dramatist and critic
    16311700 The lines are inaccurately quoted from
    Drydens OEdipus Act III Scene I line 293

I grew convincd that truth sincerity and integrity in dealings
between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of
life and I formd written resolutions which still remain in my
journal book to practice them ever while I lived Revelation had
indeed no weight with me as such but I entertaind an opinion that
though certain actions might not be bad because they were forbidden
by it or good because it commanded them yet probably these actions
might be forbidden because they were bad for us or commanded
because they were beneficial to us in their own natures all the
circumstances of things considered And this persuasion with the kind
hand of Providence or some guardian angel or accidental favourable
circumstances and situations or all together preserved me thro
this dangerous time of youth and the hazardous situations I was
sometimes in among strangers remote from the eye and advice of my
father without any willful gross immorality or injustice that might
have been expected from my want of religion I say willful because
the instances I have mentioned had something of necessity in them
from my youth inexperience and the knavery of others I had
therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with I valued it
properly and determind to preserve it

We had not been long returnd to Philadelphia before the new types
arrivd from London We settled with Keimer and left him by his
consent before he heard of it We found a house to hire near the
market and took it To lessen the rent which was then but
twentyfour pounds a year tho I have since known it to let for
seventy we took in Thomas Godfrey a glazier and his family who
were to pay a considerable part of it to us and we to board with
them We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order
before George House an acquaintance of mine brought a countryman to
us whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer All our
cash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had been
obliged to procure and this countrymans five shillings being our
firstfruits and coming so seasonably gave me more pleasure than any
crown I have since earned and the gratitude I felt toward House has
made me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to
assist young beginners

There are croakers in every country always boding its ruin Such a
one then lived in Philadelphia a person of note an elderly man with
a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking his name was Samuel
Mickle This gentleman a stranger to me stopt one day at my door
and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new
printinghouse Being answered in the affirmative he said he was
sorry for me because it was an expensive undertaking and the expense
would be lost for Philadelphia was a sinking place the people
already halfbankrupts or near being so all appearances to the
contrary such as new buildings and the rise of rents being to his
certain knowledge fallacious for they were in fact among the things
that would soon ruin us And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes
now existing or that were soon to exist that he left me half
melancholy Had I known him before I engaged in this business
probably I never should have done it This man continued to live in
this decaying place and to declaim in the same strain refusing for
many years to buy a house there because all was going to
destruction and at last I had the pleasure of seeing him give five
times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first
began his croaking

I should have mentioned before that in the autumn of the preceding
year I had formd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of
mutual improvement which was called the Junto54 we met on Friday
evenings The rules that I drew up required that every member in his
turn should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals
Politics or Natural Philosophy to be discussd by the company and
once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing on
any subject he pleased Our debates were to be under the direction of
a president and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry
after truth without fondness for dispute or desire of victory and
to prevent warmth all expressions of positiveness in opinions or
direct contradiction were after some time made contraband and
prohibited under small pecuniary penalties

    54 A Spanish term meaning a combination for political
    intrigue here a club or society

The first members were Joseph Breintnal a copyer of deeds for the
scriveners a goodnaturd friendly middleagd man a great lover
of poetry reading all he could meet with and writing some that was
tolerable very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries and of
sensible conversation

Thomas Godfrey a selftaught mathematician great in his way and
afterward inventor of what is now called Hadleys Quadrant But he
knew little out of his way and was not a pleasing companion as like
most great mathematicians I have met with he expected universal
precision in everything said or was forever denying or distinguishing
upon trifles to the disturbance of all conversation He soon left us

Nicholas Scull a surveyor afterwards surveyorgeneral who lovd
books and sometimes made a few verses

William Parsons bred a shoemaker but loving reading had acquird a
considerable share of mathematics which he first studied with a view
to astrology that he afterwards laught at it He also became
surveyorgeneral

William Maugridge a joiner a most exquisite mechanic and a solid
sensible man

Hugh Meredith Stephen Potts and George Webb I have characterizd
before

Robert Grace a young gentleman of some fortune generous lively and
witty a lover of punning and of his friends

And William Coleman then a merchants clerk about my age who had
the coolest clearest head the best heart and the exactest morals of
almost any man I ever met with He became afterwards a merchant of
great note and one of our provincial judges Our friendship continued
without interruption to his death upwards of forty years and the
club continued almost as long and was the best school of philosophy
morality and politics that then existed in the province for our
queries which were read the week preceding their discussion put us
upon reading with attention upon the several subjects that we might
speak more to the purpose and here too we acquired better habits of
conversation everything being studied in our rules which might
prevent our disgusting each other From hence the long continuance of
the club which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of
hereafter

But my giving this account of it here is to show something of the
interest I had everyone of these exerting themselves in recommending
business to us Breintnal particularly procurd us from the Quakers
the printing forty sheets of their history the rest being to be done
by Keimer and upon this we workd exceedingly hard for the price was
low It was a folio pro patria size in pica with long primer
notes55 I composd of it a sheet a day and Meredith worked it off
at press it was often eleven at night and sometimes later before I
had finished my distribution for the next days work for the little
jobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back But so
determind I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio that
one night when having imposd56 my forms I thought my days work
over one of them by accident was broken and two pages reduced to
pi57 I immediately distributd and composed it over again before I
went to bed and this industry visible to our neighbors began to
give us character and credit particularly I was told that mention
being made of the new printingoffice at the merchants Everynight
club the general opinion was that it must fail there being already
two printers in the place Keimer and Bradford but Dr Baird whom
you and I saw many years after at his native place St Andrews in
Scotland gave a contrary opinion For the industry of that
Franklin says he is superior to anything I ever saw of the kind I
see him still at work when I go home from club and he is at work
again before his neighbors are out of bed This struck the rest and
we soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with
stationery but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business

    55 A sheet 812 by 1312 inches having the words
    pro patria in translucent letters in the body of the
    paper Picaa size of type as A B C D Long Primera
    smaller size of type as A B C D

    56 To arrange and lock up pages or columns of type in a
    rectangular iron frame ready for printing

    57 Reduced to complete disorder

I mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely
tho it seems to be talking in my own praise that those of my
posterity who shall read it may know the use of that virtue when
they see its effects in my favour throughout this relation

George Webb who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to
purchase his time of Keimer now came to offer himself as a
journeyman to us We could not then employ him but I foolishly let
him know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper and
might then have work for him My hopes of success as I told him were
founded on this that the then only newspaper printed by Bradford
was a paltry thing wretchedly managd no way entertaining and yet
was profitable to him I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely
fail of good encouragement I requested Webb not to mention it but he
told it to Keimer who immediately to be beforehand with me
published proposals for printing one himself on which Webb was to be
employd I resented this and to counteract them as I could not yet
begin our paper I wrote several pieces of entertainment for
Bradfords paper under the title of the Busy Body which Breintnal
continud some months By this means the attention of the publick was
fixed on that paper and Keimers proposals which we burlesqud and
ridiculd were disregarded He began his paper however and after
carrying it on three quarters of a year with at most only ninety
subscribers he offered it to me for a trifle and I having been
ready some time to go on with it took it in hand directly and it
provd in a few years extremely profitable to me

I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number though our
partnership still continud the reason may be that in fact the
whole management of the business lay upon me Meredith was no
compositor a poor pressman and seldom sober My friends lamented my
connection with him but I was to make the best of it

Illustration I see him still at work when I go home from club

Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in
the province a better type and better printed but some spirited
remarks of my writing on the dispute then going on between Governor
Burnet and the Massachusetts Assembly struck the principal people
occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talkd of and
in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers

Their example was followd by many and our number went on growing
continually This was one of the first good effects of my having
learnt a little to scribble another was that the leading men seeing
a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen
thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me Bradford still
printed the votes and laws and other publick business He had
printed an address of the House to the governor in a coarse
blundering manner we reprinted it elegantly and correctly and sent
one to every member They were sensible of the difference it
strengthened the hands of our friends in the House and they voted us
their printers for the year ensuing

Among my friends in the House I must not forget Mr Hamilton before
mentioned who was then returned from England and had a seat in it
He interested himself for me strongly in that instance as he did in
many others afterward continuing his patronage till his death58

    58 I got his son once £500Marg note

Mr Vernon about this time put me in mind of the debt I owd him
but did not press me I wrote him an ingenuous letter of
acknowledgment cravd his forbearance a little longer which he
allowd me and as soon as I was able I paid the principal with
interest and many thanks so that erratum was in some degree
corrected

But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least
reason to expect Mr Merediths father who was to have paid for our
printinghouse according to the expectations given me was able to
advance only one hundred pounds currency which had been paid and a
hundred more was due to the merchant who grew impatient and sud us
all We gave bail but saw that if the money could not be raisd in
time the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution and our
hopeful prospects must with us be ruined as the press and letters
must be sold for payment perhaps at half price

In this distress two true friends whose kindness I have never
forgotten nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing came
to me separately unknown to each other and without any application
from me offering each of them to advance me all the money that should
be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself if
that should be practicable but they did not like my continuing the
partnership with Meredith who as they said was often seen drunk in
the streets and playing at low games in alehouses much to our
discredit These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace I
told them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remaind
of the Merediths fulfilling their part of our agreement because I
thought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done
and would do if they could but if they finally faild in their
performance and our partnership must be dissolvd I should then
think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends

Thus the matter rested for some time when I said to my partner
Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken
in this affair of ours and is unwilling to advance for you and me
what he would for you alone If that is the case tell me and I will
resign the whole to you and go about my business No said he my
father has really been disappointed and is really unable and I am
unwilling to distress him farther I see this is a business I am not
fit for I was bred a farmer and it was a folly in me to come to
town and put myself at thirty years of age an apprentice to learn a
new trade Many of our Welsh people are going to settle in North
Carolina where land is cheap I am inclind to go with them and
follow my old employment You may find friends to assist you If you
will take the debts of the company upon you return to my father the
hundred pounds he has advanced pay my little personal debts and give
me thirty pounds and a new saddle I will relinquish the partnership
and leave the whole in your hands I agreed to this proposal it was
drawn up in writing signd and seald immediately I gave him what
he demanded and he went soon after to Carolina from whence he sent
me next year two long letters containing the best account that had
been given of that country the climate the soil husbandry etc
for in those matters he was very judicious I printed them in the
papers and they gave great satisfaction to the publick

As soon as he was gone I recurrd to my two friends and because I
would not give an unkind preference to either I took half of what
each had offered and I wanted of one and half of the other paid off
the companys debts and went on with the business in my own name
advertising that the partnership was dissolved I think this was in or
about the year 1729

BUSINESS SUCCESS AND FIRST
PUBLIC SERVICE


About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money
only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province and that
soon to be sunk59 The wealthy inhabitants opposd any addition
being against all paper currency from an apprehension that it would
depreciate as it had done in New England to the prejudice of all
creditors We had discussd this point in our Junto where I was on
the side of an addition being persuaded that the first small sum
struck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade employment
and number of inhabitants in the province since I now saw all the old
houses inhabited and many new ones building whereas I remembered
well that when I first walkd about the streets of Philadelphia
eating my roll I saw most of the houses in Walnut Street between
Second and Front streets60 with bills on their doors To be let
and many likewise in Chestnutstreet and other streets which made me
then think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after
another

    59 Recalled to be redeemed

    60 This part of Philadelphia is now the center of the
    wholesale business district

Our debates possessd me so fully of the subject that I wrote and
printed an anonymous pamphlet on it entitled The Nature and
Necessity of a Paper Currency It was well receivd by the common
people in general but the rich men dislikd it for it increasd and
strengthend the clamor for more money and they happening to have no
writers among them that were able to answer it their opposition
slackend and the point was carried by a majority in the House My
friends there who conceivd I had been of some service thought fit
to reward me by employing me in printing the money a very profitable
jobb and a great help to me This was another advantage gaind by my
being able to write

The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident
as never afterwards to be much disputed so that it grew soon to
fiftyfive thousand pounds and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds
since which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty
thousand pounds trade building and inhabitants all the while
increasing tho I now think there are limits beyond which the
quantity may be hurtful61

    61 Paper money is a promise to pay its face value in
    gold or silver When a state or nation issues more such
    promises than there is a likelihood of its being able to
    redeem the paper representing the promises depreciates
    in value Before the success of the Colonies in the
    Revolution was assured it took hundreds of dollars of
    their paper money to buy a pair of boots

I soon after obtaind thro my friend Hamilton the printing of the
Newcastle paper money another profitable jobb as I then thought it
small things appearing great to those in small circumstances and
these to me were really great advantages as they were great
encouragements He procured for me also the printing of the laws and
votes of that government which continud in my hands as long as I
followd the business

I now opend a little stationers shop I had in it blanks of all
sorts the correctest that ever appeard among us being assisted in
that by my friend Breintnal I had also paper parchment chapmens
books etc One Whitemash a compositor I had known in London an
excellent workman now came to me and workd with me constantly and
diligently and I took an apprentice the son of Aquilla Rose

Illustration I sometimes brought home the paper I purchasd at the
stores thro the streets on a wheelbarrow

I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the
printinghouse In order to secure my credit and character as a
tradesman I took care not only to be in reality industrious and
frugal but to avoid all appearances to the contrary I drest plainly
I was seen at no places of idle diversion I never went out a fishing
or shooting a book indeed sometimes debauchd me from my work but
that was seldom snug and gave no scandal and to show that I was
not above my business I sometimes brought home the paper I purchasd
at the stores thro the streets on a wheelbarrow Thus being esteemd
an industrious thriving young man and paying duly for what I bought
the merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom others
proposed supplying me with books and I went on swimmingly In the
meantime Keimers credit and business declining daily he was at last
forcd to sell his printinghouse to satisfy his creditors He went to
Barbadoes and there lived some years in very poor circumstances

His apprentice David Harry whom I had instructed while I workd with
him set up in his place at Philadelphia having bought his materials
I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry as his
friends were very able and had a good deal of interest I therefore
proposd a partnership to him which he fortunately for me rejected
with scorn He was very proud dressd like a gentleman livd
expensively took much diversion and pleasure abroad ran in debt and
neglected his business upon which all business left him and
finding nothing to do he followed Keimer to Barbadoes taking the
printinghouse with him There this apprentice employd his former
master as a journeyman they quarrelld often Harry went continually
behindhand and at length was forcd to sell his types and return to
his country work in Pennsylvania The person that bought them employd
Keimer to use them but in a few years he died

There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the old
one Bradford who was rich and easy did a little printing now and
then by straggling hands but was not very anxious about the business
However as he kept the postoffice it was imagined he had better
opportunities of obtaining news his paper was thought a better
distributer of advertisements than mine and therefore had many more
which was a profitable thing to him and a disadvantage to me for
tho I did indeed receive and send papers by the post yet the publick
opinion was otherwise for what I did send was by bribing the riders
who took them privately Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it
which occasiond some resentment on my part and I thought so meanly
of him for it that when I afterward came into his situation I took
care never to imitate it

I had hitherto continud to board with Godfrey who lived in part of
my house with his wife and children and had one side of the shop for
his glaziers business tho he worked little being always absorbed
in his mathematics Mrs Godfrey projected a match for me with a
relations daughter took opportunities of bringing us often together
till a serious courtship on my part ensud the girl being in herself
very deserving The old folks encouragd me by continual invitations
to supper and by leaving us together till at length it was time to
explain Mrs Godfrey managd our little treaty I let her know that I
expected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my
remaining debt for the printinghouse which I believe was not then
above a hundred pounds She brought me word they had no such sum to
spare I said they might mortgage their house in the loanoffice The
answer to this after some days was that they did not approve the
match that on inquiry of Bradford they had been informed the
printing business was not a profitable one the types would soon be
worn out and more wanted that S Keimer and D Harry had failed one
after the other and I should probably soon follow them and
therefore I was forbidden the house and the daughter shut up

Whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice on a
supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract and
therefore that we should steal a marriage which would leave them at
liberty to give or withhold what they pleasd I know not but I
suspected the latter resented it and went no more Mrs Godfrey
brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their
disposition and would have drawn me on again but I declared
absolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family
This was resented by the Godfreys we differed and they removed
leaving me the whole house and I resolved to take no more inmates

But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage I lookd round
me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places but soon found
that the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one I
was not to expect money with a wife unless with such a one as I
should not otherwise think agreeable A friendly correspondence as
neighbours and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs
Reads family who all had a regard for me from the time of my first
lodging in their house I was often invited there and consulted in
their affairs wherein I sometimes was of service I pitid poor Miss
Reads unfortunate situation who was generally dejected seldom
chearful and avoided company I considered my giddiness and
inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her
unhappiness tho the mother was good enough to think the fault more
her own than mine as she had prevented our marrying before I went
thither and persuaded the other match in my absence Our mutual
affection was revived but there were now great objections to our
union The match was indeed looked upon as invalid a preceding wife
being said to be living in England but this could not easily be
provd because of the distance and tho there was a report of his
death it was not certain Then tho it should be true he had left
many debts which his successor might be calld upon to pay We
ventured however over all these difficulties and I took her to
wife September 1st 1730 None of the inconveniences happened that we
had apprehended she proved a good and faithful helpmate62 assisted
me much by attending the shop we throve together and have ever
mutually endeavourd to make each other happy Thus I corrected that
great erratum as well as I could

    62 Mrs Franklin survived her marriage over forty
    years Franklins correspondence abounds with evidence
    that their union was a happy one We are grown old
    together and if she has any faults I am so used to
    them that I dont perceive them The following is a
    stanza from one of Franklins own songs written for the
    Junto

      Of their Chloes and Phyllises poets may prate
         I sing my plain country Joan
       These twelve years my wife still the joy of my life
         Blest day that I made her my own

About this time our club meeting not at a tavern but in a little
room of Mr Graces set apart for that purpose a proposition was
made by me that since our books were often referrd to in our
disquisitions upon the queries it might be convenient to us to have
them altogether where we met that upon occasion they might be
consulted and by thus clubbing our books to a common library we
should while we likd to keep them together have each of us the
advantage of using the books of all the other members which would be
nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole It was likd and
agreed to and we filld one end of the room with such books as we
could best spare The number was not so great as we expected and tho
they had been of great use yet some inconveniences occurring for want
of due care of them the collection after about a year was
separated and each took his books home again

And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature that for a
subscription library I drew up the proposals got them put into form
by our great scrivener Brockden and by the help of my friends in
the Junto procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin
with and ten shillings a year for fifty years the term our company
was to continue We afterwards obtaind a charter the company being
increased to one hundred this was the mother of all the North
American subscription libraries now so numerous It is become a great
thing itself and continually increasing These libraries have
improved the general conversation of the Americans made the common
tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other
countries and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so
generally made throughout the colonies in defense of their
privileges63

Mem° Thus far was written with the intention expressd in the
beginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no
importance to others What follows was written many years after in
compliance with the advice containd in these letters and accordingly
intended for the public The affairs of the Revolution occasiond the
interruption64

    63 Here the first part of the Autobiography written
    at Twyford in 1771 ends The second part which
    follows was written at Passy in 1784

    64 After this memorandum Franklin inserted letters
    from Abel James and Benjamin Vaughan urging him to
    continue his Autobiography

Continuation of the Account of my Life begun at Passy near Paris
1784

It is some time since I receivd the above letters but I have been
too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain
It might too be much better done if I were at home among my papers
which would aid my memory and help to ascertain dates but my return
being uncertain and having just now a little leisure I will
endeavour to recollect and write what I can if I live to get home it
may there be corrected and improvd

Not having any copy here of what is already written I know not
whether an account is given of the means I used to establish the
Philadelphia public library which from a small beginning is now
become so considerable though I remember to have come down to near
the time of that transaction 1730 I will therefore begin here with
an account of it which may be struck out if found to have been
already given

At the time I establishd myself in Pennsylvania there was not a good
booksellers shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston
In New York and Philada the printers were indeed stationers they
sold only paper etc almanacs ballads and a few common
schoolbooks Those who lovd reading were obliged to send for their
books from England the members of the Junto had each a few We had
left the alehouse where we first met and hired a room to hold our
club in I proposd that we should all of us bring our books to that
room where they would not only be ready to consult in our
conferences but become a common benefit each of us being at liberty
to borrow such as he wishd to read at home This was accordingly
done and for some time contented us

Finding the advantage of this little collection I proposd to render
the benefit from books more common by commencing a public
subscription library I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would
be necessary and got a skilful conveyancer Mr Charles Brockden to
put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed by
which each subscriber engagd to pay a certain sum down for the first
purchase of books and an annual contribution for increasing them So
few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia and the majority of
us so poor that I was not able with great industry to find more
than fifty persons mostly young tradesmen willing to pay down for
this purpose forty shillings each and ten shillings per annum On
this little fund we began The books were imported the library was
opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers on their
promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned The
institution soon manifested its utility was imitated by other towns
and in other provinces The libraries were augmented by donations
reading became fashionable and our people having no publick
amusements to divert their attention from study became better
acquainted with books and in a few years were observd by strangers
to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same
rank generally are in other countries

When we were about to sign the above mentioned articles which were
to be binding on us our heirs etc for fifty years Mr Brockden
the scrivener said to us You are young men but it is scarcely
probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term
fixd in the instrument A number of us however are yet living but
the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that
incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company

The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the
subscriptions made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting ones
self as the proposer of any useful project that might be supposd to
raise ones reputation in the smallest degree above that of ones
neighbours when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that
project I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight and
stated it as a scheme of a number of friends who had requested me
to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading
In this way my affair went on more smoothly and I ever after
practisd it on such occasions and from my frequent successes can
heartily recommend it The present little sacrifice of your vanity
will afterwards be amply repaid If it remains a while uncertain to
whom the merit belongs someone more vain than yourself will be
encouraged to claim it and then even envy will be disposed to do you
justice by plucking those assumed feathers and restoring them to
their right owner

This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study
for which I set apart an hour or two each day and thus repaird in
some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended
for me Reading was the only amusement I allowd myself I spent no
time in taverns games or frolicks of any kind and my industry in
my business continud as indefatigable as it was necessary I was
indebted for my printinghouse I had a young family coming on to be
educated and I had to contend with for business two printers who
were established in the place before me My circumstances however
grew daily easier My original habits of frugality continuing and my
father having among his instructions to me when a boy frequently
repeated a proverb of Solomon Seest thou a man diligent in his
calling he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean
men I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth
and distinction which encouragd me tho I did not think that I
should ever literally stand before kings which however has since
happened for I have stood before five and even had the honor of
sitting down with one the King of Denmark to dinner

We have an English proverb that says He that would thrive must ask
his wife It was lucky for me that I had one as much disposd to
industry and frugality as myself She assisted me chearfully in my
business folding and stitching pamphlets tending shop purchasing
old linen rags for the papermakers etc etc We kept no idle
servants our table was plain and simple our furniture of the
cheapest For instance my breakfast was a long time break and milk
no tea and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer with a
pewter spoon But mark how luxury will enter families and make a
progress in spite of principle being calld one morning to
breakfast I found it in a China bowl with a spoon of silver They
had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife and had cost
her the enormous sum of threeandtwenty shillings for which she had
no other excuse or apology to make but that she thought her husband
deservd a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his
neighbors This was the first appearance of plate and China in our
house which afterward in a course of years as our wealth increasd
augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value

I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian and though some of
the dogmas of that persuasion such as the eternal decrees of God
election reprobation etc appeared to me unintelligible
others doubtful and I early absented myself from the public
assemblies of the sect Sunday being my studying day I never was
without some religious principles I never doubted for instance the
existence of the Deity that he made the world and governd it by his
Providence that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good
to man that our souls are immortal and that all crime will be
punished and virtue rewarded either here or hereafter These I
esteemd the essentials of every religion and being to be found in
all the religions we had in our country I respected them all tho
with different degrees of respect as I found them more or less mixd
with other articles which without any tendency to inspire promote
or confirm morality servd principally to divide us and make us
unfriendly to one another This respect to all with an opinion that
the worst had some good effects inducd me to avoid all discourse
that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his
own religion and as our province increasd in people and new places
of worship were continually wanted and generally erected by voluntary
contribution my mite for such purpose whatever might be the sect
was never refused

Tho I seldom attended any public worship I had still an opinion of
its propriety and of its utility when rightly conducted and I
regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only
Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia He usd to
visit me sometimes as a friend and admonished me to attend his
administrations and I was now and then prevaild on to do so once
for five Sundays successively Had he been in my opinion a good
preacher perhaps I might have continued65 notwithstanding the
occasion I had for the Sundays leisure in my course of study but his
discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments or explications of
the peculiar doctrines of our sect and were all to me very dry
uninteresting and unedifying since not a single moral principle was
inculcated or enforcd their aim seeming to be rather to make us
Presbyterians than good citizens

    65 Franklin expressed a different view about the duty
    of attending church later

At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of
Philippians Finally brethren whatsoever things are true honest
just pure lovely or of good report if there be any virtue or any
praise think on these things And I imagind in a sermon on such a
text we could not miss of having some morality But he confind
himself to five points only as meant by the apostle viz 1 Keeping
holy the Sabbath day 2 Being diligent in reading the holy
Scriptures 3 Attending duly the publick worship 4 Partaking of the
Sacrament 5 Paying a due respect to Gods ministers These might be
all good things but as they were not the kind of good things that I
expected from that text I despaired of ever meeting with them from
any other was disgusted and attended his preaching no more I had
some years before composd a little Liturgy or form of prayer for my
own private use viz in 1728 entitled Articles of Belief and
Acts of Religion I returnd to the use of this and went no more to
the public assemblies My conduct might be blameable but I leave it
without attempting further to excuse it my present purpose being to
relate facts and not to make apologies for them




IX

PLAN FOR ATTAINING MORAL
PERFECTION


It was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of
arriving at moral perfection I wishd to live without committing any
fault at any time I would conquer all that either natural
inclination custom or company might lead me into As I knew or
thought I knew what was right and wrong I did not see why I might
not always do the one and avoid the other But I soon found I had
undertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined66 While my
care was employd in guarding against one fault I was often surprised
by another habit took the advantage of inattention inclination was
sometimes too strong for reason I concluded at length that the mere
speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely
virtuous was not sufficient to prevent our slipping and that the
contrary habits must be broken and good ones acquired and
established before we can have any dependence on a steady uniform
rectitude of conduct For this purpose I therefore contrived the
following method

    66 Compare Philippians iv 8

In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my
reading I found the catalogue more or less numerous as different
writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name Temperance
for example was by some confined to eating and drinking while by
others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure
appetite inclination or passion bodily or mental even to our
avarice and ambition I proposd to myself for the sake of clearness
to use rather more names with fewer ideas annexd to each than a few
names with more ideas and I included under thirteen names of virtues
all that at that time occurrd to me as necessary or desirable and
annexed to each a short precept which fully expressd the extent I
gave to its meaning

These names of virtues with their precepts were

1 Temperance

Eat not to dullness drink not to elevation

2 Silence

Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself avoid trifling
conversation

3 Order

Let all your things have their places let each part of your business
have its time

4 Resolution

Resolve to perform what you ought perform without fail what you
resolve

5 Frugality

Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself i e waste
nothing

6 INDUSTRY

Lose no time be always employd in something useful cut off all
unnecessary actions

7 Sincerity

Use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justly and if you speak
speak accordingly

8 Justice

Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your
duty

9 Moderation

Avoid extreams forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they
deserve

10 Cleanliness

Tolerate no uncleanliness in body cloaths or habitation

11 Tranquillity

Be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable

12 Chastity

13 Humility

Imitate Jesus and Socrates

My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues I
judgd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the
whole at once but to fix it on one of them at a time and when I
should be master of that then to proceed to another and so on till
I should have gone thro the thirteen and as the previous
acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain
others I arrangd them with that view as they stand above
Temperance first as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness
of head which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept
up and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient
habits and the force of perpetual temptations This being acquird
and establishd Silence would be more easy and my desire being to
gain knowledge at the same time that I improvd in virtue and
considering that in conversation it was obtaind rather by the use of
the ears than of the tongue and therefore wishing to break a habit I
was getting into of prattling punning and joking which only made me
acceptable to trifling company I gave Silence the second place
This and the next Order I expected would allow me more time for
attending to my project and my studies Resolution once become
habitual would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the
subsequent virtues Frugality and Industry freeing me from my
remaining debt and producing affluence and independence would make
more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice etc etc Conceiving
then that agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras67 in his Golden
Verses daily examination would be necessary I contrived the
following method for conducting that examination

I made a little book in which I allotted a page for each of the
virtues68 I ruld each page with red ink so as to have seven
columns one for each day of the week marking each column with a
letter for the day I crossd these columns with thirteen red lines
marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the
virtues on which line and in its proper column I might mark by a
little black spot every fault I found upon examination to have been
committed respecting that virtue upon that day

    67 A famous Greek philosopher who lived about 582500
    B C The Golden Verses here ascribed to him are
    probably of later origin The time which he recommends
    for this work is about even or bedtime that we may
    conclude the action of the day with the judgment of
    conscience making the examination of our conversation
    an evening song to God

I determined to give a weeks strict attention to each of the virtues
successively Thus in the first week my great guard was to avoid
every the least offense against Temperance leaving the other
virtues to their ordinary chance only marking every evening the
faults of the day Thus if in the first week I could keep my first
line marked T clear of spots I supposd the habit of that virtue so
much strengthend and its opposite weakend that I might venture
extending my attention to include the next and for the following week
keep both lines clear of spots Proceeding thus to the last I could
go thro a course compleat in thirteen weeks and four courses in a
year And like him who having a garden to weed does not attempt to
eradicate all the bad herbs at once which would exceed his reach and
his strength but works on one of the beds at a time and having
accomplishd the first proceeds to a second so I should have I
hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I
made in virtue by clearing successively my lines of their spots till
in the end by a number of courses I should be happy in viewing a
clean book after a thirteen weeks daily examination

This my little book had for its motto these lines from Addisons
Cato

  Here will I hold If theres a power above us
   And that there is all nature cries aloud
   Thro all her works He must delight in virtue
   And that which he delights in must be happy

Another from Cicero

O vitæ Philosophia dux O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque
vitiorum Unus dies bene et ex præceptis tuis
actus peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus69

    69 O philosophy guide of life O searcher out of
    virtue and exterminator of vice One day spent well and
    in accordance with thy precepts is worth an immortality
    of sinTusculan Inquiries Book V

Another from the Proverbs of Solomon speaking of wisdom or virtue

Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand
riches and honour Her ways are ways of pleasantness
and all her paths are peace iii 16 17

And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom I thought it right
and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it to this end
I formed the following little prayer which was prefixd to my tables
of examination for daily use

O powerful Goodness bountiful Father merciful
Guide Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my
truest interest Strengthen my resolutions to perform what
that wisdom dictates Accept my kind offices to thy other
children as the only return in my power for thy continual
favours to me

I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomsons
Poems viz

  Father of light and life thou Good Supreme
   O teach me what is good teach me Thyself
   Save me from folly vanity and vice
   From every low pursuit and fill my soul
   With knowledge conscious peace and virtue pure
   Sacred substantial neverfading bliss

I enterd upon the execution of this plan for selfexamination and
continud it with occasional intermissions for some time I was
surprisd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined
but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish To avoid the
trouble of renewing now and then my little book which by scraping
out the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in
a new course became full of holes I transferrd my tables and
precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book on which the lines
were drawn with red ink that made a durable stain and on those lines
I markd my faults with a blacklead pencil which marks I could
easily wipe out with a wet sponge After a while I went thro one
course only in a year and afterward only one in several years till
at length I omitted them entirely being employd in voyages and
business abroad with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered but I
always carried my little book with me

My scheme of Order gave me the most trouble70 and I found that tho
it might be practicable where a mans business was such as to leave
him the disposition of his time that of a journeyman printer for
instance it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master who
must mix with the world and often receive people of business at their
own hours Order too with regard to places for things papers
etc I found extreamly difficult to acquire I had not been early
accustomed to it and having an exceeding good memory I was not so
sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method This article
therefore cost me so much painful attention and my faults in it
vexed me so much and I made so little progress in amendment and had
such frequent relapses that I was almost ready to give up the
attempt and content myself with a faulty character in that respect
like the man who in buying an ax of a smith my neighbour desired to
have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge The smith
consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel he
turnd while the smith pressd the broad face of the ax hard and
heavily on the stone which made the turning of it very fatiguing The
man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went
on and at length would take his ax as it was without farther
grinding No said the smith turn on turn on we shall have it
bright byandby as yet it is only speckled Yes says the man
but I think I like a speckled ax best And I believe this may have
been the case with many who having for want of some such means as I
employd found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad
habits in other points of vice and virtue have given up the struggle
and concluded that a speckled ax was best for something that
pretended to be reason was every now and then suggesting to me that
such extream nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery
in morals which if it were known would make me ridiculous that a
perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being
envied and hated and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults
in himself to keep his friends in countenance

Illustration The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he
would turn the wheel

    70 Professor McMaster tells us that when Franklin was
    American Agent in France his lack of business order was
    a source of annoyance to his colleagues and friends
    Strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold
    papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most
    careless way over the table and floor

In truth I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order and now I
am grown old and my memory bad I feel very sensibly the want of it
But on the whole tho I never arrived at the perfection I had been
so ambitious of obtaining but fell far short of it yet I was by the
endeavour a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have
been if I had not attempted it as those who aim at perfect writing by
imitating the engraved copies tho they never reach the wishdfor
excellence of those copies their hand is mended by the endeavour and
is tolerable while it continues fair and legible

It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little
artifice with the blessing of God their ancestor owd the constant
felicity of his life down to his 79th year in which this is written
What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence
but if they arrive the reflection on past happiness enjoyd ought to
help his bearing them with more resignation To Temperance he ascribes
his longcontinued health and what is still left to him of a good
constitution to Industry and Frugality the early easiness of his
circumstances and acquisition of his fortune with all that knowledge
that enabled him to be a useful citizen and obtained for him some
degree of reputation among the learned to Sincerity and Justice the
confidence of his country and the honorable employs it conferred upon
him and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues71
even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them all that
evenness of temper and that cheerfulness in conversation which makes
his company still sought for and agreeable even to his younger
acquaintance I hope therefore that some of my descendants may
follow the example and reap the benefit

    71 While there can be no question that Franklins moral
    improvement and happiness were due to the practice of
    these virtues yet most people will agree that we shall
    have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to
    a virtuous life Franklins own suggestion that the
    scheme smacks of foppery in morals seems justified
    Woodrow Wilson well puts it Men do not take fire from
    such thoughts unless something deeper which is missing
    here shine through them What may have seemed to the
    eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us
    nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of
    good sense and sound conduct What redeems it from
    pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of
    usefulness to be seen in Franklin himself who set these
    standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own
    life See Galatians chapter V for the Christian
    plan of moral perfection

It will be remarkd that tho my scheme was not wholly without
religion there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets
of any particular sect I had purposely avoided them for being fully
persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method and that it
might be serviceable to people in all religions and intending some
time or other to publish it I would not have anything in it that
should prejudice anyone of any sect against it I purposed writing a
little comment on each virtue in which I would have shown the
advantages of possessing it and the mischiefs attending its opposite
vice and I should have called my book The Art of Virtue72 because
it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue which
would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good that
does not instruct and indicate the means but is like the apostles
man of verbal charity who only without showing to the naked and
hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals exhorted them
to be fed and clothedJames ii 15 16

    72 Nothing so likely to make a mans fortune as
    virtueMarg note

But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this
comment was never fulfilled I did indeed from time to time put
down short hints of the sentiments reasonings etc to be made use
of in it some of which I have still by me but the necessary close
attention to private business in the earlier part of my life and
public business since have occasioned my postponing it for it being
connected in my mind with a great and extensive project that
required the whole man to execute and which an unforeseen succession
of employs prevented my attending to it has hitherto remaind
unfinishd

In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine
that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden but
forbidden because they are hurtful the nature of man alone
considered that it was therefore everyones interest to be virtuous
who wishd to be happy even in this world and I should from this
circumstance there being always in the world a number of rich
merchants nobility states and princes who have need of honest
instruments for the management of their affairs and such being so
rare have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities
were so likely to make a poor mans fortune as those of probity and
integrity

My list of virtues containd at first but twelve but a Quaker friend
having kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud that my
pride showd itself frequently in conversation that I was not content
with being in the right when discussing any point but was
overbearing and rather insolent of which he convincd me by
mentioning several instances I determined endeavouring to cure
myself if I could of this vice or folly among the rest and I added
Humility to my list giving an extensive meaning to the word

I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this
virtue but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it I
made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments
of others and all positive assertion of my own I even forbid myself
agreeably to the old laws of our Junto the use of every word or
expression in the language that imported a fixd opinion such as
certainly undoubtedly etc and I adopted instead of them I
conceive I apprehend or I imagine a thing to be so or so or it
so appears to me at present When another asserted something that I
thought an error I denyd myself the pleasure of contradicting him
abruptly and of showing immediately some absurdity in his
proposition and in answering I began by observing that in certain
cases or circumstances his opinion would be right but in the present
case there appeard or seemd to me some difference etc I soon
found the advantage of this change in my manner the conversations I
engagd in went on more pleasantly The modest way in which I proposd
my opinions procurd them a readier reception and less contradiction
I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong and I
more easily prevaild with others to give up their mistakes and join
with me when I happened to be in the right

And this mode which I at first put on with some violence to natural
inclination became at length so easy and so habitual to me that
perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical
expression escape me And to this habit after my character of
integrity I think it principally owing that I had early so much
weight with my fellowcitizens when I proposed new institutions or
alterations in the old and so much influence in public councils when
I became a member for I was but a bad speaker never eloquent
subject to much hesitation in my choice of words hardly correct in
language and yet I generally carried my points

In reality there is perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard
to subdue as pride Disguise it struggle with it beat it down
stifle it mortify it as much as one pleases it is still alive and
will every now and then peep out and show itself you will see it
perhaps often in this history for even if I could conceive that I
had compleatly overcome it I should probably be proud of my humility

Thus far written at Passy 1784

I am now about to write at home August 1788 but cannot have the
help expected from my papers many of them being lost in the war I
have however found the following73

    73 This is a marginal memorandumB

Having mentioned a great and extensive project which I had
conceivd it seems proper that some account should be here given of
that project and its object Its first rise in my mind appears in the
following little paper accidentally preservd viz

Observations on my reading history in Library May 19th 1731

That the great affairs of the world the wars revolutions etc are
carried on and effected by parties

That the view of these parties is their present general interest or
what they take to be such

That the different views of these different parties occasion all
confusion

That while a party is carrying on a general design each man has his
particular private interest in view

That as soon as a party has gaind its general point each member
becomes intent upon his particular interest which thwarting others
breaks that party into divisions and occasions more confusion

That few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their
country whatever they may pretend and tho their actings bring real
good to their country yet men primarily considered that their own and
their countrys interest was united and did not act from a principle
of benevolence

That fewer still in public affairs act with a view to the good of
mankind

There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a
United Party for Virtue by forming the virtuous and good men of all
nations into a regular body to be governd by suitable good and wise
rules which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their
obedience to than common people are to common laws

I at present think that whoever attempts this aright and is well
qualified cannot fail of pleasing God and of meeting with success

B F

Revolving this project in my mind as to be undertaken hereafter when
my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure I put down
from time to time on pieces of paper such thoughts as occurrd to me
respecting it Most of these are lost but I find one purporting to be
the substance of an intended creed containing as I thought the
essentials of every known religion and being free of everything that
might shock the professors of any religion It is expressd in these
words viz

That there is one God who made all things

That he governs the world by his providence

That he ought to be worshiped by adoration prayer and
thanksgiving

But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man

That the soul is immortal

And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice either
here or hereafter

My ideas at that time were that the sect should be begun and spread
at first among young and single men only that each person to be
initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed but should
have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks examination and
practice of the virtues as in the beforementiond model that the
existence of such a society should be kept a secret till it was
become considerable to prevent solicitations for the admission of
improper persons but that the members should each of them search
among his acquaintance for ingenuous welldisposed youths to whom
with prudent caution the scheme should be gradually communicated
that the members should engage to afford their advice assistance and
support to each other in promoting one anothers interests business
and advancement in life that for distinction we should be calld
The Society of the Free and Easy free as being by the general
practice and habit of the virtues free from the dominion of vice
and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality free from
debt which exposes a man to confinement and a species of slavery to
his creditors

This is as much as I can now recollect of the project except that I
communicated it in part to two young men who adopted it with some
enthusiasm but my then narrow circumstances and the necessity I was
under of sticking close to my business occasioned my postponing the
further prosecution of it at that time and my multifarious
occupations public and private inducd me to continue postponing so
that it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activity
left sufficient for such an enterprise though I am still of opinion
that it was a practicable scheme and might have been very useful by
forming a great number of good citizens and I was not discouragd by
the seeming magnitude of the undertaking as I have always thought
that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes and
accomplish great affairs among mankind if he first forms a good plan
and cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert
his attention makes the execution of that same plan his sole study
and business

POOR RICHARDS ALMANAC AND
OTHER ACTIVITIES


In 1732 I first publishd my Almanack under the name of Richard
Saunders it was continud by me about twentyfive years commonly
calld Poor Richards Almanac74 I endeavourd to make it both
entertaining and useful and it accordingly came to be in such demand
that I reapd considerable profit from it vending annually near ten
thousand And observing that it was generally read scarce any
neighborhood in the province being without it I considerd it as a
proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people who
bought scarcely any other books I therefore filled all the little
spaces that occurrd between the remarkable days in the calendar with
proverbial sentences chiefly such as inculcated industry and
frugality as the means of procuring wealth and thereby securing
virtue it being more difficult for a man in want to act always
honestly as to use here one of those proverbs it is hard for an
empty sack to stand upright

    74 The almanac at that time was a kind of periodical as
    well as a guide to natural phenomena and the weather
    Franklin took his title from Poor Robin a famous
    English almanac and from Richard Saunders a wellknown
    almanac publisher For the maxims of Poor Richard see
    pages 331335

These proverbs which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations I
assembled and formd into a connected discourse prefixd to the Almanack
of 1757 as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an
auction The bringing all these scatterd councils thus into a focus
enabled them to make greater impression The piece being universally
approved was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent reprinted
in Britain on a broadside to be stuck up in houses two translations
were made of it in French and great numbers bought by the clergy and
gentry to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants
In Pennsylvania as it discouraged useless expense in foreign
superfluities some thought it had its share of influence in producing
that growing plenty of money which was observable for several years
after its publication

I considered my newspaper also as another means of communicating
instruction and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from
the Spectator and other moral writers and sometimes publishd little
pieces of my own which had been first composed for reading in our
Junto Of these are a Socratic dialogue tending to prove that
whatever might be his parts and abilities a vicious man could not
properly be called a man of sense and a discourse on selfdenial
showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a
habitude and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations
These may be found in the papers about the beginning of 173575

In the conduct of my newspaper I carefully excluded all libeling and
personal abuse which is of late years become so disgraceful to our
country Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind and
the writers pleaded as they generally did the liberty of the press
and that a newspaper was like a stagecoach in which anyone who would
pay had a right to a place my answer was that I would print the
piece separately if desired and the author might have as many copies
as he pleased to distribute himself but that I would not take upon me
to spread his detraction and that having contracted with my
subscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful or
entertaining I could not fill their papers with private altercation
in which they had no concern without doing them manifest injustice
Now many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of
individuals by false accusations of the fairest characters among
ourselves augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels and
are moreover so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the
government of neighboring states and even on the conduct of our best
national allies which may be attended with the most pernicious
consequences These things I mention as a caution to young printers
and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and
disgrace their profession by such infamous practices but refuse
steadily as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct
will not on the whole be injurious to their interests

In 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston South Carolina
where a printer was wanting I furnishd him with a press and letters
on an agreement of partnership by which I was to receive onethird of
the profits of the business paying onethird of the expense He was a
man of learning and honest but ignorant in matters of account and
tho he sometimes made me remittances I could get no account from
him nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived On
his decease the business was continued by his widow who being born
and bred in Holland where as I have been informd the knowledge of
accounts makes a part of female education she not only sent me as
clear a state as she could find of the transactions past but
continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness every
quarter afterwards and managed the business with such success that
she not only brought up reputably a family of children but at the
expiration of the term was able to purchase of me the printinghouse
and establish her son in it

I mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch
of education for our young females as likely to be of more use to
them and their children in case of widowhood than either music or
dancing by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men
and enabling them to continue perhaps a profitable mercantile house
with establishd correspondence till a son is grown up fit to
undertake and go on with it to the lasting advantage and enriching of
the family

About the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young
Presbyterian preacher named Hemphill who delivered with a good
voice and apparently extempore most excellent discourses which drew
together considerable numbers of different persuasions who joind in
admiring them Among the rest I became one of his constant hearers
his sermons pleasing me as they had little of the dogmatical kind
but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue or what in the
religious stile are called good works Those however of our
congregation who considered themselves as orthodox Presbyterians
disapprovd his doctrine and were joind by most of the old clergy
who arraignd him of heterodoxy before the synod in order to have him
silencd I became his zealous partisan and contributed all I could
to raise a party in his favour and we combated for him awhile with
some hopes of success There was much scribbling pro and con upon the
occasion and finding that tho an elegant preacher he was but a
poor writer I lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three
pamphlets and one piece in the Gazette of April 1735 Those
pamphlets as is generally the case with controversial writings tho
eagerly read at the time were soon out of vogue and I question
whether a single copy of them now exists76

During the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly
One of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much
admired thought he had somewhere read the sermon before or at least
a part of it On search he found that part quoted at length in one
of the British Reviews from a discourse of Dr Fosters77 This
detection gave many of our party disgust who accordingly abandoned
his cause and occasiond our more speedy discomfiture in the synod I
stuck by him however as I rather approvd his giving us good sermons
composed by others than bad ones of his own manufacture tho the
latter was the practice of our common teachers He afterward
acknowledgd to me that none of those he preachd were his own
adding that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeat
any sermon after one reading only On our defeat he left us in search
elsewhere of better fortune and I quitted the congregation never
joining it after tho I continud many years my subscription for the
support of its ministers

I had begun in 1733 to study languages I soon made myself so much a
master of the French as to be able to read the books with ease I then
undertook the Italian An acquaintance who was also learning it usd
often to tempt me to play chess with him Finding this took up too
much of the time I had to spare for study I at length refusd to play
any more unless on this condition that the victor in every game
should have a right to impose a task either in parts of the grammar
to be got by heart or in translations etc which tasks the
vanquishd was to perform upon honour before our next meeting As we
playd pretty equally we thus beat one another into that language I
afterwards with a little painstaking acquird as much of the Spanish
as to read their books also

I have already mentiond that I had only one years instruction in a
Latin school and that when very young after which I neglected that
language entirely But when I had attained an acquaintance with the
French Italian and Spanish I was surprisd to find on looking over
a Latin Testament that I understood so much more of that language
than I had imagined which encouraged me to apply myself again to the
study of it and I met with more success as those preceding languages
had greatly smoothd my way

From these circumstances I have thought that there is some
inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages We are told
that it is proper to begin first with the Latin and having acquird
that it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are
derivd from it and yet we do not begin with the Greek in order more
easily to acquire the Latin It is true that if you can clamber and
get to the top of a staircase without using the steps you will more
easily gain them in descending but certainly if you begin with the
lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top and I would
therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the
education of our youth whether since many of those who begin with
the Latin quit the same after spending some years without having made
any great proficiency and what they have learnt becomes almost
useless so that their time has been lost it would not have been
better to have begun with the French proceeding to the Italian etc
for tho after spending the same time they should quit the study of
languages and never arrive at the Latin they would however have
acquired another tongue or two that being in modern use might be
serviceable to them in common life78

    78 The authority of Franklin the most eminently
    practical man of his age in favor of reserving the
    study of the dead languages until the mind has reached a
    certain maturity is confirmed by the confession of one
    of the most eminent scholars of any age

    Our seminaries of learning says Gibbon do not
    exactly correspond with the precept of a Spartan king
    that the child should be instructed in the arts which
    will be useful to the man since a finished scholar may
    emerge from the head of Westminster or Eton in total
    ignorance of the business and conversation of English
    gentlemen in the latter end of the eighteenth century
    But these schools may assume the merit of teaching all
    that they pretend to teach the Latin and Greek
    languagesBigelow

After ten years absence from Boston and having become easy in my
circumstances I made a journey thither to visit my relations which I
could not sooner well afford In returning I calld at Newport to see
my brother then settled there with his printinghouse Our former
differences were forgotten and our meeting was very cordial and
affectionate He was fast declining in his health and requested of me
that in case of his death which he apprehended not far distant I
would take home his son then but ten years of age and bring him up
to the printing business This I accordingly performd sending him a
few years to school before I took him into the office His mother
carried on the business till he was grown up when I assisted him with
an assortment of new types those of his father being in a manner worn
out Thus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service I
had deprivd him of by leaving him so early

Illustration Our former differences were forgotten and our
meeting was very cordial and affectionate

In 1736 I lost one of my sons a fine boy of four years old by the
smallpox taken in the common way I long regretted bitterly and
still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation This I
mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation on the
supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died
under it my example showing that the regret may be the same either
way and that therefore the safer should be chosen

Our club the Junto was found so useful and afforded such
satisfaction to the members that several were desirous of introducing
their friends which could not well be done without exceeding what we
had settled as a convenient number viz twelve We had from the
beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret which was
pretty well observd the intention was to avoid applications of
improper persons for admittance some of whom perhaps we might find
it difficult to refuse I was one of those who were against any
addition to our number but instead of it made in writing a
proposal that every member separately should endeavour to form a
subordinate club with the same rules respecting queries etc and
without informing them of the connection with the Junto The
advantages proposed were the improvement of so many more young
citizens by the use of our institutions our better acquaintance with
the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion as the
Junto member might propose what queries we should desire and was to
report to the Junto what passd in his separate club the promotion of
our particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation
and the increase of our influence in public affairs and our power of
doing good by spreading thro the several clubs the sentiments of the
Junto

The project was approvd and every member undertook to form his club
but they did not all succeed Five or six only were compleated which
were called by different names as the Vine the Union the Band etc
They were useful to themselves and afforded us a good deal of
amusement information and instruction besides answering in some
considerable degree our views of influencing the public opinion on
particular occasions of which I shall give some instances in course
of time as they happened

My first promotion was my being chosen in 1736 clerk of the General
Assembly The choice was made that year without opposition but the
year following when I was again proposd the choice like that of
the members being annual a new member made a long speech against
me in order to favour some other candidate I was however chosen
which was the more agreeable to me as besides the pay for the
immediate service as clerk the place gave me a better opportunity of
keeping up an interest among the members which securd to me the
business of printing the votes laws paper money and other
occasional jobbs for the public that on the whole were very
profitable

I therefore did not like the opposition of this new member who was a
gentleman of fortune and education with talents that were likely to
give him in time great influence in the House which indeed
afterwards happened I did not however aim at gaining his favour by
paying any servile respect to him but after some time took this
other method Having heard that he had in his library a certain very
scarce and curious book I wrote a note to him expressing my desire
of perusing that book and requesting he would do me the favour of
lending it to me for a few days He sent it immediately and I
returnd it in about a week with another note expressing strongly my
sense of the favour When we next met in the House he spoke to me
which he had never done before and with great civility and he ever
after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions so that we
became great friends and our friendship continued to his death This
is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned which
says He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do
you another than he whom you yourself have obliged And it shows
how much more profitable it is prudently to remove than to resent
return and continue inimical proceedings

In 1737 Colonel Spotswood late governor of Virginia and then
postmastergeneral being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy
at Philadelphia respecting some negligence in rendering and
inexactitude of his accounts took from him the commission and offered
it to me I accepted it readily and found it of great advantage for
tho the salary was small it facilitated the correspondence that
improvd my newspaper increasd the number demanded as well as the
advertisements to be inserted so that it came to afford me a
considerable income My old competitors newspaper declind
proportionately and I was satisfyd without retaliating his refusal
while postmaster to permit my papers being carried by the riders
Thus he sufferd greatly from his neglect in due accounting and I
mention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employd in
managing affairs for others that they should always render accounts
and make remittances with great clearness and punctuality The
character of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all
recommendations to new employments and increase of business

INTEREST IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS


I began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs beginning
however with small matters The city watch was one of the first
things that I conceivd to want regulation It was managed by the
constables of the respective wards in turn the constable warned a
number of housekeepers to attend him for the night Those who chose
never to attend paid him six shillings a year to be excusd which
was supposd to be for hiring substitutes but was in reality much
more than was necessary for that purpose and made the constableship a
place of profit and the constable for a little drink often got such
ragamuffins about him as a watch that respectable housekeepers did
not choose to mix with Walking the rounds too was often neglected
and most of the nights spent in tippling I thereupon wrote a paper to
be read in Junto representing these irregularities but insisting
more particularly on the inequality of this sixshilling tax of the
constables respecting the circumstances of those who paid it since a
poor widow housekeeper all whose property to be guarded by the watch
did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds paid as much as the
wealthiest merchant who had thousands of pounds worth of goods in
his stores

On the whole I proposed as a more effectual watch the hiring of
proper men to serve constantly in that business and as a more
equitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax that should
be proportiond to the property This idea being approvd by the
Junto was communicated to the other clubs but as arising in each of
them and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution
yet by preparing the minds of people for the change it paved the way
for the law obtained a few years after when the members of our clubs
were grown into more influence

About this time I wrote a paper first to be read in Junto but it was
afterward publishd on the different accidents and carelessnesses by
which houses were set on fire with cautions against them and means
proposed of avoiding them This was much spoken of as a useful piece
and gave rise to a project which soon followed it of forming a
company for the more ready extinguishing of fires and mutual
assistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger
Associates in this scheme were presently found amounting to thirty
Our articles of agreement obligd every member to keep always in good
order and fit for use a certain number of leather buckets with
strong bags and baskets for packing and transporting of goods which
were to be brought to every fire and we agreed to meet once a month
and spend a social evening together in discoursing and communicating
such ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires as might be
useful in our conduct on such occasions

The utility of this institution soon appeared and many more desiring
to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company they were
advised to form another which was accordingly done and this went on
one new company being formed after another till they became so
numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of
property and now at the time of my writing this tho upward of
fifty years since its establishment that which I first formed called
the Union Fire Company still subsists and flourishes tho the first
members are all deceasd but myself and one who is older by a year
than I am The small fines that have been paid by members for absence
at the monthly meetings have been applyd to the purchase of
fireengines ladders firehooks and other useful implements for
each company so that I question whether there is a city in the world
better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning
conflagrations and in fact since these institutions the city has
never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time and the
flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they
began has been half consumed

Illustration the flames have often been extinguished

In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr Whitefield79
who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher He was
at first permitted to preach in some of our churches but the clergy
taking a dislike to him soon refusd him their pulpits and he was
obligd to preach in the fields The multitudes of all sects and
denominations that attended his sermons were enormous and it was
matter of speculation to me who was one of the number to observe the
extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers and how much
they admird and respected him notwithstanding his common abuse of
them by assuring them they were naturally half beasts and half
devils It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners
of our inhabitants From being thoughtless or indifferent about
religion it seemd as if all the world were growing religious so
that one could not walk thro the town in an evening without hearing
psalms sung in different families of every street

    79 George Whitefield pronounced Hwitfield
    17141770 a celebrated English clergyman and pulpit
    orator one of the founders of Methodism

And it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air subject
to its inclemencies the building of a house to meet in was no sooner
proposd and persons appointed to receive contributions but
sufficient sums were soon receivd to procure the ground and erect the
building which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad about the
size of Westminster Hall80 and the work was carried on with such
spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been
expected Both house and ground were vested in trustees expressly for
the use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire
to say something to the people at Philadelphia the design in building
not being to accommodate any particular sect but the inhabitants in
general so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a
missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us he would find a pulpit at
his service

    80 A part of the palace of Westminster now forming the
    vestibule to the Houses of Parliament in London

Mr Whitefield in leaving us went preaching all the way thro the
colonies to Georgia The settlement of that province had lately been
begun but instead of being made with hardy industrious husbandmen
accustomed to labour the only people fit for such an enterprise it
was with families of broken shopkeepers and other insolvent debtors
many of indolent and idle habits taken out of the jails who being
set down in the woods unqualified for clearing land and unable to
endure the hardships of a new settlement perished in numbers leaving
many helpless children unprovided for The sight of their miserable
situation inspird the benevolent heart of Mr Whitefield with the
idea of building an Orphan House there in which they might be
supported and educated Returning northward he preachd up this
charity and made large collections for his eloquence had a wonderful
power over the hearts and purses of his hearers of which I myself was
an instance

I did not disapprove of the design but as Georgia was then destitute
of materials and workmen and it was proposed to send them from
Philadelphia at a great expense I thought it would have been better
to have built the house here and brought the children to it This I
advisd but he was resolute in his first project rejected my
counsel and I therefore refusd to contribute I happened soon after
to attend one of his sermons in the course of which I perceived he
intended to finish with a collection and I silently resolved he
should get nothing from me I had in my pocket a handful of copper
money three or four silver dollars and five pistoles in gold As he
proceeded I began to soften and concluded to give the coppers
Another stroke of his oratory made me ashamd of that and determind
me to give the silver and he finishd so admirably that I emptyd my
pocket wholly into the collectors dish gold and all At this sermon
there was also one of our club who being of my sentiments respecting
the building in Georgia and suspecting a collection might be
intended had by precaution emptied his pockets before he came from
home Towards the conclusion of the discourse however he felt a
strong desire to give and applyd to a neighbour who stood near him
to borrow some money for the purpose The application was
unfortunately made to perhaps the only man in the company who had
the firmness not to be affected by the preacher His answer was At
any other time Friend Hopkinson I would lend to thee freely but not
now for thee seems to be out of thy right senses

Some of Mr Whitefields enemies affected to suppose that he would
apply these collections to his own private emolument but I who was
intimately acquainted with him being employed in printing his Sermons
and Journals etc never had the least suspicion of his integrity
but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct
a perfectly honest man and methinks my testimony in his favour
ought to have the more weight as we had no religious connection He
usd indeed sometimes to pray for my conversion but never had the
satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard Ours was a mere
civil friendship sincere on both sides and lasted to his death

The following instance will show something of the terms on which we
stood Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston he wrote to me
that he should come soon to Philadelphia but knew not where he could
lodge when there as he understood his old friend and host Mr
Benezet was removed to Germantown My answer was You know my house
if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations you will be most
heartily welcome He replyd that if I made that kind offer for
Christs sake I should not miss of a reward And I returned Dont
let me be mistaken it was not for Christs sake but for your sake
One of our common acquaintance jocosely remarkd that knowing it to
be the custom of the saints when they received any favour to shift
the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders and place
it in heaven I had contrivd to fix it on earth

The last time I saw Mr Whitefield was in London when he consulted me
about his Orphan House concern and his purpose of appropriating it to
the establishment of a college

He had a loud and clear voice and articulated his words and sentences
so perfectly that he might be heard and understood at a great
distance especially as his auditories however numerous observd the
most exact silence He preachd one evening from the top of the
Courthouse steps which are in the middle of Marketstreet and on the
west side of Secondstreet which crosses it at right angles Both
streets were filld with his hearers to a considerable distance Being
among the hindmost in Marketstreet I had the curiosity to learn how
far he could be heard by retiring backwards down the street towards
the river and I found his voice distinct till I came near
Frontstreet when some noise in that street obscurd it Imagining
then a semicircle of which my distance should be the radius and that
it were filld with auditors to each of whom I allowd two square
feet I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty
thousand This reconcild me to the newspaper accounts of his having
preachd to twentyfive thousand people in the fields and to the
ancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies of which I had
sometimes doubted

By hearing him often I came to distinguish easily between sermons
newly composd and those which he had often preachd in the course of
his travels His delivery of the latter was so improvd by frequent
repetitions that every accent every emphasis every modulation of
voice was so perfectly well turnd and well placd that without
being interested in the subject one could not help being pleasd with
the discourse a pleasure of much the same kind with that receivd
from an excellent piece of musick This is an advantage itinerant
preachers have over those who are stationary as the latter cannot
well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals

His writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his
enemies unguarded expressions and even erroneous opinions delivered
in preaching might have been afterwards explaind or qualifid by
supposing others that might have accompanid them or they might have
been denyd but litera scripta manet Critics attackd his writings
violently and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the
number of his votaries and prevent their increase so that I am of
opinion if he had never written anything he would have left behind
him a much more numerous and important sect and his reputation might
in that case have been still growing even after his death as there
being nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him
a lower character his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign
for him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic
admiration might wish him to have possessed

My business was now continually augmenting and my circumstances
growing daily easier my newspaper having become very profitable as
being for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring
provinces I experienced too the truth of the observation that
after getting the first hundred pound it is more easy to get the
second money itself being of a prolific nature

The partnership at Carolina having succeeded I was encouragd to
engage in others and to promote several of my workmen who had
behaved well by establishing them with printinghouses in different
colonies on the same terms with that in Carolina Most of them did
well being enabled at the end of our term six years to purchase the
types of me and go on working for themselves by which means several
families were raised Partnerships often finish in quarrels but I was
happy in this that mine were all carried on and ended amicably
owing I think a good deal to the precaution of having very
explicitly settled in our articles everything to be done by or
expected from each partner so that there was nothing to dispute
which precaution I would therefore recommend to all who enter into
partnerships for whatever esteem partners may have for and
confidence in each other at the time of the contract little
jealousies and disgusts may arise with ideas of inequality in the
care and burden of the business etc which are attended often with
breach of friendship and of the connection perhaps with lawsuits and
other disagreeable consequences

DEFENSE OF THE PROVINCE


I had on the whole abundant reason to be satisfied with my being
established in Pennsylvania There were however two things that I
regretted there being no provision for defense nor for a compleat
education of youth no militia nor any college I therefore in 1743
drew up a proposal for establishing an academy and at that time
thinking the Reverend Mr Peters who was out of employ a fit person
to superintend such an institution I communicated the project to him
but he having more profitable views in the service of the
proprietaries which succeeded declind the undertaking and not
knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust I let the
scheme lie awhile dormant I succeeded better the next year 1744 in
proposing and establishing a Philosophical Society The paper I wrote
for that purpose will be found among my writings when collected

With respect to defense Spain having been several years at war
against Great Britain and being at length joind by France which
brought us into great danger and the laboured and longcontinued
endeavour of our governor Thomas to prevail with our Quaker Assembly
to pass a militia law and make other provisions for the security of
the province having proved abortive I determined to try what might
be done by a voluntary association of the people To promote this I
first wrote and published a pamphlet entitled Plain Truth in which I
stated our defenceless situation in strong lights with the necessity
of union and discipline for our defense and promisd to propose in a
few days an association to be generally signed for that purpose The
pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect I was calld upon for the
instrument of association and having settled the draft of it with a
few friends I appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large
building before mentioned The house was pretty full I had prepared a
number of printed copies and provided pens and ink dispersd all over
the room I harangued them a little on the subject read the paper
and explained it and then distributed the copies which were eagerly
signed not the least objection being made

When the company separated and the papers were collected we found
above twelve hundred hands and other copies being dispersed in the
country the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand
These all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms formed
themselves into companies and regiments chose their own officers and
met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise and other
parts of military discipline The women by subscriptions among
themselves provided silk colours which they presented to the
companies painted with different devices and mottos which I
supplied

Designed by Franklin and made by the women of Philadelphia

The officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment
being met chose me for their colonel but conceiving myself unfit I
declind that station and recommended Mr Lawrence a fine person
and man of influence who was accordingly appointed I then proposd a
lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town
and furnishing it with cannon It filled expeditiously and the
battery was soon erected the merlons being framd of logs and filld
with earth We bought some old cannon from Boston but these not
being sufficient we wrote to England for more soliciting at the
same time our proprietaries for some assistance tho without much
expectation of obtaining it

Meanwhile Colonel Lawrence William Allen Abram Taylor Esqr and
myself were sent to New York by the associators commissiond to
borrow some cannon of Governor Clinton He at first refusd us
peremptorily but at dinner with his council where there was great
drinking of Madeira wine as the custom of that place then was he
softened by degrees and said he would lend us six After a few more
bumpers he advancd to ten and at length he very goodnaturedly
conceded eighteen They were fine cannon eighteenpounders with
their carriages which we soon transported and mounted on our battery
where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted and
among the rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common
soldier

Illustration I regularly took my turn of duty there as a

My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and
council they took me into confidence and I was consulted by them in
every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the
association Calling in the aid of religion I proposd to them the
proclaiming a fast to promote reformation and implore the blessing
of Heaven on our undertaking They embracd the motion but as it was
the first fast ever thought of in the province the secretary had no
precedent from which to draw the proclamation My education in New
England where a fast is proclaimed every year was here of some
advantage I drew it in the accustomed stile it was translated into
German81 printed in both languages and divulgd thro the province
This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of
influencing their congregations to join in the association and it
would probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace
had not soon intervend

    81 Wm Penns agents sought recruits for the colony of
    Pennsylvania in the low countries of Germany and there
    are still in eastern Pennsylvania many Germans
    inaccurately called Pennsylvania Dutch Many of them use
    a Germanized English

It was thought by some of my friends that by my activity in these
affairs I should offend that sect and thereby lose my interest in
the Assembly of the province where they formed a great majority A
young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House and wished
to succeed me as their clerk acquainted me that it was decided to
displace me at the next election and he therefore in good will
advisd me to resign as more consistent with my honour than being
turnd out My answer to him was that I had read or heard of some
public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office and never to
refuse one when offerd to him I approve says I of his rule and
will practice it with a small addition I shall never ask never
refuse nor ever resign an office If they will have my office of
clerk to dispose of to another they shall take it from me I will
not by giving it up lose my right of some time or other making
reprisals on my adversaries I heard however no more of this I was
chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election Possibly as
they dislikd my late intimacy with the members of council who had
joind the governors in all the disputes about military preparations
with which the House had long been harassd they might have been
pleasd if I would voluntarily have left them but they did not care
to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association and
they could not well give another reason

Indeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was
not disagreeable to any of them provided they were not requird to
assist in it And I found that a much greater number of them than I
could have imagined tho against offensive war were clearly for the
defensive Many pamphlets pro and con were publishd on the subject
and some by good Quakers in favour of defense which I believe
convincd most of their younger people

A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their
prevailing sentiments It had been proposd that we should encourage
the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock
then about sixty pounds in tickets of the lottery By our rules no
money could be disposd of till the next meeting after the proposal
The company consisted of thirty members of which twentytwo were
Quakers and eight only of other persuasions We eight punctually
attended the meeting but tho we thought that some of the Quakers
would join us we were by no means sure of a majority Only one
Quaker Mr James Morris appeard to oppose the measure He expressed
much sorrow that it had ever been proposd as he said Friends were
all against it and it would create such discord as might break up the
company We told him that we saw no reason for that we were the
minority and if Friends were against the measure and outvoted us
we must and should agreeably to the usage of all societies submit
When the hour for business arrivd it was movd to put the vote he
allowd we might then do it by the rules but as he could assure us
that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of
opposing it it would be but candid to allow a little time for their
appearing

While we were disputing this a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen
below desird to speak with me I went down and found they were two
of our Quaker members They told me there were eight of them assembled
at a tavern just by that they were determind to come and vote with
us if there should be occasion which they hopd would not be the
case and desird we would not call for their assistance if we could
do without it as their voting for such a measure might embroil them
with their elders and friends Being thus secure of a majority I went
up and after a little seeming hesitation agreed to a delay of
another hour This Mr Morris allowd to be extreamly fair Not one of
his opposing friends appeard at which he expressd great surprize
and at the expiration of the hour we carrid the resolution eight to
one and as of the twentytwo Quakers eight were ready to vote with
us and thirteen by their absence manifested that they were not
inclind to oppose the measure I afterward estimated the proportion
of Quakers sincerely against defense as one to twentyone only for
these were all regular members of that society and in good reputation
among them and had due notice of what was proposd at that meeting

The honorable and learned Mr Logan who had always been of that sect
was one who wrote an address to them declaring his approbation of
defensive war and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments He
put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for
the battery with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn
wholly to that service He told me the following anecdote of his old
master William Penn respecting defense He came over from England
when a young man with that proprietary and as his secretary It was
wartime and their ship was chasd by an armed vessel supposd to be
an enemy Their captain prepard for defense but told William Penn
and his company of Quakers that he did not expect their assistance
and they might retire into the cabin which they did except James
Logan82 who chose to stay upon deck and was quarterd to a gun The
supposd enemy provd a friend so there was no fighting but when the
secretary went down to communicate the intelligence William Penn
rebukd him severely for staying upon deck and undertaking to assist
in defending the vessel contrary to the principles of Friends
especially as it had not been required by the captain This reproof
being before all the company piqud the secretary who answerd I
being thy servant why did thee not order me to come down But thee
was willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when
thee thought there was danger

    82 James Logan 16741751 came to America with William
    Penn in 1699 and was the business agent for the Penn
    family He bequeathed his valuable library preserved at
    his country seat Senton to the city of
    PhiladelphiaSmyth

My being many years in the Assembly the majority of which were
constantly Quakers gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the
embarrassment given them by their principle against war whenever
application was made to them by order of the crown to grant aids for
military purposes They were unwilling to offend government on the
one hand by a direct refusal and their friends the body of the
Quakers on the other by compliance contrary to their principles
hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying and modes of
disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable The common mode
at last was to grant money under the phrase of its being for the
kings use and never to inquire how it was applied

But if the demand was not directly from the crown that phrase was
found not so proper and some other was to be invented As when
powder was wanting I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg and
the government of New England solicited a grant of some from
Pennsylvania which was much urgd on the House by Governor Thomas
they could not grant money to buy powder because that was an
ingredient of war but they voted an aid to New England of three
thousand pounds to be put into the hands of the governor and
appropriated it for the purchasing of bread flour wheat or other
grain Some of the council desirous of giving the House still
further embarrassment advisd the governor not to accept provision
as not being the thing he had demanded but he replid I shall take
the money for I understand very well their meaning other grain is
gunpowder which he accordingly bought and they never objected to
it83

    83 See the votesMarg note

It was in allusion to this fact that when in our fire company we
feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery and I had
said to my friend Mr Syng one of our members If we fail let us
move the purchase of a fireengine with the money the Quakers can
have no objection to that and then if you nominate me and I you as a
committee for that purpose we will buy a great gun which is
certainly a fireengine I see says he you have improvd by
being so long in the Assembly your equivocal project would be just a
match for their wheat or other grain

These embarrassments that the Quakers sufferd from having establishd
and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was
lawful and which being once published they could not afterwards
however they might change their minds easily get rid of reminds me
of what I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us that
of the Dunkers I was acquainted with one of its founders Michael
Welfare soon after it appeard He complaind to me that they were
grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions and
chargd with abominable principles and practices to which they were
utter strangers I told him this had always been the case with new
sects and that to put a stop to such abuse I imagind it might be
well to publish the articles of their belief and the rules of their
discipline He said that it had been proposd among them but not
agreed to for this reason When we were first drawn together as a
society says he it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far
as to see that some doctrines which we once esteemed truths were
errors and that others which we had esteemed errors were real
truths From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther
light and our principles have been improving and our errors
diminishing Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of
this progression and at the perfection of spiritual or theological
knowledge and we fear that if we should once print our confession of
faith we should feel ourselves as if bound and confind by it and
perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement and our
successors still more so as conceiving what we their elders and
founders had done to be something sacred never to be departed from

This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history
of mankind every other sect supposing itself in possession of all
truth and that those who differ are so far in the wrong like a man
traveling in foggy weather those at some distance before him on the
road he sees wrapped up in the fog as well as those behind him and
also the people in the fields on each side but near him all appears
clear tho in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them To avoid
this kind of embarrassment the Quakers have of late years been
gradually declining the public service in the Assembly and in the
magistracy choosing rather to quit their power than their principle

In order of time I should have mentioned before that having in
1742 invented an open stove84 for the better warming of rooms and
at the same time saving fuel as the fresh air admitted was warmed in
entering I made a present of the model to Mr Robert Grace one of my
early friends who having an ironfurnace85 found the casting of
the plates for these stoves a profitable thing as they were growing
in demand To promote that demand I wrote and published a pamphlet
entitled An Account of the newinvented Pennsylvania Fireplaces
wherein their Construction and Manner of Operation is particularly
explained their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms
demonstrated and all Objections that have been raised against the Use
of them answered and obviated etc This pamphlet had a good effect
Govr Thomas was so pleasd with the construction of this stove as
described in it that he offered to give me a patent for the sole
vending of them for a term of years but I declind it from a
principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions viz
That as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others we
should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of
ours and this we should do freely and generously

    84 The Franklin stove is still in use

    85 Warwick Furnace Chester County Pennsylvania
    across the Schuylkill River from Pottstown

An ironmonger in London however assuming a good deal of my pamphlet
and working it up into his own and making some small changes in the
machine which rather hurt its operation got a patent for it there
and made as I was told a little fortune by it And this is not the
only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others tho
not always with the same success which I never contested as having
no desire of profiting by patents myself and hating disputes The use
of these fireplaces in very many houses both of this and the
neighbouring colonies has been and is a great saving of wood to the
inhabitants

PUBLIC SERVICES AND DUTIES

17491753


Peace being concluded and the association business therefore at an
end I turnd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an
academy The first step I took was to associate in the design a number
of active friends of whom the Junto furnished a good part the next
was to write and publish a pamphlet entitled Proposals Relating to
the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania This I distributed among the
principal inhabitants gratis and as soon as I could suppose their
minds a little prepared by the perusal of it I set on foot a
subscription for opening and supporting an academy it was to be paid
in quotas yearly for five years by so dividing it I judgd the
subscription might be larger and I believe it was so amounting to no
less if I remember right than five thousand pounds

In the introduction to these proposals I stated their publication
not as an act of mine but of some publickspirited gentlemen
avoiding as much as I could according to my usual rule the
presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their
benefit

The subscribers to carry the project into immediate execution chose
out of their number twentyfour trustees and appointed Mr
Francis86 then attorneygeneral and myself to draw up constitutions
for the government of the academy which being done and signed a
house was hired masters engagd and the schools opened I think in
the same year 1749

    86 Tench Francis uncle of Sir Philip Francis
    emigrated from England to Maryland and became attorney
    for Lord Baltimore He removed to Philadelphia and was
    attorneygeneral of Pennsylvania from 1741 to 1755 He
    died in Philadelphia August 16 1758Smyth

The scholars increasing fast the house was soon found too small and
we were looking out for a piece of ground properly situated with
intention to build when Providence threw into our way a large house
ready built which with a few alterations might well serve our
purpose This was the building before mentioned erected by the
hearers of Mr Whitefield and was obtained for us in the following
manner

It is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made
by people of different sects care was taken in the nomination of
trustees in whom the building and ground was to be vested that a
predominancy should not be given to any sect lest in time that
predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of
such sect contrary to the original intention It was therefore that
one of each sect was appointed viz one ChurchofEngland man one
Presbyterian one Baptist one Moravian etc those in case of
vacancy by death were to fill it by election from among the
contributors The Moravian happend not to please his colleagues and
on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect The
difficulty then was how to avoid having two of some other sect by
means of the new choice

Several persons were named and for that reason not agreed to At
length one mentiond me with the observation that I was merely an
honest man and of no sect at all which prevailed with them to chuse
me The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long
since abatd and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh
contributions for paying the groundrent and discharging some other
debts the building had occasiond which embarrassd them greatly
Being now a member of both sets of trustees that for the building and
that for the academy I had a good opportunity of negotiating with
both and brought them finally to an agreement by which the trustees
for the building were to cede it to those of the academy the latter
undertaking to discharge the debt to keep forever open in the
building a large hall for occasional preachers according to the
original intention and maintain a freeschool for the instruction of
poor children Writings were accordingly drawn and on paying the
debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the
premises and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories and
different rooms above and below for the several schools and
purchasing some additional ground the whole was soon made fit for our
purpose and the scholars removd into the building The care and
trouble of agreeing with the workmen purchasing materials and
superintending the work fell upon me and I went thro it the more
cheerfully as it did not then interfere with my private business
having the year before taken a very able industrious and honest
partner Mr David Hall with whose character I was well acquainted
as he had workd for me four years He took off my hands all care of
the printingoffice paying me punctually my share of the profits The
partnership continued eighteen years successfully for us both

The trustees of the academy after a while were incorporated by a
charter from the governor their funds were increasd by contributions
in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries to which the
Assembly has since made considerable addition and thus was
established the present University of Philadelphia87 I have been
continued one of its trustees from the beginning now near forty
years and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the
youth who have receivd their education in it distinguishd by their
improvd abilities serviceable in public stations and ornaments to
their country

    87 Later called the University of Pennsylvania

When I disengaged myself as above mentioned from private business I
flatterd myself that by the sufficient tho moderate fortune I had
acquird I had secured leisure during the rest of my life for
philosophical studies and amusements I purchased all Dr Spences
apparatus who had come from England to lecture here and I proceeded
in my electrical experiments with great alacrity but the publick now
considering me as a man of leisure laid hold of me for their
purposes every part of our civil government and almost at the same
time imposing some duty upon me The governor put me into the
commission of the peace the corporation of the city chose me of the
common council and soon after an alderman and the citizens at large
chose me a burgess to represent them in Assembly This latter station
was the more agreeable to me as I was at length tired with sitting
there to hear debates in which as clerk I could take no part and
which were often so unentertaining that I was inducd to amuse myself
with making magic squares or circles or anything to avoid weariness
and I conceivd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing
good I would not however insinuate that my ambition was not
flatterd by all these promotions it certainly was for considering
my low beginning they were great things to me and they were still
more pleasing as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public
good opinion and by me entirely unsolicited

The office of justice of the peace I tryd a little by attending a
few courts and sitting on the bench to hear causes but finding that
more knowledge of the common law than I possessd was necessary to act
in that station with credit I gradually withdrew from it excusing
myself by my being obligd to attend the higher duties of a legislator
in the Assembly My election to this trust was repeated every year for
ten years without my ever asking any elector for his vote or
signifying either directly or indirectly any desire of being chosen
On taking my seat in the House my son was appointed their clerk

The year following a treaty being to be held with the Indians at
Carlisle the governor sent a message to the House proposing that
they should nominate some of their members to be joind with some
members of council as commissioners for that purpose88 The House
named the speaker Mr Norris and myself and being commissiond we
went to Carlisle and met the Indians accordingly

As those people are extreamly apt to get drunk and when so are very
quarrelsome and disorderly we strictly forbade the selling any
liquor to them and when they complaind of this restriction we told
them that if they would continue sober during the treaty we would
give them plenty of rum when business was over They promisd this
and they kept their promise because they could get no liquor and the
treaty was conducted very orderly and concluded to mutual
satisfaction They then claimd and received the rum this was in the
afternoon they were near one hundred men women and children and
were lodgd in temporary cabins built in the form of a square just
without the town In the evening hearing a great noise among them
the commissioners walkd out to see what was the matter We found they
had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square they were all
drunk men and women quarreling and fighting Their darkcolourd
bodies half naked seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire
running after and beating one another with firebrands accompanied by
their horrid yellings formd a scene the most resembling our ideas of
hell that could well be imagind there was no appeasing the tumult
and we retired to our lodging At midnight a number of them came
thundering at our door demanding more rum of which we took no
notice

The next day sensible they had misbehavd in giving us that
disturbance they sent three of their old counselors to make their
apology The orator acknowledgd the fault but laid it upon the rum
and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying The Great Spirit
who made all things made everything for some use and whatever use he
designd anything for that use it should always be put to Now when
he made rum he said Let this be for the Indians to get drunk
with and it must be so And indeed if it be the design of
Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for
cultivators of the earth it seems not improbable that rum may be the
appointed means It has already annihilated all the tribes who
formerly inhabited the seacoast

Illustration In the evening hearing a great noise among them the
commissioners walkd out to see what was the matter

In 1751 Dr Thomas Bond a particular friend of mine conceived the
idea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia a very beneficent
design which has been ascribd to me but was originally his for
the reception and cure of poor sick persons whether inhabitants of
the province or strangers He was zealous and active in endeavouring
to procure subscriptions for it but the proposal being a novelty in
America and at first not well understood he met but with small
success

At length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no
such thing as carrying a publicspirited project through without my
being concernd in it For says he I am often askd by those to
whom I propose subscribing Have you consulted Franklin upon this
business And what does he think of it And when I tell them that I
have not supposing it rather out of your line they do not
subscribe but say they will consider of it I enquired into the
nature and probable utility of his scheme and receiving from him a
very satisfactory explanation I not only subscribd to it myself but
engagd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others
Previously however to the solicitation I endeavoured to prepare the
minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers which
was my usual custom in such cases but which he had omitted

The subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous but
beginning to flag I saw they would be insufficient without some
assistance from the Assembly and therefore proposd to petition for
it which was done The country members did not at first relish the
project they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city
and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it and
they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approvd of it
My allegation on the contrary that it met with such approbation as to
leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by
voluntary donations they considered as a most extravagant
supposition and utterly impossible

On this I formd my plan and asking leave to bring in a bill for
incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their
petition and granting them a blank sum of money which leave was
obtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the
bill out if they did not like it I drew it so as to make the
important clause a conditional one viz And be it enacted by the
authority aforesaid that when the said contributors shall have met
and chosen their managers and treasurer and shall have raised by
their contributions a capital stock ofvalue the yearly
interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the
sick poor in the said hospital free of charge for diet attendance
advice and medicines and shall make the same appear to the
satisfaction of the speaker of the Assembly for the time being that
then it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker and he is
hereby required to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the
payment of two thousand pounds in two yearly payments to the
treasurer of the said hospital to be applied to the founding
building and finishing of the same

This condition carried the bill through for the members who had
opposd the grant and now conceivd they might have the credit of
being charitable without the expense agreed to its passage and then
in soliciting subscriptions among the people we urgd the conditional
promise of the law as an additional motive to give since every mans
donation would be doubled thus the clause workd both ways The
subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum and we
claimd and receivd the public gift which enabled us to carry the
design into execution A convenient and handsome building was soon
erected the institution has by constant experience been found useful
and flourishes to this day and I do not remember any of my political
manoeuvers the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure
or wherein after thinking of it I more easily excusd myself for
having made some use of cunning

It was about this time that another projector the Rev Gilbert
Tennent89 came to me with a request that I would assist him in
procuring a subscription for erecting a new meetinghouse It was to
be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the
Presbyterians who were originally disciples of Mr Whitefield
Unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellowcitizens by too
frequently soliciting their contributions I absolutely refusd He
then desired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons I
knew by experience to be generous and publicspirited I thought it
would be unbecoming in me after their kind compliance with my
solicitations to mark them out to be worried by other beggars and
therefore refusd also to give such a list He then desird I would at
least give him my advice That I will readily do said I and in
the first place I advise you to apply to all those whom you know will
give something next to those whom you are uncertain whether they
will give anything or not and show them the list of those who have
given and lastly do not neglect those who you are sure will give
nothing for in some of them you may be mistaken He laughd and
thankd me and said he would take my advice He did so for he askd
of everybody and he obtaind a much larger sum than he expected
with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meetinghouse
that stands in Archstreet

    89 Gilbert Tennent 17031764 came to America with his
    father Rev William Tennent and taught for a time in
    the Log College from which sprang the College of New
    JerseySmyth

Our city tho laid out with a beautiful regularity the streets
large straight and crossing each other at right angles had the
disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpavd and in wet
weather the wheels of heavy carriages ploughd them into a quagmire
so that it was difficult to cross them and in dry weather the dust
was offensive I had livd near what was calld the Jersey Market and
saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their
provisions A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at
length pavd with brick so that being once in the market they had
firm footing but were often over shoes in dirt to get there By
talking and writing on the subject I was at length instrumental in
getting the street pavd with stone between the market and the brickd
footpavement that was on each side next the houses This for some
time gave an easy access to the market dryshod but the rest of the
street not being pavd whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon
this pavement it shook off and left its dirt upon it and it was soon
coverd with mire which was not removd the city as yet having no
scavengers

After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man who was willing
to undertake keeping the pavement clean by sweeping it twice a week
carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours doors for the
sum of sixpence per month to be paid by each house I then wrote and
printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that
might be obtaind by this small expense the greater ease in keeping
our houses clean so much dirt not being brought in by peoples feet
the benefit to the shops by more custom etc etc as buyers could
more easily get at them and by not having in windy weather the dust
blown in upon their goods etc etc I sent one of these papers to
each house and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe
an agreement to pay these sixpences it was unanimously signd and
for a time well executed All the inhabitants of the city were
delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the
market it being a convenience to all and this raisd a general
desire to have all the streets paved and made the people more willing
to submit to a tax for that purpose

After some time I drew a bill for paving the city and brought it into
the Assembly It was just before I went to England in 1757 and did
not pass till I was gone90 and then with an alteration in the mode
of assessment which I thought not for the better but with an
additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets which
was a great improvement It was by a private person the late Mr John
Clifton his giving a sample of the utility of lamps by placing one
at his door that the people were first impressd with the idea of
enlighting all the city The honour of this public benefit has also
been ascribd to me but it belongs truly to that gentleman I did but
follow his example and have only some merit to claim respecting the
form of our lamps as differing from the globe lamps we were at first
supplyd with from London Those we found inconvenient in these
respects they admitted no air below the smoke therefore did not
readily go out above but circulated in the globe lodgd on its
inside and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford
giving besides the daily trouble of wiping them clean and an
accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it and render it
totally useless I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat
panes with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke and crevices
admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the smoke by this
means they were kept clean and did not grow dark in a few hours as
the London lamps do but continud bright till morning and an
accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane easily
repaird

I have sometimes wonderd that the Londoners did not from the effect
holes in the bottom of the globe lamps usd at Vauxhall91 have in
keeping them clean learn to have such holes in their street lamps
But these holes being made for another purpose viz to communicate
flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro
them the other use of letting in air seems not to have been thought
of and therefore after the lamps have been lit a few hours the
streets of London are very poorly illuminated

    remembered because of Sir Roger de Coverleys visit to
    them in the Spectator and from the descriptions in
    Smolletts Humphry Clinker and Thackerays Vanity
    Fair

The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I proposd
when in London to Dr Fothergill who was among the best men I have
known and a great promoter of useful projects I had observd that
the streets when dry were never swept and the light dust carried
away but it was sufferd to accumulate till wet weather reducd it to
mud and then after lying some days so deep on the pavement that
there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with
brooms it was with great labour rakd together and thrown up into
carts open above the sides of which suffered some of the slush at
every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall sometimes to the
annoyance of footpassengers The reason given for not sweeping the
dusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops
and houses

Illustration a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch
broom

An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be
done in a little time I found at my door in Cravenstreet92 one
morning a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom she
appeared very pale and feeble as just come out of a fit of sickness
I askd who employd her to sweep there she said Nobody but I am
very poor and in distress and I sweeps before gentlefolkses doors
and hopes they will give me something I bid her sweep the whole
street clean and I would give her a shilling this was at nine
oclock at 12 she came for the shilling From the slowness I saw at
first in her working I could scarce believe that the work was done so
soon and sent my servant to examine it who reported that the whole
street was swept perfectly clean and all the dust placd in the
gutter which was in the middle and the next rain washd it quite
away so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean

    92 A short street near Charing Cross London

I then judgd that if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in
three hours a strong active man might have done it in half the time
And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in
such a narrow street running down its middle instead of two one on
each side near the footway for where all the rain that falls on a
street runs from the sides and meets in the middle it forms there a
current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with but when
divided into two channels it is often too weak to cleanse either and
only makes the mud it finds more fluid so that the wheels of
carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the footpavement
which is thereby rendered foul and slippery and sometimes splash it
upon those who are walking My proposal communicated to the good
doctor was as follows

For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of
London and Westminster it is proposed that the several watchmen be
contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons and the mud
rakd up at other times each in the several streets and lanes of his
round that they be furnishd with brooms and other proper instruments
for these purposes to be kept at their respective stands ready to
furnish the poor people they may employ in the service

That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at
proper distances before the shops and windows of houses are usually
opened when the scavengers with closecovered carts shall also
carry it all away

That the mud when rakd up be not left in heaps to be spread abroad
again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses but that the
scavengers be provided with bodies of carts not placd high upon
wheels but low upon sliders with lattice bottoms which being
coverd with straw will retain the mud thrown into them and permit
the water to drain from it whereby it will become much lighter water
making the greatest part of its weight these bodies of carts to be
placd at convenient distances and the mud brought to them in
wheelbarrows they remaining where placd till the mud is draind and
then horses brought to draw them away

I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of
this proposal on account of the narrowness of some streets and the
difficulty of placing the drainingsleds so as not to encumber too
much the passage but I am still of opinion that the former requiring
the dust to be swept up and carryd away before the shops are open is
very practicable in the summer when the days are long for in
walking thro the Strand and Fleetstreet one morning at seven
oclock I observd there was not one shop open tho it had been
daylight and the sun up above three hours the inhabitants of London
chusing voluntarily to live much by candlelight and sleep by
sunshine and yet often complain a little absurdly of the duty on
candles and the high price of tallow

Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating
but when they consider that tho dust blown into the eyes of a single
person or into a single shop on a windy day is but of small
importance yet the great number of the instances in a populous city
and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence perhaps
they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to
affairs of this seemingly low nature Human felicity is produced not
so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by
little advantages that occur every day Thus if you teach a poor
young man to shave himself and keep his razor in order you may
contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a
thousand guineas The money may be soon spent the regret only
remaining of having foolishly consumed it but in the other case he
escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers and of their
sometimes dirty fingers offensive breaths and dull razors he shaves
when most convenient to him and enjoys daily the pleasure of its
being done with a good instrument With these sentiments I have
hazarded the few preceding pages hoping they may afford hints which
some time or other may be useful to a city I love having lived many
years in it very happily and perhaps to some of our towns in America

Having been for some time employed by the postmastergeneral of
America as his comptroller in regulating several offices and bringing
the officers to account I was upon his death in 1753 appointed
jointly with Mr William Hunter to succeed him by a commission from
the postmastergeneral in England The American office never had
hitherto paid anything to that of Britain We were to have six hundred
pounds a year between us if we could make that sum out of the profits
of the office To do this a variety of improvements were necessary
some of these were inevitably at first expensive so that in the first
four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us
But it soon after began to repay us and before I was displacd by a
freak of the ministers of which I shall speak hereafter we had
brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown
as the postoffice of Ireland Since that imprudent transaction they
have receivd from itnot one farthing

The business of the postoffice occasiond my taking a journey this
year to New England where the College of Cambridge of their own
motion presented me with the degree of Master of Arts Yale College
in Connecticut had before made me a similar compliment Thus without
studying in any college I came to partake of their honours They were
conferrd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the
electric branch of natural philosophy

ALBANY PLAN OF UNION


In 1754 war with France being again apprehended a congress of
commissioners from the different colonies was by an order of the
Lords of Trade to be assembled at Albany there to confer with the
chiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their
country and ours Governor Hamilton having receivd this order
acquainted the House with it requesting they would furnish proper
presents for the Indians to be given on this occasion and naming the
speaker Mr Norris and myself to join Mr Thomas Penn and Mr
Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania The House
approvd the nomination and provided the goods for the present and
tho they did not much like treating out of the provinces and we met
the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June

In our way thither I projected and drew a plan for the union of all
the colonies under one government so far as might be necessary for
defense and other important general purposes As we passd thro New
York I had there shown my project to Mr James Alexander and Mr
Kennedy two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs and
being fortified by their approbation I venturd to lay it before the
Congress It then appeared that several of the commissioners had
formd plans of the same kind A previous question was first taken
whether a union should be established which passd in the affirmative
unanimously A committee was then appointed one member from each
colony to consider the several plans and report Mine happend to be
preferrd and with a few amendments was accordingly reported

Illustration JOIN or DIE

By this plan the general government was to be administered by a
presidentgeneral appointed and supported by the crown and a grand
council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the
several colonies met in their respective assemblies The debates upon
it in Congress went on daily hand in hand with the Indian business
Many objections and difficulties were started but at length they were
all overcome and the plan was unanimously agreed to and copies
ordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies
of the several provinces Its fate was singular the assemblies did
not adopt it as they all thought there was too much prerogative in
it and in England it was judgd to have too much of the democratic
The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it nor recommend it
for the approbation of his majesty but another scheme was formd
supposed to answer the same purpose better whereby the governors of
the provinces with some members of their respective councils were to
meet and order the raising of troops building of forts etc and to
draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense which was
afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on
America My plan with my reasons in support of it is to be found
among my political papers that are printed

Being the winter following in Boston I had much conversation with
Governor Shirley upon both the plans Part of what passed between us
on the occasion may also be seen among those papers The different and
contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was
really the true medium and I am still of opinion it would have been
happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted The colonies
so united would have been sufficiently strong to have defended
themselves there would then have been no need of troops from England
of course the subsequent pretence for taxing America and the bloody
contest it occasioned would have been avoided But such mistakes are
not new history is full of the errors of states and princes

  Look round the habitable world how few
   Know their own good or knowing it pursue

Those who govern having much business on their hands do not
generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into
execution new projects The best public measures are therefore seldom
adopted from previous wisdom but forcd by the occasion

The Governor of Pennsylvania in sending it down to the Assembly
expressed his approbation of the plan as appearing to him to be
drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment and therefore
recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious
attention The House however by the management of a certain member
took it up when I happend to be absent which I thought not very
fair and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all to
my no small mortification

QUARRELS WITH THE PROPRIETARY
GOVERNORS


In my journey to Boston this year I met at New York with our new
governor Mr Morris just arrivd there from England with whom I had
been before intimately acquainted He brought a commission to
supersede Mr Hamilton who tird with the disputes his proprietary
instructions subjected him to had resignd Mr Morris askd me if I
thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration I said
No you may on the contrary have a very comfortable one if you
will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly
My dear friend says he pleasantly how can you advise my avoiding
disputes You know I love disputing it is one of my greatest
pleasures however to show the regard I have for your counsel I
promise you I will if possible avoid them He had some reason for
loving to dispute being eloquent an acute sophister and therefore
generally successful in argumentative conversation He had been
brought up to it from a boy his father as I have heard accustoming
his children to dispute with one another for his diversion while
sitting at table after dinner but I think the practice was not wise
for in the course of my observation these disputing contradicting
and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs They
get victory sometimes but they never get good will which would be of
more use to them We parted he going to Philadelphia and I to
Boston

In returning I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly by
which it appeard that notwithstanding his promise to me he and the
House were already in high contention and it was a continual battle
between them as long as he retaind the government I had my share of
it for as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly I was put
on every committee for answering his speeches and messages and by the
committees always desired to make the drafts Our answers as well as
his messages were often tart and sometimes indecently abusive and
as he knew I wrote for the Assembly one might have imagined that
when we met we could hardly avoid cutting throats but he was so
goodnaturd a man that no personal difference between him and me was
occasiond by the contest and we often dind together

public quarrel we met in the street

One afternoon in the height of this public quarrel we met in the
street Franklin says he you must go home with me and spend the
evening I am to have some company that you will like and taking me
by the arm he led me to his house In gay conversation over our wine
after supper he told us jokingly that he much admird the idea of
Sancho Panza93 who when it was proposed to give him a government
requested it might be a government of blacks as then if he could
not agree with his people he might sell them One of his friends who
sat next to me says Franklin why do you continue to side with
these damnd Quakers Had not you better sell them The proprietor
would give you a good price The governor says I has not yet
blacked them enough He indeed had laboured hard to blacken the
Assembly in all his messages but they wipd off his colouring as fast
as he laid it on and placd it in return thick upon his own face
so that finding he was likely to be negrofied himself he as well as
Mr Hamilton grew tird of the contest and quitted the government

These public quarrels94 were all at bottom owing to the
proprietaries our hereditary governors who when any expense was to
be incurred for the defense of their province with incredible
meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the
necessary taxes unless their vast estates were in the same act
expressly excused and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to
observe such instructions The Assemblies for three years held out
against this injustice tho constrained to bend at last At length
Captain Denny who was Governor Morriss successor ventured to
disobey those instructions how that was brought about I shall show
hereafter

But I am got forward too fast with my story there are still some
transactions to be mentiond that happened during the administration
of Governor Morris

War being in a manner commenced with France the government of
Massachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point95 and sent
Mr Quincy to Pennsylvania and Mr Pownall afterward Governor
Pownall to New York to solicit assistance As I was in the Assembly
knew its temper and was Mr Quincys countryman he applid to me for
my influence and assistance I dictated his address to them which was
well received They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds to be laid
out in provisions But the governor refusing his assent to their bill
which included this with other sums granted for the use of the
crown unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate
from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary the
Assembly tho very desirous of making their grant to New England
effectual were at a loss how to accomplish it Mr Quincy labored
hard with the governor to obtain his assent but he was obstinate

    95 On Lake Champlain ninety miles north of Albany It
    was captured by the French in 1731 attacked by the
    English in 1755 and 1756 and abandoned by the French in
    1759 It was finally captured from the English by the
    Americans in 1775

I then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor
by orders on the trustees of the Loan office which by law the
Assembly had the right of drawing There was indeed little or no
money at that time in the office and therefore I proposd that the
orders should be payable in a year and to bear an interest of five
per cent With these orders I supposd the provisions might easily be
purchasd The Assembly with very little hesitation adopted the
proposal The orders were immediately printed and I was one of the
committee directed to sign and dispose of them The fund for paying
them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the
province upon loan together with the revenue arising from the excise
which being known to be more than sufficient they obtaind instant
credit and were not only receivd in payment for the provisions but
many moneyd people who had cash lying by them vested it in those
orders which they found advantageous as they bore interest while
upon hand and might on any occasion be used as money so that they
were eagerly all bought up and in a few weeks none of them were to be
seen Thus this important affair was by my means completed Mr Quincy
returnd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial went home
highly pleasd with this success of his embassy and ever after bore
for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship

BRADDOCKS EXPEDITION


The British government not chusing to permit the union of the
colonies as proposd at Albany and to trust that union with their
defense lest they should thereby grow too military and feel their
own strength suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertaind
of them sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular
English troops for that purpose He landed at Alexandria in Virginia
and thence marchd to Frederictown in Maryland where he halted for
carriages Our Assembly apprehending from some information that he
had conceived violent prejudices against them as averse to the
service wishd me to wait upon him not as from them but as
postmastergeneral under the guise of proposing to settle with him
the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches
between him and the governors of the several provinces with whom he
must necessarily have continual correspondence and of which they
proposd to pay the expense My son accompanied me on this journey

We found the general at Frederictown waiting impatiently for the
return of those he had sent thro the back parts of Maryland and
Virginia to collect waggons I stayed with him several days dind
with him daily and had full opportunity of removing all his
prejudices by the information of what the Assembly had before his
arrival actually done and were still willing to do to facilitate his
operations When I was about to depart the returns of waggons to be
obtained were brought in by which it appeard that they amounted only
to twentyfive and not all of those were in serviceable condition
The general and all the officers were surprisd declard the
expedition was then at an end being impossible and exclaimd against
the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of
the means of conveying their stores baggage etc not less than one
hundred and fifty waggons being necessary

I happend to say I thought it was pity they had not been landed
rather in Pennsylvania as in that country almost every farmer had his
waggon The general eagerly laid hold of my words and said Then
you sir who are a man of interest there can probably procure them
for us and I beg you will undertake it I askd what terms were to
be offerd the owners of the waggons and I was desird to put on
paper the terms that appeared to me necessary This I did and they
were agreed to and a commission and instructions accordingly prepard
immediately What those terms were will appear in the advertisement I
publishd as soon as I arrivd at Lancaster which being from the
great and sudden effect it producd a piece of some curiosity I
shall insert it at length as follows

   Lancaster April 26 1755

Whereas one hundred and fifty waggons with four horses to each
waggon and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses are wanted for the
service of his majestys forces now about to rendezvous at Wills
Creek and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to
empower me to contract for the hire of the same I hereby give notice
that I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day to
next Wednesday evening and at York from next Thursday morning till
Friday evening where I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams
or single horses on the following terms viz 1 That there shall be
paid for each waggon with four good horses and a driver fifteen
shillings per diem and for each able horse with a packsaddle or
other saddle and furniture two shillings per diem and for each able
horse without a saddle eighteen pence per diem 2 That the pay
commence from the time of their joining the forces at Wills Creek
which must be on or before the 20th of May ensuing and that a
reasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for
their travelling to Wills Creek and home again after their discharge
3 Each waggon and team and every saddle or pack horse is to be
valued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner and in
case of the loss of any waggon team or other horse in the service
the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid 4
Seven days pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner
of each waggon and team or horse at the time of contracting if
required and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock or by the
paymaster of the army at the time of their discharge or from time to
time as it shall be demanded 5 No drivers of waggons or persons
taking care of the hired horses are on any account to be called upon
to do the duty of soldiers or be otherwise employed than in
conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses 6 All oats
Indian corn or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp
more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses is to be
taken for the use of the army and a reasonable price paid for the
same

Friends and Countrymen

Being occasionally96 at the camp at Frederic a few days since I
found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of
their not being supplied with horses and carriages which had been
expected from this province as most able to furnish them but
through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly money had
not been provided nor any steps taken for that purpose

    96 By chance

It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these
counties to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should
be wanted and compel as many persons into the service as would be
necessary to drive and take care of them

I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these
counties on such an occasion especially considering the temper they
are in and their resentment against us would be attended with many
and great inconveniences to the inhabitants and therefore more
willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair
and equitable means The people of these back counties have lately
complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting you
have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very
considerable sum for if the service of this expedition should
continue as it is more than probable it will for one hundred and
twenty days the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to
upward of thirty thousand pounds which will be paid you in silver and
gold of the kings money

The service will be light and easy for the army will scarce march
above twelve miles per day and the waggons and baggagehorses as
they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare
of the army must march with the army and no faster and are for the
armys sake always placed where they can be most secure whether in a
march or in a camp

If you are really as I believe you are good and loyal subjects to
his majesty you may now do a most acceptable service and make it
easy to yourselves for three or four of such as cannot separately
spare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses
and a driver may do it together one furnishing the waggon another
one or two horses and another the driver and divide the pay
proportionately between you but if you do not this service to your
king and country voluntarily when such good pay and reasonable terms
are offered to you your loyalty will be strongly suspected The
kings business must be done so many brave troops come so far for
your defense must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what
may be reasonably expected from you waggons and horses must be had
violent measures will probably be used and you will be left to seek
for a recompense where you can find it and your case perhaps be
little pitied or regarded

I have no particular interest in this affair as except the
satisfaction of endeavouring to do good I shall have only my labour
for my pains If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is
not likely to succeed I am obliged to send word to the general in
fourteen days and I suppose Sir John St Clair the hussar with a
body of soldiers will immediately enter the province for the purpose
which I shall be sorry to hear because I am very sincerely and truly
your friend and wellwisher

I received of the general about eight hundred pounds to be disbursed
in advancemoney to the waggon owners etc but that sum being
insufficient I advancd upward of two hundred pounds more and in two
weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons with two hundred and
fiftynine carrying horses were on their march for the camp The
advertisement promised payment according to the valuation in case any
waggon or horse should be lost The owners however alleging they did
not know General Braddock or what dependence might be had on his
promise insisted on my bond for the performance which I accordingly
gave them

While I was at the camp supping one evening with the officers of
Colonel Dunbars regiment he represented to me his concern for the
subalterns who he said were generally not in affluence and could
ill afford in this dear country to lay in the stores that might be
necessary in so long a march thro a wilderness where nothing was to
be purchasd I commiserated their case and resolved to endeavour
procuring them some relief I said nothing however to him of my
intention but wrote the next morning to the committee of the
Assembly who had the disposition of some public money warmly
recommending the case of these officers to their consideration and
proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and
refreshments My son who had some experience of a camp life and of
its wants drew up a list for me which I enclosd in my letter The
committee approvd and used such diligence that conducted by my son
the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons They consisted
of twenty parcels each containing

6 lbs loaf sugar
6 lbs good Muscovado do
1 lb good green tea
1 lb good bohea do
6 lbs good ground coffee
6 lbs chocolate
12 cwt best white biscuit
12 lb pepper
1 quart best white wine
vinegar
1 Gloucester cheese
1 kegg containing 20 lbs
good butter
2 doz old Madeira wine
2 gallons Jamaica spirits
1 bottle flour of mustard
2 wellcurd hams
12 dozen dryd tongues
6 lbs rice
6 lbs raisins

These twenty parcels well packd were placed on as many horses each
parcel with the horse being intended as a present for one officer
They were very thankfully receivd and the kindness acknowledgd by
letters to me from the colonels of both regiments in the most
grateful terms The general too was highly satisfied with my conduct
in procuring him the waggons etc and readily paid my account of
disbursements thanking me repeatedly and requesting my farther
assistance in sending provisions after him I undertook this also and
was busily employd in it till we heard of his defeat advancing for
the service of my own money upwards of one thousand pounds sterling
of which I sent him an account It came to his hands luckily for me
a few days before the battle and he returnd me immediately an order
on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds leaving the
remainder to the next account I consider this payment as good luck
having never been able to obtain that remainder of which more
hereafter

This general was I think a brave man and might probably have made a
figure as a good officer in some European war But he had too much
selfconfidence too high an opinion of the validity of regular
troops and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians George
Croghan our Indian interpreter joind him on his march with one
hundred of those people who might have been of great use to his army
as guides scouts etc if he had treated them kindly but he
slighted and neglected them and they gradually left him

In conversation with him one day he was giving me some account of his
intended progress After taking Fort Duquesne97 says he I am to
proceed to Niagara and having taken that to Frontenac98 if the
season will allow time and I suppose it will for Duquesne can hardly
detain me above three or four days and then I see nothing that can
obstruct my march to Niagara Having before revolvd in my mind the
long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road to
be cut for them thro the woods and bushes and also what I had read
of a former defeat of fifteen hundred French who invaded the Iroquois
country I had conceivd some doubts and some fears for the event of
the campaign But I venturd only to say To be sure sir if you
arrive well before Duquesne with these fine troops so well provided
with artillery that place not yet completely fortified and as we
hear with no very strong garrison can probably make but a short
resistance The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march
is from ambuscades of Indians who by constant practice are
dexterous in laying and executing them and the slender line near
four miles long which your army must make may expose it to be
attackd by surprise in its flanks and to be cut like a thread into
several pieces which from their distance cannot come up in time to
support each other

He smild at my ignorance and replyd These savages may indeed be
a formidable enemy to your raw American militia but upon the kings
regular and disciplind troops sir it is impossible they should make
any impression I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing
with a military man in matters of his profession and said no more
The enemy however did not take the advantage of his army which I
apprehended its long line of march exposd it to but let it advance
without interruption till within nine miles of the place and then
when more in a body for it had just passed a river where the front
had halted till all were come over and in a more open part of the
woods than any it had passd attackd its advanced guard by heavy
fire from behind trees and bushes which was the first intelligence
the general had of an enemys being near him This guard being
disordered the general hurried the troops up to their assistance
which was done in great confusion thro waggons baggage and cattle
and presently the fire came upon their flank the officers being on
horseback were more easily distinguishd pickd out as marks and
fell very fast and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle
having or hearing no orders and standing to be shot at till
twothirds of them were killed and then being seizd with a panick
the whole fled with precipitation

Illustration The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your
march is from ambuscades of Indians

The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamperd their
example was immediately followed by others so that all the waggons
provisions artillery and stores were left to the enemy The general
being wounded was brought off with difficulty his secretary Mr
Shirley was killed by his side and out of eightysix officers
sixtythree were killed or wounded and seven hundred and fourteen men
killed out of eleven hundred These eleven hundred had been picked men
from the whole army the rest had been left behind with Colonel
Dunbar who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores
provisions and baggage The flyers not being pursud arrivd at
Dunbars camp and the panick they brought with them instantly seizd
him and all his people and tho he had now above one thousand men
and the enemy who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four
hundred Indians and French together instead of proceeding and
endeavouring to recover some of the lost honour he ordered all the
stores ammunition etc to be destroyd that he might have more
horses to assist his flight towards the settlements and less lumber
to remove He was there met with requests from the governors of
Virginia Maryland and Pennsylvania that he would post his troops on
the frontier so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants but
he continued his hasty march thro all the country not thinking
himself safe till he arrived at Philadelphia where the inhabitants
could protect him This whole transaction gave us Americans the first
suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regulars
had not been well founded99

    found in Fiskes Washington and his Country or
    Lodges George Washington Vol 1

In their first march too from their landing till they got beyond the
settlements they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants totally
ruining some poor families besides insulting abusing and confining
the people if they remonstrated This was enough to put us out of
conceit of such defenders if we had really wanted any How different
was the conduct of our French friends in 1781 who during a march
thro the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to
Virginia near seven hundred miles occasioned not the smallest
complaint for the loss of a pig a chicken or even an apple

Captain Orme who was one of the generals aidsdecamp and being
grievously wounded was brought off with him and continud with him
to his death which happend in a few days told me that he was
totally silent all the first day and at night only said Who would
have thought it That he was silent again the following day saying
only at last We shall better know how to deal with them another
time and dyd in a few minutes after

The secretarys papers with all the generals orders instructions
and correspondence falling into the enemys hands they selected and
translated into French a number of the articles which they printed
to prove the hostile intentions of the British court before the
declaration of war Among these I saw some letters of the general to
the ministry speaking highly of the great service I had rendered the
army and recommending me to their notice David Hume100 too who was
some years after secretary to Lord Hertford when minister in France
and afterward to General Conway when secretary of state told me he
had seen among the papers in that office letters from Braddock highly
recommending me But the expedition having been unfortunate my
service it seems was not thought of much value for those
recommendations were never of any use to me

As to rewards from himself I askd only one which was that he would
give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought
servants and that he would discharge such as had been already
enlisted This he readily granted and several were accordingly
returnd to their masters on my application Dunbar when the command
devolvd on him was not so generous He being at Philadelphia on his
retreat or rather flight I applyd to him for the discharge of the
servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he had
enlisted reminding him of the late generals orders on that head He
promised me that if the masters would come to him at Trenton where
he should be in a few days on his march to New York he would there
deliver their men to them They accordingly were at the expense and
trouble of going to Trenton and there he refusd to perform his
promise to their great loss and disappointment

As soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known all
the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to
pay Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble my acquainting
them that the money was ready in the paymasters hands but that
orders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley101
and my assuring them that I had applyd to that general by letter
but he being at a distance an answer could not soon be receivd and
they must have patience all this was not sufficient to satisfy and
some began to sue me General Shirley at length relieved me from this
terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims
and ordering payment They amounted to near twenty thousand pound
which to pay would have ruined me

Before we had the news of this defeat the two Doctors Bond came to me
with a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a
grand firework which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on
receipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne I looked grave and
said it would I thought be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing
when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice They seemd surprisd
that I did not immediately comply with their proposal Why the
dl says one of them you surely dont suppose that the
fort will not be taken I dont know that it will not be taken but
I know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty I
gave them the reasons of my doubting the subscription was dropt and
the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have
undergone if the firework had been prepared Dr Bond on some other
occasion afterward said that he did not like Franklins forebodings

Governor Morris who had continually worried the Assembly with message
after message before the defeat of Braddock to beat them into the
making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province without
taxing among others the proprietary estates and had rejected all
their bills for not having such an exempting clause now redoubled his
attacks with more hope of success the danger and necessity being
greater The Assembly however continud firm believing they had
justice on their side and that it would be giving up an essential
right if they suffered the governor to amend their moneybills In one
of the last indeed which was for granting fifty thousand pounds his
proposd amendment was only of a single word The bill expressd that
all estates real and personal were to be taxed those of the
proprietaries not excepted His amendment was for not read
only a small but very material alteration However when the news
of this disaster reached England our friends there whom we had taken
care to furnish with all the Assemblys answers to the governors
messages raisd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness
and injustice in giving their governor such instructions some going
so far as to say that by obstructing the defense of their province
they forfeited their right to it They were intimidated by this and
sent orders to their receivergeneral to add five thousand pounds of
their money to whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for such
purpose

This being notified to the House was accepted in lieu of their share
of a general tax and a new bill was formd with an exempting clause
which passed accordingly By this act I was appointed one of the
commissioners for disposing of the money sixty thousand pounds I had
been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage and had
at the same time drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining a
voluntary militia which I carried thro the House without much
difficulty as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at their
liberty To promote the association necessary to form the militia I
wrote a dialogue102 stating and answering all the objections I could
think of to such a militia which was printed and had as I thought
great effect

FRANKLINS DEFENSE OF THE
FRONTIER


While the several companies in the city and country were forming and
learning their exercise the governor prevaild with me to take charge
of our Northwestern frontier which was infested by the enemy and
provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and
building a line of forts I undertook this military business tho I
did not conceive myself well qualified for it He gave me a commission
with full powers and a parcel of blank commissions for officers to
be given to whom I thought fit I had but little difficulty in raising
men having soon five hundred and sixty under my command My son who
had in the preceding war been an officer in the army raisd against
Canada was my aiddecamp and of great use to me The Indians had
burned Gnadenhut103 a village settled by the Moravians and massacred
the inhabitants but the place was thought a good situation for one of
the forts

    103 Pronounced Gna´denhoot

In order to march thither I assembled the companies at Bethlehem the
chief establishment of those people I was surprised to find it in so
good a posture of defense the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them
apprehend danger The principal buildings were defended by a stockade
they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York
and had even placd quantities of small paving stones between the
windows of their high stone houses for their women to throw down upon
the heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them The
armed brethren too kept watch and relievd as methodically as in
any garrison town In conversation with the bishop Spangenberg I
mentiond this my surprise for knowing they had obtained an act of
Parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies I had
supposd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms He
answerd me that it was not one of their established principles but
that at the time of their obtaining that act it was thought to be a
principle with many of their people On this occasion however they
to their surprise found it adopted by but a few It seems they were
either deceivd in themselves or deceivd the Parliament but common
sense aided by present danger will sometimes be too strong for
whimsical opinions

It was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business of
building forts I sent one detachment toward the Minisink with
instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the
country and another to the lower part with similar instructions and
I concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut where
a fort was thot more immediately necessary The Moravians procurd me
five waggons for our tools stores baggage etc

Just before we left Bethlehem eleven farmers who had been driven
from their plantations by the Indians came to me requesting a supply
of firearms that they might go back and fetch off their cattle I
gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition We had not marchd many
miles before it began to rain and it continued raining all day there
were no habitations on the road to shelter us till we arrivd near
night at the house of a German where and in his barn we were all
huddled together as wet as water could make us It was well we were
not attackd in our march for our arms were of the most ordinary
sort and our men could not keep their gun locks104 dry The Indians
are dexterous in contrivances for that purpose which we had not They
met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned and killed ten
of them The one who escapd informd that his and his companions
guns would not go off the priming being wet with the rain

    104 Flintlock guns discharged by means of a spark
    struck from flint and steel into powder priming in an
    open pan

Illustration We had not marchd many miles before it began to rain

The next day being fair we continud our march and arrivd at the
desolated Gnadenhut There was a sawmill near round which were left
several piles of boards with which we soon hutted ourselves an
operation the more necessary at that inclement season as we had no
tents Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found
there who had been half interrd by the country people

The next morning our fort was plannd and markd out the
circumference measuring four hundred and fiftyfive feet which would
require as many palisades to be made of trees one with another of a
foot diameter each Our axes of which we had seventy were
immediately set to work to cut down trees and our men being
dexterous in the use of them great despatch was made Seeing the
trees fall so fast I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two
men began to cut at a pine in six minutes they had it upon the
ground and I found it of fourteen inches diameter Each pine made
three palisades of eighteen feet long pointed at one end While these
were preparing our other men dug a trench all round of three feet
deep in which the palisades were to be planted and our waggons the
bodies being taken off and the fore and hind wheels separated
by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch105 we
had ten carriages with two horses each to bring the palisades from
the woods to the spot When they were set up our carpenters built a
stage

Illustration Our axes  were immediately set to work to cut down
trees

of boards all round within about six feet high for the men to stand
on when to fire thro the loopholes We had one swivel gun which we
mounted on one of the angles and fird it as soon as fixd to let
the Indians know if any were within hearing that we had such pieces
and thus our fort if such a magnificent name may be given to so
miserable a stockade was finishd in a week though it raind so hard
every other day that the men could not work

    105 Here the pole connecting the front and rear wheels
    of a wagon

This gave me occasion to observe that when men are employd they
are best contentd for on the days they worked they were goodnaturd
and cheerful and with the consciousness of having done a good days
work they spent the evening jollily but on our idle days they were
mutinous and quarrelsome finding fault with their pork the bread
etc and in continual illhumour which put me in mind of a
seacaptain whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work
and when his mate once told him that they had done everything and
there was nothing further to employ them about Oh says he make
them scour the anchor

This kind of fort however contemptible is a sufficient defense
against Indians who have no cannon Finding ourselves now posted
securely and having a place to retreat to on occasion we venturd
out in parties to scour the adjacent country We met with no Indians
but we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lain
to watch our proceedings There was an art in their contrivance of
those places that seems worth mention It being winter a fire was
necessary for them but a common fire on the surface of the ground
would by its light have discoverd their position at a distance They
had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter and
somewhat deeper we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the
charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods With these
coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes and we
observd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies made by
their laying all round with their legs hanging down in the holes to
keep their feet warm which with them is an essential point This
kind of fire so managd could not discover them either by its
light flame sparks or even smoke it appeard that their number was
not great and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by
them with prospect of advantage

We had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister Mr Beatty
who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers
and exhortations When they enlisted they were promised besides pay
and provisions a gill of rum a day which was punctually servd out
to them half in the morning and the other half in the evening and I
observed they were as punctual in attending to receive it upon which
I said to Mr Beatty It is perhaps below the dignity of your
profession to act as steward of the rum but if you were to deal it
out and only just after prayers you would have them all about you
He liked the thot undertook the office and with the help of a few
hands to measure out the liquor executed it to satisfaction and
never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended so
that I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by
some military laws for nonattendance on divine service

I had hardly finishd this business and got my fort well stord with
provisions when I receivd a letter from the governor acquainting me
that he had calld the Assembly and wished my attendance there if
the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining
there was no longer necessary My friends too of the Assembly
pressing me by their letters to be if possible at the meeting and
my three intended forts being now compleated and the inhabitants
contented to remain on their farms under that protection I resolved
to return the more willingly as a New England officer Colonel
Clapham experienced in Indian war being on a visit to our
establishment consented to accept the command I gave him a
commission and parading the garrison had it read before them and
introducd him to them as an officer who from his skill in military
affairs was much more fit to command them than myself and giving
them a little exhortation took my leave I was escorted as far as
Bethlehem where I rested a few days to recover from the fatigue I had
undergone The first night being in a good bed I could hardly sleep
it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at
Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two

While at Bethlehem I inquird a little into the practice of the
Moravians some of them had accompanied me and all were very kind to
me I found they workd for a common stock ate at common tables and
slept in common dormitories great numbers together In the
dormitories I observed loopholes at certain distances all along just
under the ceiling which I thought judiciously placed for change of
air I was at their church where I was entertaind with good musick
the organ being accompanied with violins hautboys flutes clarinets
etc I understood that their sermons were not usually preached to
mixed congregations of men women and children as is our common
practice but that they assembled sometimes the married men at other
times their wives then the young men the young women and the little
children each division by itself The sermon I heard was to the
latter who came in and were placd in rows on benches the boys under
the conduct of a young man their tutor and the girls conducted by a
young woman The discourse seemd well adapted to their capacities
and was delivered in a pleasing familiar manner coaxing them as it
were to be good They behavd very orderly but looked pale and
unhealthy which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors
or not allowd sufficient exercise

I inquird concerning the Moravian marriages whether the report was
true that they were by lot I was told that lots were usd only in
particular cases that generally when a young man found himself
disposd to marry he informd the elders of his class who consulted
the elder ladies that governd the young women As these elders of the
different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions
of their respective pupils they could best judge what matches were
suitable and their judgments were generally acquiescd in but if
for example it should happen that two or three young women were found
to be equally proper for the young man the lot was then recurred to
I objected if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the
parties some of them may chance to be very unhappy And so they
may answerd my informer if you let the parties chuse for
themselves which indeed I could not deny

Being returned to Philadelphia I found the association went on
swimmingly the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty
generally come into it formed themselves into companies and chose
their captains lieutenants and ensigns according to the new law
Dr B visited me and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to
spread a general good liking to the law and ascribed much to those
endeavours I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue
however not knowing but that he might be in the right I let him
enjoy his opinion which I take to be generally the best way in such
cases The officers meeting chose me to be colonel of the regiment
which I this time accepted I forget how many companies we had but we
paraded about twelve hundred welllooking men with a company of
artillery who had been furnished with six brass fieldpieces which
they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a
minute The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to
my house and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door
which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus
And my new honour proved not much less brittle for all our
commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England

During this short time of my colonelship being about to set out on a
journey to Virginia the officers of my regiment took it into their
heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town as
far as the Lower Ferry Just as I was getting on horseback they came
to my door between thirty and forty mounted and all in their
uniforms I had not been previously acquainted with the project or I
should have prevented it being naturally averse to the assuming of
state on any occasion and I was a good deal chagrind at their
appearance as I could not avoid their accompanying me What made it
worse was that as soon as we began to move they drew their swords
and rode with them naked all the way Somebody wrote an account of
this to the proprietor and it gave him great offense No such honour
had been paid him when in the province nor to any of his governors
and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal which
may be true for aught I know who was and still am ignorant of the
etiquette in such cases

This silly affair however greatly increased his rancour against me
which was before not a little on account of my conduct in the
Assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation which I
had always opposd very warmly and not without severe reflections on
his meanness and injustice of contending for it He accused me to the
ministry as being the great obstacle to the Kings service
preventing by my influence in the House the proper form of the bills
for raising money and he instanced this parade with my officers as a
proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province
out of his hands by force He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener
the postmastergeneral to deprive me of my office but it had no
other effect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition

Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the
House in which I as a member had so large a share there still
subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself and
we never had any personal difference I have sometimes since thought
that his little or no resentment against me for the answers it was
known I drew up to his messages might be the effect of professional
habit and that being bred a lawyer he might consider us both as
merely advocates for contending clients in a suit he for the
proprietaries and I for the Assembly He would therefore sometimes
call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points and
sometimes tho not often take my advice

We acted in concert to supply Braddocks army with provisions and
when the shocking news arrived of his defeat the governor sent in
haste for me to consult with him on measures for preventing the
desertion of the back counties I forget now the advice I gave but I
think it was that Dunbar should be written to and prevaild with if
possible to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection
till by reinforcements from the colonies he might be able to proceed
on the expedition And after my return from the frontier he would
have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with
provincial troops for the reduction of Fort Duquesne Dunbar and his
men being otherwise employed and he proposed to commission me as
general I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he
professd to have and I believe his professions must have exceeded
his real sentiments but probably he might think that my popularity
would facilitate the raising of the men and my influence in Assembly
the grant of money to pay them and that perhaps without taxing the
proprietary estate Finding me not so forward to engage as he
expected the project was dropt and he soon after left the
government being superseded by Captain Denny

SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS


Before I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under
this new governors administration it may not be amiss here to give
some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation

In 1746 being at Boston I met there with a Dr Spence who was
lately arrived from Scotland and showd me some electric experiments
They were imperfectly performd as he was not very expert but being
on a subject quite new to me they equally surprisd and pleased me
Soon after my return to Philadelphia our library company receivd
from Mr P Collinson Fellow of the Royal Society106 of London a
present of a glass tube with some account of the use of it in making
such experiments I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I
had seen at Boston and by much practice acquired great readiness in
performing those also which we had an account of from England
adding a number of new ones I say much practice for my house was
continually full for some time with people who came to see these new
wonders

    106 The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural
    Knowledge was founded in 1660 and holds the foremost
    place among English societies for the advancement of
    science

To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends I caused a
number of similar tubes to be blown at our glasshouse with which
they furnishd themselves so that we had at length several
performers Among these the principal was Mr Kinnersley an
ingenious neighbour who being out of business I encouraged to
undertake showing the experiments for money and drew up for him two
lectures in which the experiments were rangd in such order and
accompanied with such explanations in such method as that the
foregoing should assist in comprehending the following He procurd an
elegant apparatus for the purpose in which all the little machines
that I had roughly made for myself were nicely formd by
instrumentmakers His lectures were well attended and gave great
satisfaction and after some time he went thro the colonies
exhibiting them in every capital town and pickd up some money In
the West India islands indeed it was with difficulty the experiments
could be made from the general moisture of the air

Obligd as we were to Mr Collinson for his present of the tube etc
I thought it right he should be informd of our success in using it
and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments
He got them read in the Royal Society where they were not at first
thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions
One paper which I wrote for Mr Kinnersley on the sameness of
lightning with electricity107 I sent to Dr Mitchel an acquaintance
of mine and one of the members also of that society who wrote me
word that it had been read but was laughed at by the connoisseurs
The papers however being shown to Dr Fothergill he thought them of
too much value to be stifled and advisd the printing of them Mr
Collinson then gave them to Cave for publication in his Gentlemans
Magazine but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet and Dr
Fothergill wrote the preface Cave it seems judged rightly for his
profit for by the additions that arrived afterward they swelld to a
quarto volume which has had five editions and cost him nothing for
copymoney

    107 See page 327

It was however some time before those papers were much taken notice
of in England A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the
Count de Buffon108 a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in
France and indeed all over Europe he prevailed with M Dalibard109
to translate them into French and they were printed at Paris The
publication offended the Abbé Nollet preceptor in Natural Philosophy
to the royal family and an able experimenter who had formd and
publishd a theory of electricity which then had the general vogue
He could not at first believe that such a work came from America and
said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris to decry
his system Afterwards having been assurd that there really existed
such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia which he had doubted he
wrote and published a volume of Letters chiefly addressd to me
defending his theory and denying the verity of my experiments and of
the positions deducd from them

    108 A celebrated French naturalist 17071788

    109 Dalibard who had translated Franklins letters to
    Collinson into French was the first to demonstrate in
    a practical application of Franklins experiment that
    lightning and electricity are the same This was May
    10th 1752 one month before Franklin flew his famous
    kite at Philadelphia and proved the fact
    himselfMcMaster

I once purposd answering the abbé and actually began the answer
but on consideration that my writings contained a description of
experiments which anyone might repeat and verify and if not to be
verifid could not be defended or of observations offerd as
conjectures and not delivered dogmatically therefore not laying me
under any obligation to defend them and reflecting that a dispute
between two persons writing in different languages might be
lengthened greatly by mistranslations and thence misconceptions of
one anothers meaning much of one of the abbés letters being founded
on an error in the translation I concluded to let my papers shift for
themselves believing it was better to spend what time I could spare
from public business in making new experiments than in disputing
about those already made I therefore never answered M Nollet and
the event gave me no cause to repent my silence for my friend M le
Roy of the Royal Academy of Sciences took up my cause and refuted
him my book was translated into the Italian German and Latin
languages and the doctrine it containd was by degrees universally
adopted by the philosophers of Europe in preference to that of the
abbé so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect except
Monsieur B of Paris his élève and immediate disciple

What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity was the
success of one of its proposed experiments made by Messrs Dalibard
and De Lor at Marly for drawing lightning from the clouds This
engagd the public attention everywhere M de Lor who had an
apparatus for experimental philosophy and lecturd in that branch of
science undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia
Experiments and after they were performed before the king and
court all the curious of Paris flocked to see them I will not swell
this narrative with an account of that capital experiment nor of the
infinite pleasure I receivd in the success of a similar one I made
soon after with a kite at Philadelphia as both are to be found in the
histories of electricity

Dr Wright an English physician when at Paris wrote to a friend
who was of the Royal Society an account of the high esteem my
experiments were in among the learned abroad and of their wonder that
my writings had been so little noticed in England The society on
this resumd the consideration of the letters that had been read to
them and the celebrated Dr Watson drew up a summary account of them
and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject which he
accompanied with some praise of the writer This summary was then
printed in their Transactions and some members of the society in
London particularly the very ingenious Mr Canton having verified
the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed
rod and acquainting them with the success they soon made me more
than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me
Without my having made any application for that honour they chose me
a member and voted that I should be excusd the customary payments
which would have amounted to twentyfive guineas and ever since have
given me their Transactions gratis They also presented me with the
gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley110 for the year 1753 the delivery of
which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president Lord
Macclesfield wherein I was highly honoured

AGENT OF PENNSYLVANIA IN
LONDON


Our new governor Captain Denny brought over for me the
before mentioned medal from the Royal Society which he presented to
me at an entertainment given him by the city He accompanied it with
very polite expressions of his esteem for me having as he said been
long acquainted with my character After dinner when the company as
was customary at that time were engagd in drinking he took me aside
into another room and acquainted me that he had been advisd by his
friends in England to cultivate a friendship with me as one who was
capable of giving him the best advice and of contributing most
effectually to the making his administration easy that he therefore
desired of all things to have a good understanding with me and he
begged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render me
every service that might be in his power He said much to me also of
the proprietors good disposition towards the province and of the
advantage it might be to us all and to me in particular if the
opposition that had been so long continud to his measures was dropt
and harmony restord between him and the people in effecting which
it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself and I
might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses etc etc
The drinkers finding we did not return immediately to the table sent
us a decanter of Madeira which the governor made liberal use of and
in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises

My answers were to this purpose that my circumstances thanks to God
were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me and that
being a member of the Assembly I could not possibly accept of any
that however I had no personal enmity to the proprietary and that
whenever the public measures he proposd should appear to be for the
good of the people no one should espouse and forward them more
zealously than myself my past opposition having been founded on this
that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to
serve the proprietary interest with great prejudice to that of the
people that I was much obliged to him the governor for his
professions of regard to me and that he might rely on everything in
my power to make his administration as easy as possible hoping at the
same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate
instruction his predecessor had been hampered with

On this he did not then explain himself but when he afterwards came
to do business with the Assembly they appeard again the disputes
were renewed and I was as active as ever in the opposition being the
penman first of the request to have a communication of the
instructions and then of the remarks upon them which may be found in
the votes of the time and in the Historical Review I afterward
publishd But between us personally no enmity arose we were often
together he was a man of letters had seen much of the world and was
very entertaining and pleasing in conversation He gave me the first
information that my old friend Jas Ralph was still alive that he was
esteemd one of the best political writers in England had been
employed in the dispute111 between Prince Frederic and the king and
had obtaind a pension of three hundred a year that his reputation
was indeed small as a poet Pope having damned his poetry in the
Dunciad112 but his prose was thought as good as any mans

    111 Quarrel between George II and his son Frederick
    Prince of Wales who died before his father

    112 A satirical poem by Alexander Pope directed against
    various contemporary writers

The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in
manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with
the privileges of the people but with the service of the crown
resolvd to petition the king against them and appointed me their
agent to go over to England to present and support the petition The
House had sent up a bill to the governor granting a sum of sixty
thousand pounds for the kings use ten thousand pounds of which was
subjected to the orders of the then general Lord Loudoun which the
governor absolutely refusd to pass in compliance with his
instructions

I had agreed with Captain Morris of the packet at New York for my
passage and my stores were put on board when Lord Loudoun arrivd at
Philadelphia expressly as he told me to endeavour an accommodation
between the governor and Assembly that his majestys service might
not be obstructed by their dissensions Accordingly he desird the
governor and myself to meet him that he might hear what was to be
said on both sides We met and discussed the business In behalf of
the Assembly I urged all the various arguments that may be found in
the public papers of that time which were of my writing and are
printed with the minutes of the Assembly and the governor pleaded his
instructions the bond he had given to observe them and his ruin if
he disobeyd yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if Lord
Loudoun would advise it This his lordship did not chuse to do though
I once thought I had nearly prevaild with him to do it but finally
he rather chose to urge the compliance of the Assembly and he
entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose
declaring that he would spare none of the kings troops for the
defense of our frontiers and that if we did not continue to provide
for that defense ourselves they must remain exposd to the enemy

I acquainted the House with what had passd and presenting them with
a set of resolutions I had drawn up declaring our rights and that we
did not relinquish our claim to those rights but only suspended the
exercise of them on this occasion thro force against which we
protested they at length agreed to drop that bill and frame another
conformable to the proprietary instructions This of course the
governor passd and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage
But in the meantime the packet had sailed with my seastores which
was some loss to me and my only recompense was his lordships thanks
for my service all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling
to his share

He set out for New York before me and as the time for dispatching
the packetboats was at his disposition and there were two then
remaining there one of which he said was to sail very soon I
requested to know the precise time that I might not miss her by any
delay of mine His answer was I have given out that she is to sail
on Saturday next but I may let you know entre nous that if you
are there by Monday morning you will be in time but do not delay
longer By some accidental hindrance at a ferry it was Monday noon
before I arrived and I was much afraid she might have sailed as the
wind was fair but I was soon made easy by the information that she
was still in the harbor and would not move till the next day One
would imagine that I was now on the very point of departing for
Europe I thought so but I was not then so well acquainted with his
lordships character of which indecision was one of the strongest
features I shall give some instances It was about the beginning of
April that I came to New York and I think it was near the end of June
before we saild There were then two of the packetboats which had
been long in port but were detained for the generals letters which
were always to be ready tomorrow Another packet arrivd she too was
detaind and before we saild a fourth was expected Ours was the
first to be dispatchd as having been there longest Passengers were
engaged in all and some extremely impatient to be gone and the
merchants uneasy about their letters and the orders they had given
for insurance it being war time for fall goods but their anxiety
availd nothing his lordships letters were not ready and yet
whoever waited on him found him always at his desk pen in hand and
concluded he must needs write abundantly

Going myself one morning to pay my respects I found in his
antechamber one Innis a messenger of Philadelphia who had come from
thence express with a packet from Governor Denny for the general He
delivered to me some letters from my friends there which occasiond
my inquiring when he was to return and where he lodgd that I might
send some letters by him He told me he was orderd to call tomorrow
at nine for the generals answer to the governor and should set off
immediately I put my letters into his hands the same day A fortnight
after I met him again in the same place So you are soon returnd
Innis Returnd no I am not gone yet How so I have
called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his
lordships letter and it is not yet ready Is it possible when he
is so great a writer for I see him constantly at his escritoire
Yes says Innis but he is like St George on the signs always on
horseback and never rides on This observation of the messenger
was it seems well founded for when in England I understood that
Mr Pitt113 gave it as one reason for removing this general and
sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe that the minister never heard
from him and could not know what he was doing

    113 William Pitt first Earl of Chatham 17081778 a
    great English statesman and orator Under his able
    administration England won Canada from France He was a
    friend of America at the time of our Revolution

This daily expectation of sailing and all the three packets going
down to Sandy Hook to join the fleet there the passengers thought it
best to be on board lest by a sudden order the ships should sail and
they be left behind There if I remember right we were about six
weeks consuming our seastores and obligd to procure more At
length the fleet saild the general and all his army on board bound
to Louisburg with the intent to besiege and take that fortress all
the packetboats in company ordered to attend the generals ship
ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready We were out
five days before we got a letter with leave to part and then our ship
quitted the fleet and steered for England The other two packets he
still detained carried them with him to Halifax where he stayed some
time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts then altered
his mind as to besieging Louisburg and returned to New York with all
his troops together with the two packets above mentioned and all
their passengers During his absence the French and savages had taken
Fort George on the frontier of that province and the savages had
massacred many of the garrison after capitulation

I saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell who commanded one of those
packets He told me that when he had been detaind a month he
acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul to a degree that
must necessarily hinder her fast sailing a point of consequence for a
packetboat and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and
clean her bottom He was asked how long time that would require He
answered three days The general replied If you can do it in one
day I give leave otherwise not for you must certainly sail the day
after tomorrow So he never obtaind leave though detained
afterwards from day to day during full three months

I saw also in London one of Bonnells passengers who was so enragd
against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at New
York and then carrying him to Halifax and back again that he swore
he would sue him for damages Whether he did or not I never heard
but as he represented the injury to his affairs it was very
considerable

On the whole I wonderd much how such a man came to be intrusted114
with so important a business as the conduct of a great army but
having since seen more of the great world and the means of obtaining
and motives for giving places my wonder is diminished General
Shirley on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of
Braddock would in my opinion if continued in place have made a
much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757 which was
frivolous expensive and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception
for tho Shirley was not a bred soldier he was sensible and
sagacious in himself and attentive to good advice from others
capable of forming judicious plans and quick and active in carrying
them into execution Loudoun instead of defending the colonies with
his great army left them totally exposd while he paraded idly at
Halifax by which means Fort George was lost besides he derangd all
our mercantile operations and distressd our trade by a long embargo
on the exportation of provisions on pretence of keeping supplies from
being obtaind by the enemy but in reality for beating down their
price in favour of the contractors in whose profits it was said
perhaps from suspicion only he had a share And when at length the
embargo was taken off by neglecting to send notice of it to
Charlestown the Carolina fleet was detaind near three months longer
whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great
part of them foundered in their passage home

    114 This relation illustrates the corruption that
    characterized English public life in the eighteenth
    century See page 308 It was gradually overcome in
    the early part of the next century

Shirley was I believe sincerely glad of being relieved from so
burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man
unacquainted with military business I was at the entertainment given
by the city of New York to Lord Loudoun on his taking upon him the
command Shirley tho thereby superseded was present also There was
a great company of officers citizens and strangers and some chairs
having been borrowed in the neighborhood there was one among them
very low which fell to the lot of Mr Shirley Perceiving it as I sat
by him I said They have given you sir too low a seat No
matter says he Mr Franklin I find a low seat the easiest

While I was as afore mentiond detaind at New York I receivd all
the accounts of the provisions etc that I had furnishd to
Braddock some of which accounts could not sooner be obtaind from the
different persons I had employd to assist in the business I
presented them to Lord Loudoun desiring to be paid the balance He
causd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer who after
comparing every article with its voucher certified them to be right
and the balance due for which his lordship promisd to give me an
order on the paymaster This was however put off from time to time
and tho I calld often for it by appointment I did not get it At
length just before my departure he told me he had on better
consideration concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his
predecessors And you says he when in England have only to
exhibit your accounts at the treasury and you will be paid
immediately

I mentiond but without effect the great and unexpected expense I
had been put to by being detaind so long at New York as a reason for
my desiring to be presently paid and on my observing that it was not
right I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the
money I had advancd as I charged no commission for my service O
Sir says he you must not think of persuading us that you are no
gainer we understand better those affairs and know that every one
concerned in supplying the army finds means in the doing it to fill
his own pockets I assurd him that was not my case and that I had
not pocketed a farthing but he appeard clearly not to believe me
and indeed I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made
in such employments As to my balance I am not paid it to
this day of which more hereafter

Our captain of the paquet had boasted much before we sailed of the
swiftness of his ship unfortunately when we came to sea she proved
the dullest of ninetysix sail to his no small mortification After
many conjectures respecting the cause when we were near another ship
almost as dull as ours which however gaind upon us the captain
ordered all hands to come aft and stand as near the ensign staff as
possible We were passengers included about forty persons While we
stood there the ship mended her pace and soon left her neighbour far
behind which provd clearly what our captain suspected that she was
loaded too much by the head The casks of water it seems had been
all placd forward these he therefore orderd to be movd further
aft on which the ship recoverd her character and proved the best
sailer in the fleet

The captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots
which is accounted thirteen miles per hour We had on board as a
passenger Captain Kennedy of the Navy who contended that it was
impossible and that no ship ever sailed so fast and that there must
have been some error in the division of the logline or some mistake
in heaving the log115 A wager ensud between the two captains to be
decided when there should be sufficient wind Kennedy thereupon
examind rigorously the logline and being satisfid with that he
determind to throw the log himself Accordingly some days after when
the wind blew very fair and fresh and the captain of the
paquet Lutwidge said he believd she then went at the rate of
thirteen knots Kennedy made the experiment and ownd his wager lost

    115 A piece of wood shaped and weighted so as to keep it
    stable when in the water To this is attached a line
    knotted at regular distances By these devices it is
    possible to tell the speed of a ship

The above fact I give for the sake of the following observation It
has been remarkd as an imperfection in the art of shipbuilding
that it can never be known till she is tried whether a new ship will
or will not be a good sailer for that the model of a goodsailing
ship has been exactly followd in a new one which has provd on the
contrary remarkably dull I apprehend that this may partly be
occasiond by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of
lading rigging and sailing of a ship each has his system and the
same vessel laden by the judgment and orders of one captain shall
sail better or worse than when by the orders of another Besides it
scarce ever happens that a ship is formd fitted for the sea and
saild by the same person One man builds the hull another rigs her
a third lades and sails her No one of these has the advantage of
knowing all the ideas and experience of the others and therefore
cannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole

Even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea I have often
observd different judgments in the officers who commanded the
successive watches the wind being the same One would have the sails
trimmd sharper or flatter than another so that they seemd to have
no certain rule to govern by Yet I think a set of experiments might
be instituted first to determine the most proper form of the hull
for swift sailing next the best dimensions and properest place for
the masts then the form and quantity of sails and their position as
the wind may be and lastly the disposition of the lading This is
an age of experiments and I think a set accurately made and combind
would be of great use I am persuaded therefore that ere long some
ingenious philosopher will undertake it to whom I wish success

Illustration Sailing ship

We were several times chasd in our passage but outsaild every
thing and in thirty days had soundings We had a good observation
and the captain judgd himself so near our port Falmouth that if we
made a good run in the night we might be off the mouth of that harbor
in the morning and by running in the night might escape the notice of
the enemys privateers who often cruisd near the entrance of the
channel Accordingly all the sail was set that we could possibly
make and the wind being very fresh and fair we went right before it
and made great way The captain after his observation shapd his
course as he thought so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles but it
seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up St Georges
Channel which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley
Shovels squadron This indraught was probably the cause of what
happened to us

We had a watchman placd in the bow to whom they often called Look
well out before there and he as often answered Ay ay but
perhaps had his eyes shut and was half asleep at the time they
sometimes answering as is said mechanically for he did not see a
light just before us which had been hid by the studdingsails from
the man at the helm and from the rest of the watch but by an
accidental yaw of the ship was discoverd and occasiond a great
alarm we being very near it the light appearing to me as big as a
cartwheel It was midnight and our captain fast asleep but Captain
Kennedy jumping upon deck and seeing the danger ordered the ship to
wear round all sails standing an operation dangerous to the masts
but it carried us clear and we escaped shipwreck for we were running
right upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected This
deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses and
made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in America if I
should live to return there

In the morning it was found by the soundings etc that we were near
our port but a thick fog hid the land from our sight About nine
oclock the fog began to rise and seemd to be lifted up from the
water like the curtain at a playhouse discovering underneath the
town of Falmouth the vessels in its harbor and the fields that
surrounded it This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had
been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a
vacant ocean and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free
from the anxieties which the state of war occasiond

I set out immediately with my son for London and we only stopt a
little by the way to view Stonehenge116 on Salisbury Plain and Lord
Pembrokes house and gardens with his very curious antiquities at
Wilton We arrived in London the 27th of July 1757117

    116 A celebrated prehistoric ruin probably of a temple
    built by the early Britons near Salisbury England It
    consists of inner and outer circles of enormous stones
    some of which are connected by stone slabs

    117 Here terminates the Autobiography as published
    by Wm Temple Franklin and his successors What follows
    was written in the last year of Dr Franklins life and
    was never before printed in EnglishMr Bigelows
    note in his edition of 1868

As soon as I was settled in a lodging Mr Charles had provided for me
I went to visit Dr Fothergill to whom I was strongly recommended
and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advisd to obtain
He was against an immediate complaint to government and thought the
proprietaries should first be personally applid to who might
possibly be inducd by the interposition and persuasion of some
private friends to accommodate matters amicably I then waited on my
old friend and correspondent Mr Peter Collinson who told me that
John Hanbury the great Virginia merchant had requested to be
informed when I should arrive that he might carry me to Lord
Granvilles118 who was then President of the Council and wished to
see me as soon as possible I agreed to go with him the next morning
Accordingly Mr Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to
that noblemans who receivd me with great civility and after some
questions respecting the present state of affairs in America and
discourse thereupon he said to me You Americans have wrong ideas of
the nature of your constitution you contend that the kings
instructions to his governors are not laws and think yourselves at
liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion But those
instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister
going abroad for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of
ceremony They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws they
are then considered debated and perhaps amended in Council after
which they are signed by the king They are then so far as they
relate to you the law of the land for the king is the Legislator
of the Colonies119 I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me
I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be
made by our Assemblies to be presented indeed to the king for his
royal assent but that being once given the king could not repeal or
alter them And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws
without his assent so neither could he make a law for them without
theirs He assurd me I was totally mistaken I did not think so
however and his lordships conversation having a little alarmd me as
to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us I wrote it
down as soon as I returnd to my lodgings I recollected that about 20
years before a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the
ministry had proposd to make the kings instructions laws in the
colonies but the clause was thrown out by the Commons for which we
adored them as our friends and friends of liberty till by their
conduct towards us in 1765 it seemd that they had refusd that point
of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for
themselves

    118 George Granville or Grenville 17121770 As
    English premier from 1763 to 1765 he introduced the
    direct taxation of the American Colonies and has
    sometimes been called the immediate cause of the
    Revolution

    119 This whole passage shows how hopelessly divergent
    were the English and American views on the relations
    between the mother country and her colonies Grenville
    here made clear that the Americans were to have no voice
    in making or amending their laws Parliament and the
    king were to have absolute power over the colonies No
    wonder Franklin was alarmed by this new doctrine With
    his keen insight into human nature and his consequent
    knowledge of American character he foresaw the
    inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of
    England This conversation with Grenville makes these
    last pages of the Autobiography one of its most
    important parts

After some days Dr Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries
they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr T Penns house in Spring
Garden The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of
disposition to reasonable accommodations but I suppose each party had
its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable We then went
into consideration of our several points of complaint which I
enumerated The proprietaries justifyd their conduct as well as they
could and I the Assemblys We now appeared very wide and so far
from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of
agreement However it was concluded that I should give them the heads
of our complaints in writing and they promisd then to consider them
I did so soon after but they put the paper into the hands of their
solicitor Ferdinand John Paris who managed for them all their law
business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of
Maryland Lord Baltimore which had subsisted 70 years and wrote for
them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly
He was a proud angry man and as I had occasionally in the answers of
the Assembly treated his papers with some severity they being really
weak in point of argument and haughty in expression he had conceived a
mortal enmity to me which discovering itself whenever we met I
declind the proprietarys proposal that he and I should discuss the
heads of complaint between our two selves and refusd treating with
anyone but them They then by his advice put the paper into the hands
of the Attorney and SolicitorGeneral for their opinion and counsel
upon it where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days during
which time I made frequent demands of an answer from the
proprietaries but without obtaining any other than that they had not
yet received the opinion of the Attorney and SolicitorGeneral What
it was when they did receive it I never learnt for they did not
communicate it to me but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn
and signed by Paris reciting my paper complaining of its want of
formality as a rudeness on my part and giving a flimsy justification
of their conduct adding that they should be willing to accommodate
matters if the Assembly would send out some person of candour to
treat with them for that purpose intimating thereby that I was not
such

Illustration We now appeared very wide and so far from each other
in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement

The want of formality or rudeness was probably my not having
addressd the paper to them with their assumd titles of True and
Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania which I
omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper the intention of
which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing what in
conversation I had delivered viva voce

But during this delay the Assembly having prevailed with Govr Denny
to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the
estates of the people which was the grand point in dispute they
omitted answering the message

When this act however came over the proprietaries counselled by
Paris determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent
Accordingly they petitioned the king in Council and a hearing was
appointed in which two lawyers were employd by them against the act
and two by me in support of it They alledgd that the act was
intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the
people and that if it were sufferd to continue in force and the
proprietaries who were in odium with the people left to their mercy
in proportioning the taxes they would inevitably be ruined We
replyd that the act had no such intention and would have no such
effect That the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath
to assess fairly and equitably and that any advantage each of them
might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the
proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves
This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides except
that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must
attend a repeal for that the money £100000 being printed and given
to the kings use expended in his service and now spread among the
people the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of
many and the total discouragement of future grants and the
selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general
catastrophe merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed
too highly was insisted on in the strongest terms On this Lord
Mansfield one of the counsel rose and beckoning me took me into the
clerks chamber while the lawyers were pleading and asked me if I
was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary
estate in the execution of the act I said certainly Then says he
you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure
that point I answerd None at all He then calld in Paris and
after some discourse his lordships proposition was accepted on both
sides a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of the
Council which I signd with Mr Charles who was also an Agent of the
Province for their ordinary affairs when Lord Mansfield returned to
the Council Chamber where finally the law was allowed to pass Some
changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be
made by a subsequent law but the Assembly did not think them
necessary for one years tax having been levied by the act before the
order of Council arrived they appointed a committee to examine the
proceedings of the assessors and on this committee they put several
particular friends of the proprietaries After a full enquiry they
unanimously signd a report that they found the tax had been assessd
with perfect equity

The Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the
engagement as an essential service to the Province since it secured
the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country They
gave me their thanks in form when I returnd But the proprietaries
were enraged at Governor Denny for having passd the act and turnd
him out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he
had given bond to observe He however having done it at the instance
of the General and for His Majestys service and having some
powerful interest at court despisd the threats and they were never
put in execution unfinished

ELECTRICAL KITE


To Peter Collinson

Philadelphia Oct 19 1752

Sir

As frequent mention is made in public papers from Europe of the
success of the Philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire
from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high
buildings c it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed
that the same experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia though made
in a different and more easy manner which is as follows

Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar the arms so long as
to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when
extended tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of
the cross so you have the body of a kite which being properly
accommodated with a tail loop and string will rise in the air like
those made of paper but this being of silk is fitter to bear the wet
and wind of a thundergust without tearing To the top of the upright
stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharppointed wire rising a
foot or more above the wood To the end of the twine next the hand
is to be tied a silk ribbon and where the silk and twine join a key
may be fastened This kite is to be raised when a thundergust appears
to be coming on and the person who holds the string must stand within
a door or window or under some cover so that the silk ribbon may not
be wet and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame
of the door or window As soon as any of the thunder clouds come over
the kite the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them and
the kite with all the twine will be electrified and the loose
filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an
approaching finger And when the rain has wet the kite and twine so
that it can conduct the electric fire freely you will find it stream
out plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle At this
key the phial may be charged and from electric fire thus obtained
spirits may be kindled and all the electric experiments be performed
which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube
and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning
completely demonstrated

THE WAY TO WEALTH

From Father Abrahams Speech forming
the preface to Poor Richards Almanac for 1758

It would be thought a hard Government that should tax its People
onetenth Part of their Time to be employed in its Service But
Idleness taxes many of us much more if we reckon all that is spent
in absolute Sloth or doing of nothing with that which is spent in
idle Employments or Amusements that amount to nothing Sloth by
bringing on Diseases absolutely shortens Life Sloth like Rust
consumes faster than Labor wears while the used key is always bright
as Poor Richard says But dost thou love Life then do not squander
Time for thats the stuff Life is made of as Poor Richard says How
much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep forgetting that The
sleeping Fox catches no Poultry and that There will be sleeping
enough in the Grave as Poor Richard says

If Time be of all Things the most precious wasting Time must be as
Poor Richard says the greatest Prodigality since as he
elsewhere tells us Lost Time is never found again and what we call
Time enough always proves little enough Let us then up and be
doing and doing to the Purpose so by Diligence shall we do more with
less Perplexity Sloth makes all Things difficult but Industry all
easy as Poor Richard says and He that riseth late must trot all
Day and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night while Laziness
travels so slowly that Poverty soon overtakes him as we read in
Poor Richard who adds Drive thy Business let not that drive
thee and Early to Bed and early to rise makes a Man healthy
wealthy and wise

Industry need not wish and he that lives upon Hope will die
fasting

There are no Gains without Pains

He that hath a Trade hath an Estate and he that hath a Calling hath
an Office of Profit and Honor but then the Trade must be worked
at and the Calling well followed or neither the Estate nor the
Office will enable us to pay our Taxes

What though you have found no Treasure nor has any rich Relation left
you a Legacy Diligence is the Mother of Goodluck as Poor
Richard says and God gives all Things to Industry

One Today is worth two Tomorrows and farther Have you somewhat
to do Tomorrow do it Today

If you were a Servant would you not be ashamed that a good Master
should catch you idle Are you then your own Master be ashamed to
catch yourself idle

Stick to it steadily and you will see great Effects for Constant
Dropping wears away Stones and by Diligence and Patience the Mouse
ate in two the Cable and Little Strokes fell great Oaks

Methinks I hear some of you say Must a Man afford himself no
Leisure I will tell thee my friend what Poor Richard says
Employ thy Time well if thou meanest to gain Leisure and since
thou art not sure of a Minute throw not away an Hour Leisure is
Time for doing something useful this Leisure the diligent Man will
obtain but the lazy Man never so that as Poor Richard says A
Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things

Keep thy Shop and thy Shop will keep thee and again If you would
have your business done go if not send

If you would have a faithful Servant and one that you like serve
yourself

A little Neglect may breed great Mischief adding for want of a
Nail the Shoe was lost for want of a Shoe the Horse was lost and for
want of a Horse the Rider was lost being overtaken and slain by the
Enemy all for the want of Care about a Horseshoe Nail

So much for Industry my Friends and Attention to ones own Business
but to these we must add Frugality

What maintains one Vice would bring up two Children You may think
perhaps that a little Tea or a little Punch now and then Diet a
little more costly Clothes a little finer and a little
Entertainment now and then can be no great Matter but remember
what Poor Richard says Many a Little makes a Mickle

Beware of little expenses A small Leak will sink a great Ship and
again Who Dainties love shall Beggars prove and moreover Fools
make Feasts and wise Men eat them

Buy what thou hast no Need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy
Necessaries

If you would know the Value of Money go and try to borrow some for
he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing

The second Vice is Lying the first is running in Debt

Lying rides upon Debts Back

Poverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue Tis hard for
an empty Bag to stand upright

And now to conclude Experience keeps a dear School but Fools will
learn in no other and scarce in that for it is true we may give
Advice but we cannot give Conduct as Poor Richard says However
remember this They that wont be counseled cant be helped as
Poor Richard says and farther That if you will not hear Reason
shell surely rap your Knuckles




THE WHISTLE


To Madame Brillon

Passy November 10 1779

I am charmed with your description of Paradise and with your plan of
living there and I approve much of your conclusion that in the
meantime we should draw all the good we can from this world In my
opinion we might all draw more good from it than we do and suffer
less evil if we would take care not to give too much for whistles
For to me it seems that most of the unhappy people we meet with are
become so by neglect of that caution

You ask what I mean You love stories and will excuse my telling one
of myself

When I was a child of seven year old my friends on a holiday filled
my pocket with coppers I went directly to a shop where they sold toys
for children and being charmed with the sound of a whistle that I
met by the way in the hands of another boy I voluntarily offered and
gave all my money for one I then came home and went whistling all
over the house much pleased with my whistle but disturbing all the
family My brothers and sisters and cousins understanding the
bargain I had made told me I had given four times as much for it as
it was worth put me in mind what good things I might have bought with
the rest of the money and laughed at me so much for my folly that I
cried with vexation and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the
whistle gave me pleasure

This however was afterwards of use to me the impression continuing
on my mind so that often when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary
thing I said to myself Dont give too much for the whistle and I
saved my money

As I grew up came into the world and observed the actions of men I
thought I met with many very many who gave too much for the
whistle

When I saw one too ambitious of court favor sacrificing his time in
attendance on levees his repose his liberty his virtue and perhaps
his friends to attain it I have said to myself This man gives too
much for his whistle

When I saw another fond of popularity constantly employing himself in
political bustles neglecting his own affairs and ruining them by
neglect He pays indeed said I too much for his whistle

If I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living all
the pleasure of doing good to others all the esteem of his fellow
citizens and the joys of benevolent friendship for the sake of
accumulating wealth Poor man said I you pay too much for your
whistle

When I met with a man of pleasure sacrificing every laudable
improvement of the mind or of his fortune to mere corporeal
sensations and ruining his health in their pursuit Mistaken man
said I you are providing pain for yourself instead of pleasure you
give too much for your whistle

If I see one fond of appearance or fine clothes fine houses fine
furniture fine equipages all above his fortune for which he
contracts debts and ends his career in a prison Alas say I he
has paid dear very dear for his whistle

When I see a beautiful sweettempered girl married to an illnatured
brute of a husband What a pity say I that she should pay so much
for a whistle

In short I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are
brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value
of things and by their giving too much for their whistles

Yet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people when I consider
that with all this wisdom of which I am boasting there are certain
things in the world so tempting for example the apples of King John
which happily are not to be bought for if they were put to sale by
auction I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase
and find that I had once more given too much for the whistle

Adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours very sincerely and
with unalterable affection

A LETTER TO SAMUEL MATHER

Passy May 12 1784

Revd Sir

It is now more than 60 years since I left Boston but I remember well
both your father and grandfather having heard them both in the
pulpit and seen them in their houses The last time I saw your father
was in the beginning of 1724 when I visited him after my first trip
to Pennsylvania He received me in his library and on my taking leave
showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage
which was crossed by a beam overhead We were still talking as I
withdrew he accompanying me behind and I turning partly towards him
when he said hastily Stoop stoop I did not understand him till
I felt my head hit against the beam He was a man that never missed
any occasion of giving instruction and upon this he said to me You
are young and have the world before you stoop as you go through it
and you will miss many hard thumps This advice thus beat into my
head has frequently been of use to me and I often think of it when
I see pride mortified and misfortunes brought upon people by their
carrying their heads too high

THE

Pennsylvania GAZETTE
Containing the freshest Advices Foreign and Domestick

From Thursday September 25 to Thursday October 2 1729

The Pennsylvania Gazette being now to
be carryd on by other Hands the Reader
may expect some Account of the Method we
design to proceed in

Upon a View of Chamberss great Dictionaries
from whence were taken the Materials of the
Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences
which usually made the First Part of this Paper
we find that besides their containing many Things
abstruse or insignificant to us it will probably
be fifty Years before the Whole can be gone thro
in this Manner of Publication There are likewise
in those Books continual References from
Things under one Letter of the Alphabet to those
under another which relate to the same Subject
and are necessary to explain and compleat it
those are taken in their Turn may perhaps be Ten
Years distant and since it is likely that they who
desire to acquaint themselves with any particular
Art or Science would gladly have the whole before
them in a much less Time we believe our
Readers will not think such a Method of communicating
Knowledge to be a proper One

However tho we do not intend to continue the
Publication of those Dictionaries in a regular
Alphabetical Method as has hitherto been done
yet as several Things exhibited from them in the
Course of these Papers have been entertaining
to such of the Curious who never had and cannot
have the Advantage of good Libraries and
as there are many Things still behind which being
in this Manner made generally known may
perhaps become of considerable Use by giving such
Hints to the excellent natural Geniuss of our
Country as may contribute either to the Improvement
of our present Manufactures or towards
the Invention of new Ones we propose
from Time to Time to communicate such particular
Parts as appear to be of the most general
Consequence

As to the Religious Courtship Part of
which has been retald to the Publick in these
Papers the Reader may be informd that the
whole Book will probably in a little Time be
printed and bound up by itself and those who
approve of it will doubtless be better pleasd to
have it entire than in this broken interrupted
Manner

There are many who have long desired to see a
good NewsPaper in Pennsylvania and we hope
those Gentlemen who are able will contribute towards
the making This such We ask Assistance
because we are fully sensible that to publish a
good NewPaper is not so easy an Undertaking
as many People imagine it to be The Author of
a Gazette in the Opinion of the Learned ought
to be qualified with an extensive Acquaintance
with Languages a great Easiness and Command
of Writing and Relating Things cleanly and intelligibly
and in few Words he should be able
to speak of War both by Land and Sea be well
acquainted with Geography with the History of
the Time with the several Interests of Princes
and States the Secrets of Courts and the Manners
and Customs of all Nations Men thus accomplishd
are very rare in this remote Part of
the World and it would be well if the Writer
of these Papers could make up among his Friends
what is wanting in himself

Upon the Whole we may assure the Publick
that as far as the Encouragement we meet with
will enable us no Care and Pains shall be omitted
that may make the Pennsylvania Gazette
as agreeable and useful an Entertainment as the
Nature of the Thing will allow

The Following is the last Message sent by
his Excellency Governor Burnet to the
House of Representatives in Boston

Gentlemen of the House of Representatives

It is not with so vain a Hope as to convince you that
I take the Trouble to answer your Messages but if
possible to open the Eyes of the deluded People whom
you represent and whom you are at so much Pains to keep
in Ignorance of the true State of their Affairs I need not
go further for an undeniable Proof of this Endeavour to
blind them than your ordering the Letter of Messieurs
Wilks and Belcher of the 7th of June last to your Speaker to
be published This Letter is said in Page 1 of your
Votes to inclose a Copy of the Report of the Lords of the Committee
of His Majestys Privy Council with his Majestys Approbation
and Orders thereon in Council Yet these Gentlemen
had at the same time the unparallelld Presumption to
write to the Speaker in this Manner Youll observe by the
Conclusion what is proposed to be the Consequence of your not complying
with his Majestys Instruction the whole Matter to be
laid

FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Ispahan March 6 The Conspiracy formd by the
Grand Vizir last January was Twelvemonth with design
to make himself King of Persia was seasonably
discoverd and himself and Accomplices secured since
which the State hath enjoyd its former Tranquility
and a new Vizir is appointed in his room The old
ones Eyes being both put out he is kept alive but
in Prison to make him discover all his Riches
which must be immensely great since they found in
one of his Chests four hundred thousand Persian Ducats
beside Foreign Coin and in another Place abundance
of Jewels Gold and Silver and so in proportion
among several of his Accomplices by the help of
which Treasure they hoped to compass their Ends

Tripoli July 12 As soon as our Squadron fitted out
against the Famous Baffaw Gianur Cogia appeard off
Dasna and Bengan with two thousand five hundred
Moorish Horse and a thousand Foot and skirmishd
a little with his Squadron he abandond both those
Places and fled to the Island of Serby in the Territories
of Tunis But the Bey of that Place having denyd
him Shelter he saild farther away in a French
Barque we know not whether and his own Galleys
and Barques are gone after him so that we are now
entirely rid of that troublesome Guest Our Rovers
keep all in Port for Fear of the Malteze

Cadiz Aug 12 The Flota is expected Home from
the WestIndies before the End of this Month
Thirteen Pieces of Cannon and two Mortars were lately
sent from hence to Ceuta The three Spanish Men
of War of 50 to 60 Guns each which carried the Spanish
Cardinals to Italy are now at Alicant It is said
they are to join the Dutch ViceAdmiral who is now
in this Bay with four Ships of his Squadron of 50
Guns each and cruize against the Algerines Wheat
and Barley being very cheap in these Parts great
Quantities have been sent lately to the Canaries
where for some Time past the Inhabitants have been
in great Want of Corn On the 9th Instant died Mr
Charles His Britannick Majestys Consul at St
Lucas

Berne Aug 20 The Deputies of this Canton who
went to the Diet at Frawenfeldt are now assembled
at Baden with those of Zurich and Glaris to regulate
certain Affairs relating to the Town and County of
Baden which formerly belonged to the Eight Eldest
Cantons but in the last Swiss War was given up to
Zurich and Berne in Propriety with a Reservation to
the Canton of Glaris which is mostly Protestant of
the Share it had before in the Sovereignty of that
District The three Deputies of Zurich Lucern c
Ury who were commissioned by the late General Dyet
to go to Wilchingen to try to compose the Differences
which have been long standing between the Inhabitants
of that Place and the Canton of Schafhuysen
whose Subjects they are have offered those Inhabitonts
a full Pardon for all past Misbehavior and
the Maintenance of their Privileges for the future
provided they forthwith return to their Duty but
it is advised that those of Wilchingen persist hitherto
in this Disobedience

Schaffhausen Sept 1 They write from Italy that
the Plague is no longer observd at Marseilles Aix 
several other Places and that at Toulon it is very
much decreasd But alas how should it be otherwise
when the Distemper hath hardly any Objects
left to work upon At Arles it is likewise abated
we fear for the same Reason Mean while it spreads
in the Gevaudan and two large Villages in the
Neighbourhood of Frejus were attackd the beginning
of this Month The French Court hath prohibited
all communication with the Gevaudan upon severe
Penalties The Plague is certainly got into the
small Town of  Marvegue in that District which
Town is shut in by eight hundred Men Letters from
Geneva say the two Battalions employd in surrounding
La Canourgue are infected and that Maages is
very much suspected The Marquis de Quelus had
retired to a Castle near Avignon but the Sickness
being got among his Domesticks he was fled farther
away

Paris Sept 5 The District over which the Duke
of Berwick is to have the Command extends to the
Borders of the Bourbonnois and the Court puts a
great Confidence in the Care of that General to hinder
the Infection from spreading The Marquis de
Verceil is actually drawing Lines to shut in the Gevaudan
and twelve Regiments of Foot and as many
of Dragoons are marching to reinforce the Troops
already posted on that side The Plague seems to
have almost spent itself in Provence Tho it is yet
a great way off of us Men talk nevertheless of laying
up Magazines of all sort of Provisions here and of making
twenty thousand Beds to be set up in the Hospitals
and TennisCourts

Hague Sept 9 The Deputies of our Admiralties
had last Saturday an extraordinary Conference with
those of the States General upon the spreading of a
Report that ten or twelve Persons died daily at a certain
Place in Normandy which was therefore suspected
to have received the Contagion But upon the
matter it doth not appear there was the least Foundation
for such a Report tho it is too plain the
Distemper gains ground space in the Southern Parts
of France

We can by no means penetrate into the Designs of
the Czar who notwithstanding tis confidently
written that the Peace between him and Sweden is as
good as concluded hath a Fleet of thirty Men of War
and two hundred Galleys at Sea near Aland However
an Express gone by from Stockholm doth not
confirm
