CANTO I

His glory by whose might all things are movd
Pierces the universe and in one part
Sheds more resplendence elsewhere less  In heavn
That largeliest of his light partakes was I
Witness of things which to relate again
Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence
For that so near approaching its desire
Our intellect is to such depth absorbd
That memory cannot follow  Nathless all
That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm
Could store shall now be matter of my song

Benign Apollo this last labour aid
And make me such a vessel of thy worth
As thy own laurel claims of me belovd
Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus brows
Sufficd me henceforth there is need of both
For my remaining enterprise Do thou
Enter into my bosom and there breathe
So as when Marsyas by thy hand was draggd
Forth from his limbs unsheathd  O power divine
If thou to me of shine impart so much
That of that happy realm the shadowd form
Tracd in my thoughts I may set forth to view
Thou shalt behold me of thy favourd tree
Come to the foot and crown myself with leaves
For to that honour thou and my high theme
Will fit me  If but seldom mighty Sire
To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath
Caesar or bard more shame for human wills
Depravd joy to the Delphic god must spring
From the Pierian foliage when one breast
Is with such thirst inspird  From a small spark
Great flame hath risen after me perchance
Others with better voice may pray and gain
From the Cirrhaean city answer kind

Through diver passages the worlds bright lamp
Rises to mortals but through that which joins
Four circles with the threefold cross in best
Course and in happiest constellation set
He comes and to the worldly wax best gives
Its temper and impression  Morning there
Here eve was by almost such passage made
And whiteness had oerspread that hemisphere
Blackness the other part when to the left
I saw Beatrice turnd and on the sun
Gazing as never eagle fixd his ken
As from the first a second beam is wont
To issue and reflected upwards rise
Een as a pilgrim bent on his return
So of her act that through the eyesight passd
Into my fancy mine was formd and straight
Beyond our mortal wont I fixd mine eyes
Upon the sun  Much is allowed us there
That here exceeds our powr thanks to the place
Made for the dwelling of the human kind

I sufferd it not long and yet so long
That I beheld it bickring sparks around
As iron that comes boiling from the fire
And suddenly upon the day appeard
A day newrisn as he who hath the power
Had with another sun bedeckd the sky

Her eyes fast fixd on the eternal wheels
Beatrice stood unmovd and I with ken
Fixd upon her from upward gaze removd
At her aspect such inwardly became
As Glaucus when he tasted of the herb
That made him peer among the ocean gods
Words may not tell of that transhuman change
And therefore let the example serve though weak
For those whom grace hath better proof in store

If I were only what thou didst create
Then newly Love by whom the heavn is ruld
Thou knowst who by thy light didst bear me up
Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide
Desired Spirit with its harmony
Temperd of thee and measurd charmd mine ear
Then seemd to me so much of heavn to blaze
With the suns flame that rain or flood neer made
A lake so broad  The newness of the sound
And that great light inflamd me with desire
Keener than eer was felt to know their cause

Whence she who saw me clearly as myself
To calm my troubled mind before I askd
Opend her lips and gracious thus began
With false imagination thou thyself
Makst dull so that thou seest not the thing
Which thou hadst seen had that been shaken off
Thou art not on the earth as thou believst
For lightning scapd from its own proper place
Neer ran as thou hast hither now returnd

Although divested of my firstraisd doubt
By those brief words accompanied with smiles
Yet in new doubt was I entangled more
And said Already satisfied I rest
From admiration deep but now admire
How I above those lighter bodies rise

Whence after uttrance of a piteous sigh
She towrds me bent her eyes with such a look
As on her frenzied child a mother casts
Then thus began Among themselves all things
Have order and from hence the form which makes
The universe resemble God  In this
The higher creatures see the printed steps
Of that eternal worth which is the end
Whither the line is drawn  All natures lean
In this their order diversely some more
Some less approaching to their primal source
Thus they to different havens are movd on
Through the vast sea of being and each one
With instinct givn that bears it in its course
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire
This prompts the hearts of mortal animals
This the brute earth together knits and binds
Nor only creatures void of intellect
Are aimd at by this bow but even those
That have intelligence and love are piercd
That Providence who so well orders all
With her own light makes ever calm the heaven
In which the substance that hath greatest speed
Is turnd and thither now as to our seat
Predestind we are carried by the force
Of that strong cord that never looses dart
But at fair aim and glad  Yet is it true
That as ofttimes but ill accords the form
To the design of art through sluggishness
Of unreplying matter so this course
Is sometimes quitted by the creature who
Hath power directed thus to bend elsewhere
As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall
From its original impulse warpd to earth
By vicious fondness  Thou no more admire
Thy soaring if I rightly deem than lapse
Of torrent downwards from a mountains height
There would in thee for wonder be more cause
If free of hindrance thou hadst fixd thyself
Below like fire unmoving on the earth

So said she turnd toward the heavn her face




CANTO II

All ye who in small bark have following saild
Eager to listen on the adventrous track
Of my proud keel that singing cuts its way
Backward return with speed and your own shores
Revisit nor put out to open sea
Where losing me perchance ye may remain
Bewilderd in deep maze  The way I pass
Neer yet was run Minerva breathes the gale
Apollo guides me and another Nine
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal
Ye other few who have outstretchd the neck
Timely for food of angels on which here
They live yet never know satiety
Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out
Your vessel marking well the furrow broad
Before you in the wave that on both sides
Equal returns  Those glorious who passd oer
To Colchos wonderd not as ye will do
When they saw Jason following the plough

The increate perpetual thirst that draws
Toward the realm of Gods own form bore us
Swift almost as the heaven ye behold

Beatrice upward gazd and I on her
And in such space as on the notch a dart
Is placd then loosend flies I saw myself
Arrivd where wondrous thing engagd my sight
Whence she to whom no work of mine was hid
Turning to me with aspect glad as fair
Bespake me Gratefully direct thy mind
To God through whom to this first star we come

Me seemd as if a cloud had coverd us
Translucent solid firm and polishd bright
Like adamant which the suns beam had smit
Within itself the everduring pearl
Receivd us as the wave a ray of light
Receives and rests unbroken  If I then
Was of corporeal frame and it transcend
Our weaker thought how one dimension thus
Another could endure which needs must be
If body enter body how much more
Must the desire inflame us to behold
That essence which discovers by what means
God and our nature joind  There will be seen
That which we hold through faith not shown by proof
But in itself intelligibly plain
Een as the truth that man at first believes

I answered Lady I with thoughts devout
Such as I best can frame give thanks to Him
Who hath removd me from the mortal world
But tell I pray thee whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint

She somewhat smild then spake If mortals err
In their opinion when the key of sense
Unlocks not surely wonders weapon keen
Ought not to pierce thee since thou findst the wings
Of reason to pursue the senses flight
Are short  But what thy own thought is declare

Then I What various here above appears
Is causd I deem by bodies dense or rare

She then resumd Thou certainly wilt see
In falsehood thy belief oerwhelmd if well
Thou listen to the arguments which I
Shall bring to face it  The eighth sphere displays
Numberless lights the which in kind and size
May be remarkd of different aspects
If rare or dense of that were cause alone
One single virtue then would be in all
Alike distributed or more or less
Different virtues needs must be the fruits
Of formal principles and these save one
Will by thy reasoning be destroyd  Beside
If rarity were of that dusk the cause
Which thou inquirest either in some part
That planet must throughout be void nor fed
With its own matter or as bodies share
Their fat and leanness in like manner this
Must in its volume change the leaves  The first
If it were true had through the suns eclipse
Been manifested by transparency
Of light as through aught rare beside effusd
But this is not  Therefore remains to see
The other cause and if the other fall
Erroneous so must prove what seemd to thee
If not from side to side this rarity
Pass through there needs must be a limit whence
Its contrary no further lets it pass
And hence the beam that from without proceeds
Must be pourd back as colour comes through glass
Reflected which behind it lead conceals
Now wilt thou say that there of murkier hue
Than in the other part the ray is shown
By being thence refracted farther back
From this perplexity will free thee soon
Experience if thereof thou trial make
The fountain whence your arts derive their streame
Three mirrors shalt thou take and two remove
From thee alike and more remote the third
Betwixt the former pair shall meet thine eyes
Then turnd toward them cause behind thy back
A light to stand that on the three shall shine
And thus reflected come to thee from all
Though that beheld most distant do not stretch
A space so ample yet in brightness thou
Will own it equaling the rest  But now
As under snow the ground if the warm ray
Smites it remains dismantled of the hue
And cold that coverd it before so thee
Dismantled in thy mind I will inform
With light so lively that the tremulous beam
Shall quiver where it falls  Within the heaven
Where peace divine inhabits circles round
A body in whose virtue dies the being
Of all that it contains  The following heaven
That hath so many lights this being divides
Through  different essences from it distinct
And yet containd within it  The other orbs
Their separate distinctions variously
Dispose for their own seed and produce apt
Thus do these organs of the world proceed
As thou beholdest now from step to step
Their influences from above deriving
And thence transmitting downwards  Mark me well
How through this passage to the truth I ford
The truth thou lovst that thou henceforth alone
Mayst know to keep the shallows safe untold

The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs
As mallet by the workmans hand must needs
By blessed movers be inspird  This heaven
Made beauteous by so many luminaries
From the deep spirit that moves its circling sphere
Its image takes an impress as a seal
And as the soul that dwells within your dust
Through members different yet together formd
In different powrs resolves itself een so
The intellectual efficacy unfolds
Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars
On its own unity revolving still
Different virtue compact different
Makes with the precious body it enlivens
With which it knits as life in you is knit
From its original nature full of joy
The virtue mingled through the body shines
As joy through pupil of the living eye
From hence proceeds that which from light to light
Seems different and not from dense or rare
This is the formal cause that generates
Proportiond to its power the dusk or clear




CANTO III

That sun which erst with love my bosom warmd
Had of fair truth unveild the sweet aspect
By proof of right and of the false reproof
And I to own myself convincd and free
Of doubt as much as needed raisd my head
Erect for speech  But soon a sight appeard
Which so intent to mark it held me fixd
That of confession I no longer thought

As through translucent and smooth glass or wave
Clear and unmovd and flowing not so deep
As that its bed is dark the shape returns
So faint of our impicturd lineaments
That on white forehead set a pearl as strong
Comes to the eye such saw I many a face
All stretchd to speak from whence I straight conceivd
Delusion opposite to that which raisd
Between the man and fountain amorous flame

Sudden as I perceivd them deeming these
Reflected semblances to see of whom
They were I turnd mine eyes and nothing saw
Then turnd them back directed on the light
Of my sweet guide who smiling shot forth beams
From her celestial eyes  Wonder not thou
She cryd at this my smiling when I see
Thy childish judgment since not yet on truth
It rests the foot but as it still is wont
Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy
True substances are these which thou beholdst
Hither through failure of their vow exild
But speak thou with them listen and believe
That the true light which fills them with desire
Permits not from its beams their feet to stray

Straight to the shadow which for converse seemd
Most earnest I addressed me and began
As one by overeagerness perplexd
O spirit born for joy who in the rays
Of life eternal of that sweetness knowst
The flavour which not tasted passes far
All apprehension me it well would please
If thou wouldst tell me of thy name and this
Your station here Whence she with kindness prompt
And eyes glistning with smiles Our charity
To any wish by justice introducd
Bars not the door no more than she above
Who would have all her court be like herself
I was a virgin sister in the earth
And if thy mind observe me well this form
With such addition gracd of loveliness
Will not conceal me long but thou wilt know
Piccarda in the tardiest sphere thus placd
Here mid these other blessed also blest
Our hearts whose high affections burn alone
With pleasure from the Holy Spirit conceivd
Admitted to his order dwell in joy
And this condition which appears so low
Is for this cause assignd us that our vows
Were in some part neglected and made void

Whence I to her replied Something divine
Beams in your countenance wondrous fair
From former knowledge quite transmuting you
Therefore to recollect was I so slow
But what thou sayst hath to my memory
Given now such aid that to retrace your forms
Is easier  Yet inform me ye who here
Are happy long ye for a higher place
More to behold and more in love to dwell

She with those other spirits gently smild
Then answerd with such gladness that she seemd
With loves first flame to glow Brother our will
Is in composure settled by the power
Of charity who makes us will alone
What we possess and nought beyond desire
If we should wish to be exalted more
Then must our wishes jar with the high will
Of him who sets us here which in these orbs
Thou wilt confess not possible if here
To be in charity must needs befall
And if her nature well thou contemplate
Rather it is inherent in this state
Of blessedness to keep ourselves within
The divine will by which our wills with his
Are one  So that as we from step to step
Are placd throughout this kingdom pleases all
Een as our King who in us plants his will
And in his will is our tranquillity
It is the mighty ocean whither tends
Whatever it creates and nature makes

Then saw I clearly how each spot in heavn
Is Paradise though with like gracious dew
The supreme virtue showr not over all

But as it chances if one sort of food
Hath satiated and of another still
The appetite remains that this is askd
And thanks for that returnd een so did I
In word and motion bent from her to learn
What web it was through which she had not drawn
The shuttle to its point  She thus began
Exalted worth and perfectness of life
The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven
By whose pure laws upon your nether earth
The robe and veil they wear to that intent
That een till death they may keep watch or sleep
With their great bridegroom who accepts each vow
Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms
from the world to follow her when young
Escapd and in her vesture mantling me
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins
Thereafter men for ill than good more apt
Forth snatchd me from the pleasant cloisters pale
God knows how after that my life was framd
This other splendid shape which thou beholdst
At my right side burning with all the light
Of this our orb what of myself I tell
May to herself apply  From her like me
A sister with like violence were torn
The saintly folds that shaded her fair brows
Een when she to the world again was brought
In spite of her own will and better wont
Yet not for that the bosoms inward veil
Did she renounce  This is the luminary
Of mighty Constance who from that loud blast
Which blew the second over Suabias realm
That power producd which was the third and last

She ceasd from further talk and then began
Ave Maria singing and with that song
Vanishd as heavy substance through deep wave

Mine eye that far as it was capable
Pursued her when in dimness she was lost
Turnd to the mark where greater want impelld
And bent on Beatrice all its gaze
But she as lightning beamd upon my looks
So that the sight sustaind it not at first
Whence I to question her became less prompt




CANTO IV

Between two kinds of food both equally
Remote and tempting first a man might die
Of hunger ere he one could freely choose
Een so would stand a lamb between the maw
Of two fierce wolves in dread of both alike
Een so between two deer a dog would stand
Wherefore if I was silent fault nor praise
I to myself impute by equal doubts
Held in suspense since of necessity
It happend  Silent was I yet desire
Was painted in my looks and thus I spake
My wish more earnestly than language could

As Daniel when the haughty king he freed
From ire that spurrd him on to deeds unjust
And violent so lookd Beatrice then

Well I discern she thus her words addressd
How contrary desires each way constrain thee
So that thy anxious thought is in itself
Bound up and stifled nor breathes freely forth
Thou arguest if the good intent remain
What reason that anothers violence
Should stint the measure of my fair desert

Cause too thou findst for doubt in that it seems
That spirits to the stars as Plato deemd
Return  These are the questions which thy will
Urge equally and therefore I the first
Of that will treat which hath the more of gall
Of seraphim he who is most enskyd
Moses and Samuel and either John
Choose which thou wilt nor even Marys self
Have not in any other heavn their seats
Than have those spirits which so late thou sawst
Nor more or fewer years exist but all
Make the first circle beauteous diversely
Partaking of sweet life as more or less
Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them
Here were they shown thee not that fate assigns
This for their sphere but for a sign to thee
Of that celestial furthest from the height
Thus needs that ye may apprehend we speak
Since from things sensible alone ye learn
That which digested rightly after turns
To intellectual  For no other cause
The scripture condescending graciously
To your perception hands and feet to God
Attributes nor so means and holy church
Doth represent with human countenance
Gabriel and Michael and him who made
Tobias whole  Unlike what here thou seest
The judgment of Timaeus who affirms
Each soul restord to its particular star
Believing it to have been taken thence
When nature gave it to inform her mold
Since to appearance his intention is
Een what his words declare or else to shun
Derision haply thus he hath disguisd
His true opinion  If his meaning be
That to the influencing of these orbs revert
The honour and the blame in human acts
Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth
This principle not understood aright
Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world
So that it fell to fabled names of Jove
And Mercury and Mars  That other doubt
Which moves thee is less harmful for it brings
No peril of removing thee from me

That to the eye of man our justice seems
Unjust is argument for faith and not
For heretic declension  To the end
This truth may stand more clearly in your view
I will content thee even to thy wish

If violence be when that which suffers nought
Consents to that which forceth not for this
These spirits stood exculpate  For the will
That will not still survives unquenchd and doth
As nature doth in fire tho violence
Wrest it a thousand times for if it yield
Or more or less so far it follows force
And thus did these whom they had power to seek
The hallowd place again  In them had will
Been perfect such as once upon the bars
Held Laurence firm or wrought in Scaevola
To his own hand remorseless to the path
Whence they were drawn their steps had hastend back
When liberty returnd but in too few
Resolve so steadfast dwells  And by these words
If duly weighd that argument is void
Which oft might have perplexd thee still  But now
Another question thwarts thee which to solve
Might try thy patience without better aid
I have no doubt instilld into thy mind
That blessed spirit may not lie since near
The source of primal truth it dwells for aye
And thou mightst after of Piccarda learn
That Constance held affection to the veil
So that she seems to contradict me here
Not seldom brother it hath chancd for men
To do what they had gladly left undone
Yet to shun peril they have done amiss
Een as Alcmaeon at his fathers suit
Slew his own mother so made pitiless
Not to lose pity  On this point bethink thee
That force and will are blended in such wise
As not to make the offence excusable
Absolute will agrees not to the wrong
That inasmuch as there is fear of woe
From noncompliance it agrees  Of will
Thus absolute Piccarda spake and I
Of th other so that both have truly said

Such was the flow of that pure rill that welld
From forth the fountain of all truth and such
The rest that to my wondring thoughts I found

O thou of primal love the prime delight
Goddess  I straight replyd whose lively words
Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul
Affection fails me to requite thy grace
With equal sum of gratitude be his
To recompense who sees and can reward thee
Well I discern that by that truth alone
Enlightend beyond which no truth may roam
Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know
Therein she resteth een as in his lair
The wild beast soon as she hath reachd that bound
And she hath power to reach it else desire
Were given to no end  And thence doth doubt
Spring like a shoot around the stock of truth
And it is nature which from height to height
On to the summit prompts us  This invites
This doth assure me lady revrently
To ask thee of other truth that yet
Is dark to me  I fain would know if man
By other works well done may so supply
The failure of his vows that in your scale
They lack not weight  I spake and on me straight
Beatrice lookd with eyes that shot forth sparks
Of love celestial in such copious stream
That virtue sinking in me overpowerd
I turnd and downward bent confusd my sight




CANTO V

If beyond earthly wont the flame of love
Illume me so that I oercome thy power
Of vision marvel not but learn the cause
In that perfection of the sight which soon
As apprehending hasteneth on to reach
The good it apprehends  I well discern
How in thine intellect already shines
The light eternal which to view alone
Neer fails to kindle love and if aught else
Your love seduces t is but that it shows
Some illmarkd vestige of that primal beam

This wouldst thou know if failure of the vow
By other service may be so supplied
As from selfquestion to assure the soul

Thus she her words not heedless of my wish
Began and thus as one who breaks not off
Discourse continued in her saintly strain
Supreme of gifts which God creating gave
Of his free bounty sign most evident
Of goodness and in his account most prizd
Was liberty of will the boon wherewith
All intellectual creatures and them sole
He hath endowd  Hence now thou mayst infer
Of what high worth the vow which so is framd
That when man offers God wellpleasd accepts
For in the compact between God and him
This treasure such as I describe it to thee
He makes the victim and of his own act
What compensation therefore may he find
If that whereof thou hast oblation made
By using well thou thinkst to consecrate
Thou wouldst of theft do charitable deed
Thus I resolve thee of the greater point

But forasmuch as holy church herein
Dispensing seems to contradict the truth
I have discoverd to thee yet behooves
Thou rest a little longer at the board
Ere the crude aliment which thou hast taken
Digested fitly to nutrition turn
Open thy mind to what I now unfold
And give it inward keeping  Knowledge comes
Of learning well retaind unfruitful else

This sacrifice in essence of two things
Consisteth one is that whereof t is made
The covenant the other  For the last
It neer is cancelld if not kept and hence
I spake erewhile so strictly of its force
For this it was enjoind the Israelites
Though leave were givn them as thou knowst to change
The offering still to offer  Th other part
The matter and the substance of the vow
May well be such to that without offence
It may for other substance be exchangd
But at his own discretion none may shift
The burden on his shoulders unreleasd
By either key the yellow and the white
Nor deem of any change as less than vain
If the last bond be not within the new
Included as the quatre in the six
No satisfaction therefore can be paid
For what so precious in the balance weighs
That all in counterpoise must kick the beam
Take then no vow at random taen with faith
Preserve it yet not bent as Jephthah once
Blindly to execute a rash resolve
Whom better it had suited to exclaim
I have done ill than to redeem his pledge
By doing worse or not unlike to him
In folly that great leader of the Greeks
Whence on the alter Iphigenia mournd
Her virgin beauty and hath since made mourn
Both wise and simple even all who hear
Of so fell sacrifice  Be ye more staid
O Christians not like feather by each wind
Removable nor think to cleanse ourselves
In every water  Either testament
The old and new is yours and for your guide
The shepherd of the church let this suffice
To save you  When by evil lust enticd
Remember ye be men not senseless beasts
Nor let the Jew who dwelleth in your streets
Hold you in mockry  Be not as the lamb
That fickle wanton leaves its mothers milk
To dally with itself in idle play

Such were the words that Beatrice spake
These ended to that region where the world
Is liveliest full of fond desire she turnd

Though mainly prompt new question to propose
Her silence and changd look did keep me dumb
And as the arrow ere the cord is still
Leapeth unto its mark so on we sped
Into the second realm  There I beheld
The dame so joyous enter that the orb
Grew brighter at her smiles and if the star
Were movd to gladness what then was my cheer
Whom nature hath made apt for every change

As in a quiet and clear lake the fish
If aught approach them from without do draw
Towards it deeming it their food so drew
Full more than thousand splendours towards us
And in each one was heard Lo one arrivd
To multiply our loves and as each came
The shadow streaming forth effulgence new
Witnessd augmented joy  Here reader think
If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale
To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave
And thou shalt see what vehement desire
Possessd me as soon as these had met my view
To know their state  O born in happy hour
Thou to whom grace vouchsafes or ere thy close
Of fleshly warfare to behold the thrones
Of that eternal triumph know to us
The light communicated which through heaven
Expatiates without bound  Therefore if aught
Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid
Spare not and of our radiance take thy fill

Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me
And Beatrice next Say on and trust
As unto godsHow in the light supreme
Thou harbourst and from thence the virtue bringst
That sparkling in thine eyes denotes thy joy
I mark but who thou art am still to seek
Or wherefore worthy spirit for thy lot
This sphere assignd that oft from mortal ken
Is veild by others beams  I said and turnd
Toward the lustre that with greeting kind
Erewhile had haild me  Forthwith brighter far
Than erst it waxd and as himself the sun
Hides through excess of light when his warm gaze
Hath on the mantle of thick vapours preyd
Within its proper ray the saintly shape
Was through increase of gladness thus conceald
And shrouded so in splendour answerd me
Een as the tenour of my song declares




CANTO VI

After that Constantine the eagle turnd
Against the motions of the heavn that rolld
Consenting with its course when he of yore
Lavinias spouse was leader of the flight
A hundred years twice told and more his seat
At Europes extreme point the bird of Jove
Held near the mountains whence he issued first
There under shadow of his sacred plumes
Swaying the world till through successive hands
To mine he came devolvd  Caesar I was
And am Justinian destind by the will
Of that prime love whose influence I feel
From vain excess to clear th encumberd laws
Or ere that work engagd me I did hold
Christs nature merely human with such faith
Contented  But the blessed Agapete
Who was chief shepherd he with warning voice
To the true faith recalld me  I believd
His words and what he taught now plainly see
As thou in every contradiction seest
The true and false opposd  Soon as my feet
Were to the church reclaimd to my great task
By inspiration of Gods grace impelld
I gave me wholly and consignd mine arms
To Belisarius with whom heavens right hand
Was linkd in such conjointment t was a sign
That I should rest  To thy first question thus
I shape mine answer which were ended here
But that its tendency doth prompt perforce
To some addition that thou well mayst mark
What reason on each side they have to plead
By whom that holiest banner is withstood
Both who pretend its power and who oppose

Beginning from that hour when Pallas died
To give it rule behold the valorous deeds
Have made it worthy reverence  Not unknown
To thee how for three hundred years and more
It dwelt in Alba up to those fell lists
Where for its sake were met the rival three
Nor aught unknown to thee which it achievd
Down to the Sabines wrong to Lucrece woe
With its sevn kings conquring the nation round
Nor all it wrought by Roman worthies home
Gainst Brennus and th Epirot prince and hosts
Of single chiefs or states in league combind
Of social warfare hence Torquatus stern
And Quintius namd of his neglected locks
The Decii and the Fabii hence acquird
Their fame which I with duteous zeal embalm
By it the pride of Arab hordes was quelld
When they led on by Hannibal oerpassd
The Alpine rocks whence glide thy currents Po
Beneath its guidance in their prime of days
Scipio and Pompey triumphd and that hill
Under whose summit thou didst see the light
Rued its stern bearing  After near the hour
When heavn was minded that oer all the world
His own deep calm should brood to Caesars hand
Did Rome consign it and what then it wrought
From Var unto the Rhine saw Iseres flood
Saw Loire and Seine and every vale that fills
The torrent Rhone  What after that it wrought
When from Ravenna it came forth and leapd
The Rubicon was of so bold a flight
That tongue nor pen may follow it  Towrds Spain
It wheeld its bands then towrd Dyrrachium smote
And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge
Een the warm Nile was conscious to the pang
Its native shores Antandros and the streams
Of Simois revisited and there
Where Hector lies then ill for Ptolemy
His pennons shook again lightning thence fell
On Juba and the next upon your west
At sound of the Pompeian trump returnd

What following and in its next bearers gripe
It wrought is now by Cassius and Brutus
Barkd off in hell and by Perugias sons
And Modenas was mournd  Hence weepeth still
Sad Cleopatra who pursued by it
Took from the adder black and sudden death
With him it ran een to the Red Sea coast
With him composd the world to such a peace
That of his temple Janus barrd the door

But all the mighty standard yet had wrought
And was appointed to perform thereafter
Throughout the mortal kingdom which it swayd
Falls in appearance dwindled and obscurd
If one with steady eye and perfect thought
On the third Caesar look for to his hands
The living Justice in whose breath I move
Committed glory een into his hands
To execute the vengeance of its wrath

Hear now and wonder at what next I tell
After with Titus it was sent to wreak
Vengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin
And when the Lombard tooth with fangs impure
Did gore the bosom of the holy church
Under its wings victorious Charlemagne
Sped to her rescue  Judge then for thyself
Of those whom I erewhile accusd to thee
What they are and how grievous their offending
Who are the cause of all your ills  The one
Against the universal ensign rears
The yellow lilies and with partial aim
That to himself the other arrogates
So that t is hard to see which more offends
Be yours ye Ghibellines to veil your arts
Beneath another standard ill is this
Followd of him who severs it and justice
And let not with his Guelphs the newcrownd Charles
Assail it but those talons hold in dread
Which from a lion of more lofty port
Have rent the easing  Many a time ere now
The sons have for the sires transgression waild
Nor let him trust the fond belief that heavn
Will truck its armour for his lilied shield

This little star is furnishd with good spirits
Whose mortal lives were busied to that end
That honour and renown might wait on them
And when desires thus err in their intention
True love must needs ascend with slacker beam
But it is part of our delight to measure
Our wages with the merit and admire
The close proportion  Hence doth heavnly justice
Temper so evenly affection in us
It neer can warp to any wrongfulness
Of diverse voices is sweet music made
So in our life the different degrees
Render sweet harmony among these wheels

Within the pearl that now encloseth us
Shines Romeos light whose goodly deed and fair
Met ill acceptance  But the Provencals
That were his foes have little cause for mirth
Ill shapes that man his course who makes his wrong
Of others worth  Four daughters were there born
To Raymond Berenger and every one
Became a queen and this for him did Romeo
Though of mean state and from a foreign land
Yet envious tongues incited him to ask
A reckoning of that just one who returnd
Twelve fold to him for ten  Aged and poor
He parted thence and if the world did know
The heart he had begging his life by morsels
T would deem the praise it yields him scantly dealt




CANTO VII

Hosanna Sanctus Deus Sabaoth
Superillustrans claritate tua
Felices ignes horum malahoth
Thus chanting saw I turn that substance bright
With fourfold lustre to its orb again
Revolving and the rest unto their dance
With it movd also and like swiftest sparks
In sudden distance from my sight were veild

Me doubt possessd and Speak it whisperd me
Speak speak unto thy lady that she quench
Thy thirst with drops of sweetness  Yet blank awe
Which lords it oer me even at the sound
Of Beatrices name did bow me down
As one in slumber held  Not long that mood
Beatrice sufferd she with such a smile
As might have made one blest amid the flames
Beaming upon me thus her words began
Thou in thy thought art pondring as I deem
And what I deem is truth how just revenge
Could be with justice punishd from which doubt
I soon will free thee so thou mark my words
For they of weighty matter shall possess thee

That man who was unborn himself condemnd
And in himself all who since him have livd
His offspring whence below the human kind
Lay sick in grievous error many an age
Until it pleasd the Word of God to come
Amongst them down to his own person joining
The nature from its Maker far estrangd
By the mere act of his eternal love
Contemplate here the wonder I unfold
The nature with its Maker thus conjoind
Created first was blameless pure and good
But through itself alone was driven forth
From Paradise because it had eschewd
The way of truth and life to evil turnd
Neer then was penalty so just as that
Inflicted by the cross if thou regard
The nature in assumption doomd neer wrong
So great in reference to him who took
Such nature on him and endurd the doom
God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased
So different effects flowd from one act
And heavn was opend though the earth did quake
Count it not hard henceforth when thou dost hear
That a just vengeance was by righteous court
Justly revengd  But yet I see thy mind
By thought on thought arising sore perplexd
And with how vehement desire it asks
Solution of the maze  What I have heard
Is plain thou sayst but wherefore God this way
For our redemption chose eludes my search

Brother no eye of man not perfected
Nor fully ripend in the flame of love
May fathom this decree  It is a mark
In sooth much aimd at and but little kennd
And I will therefore show thee why such way
Was worthiest  The celestial love that spume
All envying in its bounty in itself
With such effulgence blazeth as sends forth
All beauteous things eternal  What distils
Immediate thence no end of being knows
Bearing its seal immutably impressd
Whatever thence immediate falls is free
Free wholly uncontrollable by power
Of each thing new by such conformity
More grateful to its author whose bright beams
Though all partake their shining yet in those
Are liveliest which resemble him the most
These tokens of preeminence on man
Largely bestowd if any of them fail
He needs must forfeit his nobility
No longer stainless  Sin alone is that
Which doth disfranchise him and make unlike
To the chief good for that its light in him
Is darkend  And to dignity thus lost
Is no return unless where guilt makes void
He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain
Your nature which entirely in its seed
Trangressd from these distinctions fell no less
Than from its state in Paradise nor means
Found of recovery search all methods out
As strickly as thou may save one of these
The only fords were left through which to wade
Either that God had of his courtesy
Releasd him merely or else man himself
For his own folly by himself atond

Fix now thine eye intently as thou canst
On th everlasting counsel and explore
Instructed by my words the dread abyss

Man in himself had ever lackd the means
Of satisfaction for he could not stoop
Obeying in humility so low
As high he disobeying thought to soar
And for this reason he had vainly tried
Out of his own sufficiency to pay
The rigid satisfaction  Then behooved
That God should by his own ways lead him back
Unto the life from whence he fell restord
By both his ways I mean or one alone
But since the deed is ever prizd the more
The more the doers good intent appears
Goodness celestial whose broad signature
Is on the universe of all its ways
To raise ye up was fain to leave out none
Nor aught so vast or so magnificent
Either for him who gave or who receivd
Between the last night and the primal day
Was or can be  For God more bounty showd
Giving himself to make man capable
Of his return to life than had the terms
Been mere and unconditional release
And for his justice every method else
Were all too scant had not the Son of God
Humbled himself to put on mortal flesh

Now to fulfil each wish of thine remains
I somewhat further to thy view unfold
That thou mayst see as clearly as myself

I see thou sayst the air the fire I see
The earth and water and all things of them
Compounded to corruption turn and soon
Dissolve  Yet these were also things create
Because if what were told me had been true
They from corruption had been therefore free

The angels O my brother and this clime
Wherein thou art impassible and pure
I call created as indeed they are
In their whole being  But the elements
Which thou hast namd and what of them is made
Are by created virtue informd create
Their substance and create the informing virtue
In these bright stars that round them circling move
The soul of every brute and of each plant
The ray and motion of the sacred lights
With complex potency attract and turn
But this our life the eternal good inspires
Immediate and enamours of itself
So that our wishes rest for ever here

And hence thou mayst by inference conclude
Our resurrection certain if thy mind
Consider how the human flesh was framd
When both our parents at the first were made




CANTO VIII

The world was in its day of peril dark
Wont to believe the dotage of fond love
From the fair Cyprian deity who rolls
In her third epicycle shed on men
By stream of potent radiance therefore they
Of elder time in their old error blind
Not her alone with sacrifice adord
And invocation but like honours paid
To Cupid and Dione deemd of them
Her mother and her son him whom they feignd
To sit in Didos bosom and from her
Whom I have sung preluding borrowd they
The appellation of that star which views
Now obvious and now averse the sun

I was not ware that I was wafted up
Into  its orb but the new loveliness
That gracd my lady gave me ample proof
That we had entered there  And as in flame
A sparkle is distinct or voice in voice
Discernd when one its even tenour keeps
The other comes and goes so in that light
I other luminaries saw that coursd
In circling motion rapid more or less
As their eternal phases each impels

Never was blast from vapour charged with cold
Whether invisible to eye or no
Descended with such speed it had not seemd
To linger in dull tardiness compard
To those celestial lights that towrds us came
Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring
Conducted by the lofty seraphim
And after them who in the van appeard
Such an hosanna sounded as hath left
Desire neer since extinct in me to hear
Renewd the strain  Then parting from the rest
One near us drew and sole began We all
Are ready at thy pleasure well disposd
To do thee gentle service  We are they
To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing
O ye whose intellectual ministry
Moves the third heaven and in one orb we roll
One motion one impulse with those who rule
Princedoms in heaven yet are of love so full
That to please thee t will be as sweet to rest

After mine eyes had with meek reverence
Sought the celestial guide and were by her
Assurd they turnd again unto the light
Who had so largely promisd and with voice
That bare the lively pressure of my zeal
Tell who ye are I cried  Forthwith it grew
In size and splendour through augmented joy
And thus it answerd A short date below
The world possessd me  Had the time been more
Much evil that will come had never chancd
My gladness hides thee from me which doth shine
Around and shroud me as an animal
In its own silk unswathd  Thou lovdst me well
And hadst good cause for had my sojourning
Been longer on the earth the love I bare thee
Had put forth more than blossoms  The left bank
That Rhone when he hath mixd with Sorga laves

In me its lord expected and that horn
Of fair Ausonia with its boroughs old
Bari and Croton and Gaeta pild
From where the Trento disembogues his waves
With Verde mingled to the salt seaflood
Already on my temples beamd the crown
Which gave me sovreignty over the land
By Danube washd whenas he strays beyond
The limits of his German shores  The realm
Where on the gulf by stormy Eurus lashd
Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights
The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom
Not through Typhaeus but the vapry cloud
Bituminous upsteamd THAT too did look
To have its scepter wielded by a race
Of monarchs sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph
had not ill lording which doth spirit up
The people ever in Palermo raisd
The shout of death reechod loud and long
Had but my brothers foresight kennd as much
He had been warier that the greedy want
Of Catalonia might not work his bale
And truly need there is that he forecast
Or other for him lest more freight be laid
On his already overladen bark
Nature in him from bounty falln to thrift
Would ask the  guard of braver arms than such
As only care to have their coffers filld

My liege it doth enhance the joy thy words
Infuse into me mighty as it is
To think my gladness manifest to thee
As to myself who own it when thou lookst
Into the source and limit of all good
There where thou markest that which thou dost speak
Thence prizd of me the more  Glad thou hast made me
Now make intelligent clearing the doubt
Thy speech hath raised in me for much I muse
How bitter can spring up when sweet is sown

I thus inquiring he forthwith replied
If I have power to show one truth soon that
Shall face thee which thy questioning declares
Behind thee now conceald  The Good that guides
And blessed makes this realm which thou dost mount
Ordains its providence to be the virtue
In these great bodies nor th all perfect Mind
Upholds their nature merely but in them
Their energy to save for nought that lies
Within the range of that unerring bow
But is as level with the destind aim
As ever mark to arrows point opposd
Were it not thus these heavens thou dost visit
Would their effect so work it would not be
Art but destruction and this may not chance
If th intellectual powers that move these stars
Fail not or who first faulty made them fail
Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidencd

To whom I thus It is enough no fear
I see lest nature in her part should tire

He straight rejoind Say were it worse for man
If he livd not in fellowship on earth

Yea answerd I nor here a reason needs

And may that be if different estates
Grow not of different duties in your life
Consult your teacher and he tells you no

Thus did he come deducing to this point
And then concluded For this cause behooves
The roots from whence your operations come
Must differ  Therefore one is Solon born
Another Xerxes and Melchisidec
A third and he a fourth whose airy voyage
Cost him his son  In her circuitous course
Nature that is the seal to mortal wax
Doth well her art but no distinctions owns
Twixt one or other household  Hence befalls
That Esau is so wide of Jacob hence
Quirinus of so base a father springs
He dates from Mars his lineage  Were it not
That providence celestial overruld
Nature in generation must the path
Tracd by the generator still pursue
Unswervingly  Thus place I in thy sight
That which was late behind thee  But in sign
Of more affection for thee t is my will
Thou wear this corollary  Nature ever
Finding discordant fortune like all seed
Out of its proper climate thrives but ill
And were the world below content to mark
And work on the foundation nature lays
It would not lack supply of excellence
But ye perversely to religion strain
Him who was born to gird on him the sword
And of the fluent phrasemen make your king
Therefore your steps have wanderd from the paths




CANTO IX

After solution of my doubt thy Charles
O fair Clemenza of the treachery spake
That must befall his seed but Tell it not
Said he and let the destind years come round
Nor may I tell thee more save that the meed
Of sorrow welldeservd shall quit your wrongs

And now the visage of that saintly light
Was to the sun that fills it turnd again
As to the good whose plenitude of bliss
Sufficeth all  O ye misguided souls
Infatuate who from such a good estrange
Your hearts and bend your gaze on vanity
Alas for youAnd lo toward me next
Another of those splendent forms approachd
That by its outward brightning testified
The will it had to pleasure me  The eyes
Of Beatrice resting as before
Firmly upon me manifested forth
Approval of my wish  And O I cried
Blest spirit quickly be my will performd
And prove thou to me that my inmost thoughts
I can reflect on thee  Thereat the light
That yet was new to me from the recess
Where it before was singing thus began
As one who joys in kindness In that part
Of the depravd Italian land which lies
Between Rialto and the fountainsprings
Of Brenta and of Piava there doth rise
But to no lofty eminence a hill
From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend
That sorely sheet the region  From one root
I and it sprang my name on earth Cunizza
And here I glitter for that by its light
This star oercame me  Yet I naught repine
Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot
Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive

This jewel that is next me in our heaven
Lustrous and costly great renown hath left
And not to perish ere these hundred years
Five times absolve their round  Consider thou
If to excel be worthy mans endeavour
When such life may attend the first  Yet they
Care not for this the crowd that now are girt
By Adice and Tagliamento still
Impenitent tho scourgd  The hour is near
When for their stubbornness at Paduas marsh
The water shall be changd that laves Vicena
And where Cagnano meets with Sile one
Lords it and bears his head aloft for whom
The web is now awarping  Feltro too
Shall sorrow for its godless shepherds fault
Of so deep stain that never for the like
Was Maltas bar unclosd  Too large should be
The skillet that would hold Ferraras blood
And wearied he who ounce by ounce would weight it
The which this priest in show of partyzeal
Courteous will give nor will the gift ill suit
The countrys custom  We descry above
Mirrors ye call them thrones from which to us
Reflected shine the judgments of our God
Whence these our sayings we avouch for good

She ended and appeard on other thoughts
Intent reentring on the wheel she late
Had left  That other joyance meanwhile waxd
A thing to marvel at in splendour glowing
Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun
For in that upper clime effulgence comes
Of gladness as here laughter and below
As the mind saddens murkier grows the shade

God seeth all and in him is thy sight
Said I blest Spirit  Therefore will of his
Cannot to thee be dark  Why then delays
Thy voice to satisfy my wish untold
That voice which joins the inexpressive song
Pastime of heavn the which those ardours sing
That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread
I would not wait thy asking wert thou known
To me as thoroughly I to thee am known

He forthwith answring thus his words began
The valley of waters widest next to that
Which doth the earth engarland shapes its course
Between discordant shores against the sun
Inward so far it makes meridian there
Where was before th horizon  Of that vale
Dwelt I upon the shore twixt Ebros stream
And Macras that divides with passage brief
Genoan bounds from Tuscan  East and west
Are nearly one to Begga and my land
Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm
Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco
And I did bear impression of this heavn
That now bears mine for not with fiercer flame
Glowd Belus daughter injuring alike
Sichaeus and Creusa than did I
Long as it suited the unripend down
That fledgd my cheek nor she of Rhodope
That was beguiled of Demophoon
Nor Joves son when the charms of Iole
Were shrind within his heart  And yet there hides
No sorrowful repentance here but mirth
Not for the fault that doth not come to mind
But for the virtue whose oerruling sway
And providence have wrought thus quaintly  Here
The skill is lookd into that fashioneth
With such effectual working and the good
Discernd accruing to this upper world
From that below  But fully to content
Thy wishes all that in this sphere have birth
Demands my further parle  Inquire thou wouldst
Who of this light is denizen that here
Beside me sparkles as the sunbeam doth
On the clear wave  Know then the soul of Rahab
Is in that gladsome harbour to our tribe
United and the foremost rank assignd
He to that heavn at which the shadow ends
Of your sublunar world was taken up
First in Christs triumph of all souls redeemd
For well behoovd that in some part of heavn
She should remain a trophy to declare
The mighty contest won with either palm
For that she favourd first the high exploit
Of Joshua on the holy land whereof
The Pope recks little now  Thy city plant
Of him that on his Maker turnd the back
And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung
Engenders and expands the cursed flower
That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs
Turning the shepherd to a wolf  For this
The gospel and great teachers laid aside
The decretals as their stuft margins show
Are the sole study  Pope and Cardinals
Intent on these neer journey but in thought
To Nazareth where Gabriel opd his wings
Yet it may chance erelong the Vatican
And other most selected parts of Rome
That were the grave of Peters soldiery
Shall be deliverd from the adultrous bond




CANTO X

Looking into his firstborn with the love
Which breathes from both eternal the first Might
Ineffable whence eye or mind
Can roam hath in such order all disposd
As none may see and fail to enjoy  Raise then
O reader to the lofty wheels with me
Thy ken directed to the point whereat
One motion strikes on th other  There begin
Thy wonder of the mighty Architect
Who loves his work so inwardly his eye
Doth ever watch it  See how thence oblique
Brancheth the circle where the planets roll
To pour their wished influence on the world
Whose path not bending thus in heavn above
Much virtue would be lost and here on earth
All power well nigh extinct or from direct
Were its departure distant more or less
I th universal order great defect
Must both in heavn and here beneath ensue

Now rest thee reader on thy bench and muse
Anticipative of the feast to come
So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil
Lo I have set before thee for thyself
Feed now the matter I indite henceforth
Demands entire my thought  Joind with the part
Which late we told of the great minister
Of nature that upon the world imprints
The virtue of the heaven and doles out
Time for us with his beam went circling on
Along the spires where each hour sooner comes
And I was with him weetless of ascent
As one who till arrivd weets not his coming

For Beatrice she who passeth on
So suddenly from good to better time
Counts not the act oh then how great must needs
Have been her brightness  What she was i th sun
Where I had enterd not through change of hue
But light transparentdid I summon up
Genius art practiceI might not so speak
It should be eer imagind yet believd
It may be and the sight be justly cravd
And if our fantasy fail of such height
What marvel since no eye above the sun
Hath ever traveld  Such are they dwell here
Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire
Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows
And holds them still enrapturd with the view
And thus to me Beatrice Thank oh thank
The Sun of angels him who by his grace
To this perceptible hath lifted thee

Never was heart in such devotion bound
And with complacency so absolute
Disposd to render up itself to God
As mine was at those words and so entire
The love for Him that held me it eclipsd
Beatrice in oblivion  Naught displeasd
Was she but smild thereat so joyously
That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake
And scatterd my collected mind abroad

Then saw I a bright band in liveliness
Surpassing who themselves did make the crown
And us their centre yet more sweet in voice
Than in their visage beaming  Cincturd thus
Sometime Latonas daughter we behold
When the impregnate air retains the thread
That weaves her zone  In the celestial court
Whence I return are many jewels found
So dear and beautiful they cannot brook
Transporting from that realm and of these lights
Such was the song  Who doth not prune his wing
To soar up thither let him look from thence
For tidings from the dumb  When singing thus
Those burning suns that circled round us thrice
As nearest stars around the fixed pole
Then seemd they like to ladies from the dance
Not ceasing but suspense in silent pause
Listning till they have caught the strain anew
Suspended so they stood and from within
Thus heard I one who spake Since with its beam
The grace whence true love lighteth first his flame
That after doth increase by loving shines
So multiplied in thee it leads thee up
Along this ladder down whose hallowd steps
None eer descend and mount them not again
Who from his phial should refuse thee wine
To slake thy thirst no less constrained were
Than water flowing not unto the sea
Thou fain wouldst hear what plants are these that bloom
In the bright garland which admiring girds
This fair dame round who strengthens thee for heavn
I then was of the lambs that Dominic
Leads for his saintly flock along the way
Where well they thrive not sworn with vanity
He nearest on my right hand brother was
And master to me Albert of Cologne
Is this and of Aquinum Thomas I
If thou of all the rest wouldst be assurd
Let thine eye waiting on the words I speak
In circuit journey round the blessed wreath
That next resplendence issues from the smile
Of Gratian who to either forum lent
Such help as favour wins in Paradise
The other nearest who adorns our quire
Was Peter he that with the widow gave
To holy church his treasure  The fifth light
Goodliest of all is by such love inspired
That all your world craves tidings of its doom
Within there is the lofty light endowd
With sapience so profound if truth be truth
That with a ken of such wide amplitude
No second hath arisen  Next behold
That tapers radiance to whose view was shown
Clearliest the nature and the ministry
Angelical while yet in flesh it dwelt
In the other little light serenely smiles
That pleader for the Christian temples he
Who did provide Augustin of his lore
Now if thy minds eye pass from light to light
Upon my praises following of the eighth
Thy thirst is next  The saintly soul that shows
The worlds deceitfulness to all who hear him
Is with the sight of all the good that is
Blest there  The limbs whence it was driven lie
Down in Cieldauro and from martyrdom
And exile came it here  Lo further on
Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore
Of Bede and Richard more than man erewhile
In deep discernment  Lastly this from whom
Thy look on me reverteth was the beam
Of one whose spirit on high musings bent
Rebukd the lingring tardiness of death
It is the eternal light of Sigebert
Who scapd not envy when of truth he argued
Reading in the strawlitterd street  Forthwith
As clock that calleth up the spouse of God
To win her bridegrooms love at matins hour
Each part of other fitly drawn and urgd
Sends out a tinkling sound of note so sweet
Affection springs in welldisposed breast
Thus saw I move the glorious wheel thus heard
Voice answring voice so musical and soft
It can be known but where day endless shines




CANTO XI

O fond anxiety of mortal men
How vain and inconclusive arguments
Are those which make thee beat thy wings below
For statues one and one for aphorisms
Was hunting this the priesthood followd that
By force or sophistry aspird to rule
To rob another and another sought
By civil business wealth one moiling lay
Tangled in net of sensual delight
And one to witless indolence resignd
What time from all these empty things escapd
With Beatrice I thus gloriously
Was raisd aloft and made the guest of heavn

They of the circle to that point each one
Where erst it was had turnd and steady glowd
As candle in his socket  Then within
The lustre that erewhile bespake me smiling
With merer gladness heard I thus begin

Een as his beam illumes me so I look
Into the eternal light and clearly mark
Thy thoughts from whence they rise  Thou art in doubt
And wouldst that I should bolt my words afresh
In such plain open phrase as may be smooth
To thy perception where I told thee late
That well they thrive and that no second such
Hath risen which no small distinction needs

The providence that governeth the world
In depth of counsel by created ken
Unfathomable to the end that she
Who with loud cries was spousd in precious blood
Might keep her footing towards her wellbelovd
Safe in herself and constant unto him
Hath two ordaind who should on either hand
In chief escort her one seraphic all
In fervency for wisdom upon earth
The other splendour of cherubic light
I but of one will tell he tells of both
Who one commendeth which of them soer
Be taken for their deeds were to one end

Between Tupino and the wave that falls
From blest Ubaldos chosen hill there hangs
Rich slope of mountain high whence heat and cold
Are wafted through Perugias eastern gate
And Norcera with Gualdo in its rear
Mourn for their heavy yoke  Upon that side
Where it doth break its steepness most arose
A sun upon the world as duly this
From Ganges doth therefore let none who speak
Of that place say Ascesi for its name
Were lamely so deliverd but the East
To call things rightly be it henceforth styld
He was not yet much distant from his rising
When his good influence gan to bless the earth
A dame to whom none openeth pleasures gate
More than to death was gainst his fathers will
His stripling choice and he did make her his
Before the Spiritual court by nuptial bonds
And in his fathers sight from day to day
Then lovd her more devoutly  She bereavd
Of her first husband slighted and obscure
Thousand and hundred years and more remaind
Without a single suitor till he came
Nor aught availd that with Amyclas she
Was found unmovd at rumour of his voice
Who shook the world nor aught her constant boldness
Whereby with Christ she mounted on the cross
When Mary stayd beneath  But not to deal
Thus closely with thee longer take at large
The rovers titlesPoverty and Francis
Their concord and glad looks wonder and love
And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts
So much that venerable Bernard first
Did bare his feet and in pursuit of peace
So heavenly ran yet deemd his footing slow
O hidden riches  O prolific good
Egidius bares him next and next Sylvester
And follow both the bridegroom so the bride
Can please them  Thenceforth goes he on his way
The father and the master with his spouse
And with that family whom now the cord
Girt humbly nor did abjectness of heart
Weigh down his eyelids for that he was son
Of Pietro Bernardone and by men
In wondrous sort despisd  But royally
His hard intention he to Innocent
Set forth and from him first receivd the seal
On his religion  Then when numerous flockd
The tribe of lowly ones that tracd HIS steps
Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung
In heights empyreal through Honorius hand
A second crown to deck their Guardians virtues
Was by the eternal Spirit inwreathd and when
He had through thirst of martyrdom stood up
In the proud Soldans presence and there preachd
Christ and his followers but found the race
Unripend for conversion back once more
He hasted not to intermit his toil
And reapd Ausonian lands  On the hard rock
Twixt Arno and the Tyber he from Christ
Took the last Signet which his limbs two years
Did carry  Then the season come that he
Who to such good had destind him was pleasd
T advance him to the meed which he had earnd
By his selfhumbling to his brotherhood
As their just heritage he gave in charge
His dearest lady and enjoind their love
And faith to her and from her bosom willd
His goodly spirit should move forth returning
To its appointed kingdom nor would have
His body laid upon another bier

Think now of one who were a fit colleague
To keep the bark of Peter in deep sea
Helmd to right point and such our Patriarch was
Therefore who follow him as he enjoins
Thou mayst be certain take good lading in
But hunger of new viands tempts his flock
So that they needs into strange pastures wide
Must spread them and the more remote from him
The stragglers wander so much mole they come
Home to the sheepfold destitute of milk
There are of them in truth who fear their harm
And to the shepherd cleave but these so few
A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks

Now if my words be clear if thou have taen
Good heed if that which I have told recall
To mind thy wish may be in part fulfilld
For thou wilt see the point from whence they split
Nor miss of the reproof which that implies
That well they thrive not sworn with vanity




CANTO XII

Soon as its final word the blessed flame
Had raisd for utterance straight the holy mill
Began to wheel nor yet had once revolvd
Or ere another circling compassd it
Motion to motion song to song conjoining
Song that as much our muses doth excel
Our Sirens with their tuneful pipes as ray
Of primal splendour doth its faint reflex

As when if Juno bid her handmaid forth
Two arches parallel and trickd alike
Span the thin cloud the outer taking birth
From that within in manner of that voice
Whom love did melt away as sun the mist
And they who gaze presageful call to mind
The compact made with Noah of the world
No more to be oerflowd about us thus
Of sempiternal roses bending wreathd
Those garlands twain and to the innermost
Een thus th external answered  When the footing
And other great festivity of song
And radiance light with light accordant each
Jocund and blythe had at their pleasure stilld
Een as the eyes by quick volition movd
Are shut and raisd together from the heart
Of one amongst the new lights movd a voice
That made me seem like needle to the star
In turning to its whereabout and thus
Began The love that makes me beautiful
Prompts me to tell of th other guide for whom
Such good of mine is spoken  Where one is
The other worthily should also be
That as their warfare was alike alike
Should be their glory  Slow and full of doubt
And with thin ranks after its banner movd
The army of Christ which it so clearly cost
To reappoint when its imperial Head
Who reigneth ever for the drooping host
Did make provision thorough grace alone
And not through its deserving  As thou heardst
Two champions to the succour of his spouse
He sent who by their deeds and words might join
Again his scatterd people  In that clime
Where springs the pleasant westwind to unfold
The fresh leaves with which Europe sees herself
Newgarmented nor from those billows far
Beyond whose chiding after weary course
The sun doth sometimes hide him safe abides
The happy Callaroga under guard
Of the great shield wherein the lion lies
Subjected and supreme  And there was born
The loving million of the Christian faith
The hollowd wrestler gentle to his own
And to his enemies terrible  So replete
His soul with lively virtue that when first
Created even in the mothers womb
It prophesied  When at the sacred font
The spousals were complete twixt faith and him
Where pledge of mutual safety was exchangd
The dame who was his surety in her sleep
Beheld the wondrous fruit that was from him
And from his heirs to issue  And that such
He might be construed as indeed he was
She was inspird to name him of his owner
Whose he was wholly and so calld him Dominic
And I speak of him as the labourer
Whom Christ in his own garden chose to be
His helpmate  Messenger he seemd and friend
Fastknit to Christ and the first love he showd
Was after the first counsel that Christ gave
Many a time his nurse at entering found
That he had risn in silence and was prostrate
As who should say My errand was for this
O happy father  Felix rightly namd
O favourd mother rightly namd Joanna
If that do mean as men interpret it
Not for the worlds sake for which now they pore
Upon Ostiense and Taddeos page
But for the real manna soon he grew
Mighty in learning and did set himself
To go about the vineyard that soon turns
To wan and witherd if not tended well
And from the see whose bounty to the just
And needy is gone by not through its fault
But his who fills it basely he besought
No dispensation for commuted wrong
Nor the first vacant fortune nor the tenth
That to Gods paupers rightly appertain
But gainst an erring and degenerate world
Licence to fight in favour of that seed
From which the twice twelve cions gird thee round
Then with sage doctrine and good will to help
Forth on his great apostleship he fard
Like torrent bursting from a lofty vein
And dashing gainst the stocks of heresy
Smote fiercest where resistance was most stout
Thence many rivulets have since been turnd
Over the garden Catholic to lead
Their living waters and have fed its plants

If such one wheel of that twoyoked car
Wherein the holy church defended her
And rode triumphant through the civil broil
Thou canst not doubt its fellows excellence
Which Thomas ere my coming hath declard
So courteously unto thee  But the track
Which its smooth fellies made is now deserted
That mouldy mother is where late were lees
His family that wont to trace his path
Turn backward and invert their steps erelong
To rue the gathering in of their ill crop
When the rejected tares in vain shall ask
Admittance to the barn  I question not
But he who searchd our volume leaf by leaf
Might still find page with this inscription ont
I am as I was wont  Yet such were not
From Acquasparta nor Casale whence
Of those who come to meddle with the text
One stretches and another cramps its rule
Bonaventuras life in me behold
From Bagnororegio one who in discharge
Of my great offices still laid aside
All sinister aim  Illuminato here
And Agostino join me two they were
Among the first of those barefooted meek ones
Who sought Gods friendship in the cord with them
Hugues of Saint Victor Pietro Mangiadore
And he of Spain in his twelve volumes shining
Nathan the prophet Metropolitan
Chrysostom and Anselmo and who deignd
To put his hand to the first art Donatus
Raban is here and at my side there shines
Calabrias abbot Joachim endowd
With soul prophetic  The bright courtesy
Of friar Thomas and his goodly lore
Have movd me to the blazon of a peer
So worthy and with me have movd this throng




CANTO XIII

Let him who would conceive what now I saw
Imagine and retain the image firm
As mountain rock the whilst he hears me speak
Of stars fifteen from midst the ethereal host
Selected that with lively ray serene
Oercome the massiest air thereto imagine
The wain that in the bosom of our sky
Spins ever on its axle night and day
With the bright summit of that horn which swells
Due from the pole round which the first wheel rolls
T have rangd themselves in fashion of two signs
In heavn such as Ariadne made
When deaths chill seized her and that one of them
Did compass in the others beam and both
In such sort whirl around that each should tend
With opposite motion and conceiving thus
Of that true constellation and the dance
Twofold that circled me he shall attain
As t were the shadow for things there as much
Surpass our usage as the swiftest heavn
Is swifter than the Chiana  There was sung
No Bacchus and no Io Paean but
Three Persons in the Godhead and in one
Substance that nature and the human joind

The song fulfilld its measure and to us
Those saintly lights attended happier made
At each new ministring  Then silence brake
Amid th accordant sons of Deity
That luminary in which the wondrous life
Of the meek man of God was told to me
And thus it spake One ear o th harvest threshd
And its grain safely stord sweet charity
Invites me with the other to like toil

Thou knowst that in the bosom whence the rib
Was taen to fashion that fair cheek whose taste
All the world pays for and in that which piercd
By the keen lance both after and before
Such satisfaction offerd as outweighs
Each evil in the scale whateer of light
To human nature is allowd must all
Have by his virtue been infusd who formd
Both one and other and thou thence admirst
In that I told thee of beatitudes
A second there is none to his enclosd
In the fifth radiance  Open now thine eyes
To what I answer thee and thou shalt see
Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth
As centre in the round  That which dies not
And that which can die are but each the beam
Of that idea which our Soverign Sire
Engendereth loving for that lively light
Which passeth from his brightness not disjoind
From him nor from his love triune with them
Doth through his bounty congregate itself
Mirrord as t were in new existences
Itself unalterable and ever one

Descending hence unto the lowest powers
Its energy so sinks at last it makes
But brief contingencies for so I name
Things generated which the heavnly orbs
Moving with seed or without seed produce
Their wax and that which molds it differ much
And thence with lustre more or less it shows
Th ideal stamp impress so that one tree
According to his kind hath better fruit
And worse and at your birth ye mortal men
Are in your talents various  Were the wax
Molded with nice exactness and the heavn
In its disposing influence supreme
The lustre of the seal should be complete
But nature renders it imperfect ever
Resembling thus the artist in her work
Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill
Howeer if love itself dispose and mark
The primal virtue kindling with bright view
There all perfection is vouchsafed and such
The clay was made accomplishd with each gift
That life can teem with such the burden filld
The virgins bosom so that I commend
Thy judgment that the human nature neer
Was or can be such as in them it was

Did I advance no further than this point
How then had he no peer  thou mightst reply
But that what now appears not may appear
Right plainly ponder who he was and what
When he was bidden Ask  the motive swayd
To his requesting  I have spoken thus
That thou mayst see he was a king who askd
For wisdom to the end he might be king
Sufficient not the number to search out
Of the celestial movers or to know
If necessary with contingent eer
Have made necessity or whether that
Be granted that first motion is or if
Of the mid circle can by art be made
Triangle with each corner blunt or sharp

Whence noting that which I have said and this
Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn
At which the dart of my intention aims
And marking clearly that I told thee Risen
Thou shalt discern it only hath respect
To kings of whom are many and the good
Are rare  With this distinction take my words
And they may well consist with that which thou
Of the first human father dost believe
And of our wellbeloved  And let this
Henceforth be led unto thy feet to make
Thee slow in motion as a weary man
Both to the yea and to the nay thou seest not
For he among the fools is down full low
Whose affirmation or denial is
Without distinction in each case alike
Since it befalls that in most instances
Current opinion leads to false and then
Affection bends the judgment to her ply

Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore
Since he returns not such as he set forth
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill
And open proofs of this unto the world
Have been afforded in Parmenides
Melissus Bryso and the crowd beside
Who journeyd on and knew not whither so did
Sabellius Arius and the other fools
Who like to scymitars reflected back
The scriptureimage by distortion marrd

Let not the people be too swift to judge
As one who reckons on the blades in field
Or ere the crop be ripe  For I have seen
The thorn frown rudely all the winter long
And after bear the rose upon its top
And bark that all the way across the sea
Ran straight and speedy perish at the last
Een in the havens mouth seeing one steal
Another brine his offering to the priest
Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence
Into heavns counsels deem that they can pry
For one of these may rise the other fall




CANTO XIV

From centre to the circle and so back
From circle to the centre water moves
In the round chalice even as the blow
Impels it inwardly or from without
Such was the image glancd into my mind
As the great spirit of Aquinum ceasd
And Beatrice after him her words
Resumd alternate Need there is tho yet
He tells it to you not in words nor een
In thought that he should fathom to its depth
Another mystery  Tell him if the light
Wherewith your substance blooms shall stay with you
Eternally as now and if it doth
How when ye shall regain your visible forms
The sight may without harm endure the change
That also tell  As those who in a ring
Tread the light measure in their fitful mirth
Raise loud the voice and spring with gladder bound
Thus at the hearing of that pious suit
The saintly circles in their tourneying
And wondrous note attested new delight

Whoso laments that we must doff this garb
Of frail mortality thenceforth to live
Immortally above he hath not seen
The sweet refreshing of that heavnly shower

Him who lives ever and for ever reigns
In mystic union of the Three in One
Unbounded bounding all each spirit thrice
Sang with such melody as but to hear
For highest merit were an ample meed
And from the lesser orb the goodliest light
With gentle voice and mild such as perhaps
The angels once to Mary thus replied
Long as the joy of Paradise shall last
Our love shall shine around that raiment bright
As fervent fervent as in vision blest
And that as far in blessedness exceeding
As it hath grave beyond its virtue great
Our shape regarmented with glorious weeds
Of saintly flesh must being thus entire
Show yet more gracious  Therefore shall increase
Whateer of light gratuitous imparts
The Supreme Good light ministering aid
The better disclose his glory whence
The vision needs increasing much increase
The fervour which it kindles and that too
The ray that comes from it  But as the greed
Which gives out flame yet it its whiteness shines
More lively than that and so preserves
Its proper semblance thus this circling sphere
Of splendour shall to view less radiant seem
Than shall our fleshly robe which yonder earth
Now covers  Nor will such excess of light
Oerpower us in corporeal organs made
Firm and susceptible of all delight

So ready and so cordial an Amen
Followed from either choir as plainly spoke
Desire of their dead bodies yet perchance
Not for themselves but for their kindred dear
Mothers and sires and those whom best they lovd
Ere they were made imperishable flame

And lo forthwith there rose up round about
A lustre over that already there
Of equal clearness like the brightening up
Of the horizon  As at an evening hour
Of twilight new appearances through heavn
Peer with faint glimmer doubtfully descried
So there new substances methought began
To rise in view and round the other twain
Enwheeling sweep their ampler circuit wide

O gentle glitter of eternal beam
With what a such whiteness did it flow
Oerpowering vision in me  But so fair
So passing lovely Beatrice showd
Mind cannot follow it nor words express
Her infinite sweetness  Thence mine eyes regaind
Power to look up and I beheld myself
Sole with my lady to more lofty bliss
Translated for the star with warmer smile
Impurpled well denoted our ascent

With all the heart and with that tongue which speaks
The same in all an holocaust I made
To God befitting the new grace vouchsafd
And from my bosom had not yet upsteamd
The fuming of that incense when I knew
The rite accepted  With such mighty sheen
And mantling crimson in two listed rays
The splendours shot before me that I cried
God of Sabaoth that does prank them thus

As leads the galaxy from pole to pole
Distinguishd into greater lights and less
Its pathway which the wisest fail to spell
So thickly studded in the depth of Mars
Those rays describd the venerable sign
That quadrants in the round conjoining frame
Here memory mocks the toil of genius  Christ
Beamd on that cross and pattern fails me now
But whoso takes his cross and follows Christ
Will pardon me for that I leave untold
When in the fleckerd dawning he shall spy
The glitterance of Christ  From horn to horn
And tween the summit and the base did move
Lights scintillating as they met and passd
Thus oft are seen with everchangeful glance
Straight or athwart now rapid and now slow
The atomies of bodies long or short
To move along the sunbeam whose slant line
Checkers the shadow interposd by art
Against the noontide heat  And as the chime
Of minstrel music dulcimer and help
With many strings a pleasant dining makes
To him who heareth not distinct the note
So from the lights which there appeard to me
Gatherd along the cross a melody
That indistinctly heard with ravishment
Possessd me  Yet I markd it was a hymn
Of lofty praises for there came to me
Arise and conquer as to one who hears
And comprehends not  Me such ecstasy
Oercame that never till that hour was thing
That held me in so sweet imprisonment

Perhaps my saying over bold appears
Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes
Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire
But he who is aware those living seals
Of every beauty work with quicker force
The higher they are risn and that there
I had not turnd me to them he may well
Excuse me that whereof in my excuse
I do accuse me and may own my truth
That holy pleasure here not yet reveald
Which grows in transport as we mount aloof




CANTO XV

True love that ever shows itself as clear
In kindness as loose appetite in wrong
Silenced that lyre harmonious and stilld
The sacred chords that are by heavns right hand
Unwound and tightend flow to righteous prayers
Should they not hearken who to give me will
For praying in accordance thus were mute
He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief
Who for the love of thing that lasteth not
Despoils himself forever of that love

As oft along the still and pure serene
At nightfall glides a sudden trail of fire
Attracting with involuntary heed
The eye to follow it erewhile at rest
And seems some star that shifted place in heavn
Only that whence it kindles none is lost
And it is soon extinct thus from the horn
That on the dexter of the cross extends
Down to its foot one luminary ran
From mid the cluster shone there yet no gem
Droppd from its foil and through the beamy list
Like flame in alabaster glowd its course

So forward stretchd him if of credence aught
Our greater muse may claim the pious ghost
Of old Anchises in the Elysian bower
When he perceivd his son  O thou my blood
O most exceeding grace divine to whom
As now to thee hath twice the heavnly gate
Been eer unclosd so spake the light whence I
Turnd me toward him then unto my dame
My sight directed and on either side
Amazement waited me for in her eyes
Was lighted such a smile I thought that mine
Had divd unto the bottom of my grace
And of my bliss in Paradise  Forthwith
To hearing and to sight grateful alike
The spirit to his proem added things
I understood not so profound he spake
Yet not of choice but through necessity
Mysterious for his high conception scard
Beyond the mark of mortals  When the flight
Of holy transport had so spent its rage
That nearer to the level of our thought
The speech descended the first sounds I heard
Were Best he thou Triunal Deity
That hast such favour in my seed vouchsafd
Then followd No unpleasant thirst tho long
Which took me reading in the sacred book
Whose leaves or white or dusky never change
Thou hast allayd my son within this light
From whence my voice thou hearst more thanks to her
Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes
Begirt thee  Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me
From him transmitted who is first of all
Een as all numbers ray from unity
And therefore dost not ask me who I am
Or why to thee more joyous I appear
Than any other in this gladsome throng
The truth is as thou deemst for in this hue
Both less and greater in that mirror look
In which thy thoughts or ere thou thinkst are shown
But that the love which keeps me wakeful ever
Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire
May be contended fully let thy voice
Fearless and frank and jocund utter forth
Thy will distinctly utter forth the wish
Whereto my ready answer stands decreed

I turnd me to Beatrice and she heard
Ere I had spoken smiling an assent
That to my will gave wings and I began
To each among your tribe what time ye kennd
The nature in whom naught unequal dwells
Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt
For that they are so equal in the sun
From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat
As makes all likeness scant  But will and means
In mortals for the cause ye well discern
With unlike wings are fledge  A mortal I
Experience inequality like this
And therefore give no thanks but in the heart
For thy paternal greeting  This howeer
I pray thee living topaz that ingemmst
This precious jewel let me hear thy name

I am thy root O leaf whom to expect
Even hath pleasd me thus the prompt reply
Prefacing next it added he of whom
Thy kindred appellation comes and who
These hundred years and more on its first ledge
Hath circuited the mountain was my son
And thy great grandsire  Well befits his long
Endurance should be shortend by thy deeds

Florence within her ancient limitmark
Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon
Was chaste and sober and abode in peace
She had no armlets and no headtires then
No purfled dames no zone that caught the eye
More than the person did  Time was not yet
When at his daughters birth the sire grew pale
For fear the age and dowry should exceed
On each side just proportion  House was none
Void of its family nor yet had come
Hardanapalus to exhibit feats
Of chamber prowess  Montemalo yet
Oer our suburban turret rose as much
To be surpass in fall as in its rising
I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad
In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone
And with no artful colouring on her cheeks
His lady leave the glass  The sons I saw
Of Nerli and of Vecchio well content
With unrobd jerkin and their good dames handling
The spindle and the flax O happy they
Each sure of burial in her native land
And none left desolate abed for France
One wakd to tend the cradle hushing it
With sounds that lulld the parents infancy
Another with her maidens drawing off
The tresses from the distaff lecturd them
Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome
A Salterello and Cianghella we
Had held as strange a marvel as ye would
A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now

In such composd and seemly fellowship
Such faithful and such fair equality
In so sweet household Mary at my birth
Bestowd me calld on with loud cries and there
In your old baptistery I was made
Christian at once and Cacciaguida as were
My brethren Eliseo and Moronto

From Valdipado came to me my spouse
And hence thy surname grew  I followd then
The Emperor Conrad and his knighthood he
Did gird on me in such good part he took
My valiant service  After him I went
To testify against that evil law
Whose people by the shepherds fault possess
Your right usurping  There by that foul crew
Was I releasd from the deceitful world
Whose base affection many a spirit soils
And from the martyrdom came to this peace




CANTO XVI

O slight respect of mans nobility
I never shall account it marvelous
That our infirm affection here below
Thou movst to boasting when I could not choose
Een in that region of unwarpd desire
In heavn itself but make my vaunt in thee
Yet cloak thou art soon shortend for that time
Unless thou be eked out from day to day
Goes round thee with his shears  Resuming then
With greeting such as Rome was first to bear
But since hath disaccustomd I began
And Beatrice that a little space
Was severd smild reminding me of her
Whose cough emboldend as the story holds
To first offence the doubting Guenever

You are my sire said I you give me heart
Freely to speak my thought above myself
You raise me  Through so many streams with joy
My soul is filld that gladness wells from it
So that it bears the mighty tide and bursts not
Say then my honourd stem what ancestors
Where those you sprang from and what years were markd
In your first childhood  Tell me of the fold
That hath Saint John for guardian what was then
Its state and who in it were highest seated

As embers at the breathing of the wind
Their flame enliven so that light I saw
Shine at my blandishments and as it grew
More fair to look on so with voice more sweet
Yet not in this our modern phrase forthwith
It answerd From the day when it was said
Hail Virgin to the throes by which my mother
Who now is sainted lightend her of me
Whom she was heavy with this fire had come
Five hundred fifty times and thrice its beams
To reilumine underneath the foot
Of its own lion  They of whom I sprang
And I had there our birthplace where the last
Partition of our city first is reachd
By him that runs her annual game  Thus much
Suffice of my forefathers who they were
And whence they hither came more honourable
It is to pass in silence than to tell
All those who in that time were there from Mars
Until the Baptist fit to carry arms
Were but the fifth of them this day alive
But then the citizens blood that now is mixd
From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine
Ran purely through the last mechanics veins
O how much better were it that these people
Were neighbours to you and that at Galluzzo
And at Trespiano ye should have your boundry
Than to have them within and bear the stench
Of Agugliones hind and Signas him
That hath his eye already keen for bartring
Had not the people which of all the world
Degenerates most been stepdame unto Caesar
But as a mother gracious to her son
Such one as hath become a Florentine
And trades and traffics had been turnd adrift
To Simifonte where his grandsire plyd
The beggars craft  The Conti were possessd
Of Montemurlo still the Cerchi still
Were in Acones parish nor had haply
From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte
The citys malady hath ever source
In the confusion of its persons as
The bodys in variety of food
And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge
Than the blind lamb and oftentimes one sword
Doth more and better execution
Than five  Mark Luni Urbisaglia mark
How they are gone and after them how go
Chiusi and Sinigaglia and t will seem
No longer new or strange to thee to hear
That families fail when cities have their end
All things that appertain t ye like yourselves
Are mortal but mortality in some
Ye mark not they endure so long and you
Pass by so suddenly  And as the moon
Doth by the rolling of her heavnly sphere
Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly
So fortune deals with Florence  Hence admire not
At what of them I tell thee whose renown
Time covers the first Florentines  I saw
The Ughi Catilini and Filippi
The Alberichi Greci and Ormanni
Now in their wane illustrious citizens
And great as ancient of Sannella him
With him of Arca saw and Soldanieri
And Ardinghi and Bostichi  At the poop
That now is laden with new felony
So cumbrous it may speedily sink the bark
The Ravignani sat of whom is sprung
The County Guido and whoso hath since
His title from the famd Bellincione taen
Fair governance was yet an art well prizd
By him of Pressa Galigaio showd
The gilded hilt and pommel in his house
The column clothd with verrey still was seen
Unshaken the Sacchetti still were great
Giouchi Sifanti Galli and Barucci
With them who blush to hear the bushel namd
Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk
Was in its strength and to the curule chairs
Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn
How mighty them I saw whom since their pride
Hath undone and in all her goodly deeds
Florence was by the bullets of bright gold
Oerflourishd  Such the sires of those who now
As surely as your church is vacant flock
Into her consistory and at leisure
There stall them and grow fat  The oerweening brood
That plays the dragon after him that flees
But unto such as turn and show the tooth
Ay or the purse is gentle as a lamb
Was on its rise but yet so slight esteemd
That Ubertino of Donati grudgd
His fatherinlaw should yoke him to its tribe
Already Caponsacco had descended
Into the mart from Fesole and Giuda
And Infangato were good citizens
A thing incredible I tell tho true
The gateway named from those of Pera led
Into the narrow circuit of your walls
Each one who bears the sightly quarterings
Of the great Baron he whose name and worth
The festival of Thomas still revives
His knighthood and his privilege retaind
Albeit one who borders them With gold
This day is mingled with the common herd
In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt
And Importuni well for its repose
Had it still lackd of newer neighbourhood
The house from whence your tears have had their spring
Through the just anger that hath murderd ye
And put a period to your gladsome days
Was honourd it and those consorted with it
O Buondelmonte what ill counseling
Prevaild on thee to break the plighted bond
Many who now are weeping would rejoice
Had God to Ema givn thee the first time
Thou near our city camst  But so was doomd
On that maimd stone set up to guard the bridge
At thy last peace the victim Florence fell
With these and others like to them I saw
Florence in such assurd tranquility
She had no cause at which to grieve with these
Saw her so glorious and so just that neer
The lily from the lance had hung reverse
Or through division been with vermeil dyed




CANTO XVII

Such as the youth who came to Clymene
To certify himself of that reproach
Which had been fastend on him he whose end
Still makes the fathers chary to their sons
Een such was I nor unobservd was such
Of Beatrice and that saintly lamp
Who had erewhile for me his station movd
When thus by lady Give thy wish free vent
That it may issue bearing true report
Of the minds impress not that aught thy words
May to our knowledge add but to the end
That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst
And men may mingle for thee when they hear

O plant from whence I spring reverd and lovd
Who soarst so high a pitch thou seest as clear
As earthly thought determines two obtuse
In one triangle not containd so clear
Dost see contingencies ere in themselves
Existent looking at the point whereto
All times are present I the whilst I scald
With Virgil the soul purifying mount
And visited the nether world of woe
Touching my future destiny have heard
Words grievous though I feel me on all sides
Well squard to fortunes blows  Therefore my will
Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me
The arrow seen beforehand slacks its flight

So said I to the brightness which erewhile
To me had spoken and my will declard
As Beatrice willd explicitly
Nor with oracular response obscure
Such as or ere the Lamb of God was slain
Beguild the credulous nations but in terms
Precise and unambiguous lore replied
The spirit of paternal love enshrind
Yet in his smile apparent and thus spake
Contingency unfolded not to view
Upon the tablet of your mortal mold
Is all depicturd in the eternal sight
But hence deriveth not necessity
More then the tall ship hurried down the flood
Doth from the vision that reflects the scene
From thence as to the ear sweet harmony
From organ comes so comes before mine eye
The time prepard for thee  Such as drivn out
From Athens by his cruel stepdames wiles
Hippolytus departed such must thou
Depart from Florence  This they wish and this
Contrive and will ere long effectuate there
Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ
Throughout the livelong day  The common cry
Will as t is ever wont affix the blame
Unto the party injurd but the truth
Shall in the vengeance it dispenseth find
A faithful witness  Thou shall leave each thing
Belovd most dearly this is the first shaft
Shot from the bow of exile  Thou shalt prove
How salt the savour is of others bread
How hard the passage to descend and climb
By others stairs But that shall gall thee most
Will be the worthless and vile company
With whom thou must be thrown into these straits
For all ungrateful impious all and mad
Shall turn gainst thee but in a little while
Theirs and not thine shall be the crimsond brow
Their course shall so evince their brutishness
T have taen thy stand apart shall well become thee

First refuge thou must find first place of rest
In the great Lombards courtesy who bears
Upon the ladder perchd the sacred bird
He shall behold thee with such kind regard
That twixt ye two the contrary to that
Which falls twixt other men the granting shall
Forerun the asking  With him shalt thou see
That mortal who was at his birth impress
So strongly from this star that of his deeds
The nations shall take note  His unripe age
Yet holds him from observance for these wheels
Only nine years have compass him about
But ere the Gascon practice on great Harry
Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him
In equal scorn of labours and of gold
His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely
As not to let the tongues een of his foes
Be idle in its praise  Look thou to him
And his beneficence for he shall cause
Reversal of their lot to many people
Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes
And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul
Of him but tell it not and things he told
Incredible to those who witness them
Then added So interpret thou my son
What hath been told theeLo the ambushment
That a few circling seasons hide for thee
Yet envy not thy neighbours time extends
Thy span beyond their treasons chastisement

Soon as the saintly spirit by his silence
Had shown the web which I had stretehd for him
Upon the warp was woven I began
As one who in perplexity desires
Counsel of other wise benign and friendly
My father well I mark how time spurs on
Toward me ready to inflict the blow
Which falls most heavily on him who most
Abandoned himself  Therefore t is good
I should forecast that driven from the place
Most dear to me I may not lose myself
All others by my song  Down through the world
Of infinite mourning and along the mount
From whose fair height my ladys eyes did lift me
And after through this heavn from light to light
Have I learnt that which if I tell again
It may with many woefully disrelish
And if I am a timid friend to truth
I fear my life may perish among those
To whom these days shall be of ancient date

The brightness where enclosd the treasure smild
Which I had found there first shone glisteningly
Like to a golden mirror in the sun
Next answerd Conscience dimmd or by its own
Or others shame will feel thy saying sharp
Thou notwithstanding all deceit removd
See the whole vision be made manifest
And let them wince who have their withers wrung
What though when tasted first thy voice shall prove
Unwelcome on digestion it will turn
To vital nourishment  The cry thou raisest
Shall as the wind doth smite the proudest summits
Which is of honour no light argument
For this there only have been shown to thee
Throughout these orbs the mountain and the deep
Spirits whom fame hath note of  For the mind
Of him who hears is loth to acquiesce
And fix its faith unless the instance brought
Be palpable and proof apparent urge




CANTO XVIII

CANTO XVIII

Now in his word sole ruminating joyd
That blessed spirit and I fed on mine
Tempting the sweet with bitter she meanwhile
Who led me unto God admonishd Muse
On other thoughts bethink thee that near Him
I dwell who recompenseth every wrong

At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turnd
And in the saintly eyes what love was seen
I leave in silence here nor through distrust
Of my words only but that to such bliss
The mind remounts not without aid  Thus much
Yet may I speak that as I gazd on her
Affection found no room for other wish
While the everlasting pleasure that did full
On Beatrice shine with second view
From her fair countenance my gladdend soul
Contented vanquishing me with a beam
Of her soft smile she spake Turn thee and list
These eyes are not thy only Paradise

As here we sometimes in the looks may see
Th affection markd when that its sway hath taen
The spirit wholly thus the hallowd light
To whom I turnd flashing bewrayd its will
To talk yet further with me and began
On this fifth lodgment of the tree whose life
Is from its top whose fruit is ever fair
And leaf unwithring blessed spirits abide
That were below ere they arrivd in heavn
So mighty in renown as every muse
Might grace her triumph with them  On the horns
Look therefore of the cross he whom I name
Shall there enact as doth in summer cloud
Its nimble fire  Along the cross I saw
At the repeated name of Joshua
A splendour gliding nor the word was said
Ere it was done then at the naming saw
Of the great Maccabee another move
With whirling speed and gladness was the scourge
Unto that top  The next for Charlemagne
And for the peer Orlando two my gaze
Pursued intently as the eye pursues
A falcon flying  Last along the cross
William and Renard and Duke Godfrey drew
My ken and Robert Guiscard  And the soul
Who spake with me among the other lights
Did move away and mix and with the choir
Of heavnly songsters provd his tuneful skill

To Beatrice on my right l bent
Looking for intimation or by word
Or act what next behoovd and did descry
Such mere effulgence in her eyes such joy
It past all former wont  And as by sense
Of new delight the man who perseveres
In good deeds doth perceive from day to day
His virtue growing I een thus perceivd
Of my ascent together with the heavn
The circuit widend noting the increase
Of beauty in that wonder  Like the change
In a brief moment on some maidens cheek
Which from its fairness doth discharge the weight
Of pudency that staind it such in her
And to mine eyes so sudden was the change
Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star
Whose sixth orb now enfolded us  I saw
Within that Jovial cresset the clear sparks
Of love that reignd there fashion to my view
Our language  And as birds from river banks
Arisen now in round now lengthend troop
Array them in their flight greeting as seems
Their newfound pastures so within the lights
The saintly creatures flying sang and made
Now D now I now L figurd I th air

First singing to their notes they movd then one
Becoming of these signs a little while
Did rest them and were mute  O nymph divine
Of Pegasean race whose souls which thou
Inspirst makst glorious and longlivd as they
Cities and realms by thee thou with thyself
Inform me that I may set forth the shapes
As fancy doth present them  Be thy power
Displayd in this brief song  The characters
Vocal and consonant were fivefold seven
In order each as they appeard I markd
Diligite Justitiam the first
Both verb and noun all blazond and the extreme
Qui judicatis terram  In the M
Of the fifth word they held their station
Making the star seem silver streakd with gold
And on the summit of the M I saw
Descending other lights that rested there
Singing methinks their bliss and primal good
Then as at shaking of a lighted brand
Sparkles innumerable on all sides
Rise scatterd source of augury to th unwise
Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence
Seemd reascending and a higher pitch
Some mounting and some less een as the sun
Which kindleth them decreed  And when each one
Had settled in his place the head and neck
Then saw I of an eagle lively
Gravd in that streaky fire  Who painteth there
Hath none to guide him of himself he guides
And every line and texture of the nest
Doth own from him the virtue fashions it
The other bright beatitude that seemd
Erewhile with lilied crowning well content
To overcanopy the M movd forth
Following gently the impress of the bird

 Sweet star what glorious and thickstudded gems
Declard to me our justice on the earth
To be the effluence of that heavn which thou
Thyself a costly jewel dost inlay
Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind from whom
Thy motion and thy virtue are begun
That he would look from whence the fog doth rise
To vitiate thy beam so that once more
He may put forth his hand gainst such as drive
Their traffic in that sanctuary whose walls
With miracles and martyrdoms were built

Ye host of heaven whose glory I survey
O beg ye grace for those that are on earth
All after ill example gone astray
War once had for its instrument the sword
But now t is made taking the bread away
Which the good Father locks from none  And thou
That writes but to cancel think that they
Who for the vineyard which thou wastest died
Peter and Paul live yet and mark thy doings
Thou hast good cause to cry My heart so cleaves
To him that livd in solitude remote
And from the wilds was draggd to martyrdom
I wist not of the fisherman nor Paul




CANTO XIX

Before my sight appeard with open wings
The beauteous image in fruition sweet
Gladdening the thronged spirits  Each did seem
A little ruby whereon so intense
The sunbeam glowd that to mine eyes it came
In clear refraction  And that which next
Befalls me to portray voice hath not utterd
Nor hath ink written nor in fantasy
Was eer conceivd  For I beheld and heard
The beak discourse and what intention formd
Of many singly as of one express
Beginning For that I was just and piteous
l am exalted to this height of glory
The which no wish exceeds and there on earth
Have I my memory left een by the bad
Commended while they leave its course untrod

Thus is one heat from many embers felt
As in that image many were the loves
And one the voice that issued from them all
Whence I address them O perennial flowers
Of gladness everlasting that exhale
In single breath your odours manifold
Breathe now and let the hunger be appeasd
That with great craving long hath held my soul
Finding no food on earth  This well I know
That if there be in heavn a realm that shows
In faithful mirror the celestial Justice
Yours without veil reflects it  Ye discern
The heed wherewith I do prepare myself
To hearken ye the doubt that urges me
With such inveterate craving  Straight I saw
Like to a falcon issuing from the hood
That rears his head and claps him with his wings
His beauty and his eagerness bewraying
So saw I move that stately sign with praise
Of grace divine inwoven and high song
Of inexpressive joy  He it began
Who turnd his compass on the worlds extreme
And in that space so variously hath wrought
Both openly and in secret in such wise
Could not through all the universe display
Impression of his glory that the Word
Of his omniscience should not still remain
In infinite excess  In proof whereof
He first through pride supplanted who was sum
Of each created being waited not
For light celestial and abortive fell
Whence needs each lesser nature is but scant
Receptacle unto that Good which knows
No limit measurd by itself alone
Therefore your sight of th omnipresent Mind
A single beam its origin must own
Surpassing far its utmost potency
The ken your world is gifted with descends
In th everlasting Justice as low down
As eye doth in the sea which though it mark
The bottom from the shore in the wide main
Discerns it not and neertheless it is
But hidden through its deepness  Light is none
Save that which cometh from the pure serene
Of neer disturbed ether for the rest
Tis darkness all or shadow of the flesh
Or else its poison  Here confess reveald
That covert which hath hidden from thy search
The living justice of the which thou madst
Such frequent question for thou saidstA man
Is born on Indus banks and none is there
Who speaks of Christ nor who doth read nor write
And all his inclinations and his acts
As far as human reason sees are good
And he offendeth not in word or deed
But unbaptizd he dies and void of faith
Where is the justice that condemns him  where
His blame if he believeth notWhat then
And who art thou that on the stool wouldst sit
To judge at distance of a thousand miles
With the shortsighted vision of a span
To him who subtilizes thus with me
There would assuredly be room for doubt
Even to wonder did not the safe word
Of scripture hold supreme authority

O animals of clay  O spirits gross I
The primal will that in itself is good
Hath from itself the chief Good neer been movd
Justice consists in consonance with it
Derivable by no created good
Whose very cause depends upon its beam

As on her nest the stork that turns about
Unto her young whom lately she hath fed
While they with upward eyes do look on her
So lifted I my gaze and bending so
The everblessed image wavd its wings
Labring with such deep counsel  Wheeling round
It warbled and did say As are my notes
To thee who understandst them not such is
Th eternal judgment unto mortal ken

Then still abiding in that ensign rangd
Wherewith the Romans overawed the world
Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit
Took up the strain and thus it spake again
None ever hath ascended to this realm
Who hath not a believer been in Christ
Either before or after the blest limbs
Were naild upon the wood  But lo of those
Who call Christ Christ there shall be many found
 In judgment further off from him by far
Than such to whom his name was never known
Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn
When that the two assemblages shall part
One rich eternally the other poor

What may the Persians say unto your kings
When they shall see that volume in the which
All their dispraise is written spread to view
There amidst Alberts works shall that be read
Which will give speedy motion to the pen
When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm
There shall be read the woe that he doth work
With his adulterate money on the Seine
Who by the tusk will perish there be read
The thirsting pride that maketh fool alike
The English and Scot impatient of their bound
There shall be seen the Spaniards luxury
The delicate living there of the Bohemian
Who still to worth has been a willing stranger
The halter of Jerusalem shall see
A unit for his virtue for his vices
No less a mark than million  He who guards
The isle of fire by old Anchises honourd
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice
And better to denote his littleness
The writing must be letters maimd that speak
Much in a narrow space  All there shall know
His uncle and his brothers filthy doings
Who so renownd a nation and two crowns
Have bastardized  And they of Portugal
And Norway there shall be exposd with him
Of Ratza who hath counterfeited ill
The coin of Venice  O blest Hungary
If thou no longer patiently abidst
Thy illentreating and O blest Navarre
If with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm thee
In earnest of that day een now are heard
Wailings and groans in Famagostas streets
And Nicosias grudging at their beast
Who keepeth even footing with the rest




CANTO XX

When disappearing from our hemisphere
The worlds enlightener vanishes and day
On all sides wasteth suddenly the sky
Erewhile irradiate only with his beam
Is yet again unfolded putting forth
Innumerable lights wherein one shines
Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought
As the great sign that marshaleth the world
And the worlds leaders in the blessed beak
Was silent for that all those living lights
Waxing in splendour burst forth into songs
Such as from memory glide and fall away

Sweet love that dost apparel thee in smiles
How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles
Which merely are from holy thoughts inspird

After the precious and bright beaming stones
That did ingem the sixth light ceasd the chiming
Of their angelic bells methought I heard
The murmuring of a river that doth fall
From rock to rock transpicuous making known
The richness of his springhead and as sound
Of cistern at the fretboard or of pipe
Is at the windhole modulate and tund
Thus up the neck as it were hollow rose
That murmuring of the eagle and forthwith
Voice there assumd and thence along the beak
Issued in form of words such as my heart
Did look for on whose tables I inscribd them

The part in me that sees and bears the sun
In mortal eagles it began must now
Be noted steadfastly for of the fires
That figure me those glittering in mine eye
Are chief of all the greatest  This that shines
Midmost for pupil was the same who sang
The Holy Spirits song and bare about
The ark from town to town now doth he know
The merit of his soulimpassiond strains
By their wellfitted guerdon  Of the five
That make the circle of the vision he
Who to the beak is nearest comforted
The widow for her son now doth he know
How dear he costeth not to follow Christ
Both from experience of this pleasant life
And of its opposite  He next who follows
In the circumference for the over arch
By true repenting slackd the pace of death
Now knoweth he that the degrees of heavn
Alter not when through pious prayer below
Todays is made tomorrows destiny
The other following with the laws and me
To yield the shepherd room passd oer to Greece
From good intent producing evil fruit
Now knoweth he how all the ill derivd
From his well doing doth not helm him aught
Though it have brought destruction on the world
That which thou seest in the under bow
Was William whom that land bewails which weeps
For Charles and Frederick living now he knows
How well is lovd in heavn the righteous king
Which he betokens by his radiant seeming
Who in the erring world beneath would deem
That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set
Fifth of the saintly splendours  now he knows
Enough of that which the world cannot see
The grace divine albeit een his sight
Reach not its utmost depth  Like to the lark
That warbling in the air expatiates long
Then trilling out his last sweet melody
Drops satiate with the sweetness such appeard
That image stampt by the everlasting pleasure
Which fashions like itself all lovely things

I though my doubting were as manifest
As is through glass the hue that mantles it
In silence waited not for to my lips
What things are these  involuntary rushd
And forcd a passage out whereat I markd
A sudden lightening and new revelry
The eye was kindled and the blessed sign
No more to keep me wondring and suspense
Replied I see that thou believst these things
Because I tell them but discernst not how
So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith
As one who knows the name of thing by rote
But is a stranger to its properties
Till others tongue reveal them  Fervent love
And lively hope with violence assail
The kingdom of the heavens and overcome
The will of the Most high not in such sort
As man prevails oer man but conquers it
Because t is willing to be conquerd still
Though conquerd by its mercy conquering

Those in the eye who live the first and fifth
Cause thee to marvel in that thou beholdst
The region of the angels deckd with them
They quitted not their bodies as thou deemst
Gentiles but Christians in firm rooted faith
This of the feet in future to be piercd
That of feet naild already to the cross
One from the barrier of the dark abyss
Where never any with good will returns
Came back unto his bones  Of lively hope
Such was the meed of lively hope that wingd
The prayers sent up to God for his release
And put power into them to bend his will
The glorious Spirit of whom I speak to thee
A little while returning to the flesh
Believd in him who had the means to help
And in believing nourishd such a flame
Of holy love that at the second death
He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth
The other through the riches of that grace
Which from so deep a fountain doth distil
As never eye created saw its rising
Placd all his love below on just and right
Wherefore of grace God opd in him the eye
To the redemption of mankind to come
Wherein believing he endurd no more
The filth of paganism and for their ways
Rebukd the stubborn nations  The three nymphs
Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing
Were sponsors for him more than thousand years
Before baptizing  O how far removd
Predestination is thy root from such
As see not the First cause entire and ye
O mortal men be wary how ye judge
For we who see our Maker know not yet
The number of the chosen and esteem
Such scantiness of knowledge our delight
For all our good is in that primal good
Concentrate and Gods will and ours are one

So by that form divine was givn to me
Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight
And as one handling skillfully the harp
Attendant on some skilful songsters voice
Bids the chords vibrate and therein the song
Acquires more pleasure so the whilst it spake
It doth remember me that I beheld
The pair of blessed luminaries move
Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes
Their beamy circlets dancing to the sounds




CANTO XXI

Again mine eyes were fixd on Beatrice
And with mine eyes my soul that in her looks
Found all contentment  Yet no smile she wore
And Did I smile quoth she thou wouldst be straight
Like Semele when into ashes turnd
For mounting these eternal palacestairs
My beauty which the loftier it climbs
As thou hast noted still doth kindle more
So shines that were no tempring interposd
Thy mortal puissance would from its rays
Shrink as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt
Into the seventh splendour are we wafted
That underneath the burning lions breast
Beams in this hour commingled with his might
Thy mind be with thine eyes and in them mirrord
The shape which in this mirror shall be shown
Whoso can deem how fondly I had fed
My sight upon her blissful countenance
May know when to new thoughts I changd what joy
To do the bidding of my heavnly guide
In equal balance poising either weight

Within the crystal which records the name
As its remoter circle girds the world
Of that lovd monarch in whose happy reign
No ill had power to harm I saw reard up
In colour like to sunillumind gold

A ladder which my ken pursued in vain
So lofty was the summit down whose steps
I saw the splendours in such multitude
Descending evry light in heavn methought
Was shed thence  As the rooks at dawn of day
Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill
Some speed their way afield and homeward some
Returning cross their flight while some abide
And wheel around their airy lodge so seemd
That glitterance wafted on alternate wing
As upon certain stair it met and clashd
Its shining And one lingring near us waxd
So bright that in my thought said The love
Which this betokens me admits no doubt

Unwillingly from question I refrain
To her by whom my silence and my speech
Are orderd looking for a sign whence she
Who in the sight of Him that seeth all
Saw wherefore I was silent prompted me
T indulge the fervent wish and I began
I am not worthy of my own desert
That thou shouldst answer me but for her sake
Who hath vouchsafd my asking spirit blest
That in thy joy art shrouded say the cause
Which bringeth thee so near and wherefore say
Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise
Keep silence here pervading with such sounds
Of rapt devotion evry lower sphere
Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight
Was the reply and what forbade the smile
Of Beatrice interrupts our song
Only to yield thee gladness of my voice
And of the light that vests me I thus far
Descend these hallowd steps not that more love
Invites me for lo there aloft as much
Or more of love is witnessd in those flames
But such my lot by charity assignd
That makes us ready servants as thou seest
To execute the counsel of the Highest
That in this court said I O sacred lamp
Love no compulsion needs but follows free
Th eternal Providence I well discern
This harder find to deem why of thy peers
Thou only to this office wert foredoomd
I had not ended when like rapid mill
Upon its centre whirld the light and then
The love that did inhabit there replied
Splendour eternal piercing through these folds
Its virtue to my vision knits and thus
Supported lifts me so above myself
That on the sovran essence which it wells from
I have the power to gaze and hence the joy
Wherewith I sparkle equaling with my blaze
The keenness of my sight  But not the soul
That is in heavn most lustrous nor the seraph
That hath his eyes most fixd on God shall solve
What thou hast askd for in th abyss it lies
Of th everlasting statute sunk so low
That no created ken may fathom it
And to the mortal world when thou returnst
Be this reported that none henceforth dare
Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn
The mind that here is radiant on the earth
Is wrapt in mist  Look then if she may do
Below what passeth her ability
When she is taen to heavn  By words like these
Admonishd I the question urgd no more
And of the spirit humbly sued alone
T instruct me of its state  Twixt either shore
Of Italy nor distant from thy land
A stony ridge ariseth in such sort
The thunder doth not lift his voice so high
They call it Catria at whose foot a cell
Is sacred to the lonely Eremite
For worship set apart and holy rites
A third time thus it spake then added There
So firmly to Gods service I adherd
That with no costlier viands than the juice
Of olives easily I passd the heats
Of summer and the winter frosts content
In heavnward musings  Rich were the returns
And fertile which that cloister once was usd
To render to these heavens now t is falln
Into a waste so empty that ere long
Detection must lay bare its vanity
Pietro Damiano there was I yclept
Pietro the sinner when before I dwelt
Beside the Adriatic in the house
Of our blest Lady  Near upon my close
Of mortal life through much importuning
I was constraind to wear the hat that still
From bad to worse it shiftedCephas came
He came who was the Holy Spirits vessel
Barefoot and lean eating their bread as chancd
At the first table  Modern Shepherds need
Those who on either hand may prop and lead them
So burly are they grown and from behind
Others to hoist them  Down the palfreys sides
Spread their broad mantles so as both the beasts
Are coverd with one skin  O patience thou
That lookst on this and doth endure so long
I at those accents saw the splendours down
From step to step alight and wheel and wax
Each circuiting more beautiful  Round this
They came and stayd them uttered them a shout
So loud it hath no likeness here nor I
Wist what it spake so deafning was the thunder




CANTO XXII

Astounded to the guardian of my steps
I turnd me like the chill who always runs
Thither for succour where he trusteth most
And she was like the mother who her son
Beholding pale and breathless with her voice
Soothes him and he is cheerd for thus she spake
Soothing me Knowst not thou thou art in heavn
And knowst not thou whatever is in heavn
Is holy and that nothing there is done
But is done zealously and well  Deem now
What change in thee the song and what my smile
had wrought since thus the shout had powr to move thee
In which couldst thou have understood their prayers
The vengeance were already known to thee
Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour
The sword of heavn is not in haste to smite
Nor yet doth linger save unto his seeming
Who in desire or fear doth look for it
But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view
So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold
Mine eyes directing as she willd I saw
A hundred little spheres that fairer grew
By interchange of splendour  I remaind
As one who fearful of oermuch presuming
Abates in him the keenness of desire
Nor dares to question when amid those pearls
One largest and most lustrous onward drew
That it might yield contentment to my wish
And from within it these the sounds I heard

If thou like me beheldst the charity
That burns amongst us what thy mind conceives
Were utterd  But that ere the lofty bound
Thou reach expectance may not weary thee
I will make answer even to the thought
Which thou hast such respect of  In old days
That mountain at whose side Cassino rests
Was on its height frequented by a race
Deceived and ill disposd and I it was
Who thither carried first the name of Him
Who brought the soulsubliming truth to man
And such a speeding grace shone over me
That from their impious worship I reclaimd
The dwellers round about who with the world
Were in delusion lost  These other flames
The spirits of men contemplative were all
Enlivend by that warmth whose kindly force
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness
Here is Macarius Romoaldo here
And here my brethren who their steps refraind
Within the cloisters and held firm their heart

I answring thus Thy gentle words and kind
And this the cheerful semblance I behold
Not unobservant beaming in ye all
Have raisd assurance in me wakening it
Fullblossomd in my bosom as a rose
Before the sun when the consummate flower
Has spread to utmost amplitude  Of thee
Therefore entreat I father to declare
If I may gain such favour as to gaze
Upon thine image by no covering veild

Brother  he thus rejoind in the last sphere
Expect completion of thy lofty aim
For there on each desire completion waits
And there on mine where every aim is found
Perfect entire and for fulfillment ripe
There all things are as they have ever been
For space is none to bound nor pole divides
Our ladder reaches even to that clime
And so at giddy distance mocks thy view
Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch
Its topmost round when it appeard to him
With angels laden  But to mount it now
None lifts his foot from earth and hence my rule
Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves
The walls for abbey reard turned into dens
The cowls to sacks choakd up with musty meal
Foul usury doth not more lift itself
Against Gods pleasure than that fruit which makes
The hearts of monks so wanton for whateer
Is in the churchs keeping all pertains
To such as sue for heavns sweet sake and not
To those who in respect of kindred claim
Or on more vile allowance  Mortal flesh
Is grown so dainty good beginnings last not
From the oaks birth unto the acorns setting
His convent Peter founded without gold
Or silver I with prayrs and fasting mine
And Francis his in meek humility
And if thou note the point whence each proceeds
Then look what it hath errd to thou shalt find
The white grown murky  Jordan was turnd back
And a less wonder then the refluent sea
May at Gods pleasure work amendment here

So saying to his assembly back he drew
And they together clusterd into one
Then all rolld upward like an eddying wind

The sweet dame beckond me to follow them
And by that influence only so prevaild
Over my nature that no natural motion
Ascending or descending here below
Had as I mounted with my pennon vied

So reader as my hope is to return
Unto the holy triumph for the which
I ofttimes wail my sins and smite my breast
Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting
Thy finger in the fire than I was ere
The sign that followeth Taurus I beheld
And enterd its precinct  O glorious stars
O light impregnate with exceeding virtue
To whom whateer of genius lifteth me
Above the vulgar grateful I refer
With ye the parent of all mortal life
Arose and set when I did first inhale
The Tuscan air and afterward when grace
Vouchsafd me entrance to the lofty wheel
That in its orb impels ye fate decreed
My passage at your clime  To you my soul
Devoutly sighs for virtue even now
To meet the hard emprize that draws me on

Thou art so near the sum of blessedness
Said Beatrice that behooves thy ken
Be vigilant and clear  And to this end
Or even thou advance thee further hence
Look downward and contemplate what a world
Already stretched under our feet there lies
So as thy heart may in its blithest mood
Present itself to the triumphal throng
Which through the etherial concave comes rejoicing

I straight obeyd and with mine eye returnd
Through all the seven spheres and saw this globe
So pitiful of semblance that perforce
It moved my smiles and him in truth I hold
For wisest who esteems it least whose thoughts
Elsewhere are fixd him worthiest call and best
I saw the daughter of Latona shine
Without the shadow whereof late I deemd
That dense and rare were cause  Here I sustaind
The visage Hyperion of thy sun
And markd how near him with their circle round
Move Maia and Dione here discernd
Joves tempering twixt his sire and son and hence
Their changes and their various aspects
Distinctly scannd  Nor might I not descry
Of all the seven how bulky each how swift
Nor of their several distances not learn
This petty area oer the which we stride
So fiercely as along the eternal twins
I wound my way appeard before me all
Forth from the havens stretchd unto the hills
Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes returnd




CANTO XXIII

Een as the bird who midst the leafy bower
Has in her nest sat darkling through the night
With her sweet brood impatient to descry
Their wished looks and to bring home their food
In the fond quest unconscious of her toil
She of the time prevenient on the spray
That overhangs their couch with wakeful gaze
Expects the sun nor ever till the dawn
Removeth from the east her eager ken
So stood the dame erect and bent her glance
Wistfully on that region where the sun
Abateth most his speed that seeing her
Suspense and wandring I became as one
In whom desire is wakend and the hope
Of somewhat new to come fills with delight

Short space ensued I was not held I say
Long in expectance when I saw the heavn
Wax more and more resplendent and Behold
Cried Beatrice the triumphal hosts
Of Christ and all the harvest reapd at length
Of thy ascending up these spheres  Meseemd
That while she spake her image all did burn
And in her eyes such fullness was of joy
And I am fain to pass unconstrued by

As in the calm full moon when Trivia smiles
In peerless beauty mid th eternal nympus
That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound
In bright preeminence so saw I there
Oer million lamps a sun from whom all drew
Their radiance as from ours the starry train
And through the living light so lustrous glowd
The substance that my ken endurd it not

O Beatrice sweet and precious guide
Who cheerd me with her comfortable words
Against the virtue that oerpowreth thee
Avails not to resist  Here is the might
And here the wisdom which did open lay
The path that had been yearned for so long
Betwixt the heavn and earth  Like to the fire
That in a cloud imprisond doth break out
Expansive so that from its womb enlargd
It falleth against nature to the ground
Thus in that heavnly banqueting my soul
Outgrew herself and in the transport lost
Holds now remembrance none of what she was

Ope thou thine eyes and mark me thou hast seen
Things that empower thee to sustain my smile

I was as one when a forgotten dream
Doth come across him and he strives in vain
To shape it in his fantasy again
Whenas that gracious boon was profferd me
Which never may be canceld from the book
Wherein the past is written  Now were all
Those tongues to sound that have on sweetest milk
Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed
And fattend not with all their help to boot
Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth
My song might shadow forth that saintly smile
flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought
And with such figuring of Paradise
The sacred strain must leap like one that meets
A sudden interruption to his road
But he who thinks how ponderous the theme
And that t is lain upon a mortal shoulder
May pardon if it tremble with the burden
The track our ventrous keel must furrow brooks
No unribbd pinnace no selfsparing pilot

Why doth my face said Beatrice thus
Enamour thee as that thou dost not turn
Unto the beautiful garden blossoming
Beneath the rays of Christ  Here is the rose
Wherein the word divine was made incarnate
And here the lilies by whose odour known
The way of life was followd  Prompt I heard
Her bidding and encounter once again
The strife of aching vision  As erewhile
Through glance of sunlight streamd through broken cloud
Mine eyes a flowerbesprinkled mead have seen
Though veild themselves in shade so saw I there
Legions of splendours on whom burning rays
Shed lightnings from above yet saw I not
The fountain whence they flowd  O gracious virtue
Thou whose broad stamp is on them higher up
Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
To my oerlabourd sight when at the name
Of that fair flower whom duly I invoke
Both morn and eve my soul with all her might
Collected on the goodliest ardour fixd
And as the bright dimensions of the star
In heavn excelling as once here on earth
Were in my eyeballs lively portrayd
Lo from within the sky a cresset fell
Circling in fashion of a diadem
And girt the star and hovring round it wheeld

Whatever melody sounds sweetest here
And draws the spirit most unto itself
Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder
Compard unto the sounding of that lyre
Wherewith the goodliest sapphire that inlays
The floor of heavn was crownd Angelic Love
I am who thus with hovring flight enwheel
The lofty rapture from that womb inspird
Where our desire did dwell and round thee so
Lady of Heavn will hover long as thou
Thy Son shalt follow and diviner joy
Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere

Such close was to the circling melody
And as it ended all the other lights
Took up the strain and echoed Marys name

The robe that with its regal folds enwraps
The world and with the nearer breath of God
Doth burn and quiver held so far retird
Its inner hem and skirting over us
That yet no glimmer of its majesty
Had streamd unto me therefore were mine eyes
Unequal to pursue the crowned flame
That rose and sought its natal seed of fire
And like to babe that stretches forth its arms
For very eagerness towards the breast
After the milk is taken so outstretchd
Their wavy summits all the fervent band
Through zealous love to Mary then in view
There halted and Regina Coeli sang
So sweetly the delight hath left me never

O what oerflowing plenty is uppild
In those richladen coffers which below
Sowd the good seed whose harvest now they keep

Here are the treasures tasted that with tears
Were in the Babylonian exile won
When gold had faild them  Here in synod high
Of ancient council with the new convend
Under the Son of Mary and of God
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds
To whom the keys of glory were assignd




CANTO XXIV

O ye in chosen fellowship advancd
To the great supper of the blessed Lamb
Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfilld
If to this man through Gods grace be vouchsafd
Foretaste of that which from your table falls
Or ever death his fated term prescribe
Be ye not heedless of his urgent will
But may some influence of your sacred dews
Sprinkle him  Of the fount ye alway drink
Whence flows what most he craves  Beatrice spake
And the rejoicing spirits like to spheres
On firmset poles revolving traild a blaze
Of comet splendour and as wheels that wind
Their circles in the horologe so work
The stated rounds that to th observant eye
The first seems still and as it flew the last
Een thus their carols weaving variously
They by the measure pacd or swift or slow
Made me to rate the riches of their joy

From that which I did note in beauty most
Excelling saw I issue forth a flame
So bright as none was left more goodly there
Round Beatrice thrice it wheeld about
With so divine a song that fancys ear
Records it not and the pen passeth on
And leaves a blank for that our mortal speech
Nor een the inward shaping of the brain
Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds

O saintly sister mine thy prayer devout
Is with so vehement affection urgd
Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere

Such were the accents towards my lady breathd
From that blest ardour soon as it was stayd
To whom she thus O everlasting light
Of him within whose mighty grasp our Lord
Did leave the keys which of this wondrous bliss
He bare below tent this man as thou wilt
With lighter probe or deep touching the faith
By the which thou didst on the billows walk
If he in love in hope and in belief
Be steadfast is not hid from thee for thou
Hast there thy ken where all things are beheld
In liveliest portraiture  But since true faith
Has peopled this fair realm with citizens
Meet is that to exalt its glory more
Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse

Like to the bachelor who arms himself
And speaks not till the master have proposd
The question to approve and not to end it
So I in silence armd me while she spake
Summoning up each argument to aid
As was behooveful for such questioner
And such profession As good Christian ought
Declare thee What is faith  Whereat I raisd
My forehead to the light whence this had breathd
Then turnd to Beatrice and in her looks
Approval met that from their inmost fount
I should unlock the waters  May the grace
That giveth me the captain of the church
For confessor said I vouchsafe to me
Apt utterance for my thoughts then added Sire
Een as set down by the unerring style
Of thy dear brother who with thee conspird
To bring Rome in unto the way of life
Faith of things hopd is substance and the proof
Of things not seen and herein doth consist
Methinks its essenceRightly hast thou deemd
Was answerd if thou well discern why first
He hath defind it substance and then proof

The deep things I replied which here I scan
Distinctly are below from mortal eye
So hidden they have in belief alone
Their being on which credence hope sublime
Is built and therefore substance it intends
And inasmuch as we must needs infer
From such belief our reasoning all respect
To other view excluded hence of proof
Th intention is derivd  Forthwith I heard
If thus whateer by learning men attain
Were understood the sophist would want room
To exercise his wit  So breathd the flame
Of love then added Current is the coin
Thou utterst both in weight and in alloy
But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse

Even so glittering and so round said I
I not a whit misdoubt of its assay

Next issued from the deep imbosomd splendour
Say whence the costly jewel on the which
Is founded every virtue came to thee
The flood I answerd from the Spirit of God
Raind down upon the ancient bond and new
Here is the reasning that convinceth me
So feelingly each argument beside
Seems blunt and forceless in comparison
Then heard I Wherefore holdest thou that each
The elder proposition and the new
Which so persuade thee are the voice of heavn

The works that followd evidence their truth
I answerd Nature did not make for these
The iron hot or on her anvil mould them
Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves
Was the reply that they in very deed
Are that they purport  None hath sworn so to thee

That all the world said I should have been turnd
To Christian and no miracle been wrought
Would in itself be such a miracle
The rest were not an hundredth part so great
Een thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger
To set the goodly plant that from the vine
It once was now is grown unsightly bramble
That ended through the high celestial court
Resounded all the spheres  Praise we one God
In song of most unearthly melody
And when that Worthy thus from branch to branch
Examining had led me that we now
Approachd the topmost bough he straight resumd
The grace that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul
So far discreetly hath thy lips unclosd
That whatsoeer has past them I commend
Behooves thee to express what thou believst
The next and whereon thy belief hath grown

O saintly sire and spirit I began
Who seest that which thou didst so believe
As to outstrip feet younger than thine own
Toward the sepulchre  thy will is here
That I the tenour of my creed unfold
And thou the cause of it hast likewise askd
And I reply I in one God believe
One sole eternal Godhead of whose love
All heavn is movd himself unmovd the while
Nor demonstration physical alone
Or more intelligential and abstruse
Persuades me to this faith but from that truth
It cometh to me rather which is shed
Through Moses the rapt Prophets and the Psalms
The Gospel and that ye yourselves did write
When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost
In three eternal Persons I believe
Essence threefold and one mysterious league
Of union absolute which many a time
The word of gospel lore upon my mind
Imprints and from this germ this firstling spark
The lively flame dilates and like heavns star
Doth glitter in me  As the master hears
Well pleasd and then enfoldeth in his arms
The servant who hath joyful tidings brought
And having told the errand keeps his peace
Thus benediction uttering with song
Soon as my peace I held compassd me thrice
The apostolic radiance whose behest
Had opd lips so well their answer pleasd




CANTO XXV

If eer the sacred poem that hath made
Both heavn and earth copartners in its toil
And with lean abstinence through many a year
Faded my brow be destind to prevail
Over the cruelty which bars me forth
Of the fair sheepfold where a sleeping lamb
The wolves set on and fain had worried me
With other voice and fleece of other grain
I shall forthwith return and standing up
At my baptismal font shall claim the wreath
Due to the poets temples for I there
First enterd on the faith which maketh souls
Acceptable to God and for its sake
Peter had then circled my forehead thus

Next from the squadron whence had issued forth
The first fruit of Christs vicars on the earth
Toward us movd a light at view whereof
My Lady full of gladness spake to me
Lo lo behold the peer of mickle might
That makes Falicia throngd with visitants

As when the ringdove by his mate alights
In circles each about the other wheels
And murmuring cooes his fondness thus saw I
One of the other great and glorious prince
With kindly greeting haild extolling both
Their heavenly banqueting but when an end
Was to their gratulation silent each
Before me sat they down so burning bright
I could not look upon them  Smiling then
Beatrice spake O life in glory shrind
Who didst the largess of our kingly court
Set down with faithful pen let now thy voice
Of hope the praises in this height resound
For thou who figurst them in shapes as clear
As Jesus stood before thee well canst speak them

Lift up thy head and be thou strong in trust
For that which hither from the mortal world
Arriveth must be ripend in our beam

Such cheering accents from the second flame
Assurd me and mine eyes I lifted up
Unto the mountains that had bowd them late
With overheavy burden  Sith our Liege
Wills of his grace that thou or ere thy death
In the most secret council with his lords
Shouldst be confronted so that having viewd
The glories of our court thou mayst therewith
Thyself and all who hear invigorate
With hope that leads to blissful end declare
What is that hope how it doth flourish in thee
And whence thou hadst it  Thus proceeding still
The second light and she whose gentle love
My soaring pennons in that lofty flight
Escorted thus preventing me rejoind
Among her sons not one more full of hope
Hath the church militant so t is of him
Recorded in the sun whose liberal orb
Enlighteneth all our tribe and ere his term
Of warfare hence permitted he is come
From Egypt to Jerusalem to see
The other points both which thou hast inquird
Not for more knowledge but that he may tell
How dear thou holdst the virtue these to him
Leave I for he may answer thee with ease
And without boasting so God give him grace
Like to the scholar practisd in his task
Who willing to give proof of diligence
Seconds his teacher gladly Hope said I
Is of the joy to come a sure expectance
Th effect of grace divine and merit preceding
This light from many a star visits my heart
But flowd to me the first from him who sang
The songs of the Supreme himself supreme
Among his tuneful brethren  Let all hope
In thee so speak his anthem who have known
Thy name and with my faith who know not that
From thee the next distilling from his spring
In thine epistle fell on me the drops
So plenteously that I on others shower
The influence of their dew  Whileas I spake
A lamping as of quick and vollied lightning
Within the bosom of that mighty sheen
Playd tremulous then forth these accents breathd
Love for the virtue which attended me
Een to the palm and issuing from the field
Glows vigorous yet within me and inspires
To ask of thee whom also it delights
What promise thou from hope in chief dost win

Both scriptures new and ancient I replyd
Propose the mark which even now I view
For souls belovd of God Isaias saith
That in their own land each one must be clad
In twofold vesture and their proper lands this delicious life
In terms more full
And clearer far thy brother hath set forth
This revelation to us where he tells
Of the white raiment destind to the saints
And as the words were ending from above
They hope in thee first heard we cried whereto
Answerd the carols all  Amidst them next
A light of so clear amplitude emergd
That winters month were but a single day
Were such a crystal in the Cancers sign

Like as a virgin riseth up and goes
And enters on the mazes of the dance
Though gay yet innocent of worse intent
Than to do fitting honour to the bride
So I beheld the new effulgence come
Unto the other two who in a ring
Wheeld as became their rapture  In the dance
And in the song it mingled  And the dame
Held on them fixd her looks een as the spouse
Silent and moveless  This is he who lay
Upon the bosom of our pelican
This he into whose keeping from the cross
The mighty charge was given  Thus she spake
Yet therefore naught the more removd her Sight
From marking them or ere her words began
Or when they closd  As he who looks intent
And strives with searching ken how he may see
The sun in his eclipse and through desire
Of seeing loseth power of sight so I
Peerd on that last resplendence while I heard
Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that
Which here abides not  Earth my body is
In earth and shall be with the rest so long
As till our number equal the decree
Of the Most High  The two that have ascended
In this our blessed cloister shine alone
With the two garments  So report below

As when for ease of labour or to shun
Suspected peril at a whistles breath
The oars erewhile dashd frequent in the wave
All rest the flamy circle at that voice
So rested and the mingling sound was still
Which from the trinal band softbreathing rose
I turnd but ah how trembled in my thought
When looking at my side again to see
Beatrice I descried her not although
Not distant on the happy coast she stood




CANTO XXVI

With dazzled eyes whilst wondring I remaind
Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me
Issued a breath that in attention mute
Detaind me and these words it spake T were well
That long as till thy vision on my form
Oerspent regain its virtue with discourse
Thou compensate the brief delay  Say then
Beginning to what point thy soul aspires

And meanwhile rest assurd that sight in thee
Is but oerpowered a space not wholly quenchd
Since thy fair guide and lovely in her look
Hath potency the like to that which dwelt
In Ananias hand I answering thus
Be to mine eyes the remedy or late
Or early at her pleasure for they were
The gates at which she enterd and did light
Her never dying fire  My wishes here
Are centered in this palace is the weal
That Alpha and Omega is to all
The lessons love can read me  Yet again
The voice which had dispersd my fear when dazd
With that excess to converse urgd and spake
Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms
And say who leveld at this scope thy bow

Philosophy said I hath arguments
And this place hath authority enough
T imprint in me such love for of constraint
Good inasmuch as we perceive the good
Kindles our love and in degree the more
As it comprises more of goodness in t
The essence then where such advantage is
That each good found without it is naught else
But of his light the beam must needs attract
The soul of each one loving who the truth
Discerns on which this proof is built  Such truth
Learn I from him who shows me the first love
Of all intelligential substances
Eternal from his voice I learn whose word
Is truth that of himself to Moses saith
I will make all my good before thee pass
Lastly from thee I learn who chief proclaimst
Een at the outset of thy heralding
In mortal ears the mystery of heavn

Through human wisdom and th authority
Therewith agreeing heard I answerd keep
The choicest of thy love for God  But say
If thou yet other cords within thee feelst
That draw thee towards him so that thou report
How many are the fangs with which this love
Is grappled to thy soul  I did not miss
To what intent the eagle of our Lord
Had pointed his demand yea noted well
Th avowal which he led to and resumd
All grappling bonds that knit the heart to God
Confederate to make fast our clarity
The being of the world and mine own being
The death which he endurd that I should live
And that which all the faithful hope as I do
To the forementiond lively knowledge joind
Have from the sea of ill love savd my bark
And on the coast securd it of the right
As for the leaves that in the garden bloom
My love for them is great as is the good
Dealt by th eternal hand that tends them all

I ended and therewith a song most sweet
Rang through the spheres and Holy holy holy
Accordant with the rest my lady sang
And as a sleep is broken and dispersd
Through sharp encounter of the nimble light
With the eyes spirit running forth to meet
The ray from membrane on to the membrane urgd
And the upstartled wight loathes that he sees
So at his sudden waking he misdeems
Of all around him till assurance waits
On better judgment thus the saintly came
Drove from before mine eyes the motes away
With the resplendence of her own that cast
Their brightness downward thousand miles below
Whence I my vision clearer shall before
Recoverd and well nigh astounded askd
Of a fourth light that now with us I saw

And Beatrice The first diving soul
That ever the first virtue framd admires
Within these rays his Maker  Like the leaf
That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown
By its own virtue reard then stands aloof
So I the whilst she said awestricken bowd
Then eagerness to speak emboldend me
And I began O fruit that wast alone
Mature when first engenderd  Ancient father
That doubly seest in every wedded bride
Thy daughter by affinity and blood
Devoutly as I may I pray thee hold
Converse with me my will thou seest and I
More speedily to hear thee tell it not

It chanceth oft some animal bewrays
Through the sleek covring of his furry coat
The fondness that stirs in him and conforms
His outside seeming to the cheer within
And in like guise was Adams spirit movd
To joyous mood that through the covering shone
Transparent when to pleasure me it spake
No need thy will be told which I untold
Better discern than thou whatever thing
Thou holdst most certain for that will I see
In Him who is truths mirror and Himself
Parhelion unto all things and naught else
To him  This wouldst thou hear how long since God
Placd me high garden from whose hounds
She led me up in this ladder steep and long
What space endurd my season of delight
Whence truly sprang the wrath that banishd me
And what the language which I spake and framd
Not that I tasted of the tree my son
Was in itself the cause of that exile
But only my transgressing of the mark
Assignd me  There whence at thy ladys hest
The Mantuan movd him still was I debarrd
This council till the sun had made complete
Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice
His annual journey and through every light
In his broad pathway saw I him return
Thousand save sevnty times the whilst I dwelt
Upon the earth  The language I did use
Was worn away or ever Nimrods race
Their unaccomplishable work began
For naught that man inclines to ere was lasting
Left by his reason free and variable
As is the sky that sways him  That he speaks
Is natures prompting whether thus or thus
She leaves to you as ye do most affect it
Ere I descended into hells abyss
El was the name on earth of the Chief Good
Whose joy enfolds me Eli then t was calld
And so beseemeth for in mortals use
Is as the leaf upon the bough that goes
And other comes instead  Upon the mount
Most high above the waters all my life
Both innocent and guilty did but reach
From the first hour to that which cometh next
As the sun changes quarter to the sixth




CANTO XXVII

Then  Glory to the Father to the Son
And to the Holy Spirit rang aloud
Throughout all Paradise that with the song
My spirit reeld so passing sweet the strain
And what I saw was equal ecstasy
One universal smile it seemd of all things
Joy past compare gladness unutterable
Imperishable life of peace and love
Exhaustless riches and unmeasurd bliss

Before mine eyes stood the four torches lit
And that which first had come began to wax
In brightness and in semblance such became
As Jove might be if he and Mars were birds
And interchangd their plumes  Silence ensued
Through the blest quire by Him who here appoints
Vicissitude of ministry enjoind
When thus I heard Wonder not if my hue
Be changd for while I speak these shalt thou see
All in like manner change with me  My place
He who usurps on earth my place ay mine
Which in the presence of the Son of God
Is void the same hath made my cemetery
A common sewer of puddle and of blood
The more below his triumph who from hence
Malignant fell  Such colour as the sun
At eve or morning paints an adverse cloud
Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky
And as th unblemishd dame who in herself
Secure of censure yet at bare report
Of others failing shrinks with maiden fear
So Beatrice in her semblance changd
And such eclipse in heavn methinks was seen
When the Most Holy sufferd  Then the words
Proceeded with voice alterd from itself
So clean the semblance did not alter more
Not to this end was Christs spouse with my blood
With that of Linus and of Cletus fed
That she might serve for purchase of base gold
But for the purchase of this happy life
Did Sextus Pius and Callixtus bleed
And Urban they whose doom was not without
Much weeping seald  No purpose was of our
That on the right hand of our successors
Part of the Christian people should be set
And part upon their left nor that the keys
Which were vouchsafd me should for ensign serve
Unto the banners that do levy war
On the baptizd nor I for sigilmark
Set upon sold and lying privileges
Which makes me oft to bicker and turn red
In shepherds clothing greedy wolves below
Range wide oer all the pastures  Arm of God
Why longer sleepst thou  Caorsines and Gascona
Prepare to quaff our blood  O good beginning
To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop
But the high providence which did defend
Through Scipio the worlds glory unto Rome
Will not delay its succour and thou son
Who through thy mortal weight shall yet again
Return below open thy lips nor hide
What is by me not hidden  As a Hood
Of frozen vapours streams adown the air
What time the shegoat with her skiey horn
Touches the sun so saw I there stream wide
The vapours who with us had lingerd late
And with glad triumph deck th ethereal cope
Onward my sight their semblances pursued
So far pursued as till the space between
From its reach severd them whereat the guide
Celestial marking me no more intent
On upward gazing said Look down and see
What circuit thou hast compassd  From the hour
When I before had cast my view beneath
All the first region overpast I saw
Which from the midmost to the boundry winds
That onward thence from Gades I beheld
The unwise passage of Laertes son
And hitherward the shore where thou Europa
Madst thee a joyful burden and yet more
Of this dim spot had seen but that the sun
A constellation off and more had taen
His progress in the zodiac underneath

Then by the spirit that doth never leave
Its amorous dalliance with my ladys looks
Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes
Led unto her and from her radiant smiles
Whenas I turnd me pleasure so divine
Did lighten on me that whatever bait
Or art or nature in the human flesh
Or in its limnd resemblance can combine
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal
Were to her beauty nothing  Its boon influence
From the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth
And wafted on into the swiftest heavn

What place for entrance Beatrice chose
I may not say so uniform was all
Liveliest and loftiest  She my secret wish
Divind and with such gladness that Gods love
Seemd from her visage shining thus began
Here is the goal whence motion on his race
Starts motionless the centre and the rest
All movd around  Except the soul divine
Place in this heavn is none the soul divine
Wherein the love which ruleth oer its orb
Is kindled and the virtue that it sheds
One circle light and love enclasping it
As this doth clasp the others and to Him
Who draws the bound its limit only known
Measurd itself by none it doth divide
Motion to all counted unto them forth
As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten
The vase wherein times roots are plungd thou seest
Look elsewhere for the leaves  O mortal lust
That canst not lift thy head above the waves
Which whelm and sink thee down  The will in man
Bears goodly blossoms but its ruddy promise
Is by the dripping of perpetual rain
Made mere abortion faith and innocence
Are met with but in babes each taking leave
Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled he that fasts
While yet a stammerer with his tongue let loose
Gluts every food alike in every moon
One yet a babbler loves and listens to
His mother but no sooner hath free use
Of speech than he doth wish her in her grave
So suddenly doth the fair child of him
Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting
To negro blackness change her virgin white

Thou to abate thy wonder note that none
Bears rule in earth and its frail family
Are therefore wandrers  Yet before the date
When through the hundredth in his reckning drops
Pale January must be shord aside
From winters calendar these heavnly spheres
Shall roar so loud that fortune shall be fain
To turn the poop where she hath now the prow
So that the fleet run onward and true fruit
Expected long shall crown at last the bloom




CANTO XXVII

So she who doth imparadise my soul
Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life
And bard the truth of poor mortality
When lo as one who in a mirror spies
The shining of a flambeau at his back
Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach
And turneth to resolve him if the glass
Have told him true and sees the record faithful
As note is to its metre even thus
I well remember did befall to me
Looking upon the beauteous eyes whence love
Had made the leash to take me  As I turnd
And that which in their circles none who spies
Can miss of in itself apparent struck
On mine a point I saw that darted light
So sharp no lid unclosing may bear up
Against its keenness  The least star we view
From hence had seemd a moon set by its side
As star by side of star  And so far off
Perchance as is the halo from the light
Which paints it when most dense the vapour spreads
There wheeld about the point a circle of fire
More rapid than the motion which first girds
The world  Then circle after circle round
Enringd each other till the seventh reachd
Circumference so ample that its bow
Within the span of Junos messenger
lied scarce been held entire Beyond the sevnth
Followd yet other two  And every one
As more in number distant from the first
Was tardier in motion and that glowd
With flame most pure that to the sparkle of truth
Was nearest as partaking most methinks
Of its reality  The guide belovd
Saw me in anxious thought suspense and spake
Heavn and all nature hangs upon that point
The circle thereto most conjoind observe
And know that by intenser love its course
Is to this swiftness wingd  To whom I thus
It were enough nor should I further seek
Had I but witnessd order in the world
Appointed such as in these wheels is seen
But in the sensible world such diffrence is
That is each round shows more divinity
As each is wider from the centre  Hence
If in this wondrous and angelic temple
That hath for confine only light and love
My wish may have completion I must know
Wherefore such disagreement is between
Th exemplar and its copy for myself
Contemplating I fail to pierce the cause

It is no marvel if thy fingers foild
Do leave the knot untied so hard t is grown
For want of tenting  Thus she said But take
She added if thou wish thy cure my words
And entertain them subtly  Every orb
Corporeal doth proportion its extent
Unto the virtue through its parts diffusd
The greater blessedness preserves the more
The greater is the body if all parts
Share equally the more is to preserve
Therefore the circle whose swift course enwheels
The universal frame answers to that
Which is supreme in knowledge and in love
Thus by the virtue not the seeming breadth
Of substance measure thou shalt see the heavns
Each to the intelligence that ruleth it
Greater to more and smaller unto less
Suited in strict and wondrous harmony

As when the sturdy north blows from his cheek
A blast that scours the sky forthwith our air
Cleard of the rack that hung on it before
Glitters and With his beauties all unveild
The firmament looks forth serene and smiles
Such was my cheer when Beatrice drove
With clear reply the shadows back and truth
Was manifested as a star in heaven
And when the words were ended not unlike
To iron in the furnace every cirque
Ebullient shot forth scintillating fires
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze
In number did outmillion the account
Reduplicate upon the chequerd board
Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir
Hosanna to the fixed point that holds
And shall for ever hold them to their place
From everlasting irremovable

Musing awhile I stood and she who saw
by inward meditations thus began
In the first circles they whom thou beheldst
Are seraphim and cherubim  Thus swift
Follow their hoops in likeness to the point
Near as they can approaching and they can
The more the loftier their vision  Those
That round them fleet gazing the Godhead next
Are thrones in whom the first trine ends  And all
Are blessed even as their sight descends
Deeper into the truth wherein rest is
For every mind  Thus happiness hath root
In seeing not in  loving which of sight
Is aftergrowth  And of the seeing such
The meed as unto each in due degree
Grace and goodwill their measure have assignd
The other trine that with still opening buds
In this eternal springtide blossom fair
Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram
Breathe up in warbled melodies threefold
Hosannas blending ever from the three
Transmitted hierarchy of gods for aye
Rejoicing dominations first next then
Virtues and powers the third  The next to whom
Are princedoms and archangels with glad round
To tread their festal ring and last the band
Angelical disporting in their sphere
All as they circle in their orders look
Aloft and downward with such sway prevail
That all with mutual impulse tend to God
These once a mortal view beheld  Desire
In Dionysius so intently wrought
That he as I have done rangd them and namd
Their orders marshald in his thought  From him
Dissentient one refusd his sacred read
But soon as in this heavn his doubting eyes
Were opend Gregory at his error smild
Nor marvel that a denizen of earth
Should scan such secret truth for he had learnt
Both this and much beside of these our orbs
From an eyewitness to heavns mysteries




CANTO XXIX

No longer than what time Latonas twins
Coverd of Libra and the fleecy star
Together both girding the horizon hang
In even balance from the zenith poisd
Till from that verge each changing hemisphere
Part the nice level een so brief a space
Did Beatrices silence hold  A smile
Bat painted on her cheek and her fixd gaze
Bent on the point at which my vision faild
When thus her words resuming she began
I speak nor what thou wouldst inquire demand
For I have markd it where all time and place
Are present  Not for increase to himself
Of good which may not be increasd but forth
To manifest his glory by its beams
Inhabiting his own eternity
Beyond times limit or what bound soeer
To circumscribe his being as he willd
Into new natures like unto himself
Eternal Love unfolded  Nor before
As if in dull inaction torpid lay
For not in process of before or aft
Upon these waters movd the Spirit of God
Simple and mixd both form and substance forth
To perfect being started like three darts
Shot from a bow threecorded  And as ray
In crystal glass and amber shines entire
Een at the moment of its issuing thus
Did from th eternal Sovran beam entire
His threefold operation at one act
Producd coeval  Yet in order each
Created his due station knew those highest
Who pure intelligence were made mere power
The lowest in the midst bound with strict league
Intelligence and power unseverd bond
Long tract of ages by the angels past
Ere the creating of another world
Describd on Jeromes pages thou hast seen
But that what I disclose to thee is true
Those penmen whom the Holy Spirit movd
In many a passage of their sacred book
Attest as thou by diligent search shalt find
And reason in some sort discerns the same
Who scarce would grant the heavnly ministers
Of their perfection void so long a space
Thus when and where these spirits of love were made
Thou knowst and how and knowing hast allayd
Thy thirst which from the triple question rose
Ere one had reckond twenty een so soon
Part of the angels fell and in their fall
Confusion to your elements ensued
The others kept their station and this task
Whereon thou lookst began with such delight
That they surcease not ever day nor night
Their circling  Of that fatal lapse the cause
Was the curst pride of him whom thou hast seen
Pent with the worlds incumbrance  Those whom here
Thou seest were lowly to confess themselves
Of his free bounty who had made them apt
For ministries so high therefore their views
Were by enlightning grace and their own merit
Exalted so that in their will confirmd
They stand nor feel to fall  For do not doubt
But to receive the grace which heavn vouchsafes
Is meritorious even as the soul
With prompt affection welcometh the guest
Now without further help if with good heed
My words thy mind have treasurd thou henceforth
This consistory round about mayst scan
And gaze thy fill  But since thou hast on earth
Heard vain disputers reasoners in the schools
Canvas the angelic nature and dispute
Its powers of apprehension memory choice
Therefore t is well thou take from me the truth
Pure and without disguise which they below
Equivocating darken and perplex

Know thou that from the first these substances
Rejoicing in the countenance of God
Have held unceasingly their view intent
Upon the glorious vision from the which
Naught absent is nor hid where then no change
Of newness with succession interrupts
Remembrance there needs none to gather up
Divided thought and images remote

So that men thus at variance with the truth
Dream though their eyes be open reckless some
Of error others well aware they err
To whom more guilt and shame are justly due
Each the known track of sage philosophy
Deserts and has a byway of his own
So much the restless eagerness to shine
And love of singularity prevail
Yet this offensive as it is provokes
Heavns anger less than when the book of God
Is forcd to yield to mans authority
Or from its straightness warpd no reckning made
What blood the sowing of it in the world
Has cost what favour for himself he wins
Who meekly clings to it  The aim of all
Is how to shine een they whose office is
To preach the Gospel let the gospel sleep
And pass their own inventions off instead
One tells how at Christs suffering the wan moon
Bent back her steps and shadowd oer the sun
With intervenient disk as she withdrew
Another how the light shrouded itself
Within its tabernacle and left dark
The Spaniard and the Indian with the Jew
Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears
Bandied about more frequent than the names
Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets
The sheep meanwhile poor witless ones return
From pasture fed with wind and what avails
For their excuse they do not see their harm
Christ said not to his first conventicle
Go forth and preach impostures to the world
But gave them truth to build on and the sound
Was mighty on their lips nor needed they
Beside the gospel other spear or shield
To aid them in their warfare for the faith
The preacher now provides himself with store
Of jests and gibes and so there be no lack
Of laughter while he vents them his big cowl
Distends and he has won the meed he sought
Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while
Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood
They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said
Which now the dotards hold in such esteem
That every counterfeit who spreads abroad
The hands of holy promise finds a throng
Of credulous fools beneath  Saint Anthony
Fattens with this his swine and others worse
Than swine who diet at his lazy board
Paying with unstampd metal for their fare

But for we far have wanderd let us seek
The forward path again so as the way
Be shortend with the time  No mortal tongue
Nor thought of man hath ever reachd so far
That of these natures he might count the tribes
What Daniel of their thousands hath reveald
With finite number infinite conceals
The fountain at whose source these drink their beams
With light supplies them in as many modes
As there are splendours that it shines on each
According to the virtue it conceives
Differing in love and sweet affection
Look then how lofty and how huge in breadth
The eternal might which broken and dispersd
Over such countless mirrors yet remains
Whole in itself and one as at the first




CANTO XXX

Noons fervid hour perchance six thousand miles
From hence is distant and the shadowy cone
Almost to level on our earth declines
When from the midmost of this blue abyss
By turns some star is to our vision lost
And straightway as the handmaid of the sun
Puts forth her radiant brow all light by light
Fade and the spangled firmament shuts in
Een to the loveliest of the glittering throng
Thus vanishd gradually from my sight
The triumph which plays ever round the point
That overcame me seeming for it did
Engirt by that it girdeth  Wherefore love
With loss of other object forcd me bend
Mine eyes on Beatrice once again

If all that hitherto is told of her
Were in one praise concluded t were too weak
To furnish out this turn  Mine eyes did look
On beauty such as I believe in sooth
Not merely to exceed our human but
That save its Maker none can to the full
Enjoy it  At this point oerpowerd I fail
Unequal to my theme as never bard
Of buskin or of sock hath faild before
For as the sun doth to the feeblest sight
Een so remembrance of that witching smile
Hath dispossess my spirit of itself
Not from that day when on this earth I first
Beheld her charms up to that view of them
Have I with song applausive ever ceasd
To follow but not follow them no more
My course here bounded as each artists is
When it doth touch the limit of his skill

She such as I bequeath her to the bruit
Of louder trump than mine which hasteneth on
Urging its arduous matter to the close
Her words resumd in gesture and in voice
Resembling one accustomd to command
Forth from the last corporeal are we come
Into the heavn that is unbodied light
Light intellectual replete with love
Love of true happiness replete with joy
Joy that transcends all sweetness of delight
Here shalt thou look on either mighty host
Of Paradise and one in that array
Which in the final judgment thou shalt see

As when the lightning in a sudden spleen
Unfolded dashes from the blinding eyes
The visive spirits dazzled and bedimmd
So round about me fulminating streams
Of living radiance playd and left me swathd
And veild in dense impenetrable blaze
Such weal is in the love that stills this heavn
For its own flame the torch this fitting ever

No sooner to my listning ear had come
The brief assurance than I understood
New virtue into me infusd and sight
Kindled afresh with vigour to sustain
Excess of light however pure  I lookd
And in the likeness of a river saw
Light flowing from whose amberseeming waves
Flashd up effulgence as they glided on
Twixt banks on either side painted with spring
Incredible how fair and from the tide
There ever and anon outstarting flew
Sparkles instinct with life and in the flowrs
Did set them like to rubies chasd in gold
Then as if drunk with odors plungd again
Into the wondrous flood from which as one
Reenterd still another rose  The thirst
Of knowledge high whereby thou art inflamd
To search the meaning of what here thou seest
The more it warms thee pleases me the more
But first behooves thee of this water drink
Or ere that longing be allayd  So spake
The daystar of mine eyes then thus subjoind
This stream and these forth issuing from its gulf
And diving back a living topaz each
With all this laughter on its bloomy shores
Are but a preface shadowy of the truth
They emblem not that in themselves the things
Are crude but on thy part is the defect
For that thy views not yet aspire so high
Never did babe that had outslept his wont
Rush with such eager straining to the milk
As I toward the water bending me
To make the better mirrors of mine eyes
In the refining wave and as the eaves
Of mine eyelids did drink of it forthwith
Seemd it unto me turnd from length to round
Then as a troop of maskers when they put
Their vizors off look other than before
The counterfeited semblance thrown aside
So into greater jubilee were changd
Those flowers and sparkles and distinct I saw
Before me either court of heavn displacd

O prime enlightener thou who cravst me strength
On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze
Grant virtue now to utter what I kennd
    There is in heavn a light whose goodly shine
Makes the Creator visible to all
Created that in seeing him alone
Have peace and in a circle spreads so far
That the circumference were too loose a zone
To girdle in the sun  All is one beam
Reflected from the summit of the first
That moves which being hence and vigour takes
And as some cliff that from the bottom eyes
Its image mirrord in the crystal flood
As if t admire its brave appareling
Of verdure and of flowers so round about
Eyeing the light on more than million thrones
Stood eminent whatever from our earth
Has to the skies returnd  How wide the leaves
Extended to their utmost of this rose
Whose lowest step embosoms such a space
Of ample radiance  Yet nor amplitude
Nor height impeded but my view with ease
Took in the full dimensions of that joy
Near or remote what there avails where God
Immediate rules and Nature awed suspends
Her sway  Into the yellow of the rose
Perennial which in bright expansiveness
Lays forth its gradual blooming redolent
Of praises to the neverwintring sun
As one who fain would speak yet holds his peace
Beatrice led me and Behold she said
This fair assemblage stoles of snowy white
How numberless  The city where we dwell
Behold how vast and these our seats so throngd
Few now are wanting here  In that proud stall
On which the crown already oer its state
Suspended holds thine eyesor ere thyself
Mayst at the wedding supshall rest the soul
Of the great Harry he who by the world
Augustas haild to Italy must come
Before her day be ripe  But ye are sick
And in your tetchy wantonness as blind
As is the bantling that of hunger dies
And drives away the nurse  Nor may it be
That he who in the sacred forum sways
Openly or in secret shall with him
Accordant walk Whom God will not endure
I th holy office long but thrust him down
To Simon Magus where Magnas priest
Will sink beneath him such will be his meed




CANTO XXXI

In fashion as a snowwhite rose lay then
Before my view the saintly multitude
Which in his own blood Christ espousd  Meanwhile
That other host that soar aloft to gaze
And celebrate his glory whom they love
Hoverd around and like a troop of bees
Amid the vernal sweets alighting now
Now clustering where their fragrant labour glows
Flew downward to the mighty flowr or rose
From the redundant petals streaming back
Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy
Faces had they of flame and wings of gold
The rest was whiter than the driven snow
And as they flitted down into the flower
From range to range fanning their plumy loins
Whisperd the peace and ardour which they won
From that soft winnowing  Shadow none the vast
Interposition of such numerous flight
Cast from above upon the flower or view
Obstructed aught  For through the universe
Wherever merited celestial light
Glides freely and no obstacle prevents

All there who reign in safety and in bliss
Ages long past or new on one sole mark
Their love and vision fixd  O trinal beam
Of individual star that charmst them thus
Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below

If the grim brood from Arctic shores that roamd
Where helice forever as she wheels
Sparkles a mothers fondness on her son
Stood in mute wonder mid the works of Rome
When to their view the Lateran arose
In greatness more than earthly I who then
From human to divine had past from time
Unto eternity and out of Florence
To justice and to truth how might I choose
But marvel too  Twixt gladness and amaze
In sooth no will had I to utter aught
Or hear  And as a pilgrim when he rests
Within the temple of his vow looks round
In breathless awe and hopes some time to tell
Of all its goodly state een so mine eyes
Coursd up and down along the living light
Now low and now aloft and now around
Visiting every step  Looks I beheld
Where charity in soft persuasion sat
Smiles from within and radiance from above
And in each gesture grace and honour high

So rovd my ken and its general form
All Paradise surveyd when round I turnd
With purpose of my lady to inquire
Once more of things that held my thought suspense
But answer found from other than I weend
For Beatrice when I thought to see
I saw instead a senior at my side
 Robd as the rest in glory  Joy benign
Glowd in his eye and oer his cheek diffusd
With gestures such as spake a fathers love
And Whither is she vanishd  straight I askd

By Beatrice summond he replied
I come to aid thy wish  Looking aloft
To the third circle from the highest there
Behold her on the throne wherein her merit
Hath placd her  Answering not mine eyes I raisd
And saw her where aloof she sat her brow
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams
Not from the centre of the sea so far
Unto the region of the highest thunder
As was my ken from hers and yet the form
Came through that medium down unmixd and pure

O Lady thou in whom my hopes have rest
Who for my safety hast not scornd in hell
To leave the traces of thy footsteps markd
For all mine eyes have seen I to thy power
And goodness virtue owe and grace  Of slave
Thou hast to freedom brought me and no means
For my deliverance apt hast left untried
Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep
That when my spirit which thou madest whole
Is loosend from this body it may find
Favour with thee  So I my suit preferrd
And she so distant as appeard lookd down
And smild then towrds th eternal fountain turnd

And thus the senior holy and reverd
That thou at length mayst happily conclude
Thy voyage to which end I was dispatchd
By supplication movd and holy love
Let thy upsoaring vision range at large
This garden through for so by ray divine
Kindled thy ken a higher flight shall mount
And from heavns queen whom fervent I adore
All gracious aid befriend us for that I
Am her own faithful Bernard  Like a wight
Who haply from Croatia wends to see
Our Veronica and the while t is shown
Hangs over it with neversated gaze
And all that he hath heard revolving saith
Unto himself in thought And didst thou look
Een thus O Jesus my true Lord and God
And was this semblance thine  So gazd I then
Adoring for the charity of him
Who musing in the world that peace enjoyd
Stood lively before me  Child of grace
Thus he began thou shalt not knowledge gain
Of this glad being if thine eyes are held
Still in this depth below  But search around
The circles to the furthest till thou spy
Seated in state the queen that of this realm
Is sovran  Straight mine eyes I raisd and bright
As at the birth of morn the eastern clime
Above th horizon where the sun declines
To mine eyes that upward as from vale
To mountain sped at th extreme bound a part
Excelld in lustre all the front opposd
And as the glow burns ruddiest oer the wave
That waits the sloping beam which Phaeton
Ill knew to guide and on each part the light
Diminishd fades intensest in the midst
So burnd the peaceful oriflame and slackd
On every side the living flame decayd
And in that midst their sportive pennons wavd
Thousands of angels in resplendence each
Distinct and quaint adornment At their glee
And carol smild the Lovely One of heavn
That joy was in the eyes of all the blest

Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich
As is the colouring in fancys loom
T were all too poor to utter the least part
Of that enchantment  When he saw mine eyes
Intent on her that charmd him Bernard gazd
With so exceeding fondness as infusd
Ardour into my breast unfelt before




CANTO XXXII

Freely the sage though wrapt in musings high
Assumd the teachers part and mild began
The wound that Mary closd she opend first
Who sits so beautiful at Marys feet
The third in order underneath her lo
Rachel with Beatrice Sarah next
Judith Rebecca and the gleaner maid
Meek ancestress of him who sang the songs
Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood
All as I name them down from deaf to leaf
Are in gradation throned on the rose
And from the seventh step successively
Adown the breathing tresses of the flowr
Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed
For these are a partition wall whereby
The sacred stairs are severd as the faith
In Christ divides them  On this part where blooms
Each leaf in full maturity are set
Such as in Christ or ere he came believd
On th other where an intersected space
Yet shows the semicircle void abide
All they who lookd to Christ already come
And as our Lady on her glorious stool
And they who on their stools beneath her sit
This way distinction make een so on his
The mighty Baptist that way marks the line
He who endurd the desert and the pains
Of martyrdom and for two years of hell
Yet still continued holy and beneath
Augustin Francis Benedict and the rest
Thus far from round to round  So heavns decree
Forecasts this garden equally to fill
With faith in either view past or to come
Learn too that downward from the step which cleaves
Midway the twain compartments none there are
Who place obtain for merit of their own
But have through others merit been advancd
On set conditions spirits all releasd
Ere for themselves they had the power to choose
And if thou mark and listen to them well
Their childish looks and voice declare as much

Here silent as thou art I know thy doubt
And gladly will I loose the knot wherein
Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee  From this realm
Excluded chalice no entrance here may find
No more shall hunger thirst or sorrow can
A law immutable hath establishd all
Nor is there aught thou seest that doth not fit
Exactly as the finger to the ring
It is not therefore without cause that these
Oerspeedy comers to immortal life
Are different in their shares of excellence
Our Sovran Lordthat settleth this estate
In love and in delight so absolute
That wish can dare no furtherevery soul
Created in his joyous sight to dwell
With grace at pleasure variously endows
And for a proof th effect may well suffice
And t is moreover most expressly markd
In holy scripture where the twins are said
To have struggled in the womb  Therefore as grace
Inweaves the coronet so every brow
Weareth its proper hue of orient light
And merely in respect to his prime gift
Not in reward of meritorious deed
Hath each his several degree assignd
In early times with their own innocence
More was not wanting than the parents faith
To save them those first ages past behoovd
That circumcision in the males should imp
The flight of innocent wings but since the day
Of grace hath come without baptismal rites
In Christ accomplishd innocence herself
Must linger yet below  Now raise thy view
Unto the visage most resembling Christ
For in her splendour only shalt thou win
The powr to look on him  Forthwith I saw
Such floods of gladness on her visage showerd
From holy spirits winging that profound
That whatsoever I had yet beheld
Had not so much suspended me with wonder
Or shown me such similitude of God
And he who had to her descended once
On earth now haild in heavn and on poisd wing
Ave Maria Gratia Plena sang
To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court
From all parts answring rang that holier joy
Brooded the deep serene  Father reverd
Who deignst for me to quit the pleasant place
Wherein thou sittest by eternal lot
Say who that angel is that with such glee
Beholds our queen and so enamourd glows
Of her high beauty that all fire he seems
So I again resorted to the lore
Of my wise teacher he whom Marys charms
Embellishd as the sun the morning star
Who thus in answer spake In him are summd
Whatever of buxomness and free delight
May be in Spirit or in angel met
And so beseems for that he bare the palm
Down unto Mary when the Son of God
Vouchsafd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds
Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words
And note thou of this just and pious realm
The chiefest nobles  Those highest in bliss
The twain on each hand next our empress thrond
Are as it were two roots unto this rose
He to the left the parent whose rash taste
Proves bitter to his seed and on the right
That ancient father of the holy church
Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys
Of this sweet flowr near whom behold the seer
That ere he died saw all the grievous times
Of the fair bride who with the lance and nails
Was won  And near unto the other rests
The leader under whom on manna fed
Th ungrateful nation fickle and perverse
On th other part facing to Peter lo
Where Anna sits so well content to look
On her lovd daughter that with moveless eye
She chants the loud hosanna while opposd
To the first father of your mortal kind
Is Lucia at whose hest thy lady sped
When on the edge of ruin closd thine eye

But for the vision hasteneth so an end
Here break we off as the good workman doth
That shapes the cloak according to the cloth
And to the primal love our ken shall rise
That thou mayst penetrate the brightness far
As sight can bear thee  Yet alas in sooth
Beating thy pennons thinking to advance
Thou backward fallst  Grace then must first be gaind
Her grace whose might can help thee  Thou in prayer
Seek her and with affection whilst I sue
Attend and yield me all thy heart  He said
And thus the saintly orison began




CANTO XXXIII

O virgin mother daughter of thy Son
Created beings all in lowliness
Surpassing as in height above them all
Term by th eternal counsel preordaind
Ennobler of thy nature so advancd
In thee that its great Maker did not scorn
Himself in his own work enclosd to dwell
For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
Reveald whose genial influence makes now
This flower to germin in eternal peace
Here thou to us of charity and love
Art as the noonday torch and art beneath
To mortal men of hope a living spring
So mighty art thou lady and so great
That he who grace desireth and comes not
To thee for aidance fain would have desire
Fly without wings  Nor only him who asks
Thy bounty succours but doth freely oft
Forerun the asking  Whatsoeer may be
Of excellence in creature pity mild
Relenting mercy large munificence
Are all combind in thee  Here kneeleth one
Who of all spirits hath reviewd the state
From the worlds lowest gap unto this height
Suppliant to thee he kneels imploring grace
For virtue yet more high to lift his ken
Toward the bliss supreme  And I who neer
Coveted sight more fondly for myself
Than now for him my prayers to thee prefer
And pray they be not scant that thou wouldst drive
Each cloud of his mortality away
That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze
This also I entreat of thee O queen
Who canst do what thou wilt that in him thou
Wouldst after all he hath beheld preserve
Affection sound and human passions quell
Lo  Where with Beatrice many a saint
Stretch their claspd hands in furtherance of my suit

The eyes that heavn with love and awe regards
Fixd on the suitor witnessd how benign
She looks on pious prayrs then fastend they
On th everlasting light wherein no eye
Of creature as may well be thought so far
Can travel inward  I meanwhile who drew
Near to the limit where all wishes end
The ardour of my wish for so behooved
Ended within me Beckning smild the sage
That I should look aloft but ere he bade
Already of myself aloft I lookd
For visual strength refining more and more
Bare me into the ray authentical
Of sovran light  Thenceforward what I saw
Was not for words to speak nor memorys self
To stand against such outrage on her skill
As one who from a dream awakend straight
All he hath seen forgets yet still retains
Impression of the feeling in his dream
Een such am I for all the vision dies
As t were away and yet the sense of sweet
That sprang from it still trickles in my heart
Thus in the sunthaw is the snow unseald
Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost
The Sybils sentence  O eternal beam
Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar
Yield me again some little particle
Of what thou then appearedst give my tongue
Power but to leave one sparkle of thy glory
Unto the race to come that shall not lose
Thy triumph wholly if thou waken aught
Of memory in me and endure to hear
The record sound in this unequal strain

Such keenness from the living ray I met
That if mine eyes had turnd away methinks
I had been lost but so emboldend on
I passd as I remember till my view
Hoverd the brink of dread infinitude

O grace unenvying of thy boon that gavst
Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken
On th everlasting splendour that I lookd
While sight was unconsumd and in that depth
Saw in one volume claspd of love whatever
The universe unfolds all properties
Of substance and of accident beheld
Compounded yet one individual light
The whole  And of such bond methinks I saw
The universal form for that whenever
I do but speak of it my soul dilates
Beyond her proper self and till I speak
One moment seems a longer lethargy
Than fiveandtwenty ages had appeard
To that emprize that first made Neptune wonder
At Argos shadow darkening on his flood

With fixed heed suspense and motionless
Wondring I gazd and admiration still
Was kindled as I gazd  It may not be
That one who looks upon that light can turn
To other object willingly his view
For all the good that will may covet there
Is summd and all elsewhere defective found
Complete  My tongue shall utter now no more
Een what remembrance keeps than could the babes
That yet is moistend at his mothers breast
Not that the semblance of the living light
Was changd that ever as at first remaind
But that my vision quickening in that sole
Appearance still new miracles descryd
And toild me with the change  In that abyss
Of radiance clear and lofty seemd methought
Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound
And from another one reflected seemd
As rainbow is from rainbow and the third
Seemd fire breathd equally from both  Oh speech
How feeble and how faint art thou to give
Conception birth  Yet this to what I saw
Is less than little  Oh eternal light
Sole in thyself that dwellst and of thyself
Sole understood past present or to come
Thou smiledst on that circling which in thee
Seemd as reflected splendour while I musd
For I therein methought in its own hue
Beheld our image painted steadfastly
I therefore pord upon the view  As one
Who versd in geometric lore would fain
Measure the circle and though pondering long
And deeply that beginning which he needs
Finds not een such was I intent to scan
The novel wonder and trace out the form
How to the circle fitted and therein
How placd but the flight was not for my wing
Had not a flash darted athwart my mind
And in the spleen unfolded what it sought

Here vigour faild the towring fantasy
But yet the will rolld onward like a wheel
In even motion by the Love impelld
That moves the sun in heavn and all the stars
