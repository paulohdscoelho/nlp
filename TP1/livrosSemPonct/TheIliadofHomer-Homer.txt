INTRODUCTION


Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge as knowledge is of
scepticism To be content with what we at present know is for the most
part to shut our ears against conviction since from the very gradual
character of our education we must continually forget and emancipate
ourselves from knowledge previously acquired we must set aside old
notions and embrace fresh ones and as we learn we must be daily
unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to
acquire

And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which
progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice and in which
persons and things are day by day finding their real level in lieu of
their conventional value The same principles which have swept away
traditional abuses and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of
sinecurists and stripping the thin tawdry veil from attractive
superstitions are working as actively in literature as in society The
credulity of one writer or the partiality of another finds as powerful a
touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a
temperate class of antagonists as the dreams of conservatism or the
impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church History and tradition
whether of ancient or comparatively recent times are subjected to very
different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former
ages could allow Mere statements are jealously watched and the motives
of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his
history as the facts he records Probability is a powerful and
troublesome test and it is by this troublesome standard that a large
portion of historical evidence is sifted Consistency is no less
pertinacious and exacting in its demands In brief to write a history we
must know more than mere facts Human nature viewed under an induction of
extended experience is the best help to the criticism of human history
Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human
experience whether actual or traditionary has furnished To form correct
views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great
wholewe must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom
they are surrounded and in contemplating the incidents in their lives or
condition which tradition has handed down to us we must rather consider
the general bearing of the whole narrative than the respective
probability of its details

It is unfortunate for us that of some of the greatest men we know
least and talk most Homer Socrates and Shakespere1 have perhaps
contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any
other three writers who could be named and yet the history of all three
has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion which has left us
little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will
follow The personality of Shakespere is perhaps the only thing in which
critics will allow us to believe without controversy but upon everything
else even down to the authorship of plays there is more or less of doubt
and uncertainty Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of
Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know He was one of the dramatis
personae in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style He appears as
the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the
writers who have handed them down When we have read Plato or Xenophon
we think we know something of Socrates when we have fairly read and
examined both we feel convinced that we are something worse than
ignorant

It has been an easy and a popular expedient of late years to deny the
personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were
too much for our belief This systemwhich has often comforted the
religious sceptic and substituted the consolations of Strauss for those
of the New Testamenthas been of incalculable value to the historical
theorists of the last and present centuries To question the existence of
Alexander the Great would be a more excusable act than to believe in
that of Romulus To deny a fact related in Herodotus because it is
inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian inscription which no
two scholars read in the same way is more pardonable than to believe in
the goodnatured old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has
idealizedNuma Pompilius

Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer and
the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission
to believe any theory provided we throw overboard all written tradition
concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey What few
authorities exist on the subject are summarily dismissed although the
arguments appear to run in a circle This cannot be true because it is
not true and that is not true because it cannot be true Such seems to
be the style in which testimony upon testimony statement upon statement
is consigned to denial and oblivion

It is however unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are
partly forgeries partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination in which
truth is the requisite most wanting Before taking a brief review of the
Homeric theory in its present conditions some notice must be taken of the
treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus

According to this document the city of Cumae in Ćolia was at an early
period the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece
Among the immigrants was Menapolus the son of Ithagenes Although poor
he married and the result of the union was a girl named Critheis The
girl was left an orphan at an early age under the guardianship of
Cleanax of Argos It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we are
indebted for so much happiness Homer was the first fruit of her juvenile
frailty and received the name of Melesigenes from having been born near
the river Meles in Boeotia whither Critheis had been transported in
order to save her reputation

At this time continues our narrative there lived at Smyrna a man
named Phemius a teacher of literature and music who not being married
engaged Critheis to manage his household and spin the flax he received as
the price of his scholastic labours So satisfactory was her performance
of this task and so modest her conduct that he made proposals of
marriage declaring himself as a further inducement willing to adopt her
son who he asserted would become a clever man if he were carefully
brought up

They were married careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature
had bestowed and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every
attainment and when older rivalled his preceptor in wisdom Phemius
died leaving him sole heir to his property and his mother soon followed
Melesigenes carried on his adopted fathers school with great success
exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna but also of
the strangers whom the trade carried on there especially in the
exportation of corn attracted to that city Among these visitors one
Mentes from Leucadia the modern Santa Maura who evinced a knowledge and
intelligence rarely found in those times persuaded Melesigenes to close
his school and accompany him on his travels He promised not only to pay
his expenses but to furnish him with a further stipend urging that
While he was yet young it was fitting that he should see with his own
eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his
discourses Melesigenes consented and set out with his patron
examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited and
informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met We
may also suppose that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of
preservation2 Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia they reached
Ithaca Here Melesigenes who had already suffered in his eyes became
much worse and Mentes who was about to leave for Leucadia left him to
the medical superintendence of a friend of his named Mentor the son of
Alcinor Under his hospitable and intelligent host Melesigenes rapidly
became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses which afterwards
formed the subject of the Odyssey The inhabitants of Ithaca assert that
it was here that Melesigenes became blind but the Colophomans make their
city the seat of that misfortune He then returned to Smyrna where he
applied himself to the study of poetry3

But poverty soon drove him to Cumae Having passed over the Hermaean
plain he arrived at Neon Teichos the New Wall a colony of Cumae Here
his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one
Tychias an armourer And up to my time continued the author the
inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation
of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot Here also a poplar
grew which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived4

But poverty still drove him on and he went by way of Larissa as being
the most convenient road Here the Cumans say he composed an epitaph on
Gordius king of Phrygia which has however and with greater probability
been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus5

Arrived at Cumae he frequented the converzationes6 of the old men
and delighted all by the charms of his poetry Encouraged by this
favourable reception he declared that if they would allow him a public
maintenance he would render their city most gloriously  renowned They
avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed and
procured him an audience in the council Having made the speech with the
purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us he retired and
left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal

The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poets demand
but one man observed that if they were to feed Homers they would be
encumbered with a multitude of useless people From this circumstance
says the writer Melesigenes acquired the name of Homer for the Cumans
call blind men Homers7 With a love of economy which shows how
similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men the
pension was denied and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that
Cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory

At Phocoea Homer was destined to experience another literary distress
One Thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius kept
Homer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on condition of the
verses of the poet passing in his name Having collected sufficient poetry
to be profitable Thestorides like some wouldbeliterary publishers
neglected the man whose brains he had sucked and left him At his
departure Homer is said to have observed O Thestorides of the many
things hidden from the knowledge of man nothing is more unintelligible
than the human heart8

Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some Chian
merchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite
acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a profitable
livelihood by the recital of the very same poems This at once determined
him to set out for Chios No vessel happened then to be setting sail
thither but he found one ready to Start for Erythrae a town of Ionia
which faces that island and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to
accompany them Having embarked he invoked a favourable wind and prayed
that he might be able to expose the imposture of Thestorides who by his
breach of hospitality had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable

At Erythrae Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in
Phocoea by whose assistance he at length after some difficulty reached
the little hamlet of Pithys Here he met with an adventure which we will
continue in the words of our author Having set out from Pithys Homer
went on attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing The
dogs barked on his approach and he cried out Glaucus for that was the
name of the goatherd heard his voice ran up quickly called off his
dogs and drove them away from Homer For or some time he stood wondering
how a blind man should have reached such a place alone and what could be
his design in coming He then went up to him and inquired who he was and
how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots and of what he
stood in need Homer by recounting to him the whole history of his
misfortunes moved him with compassion and he took him and led him to
his cot and having lit a fire bade him sup9

The dogs instead of eating kept barking at the stranger according to
their usual habit Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus O Glaucus my
friend prythee attend to my behest First give the dogs their supper at
the doors of the hut for so it is better since whilst they watch nor
thief nor wild beast will approach the fold

Glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author Having
finished supper they banqueted10 afresh on conversation Homer
narrating his wanderings and telling of the cities he had visited

At length they retired to rest but on the following morning Glaucus
resolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his meeting with
Homer Having left the goats in charge of a fellowservant he left Homer
at home promising to return quickly Having arrived at Bolissus a place
near the farm and finding his mate he told him the whole story
respecting Homer and his journey He paid little attention to what he
said and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed
and enfeebled persons However he bade him bring the stranger to him

Glaucus told Homer what had taken place and bade him follow him assuring
him that good fortune would be the result Conversation soon showed that
the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge and the
Chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake the charge of his
children11

Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the
island Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher In the town of
Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry To
this day says Chandler12 the most curious remain is that which has
been named without reason the School of Homer It is on the coast at
some distance from the city northward and appears to have been an open
temple of Cybele formed on the top of a rock The shape is oval and in
the centre is the image of the goddess the head and an arm wanting She
is represented as usual sitting The chair has a lion carved on each
side and on the back The area is bounded by a low rim or seat and
about five yards over The whole is hewn out of the mountain is rude
indistinct and probably of the most remote antiquity

So successful was this school that Homer realised a considerable fortune
He married and had two daughters one of whom died single the other
married a Chian

The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages
of the poems with the history of the poet which has already been
mentioned

In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards
Mentor of Ithaca in the Odyssey whose name he has inserted in his poem
as the companion of Ulysses13 in return for the care taken of him when
afflicted with blindness He also testifies his gratitude to Phemius who
had given him both sustenance and instruction

His celebrity continued to increase and many persons advised him to visit
Greece whither his reputation had now extended Having it is said made
some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the
Athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no mention14 he sent out
for Samos Here being recognized by a Samian who had met with him in
Chios he was handsomely received and invited to join in celebrating the
Apaturian festival He recited some verses which gave great satisfaction
and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals he earned a
subsistence visiting the houses of the rich with whose children he was
very popular

In the spring he sailed for Athens and arrived at the island of Ios now
Ino where he fell extremely ill and died It is said that his death
arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed
by some fishermens children15

Such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of Homer we possess
and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness that it is
scarcely necessary to point them out in detail Let us now consider some
of the opinions to which a persevering patient and learnedbut by no
means consistentseries of investigations has led In doing so I profess
to bring forward statements not to vouch for their reasonableness or
probability

Homer appeared The history of this poet and his works is lost in
doubtful obscurity as is the history of many of the first minds who have
done honour to humanity because they rose amidst darkness The majestic
stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like the Nile through
many lands and nations and like the sources of the Nile its fountains
will ever remain concealed

Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics has
eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the Homeric
question is involved With no less truth and feeling he proceeds

It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of
things makes possible If the period of tradition in history is the region
of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light The creations of
genius always seem like miracles because they are for the most part
created far out of the reach of observation If we were in possession of
all the historical testimonies we never could wholly explain the origin
of the Iliad and the Odyssey for their origin in all essential points
must have remained the secret of the poet 16

From this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths of human
nature as into the minute wiredrawings of scholastic investigation let
us pass on to the main question at issue Was Homer an individual17 or
were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of
fragments by earlier poets

Well has Landor remarked Some tell us there were twenty Homers some
deny that there was ever one It were idle and foolish to shake the
contents of a vase in order to let them settle at last We are
perpetually labouring to destroy our delights our composure our devotion
to superior power Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good
for us My opinion is that what is best for us is our admiration of good
No man living venerates Homer more than I do 18

But greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented
with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered
without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute
analysisour editorial office compels us to give some attention to the
doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset and to
entreat our reader for a brief period to prefer his judgment to his
imagination and to condescend to dry details

Before however entering into particulars respecting the question of this
unity of the Homeric poems at least of the Iliad I must express my
sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks

We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better
the poetic age of Greece almost conclusive testimony to its original
composition It was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive
integrity was called in question nor is it injustice to assert that the
minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification
for the profound feeling the comprehensive conception of an harmonious
whole The most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the
human frame and we would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on
the proportions and general beauty of a form rather than that of Mr
Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper

There is some truth though some malicious exaggeration in the lines of
Pope

  The critic eyethat microscope of wit
  Sees hairs and pores examines bit by bit
  How parts relate to parts or they to whole
  The bodys harmony the beaming soul
  Are things which Kuster Burmann Wasse shall see
  When mans whole frame is obvious to a flea19

Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the
unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems The grave and cautious
Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo20 the
authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics
Longinus in an oft quoted passage merely expressed an opinion touching
the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad21 and among a
mass of ancient authors whose very names22 it would be tedious to
detail no suspicion of the personal nonexistence of Homer ever arose So
far the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on
the subject let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern
investigations lay claim

At the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken on the
subject and we find Bentley remarking that Homer wrote a sequel of songs
and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings and good cheer
at festivals and other days of merriment These loose songs were not
collected together in the form of an epic poem till about Peisistratus
time about five hundred years after23

Two French writersHedelin and Perraultavowed a similar scepticism on the
subject but it is in the Scienza Nuova of Battista Vico that we first
meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended by Wolf with so
much learning and acuteness Indeed it is with the Wolfian theory that we
have chiefly to deal and with the following bold hypothesis which we
will detail in the words of Grote24

Half a century ago the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F A Wolf
turning to account the Venetian Scholia which had then been recently
published first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the
Homeric text A considerable part of that dissertation though by no means
the whole is employed in vindicating the position previously announced
by Bentley amongst others that the separate constituent portions of the
Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and
unchangeable order until the days of Peisistratus in the sixth century
before Christ As a step towards that conclusion Wolf maintained that no
written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the
earlier times to which their composition is referred and that without
writing neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have
been originally conceived by any poet nor if realized by him
transmitted with assurance to posterity The absence of easy and
convenient writing such as must be indispensably supposed for long
manuscripts among the early Greeks was thus one of the points in Wolfs
case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey By Nitzsch
and other leading opponents of Wolf the connection of the one with the
other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it and it has been
considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character
of the Iliad and Odyssey to maintain that they were written poems from
the beginning

To me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to
Peisistratus and his associates in reference to the Homeric poems are
nowise admissible But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view
of the question if it could be shown that in order to controvert it we
were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems in the ninth
century before the Christian aera Few things in my opinion can be more
improbable and Mr Payne Knight opposed as he is to the Wolfian
hypothesis admits this no less than Wolf himself The traces of writing
in Greece even in the seventh century before the Christian aera are
exceedingly trifling We have no remaining inscription earlier than the
fortieth Olympiad and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully
executed nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus Simonides
of Amorgus Kallinus Tyrtaeus Xanthus and the other early elegiac and
lyric poets committed their compositions to writing or at what time the
practice of doing so became familiar The first positive ground which
authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer is in the
famous ordinance of Solon with regard to the rhapsodies at the
Panathenaea but for what length of time previously manuscripts had
existed we are unable to say

Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the
beginning rest their case not upon positive proofs nor yet upon the
existing habits of society with regard to poetryfor they admit generally
that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read but recited and heardbut upon
the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the
preservation of the poemsthe unassisted memory of reciters being neither
sufficient nor trustworthy But here we only escape a smaller difficulty
by running into a greater for the existence of trained bards gifted with
extraordinary memory 25 is far less astonishing than that of long
manuscripts in an age essentially nonreading and nonwriting and when
even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious
Moreover there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard
was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a
manuscript for if such had been the fact blindness would have been a
disqualification for the profession which we know that it was not as
well from the example of Demodokus in the Odyssey as from that of the
blind bard of Chios in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo whom Thucydides as
well as the general tenor of Grecian legend identifies with Homer
himself The author of that hymn be he who he may could never have
described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art if he
had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by
constant reference to the manuscript in his chest

The loss of the digamma that crux of critics that quicksand upon which
even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove beyond a doubt
that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable
change Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems
could have suffered by this change had written copies been preserved If
Chaucers poetry for instance had not been written it could only have
come down to us in a softened form more like the effeminate version of
Dryden than the rough quaint noble original

At what period continues Grote these poems or indeed any other Greek
poems first began to be written must be matter of conjecture though
there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon If in
the absence of evidence we may venture upon naming any more determinate
period the question a once suggests itself What were the purposes which
in that state of society a manuscript at its first commencement must have
been intended to answer For whom was a written Iliad necessary Not for
the rhapsodes for with them it was not only planted in the memory but
also interwoven with the feelings and conceived in conjunction with all
those flexions and intonations of voice pauses and other oral artifices
which were required for emphatic delivery and which the naked manuscript
could never reproduce Not for the general publicthey were accustomed to
receive it with its rhapsodic delivery and with its accompaniments of a
solemn and crowded festival The only persons for whom the written Iliad
would be suitable would be a select few studious and curious men a class
of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had
experienced as hearers in the crowd and who would on perusing the
written words realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the
impression communicated by the reciter Incredible as the statement may
seem in an age like the present there is in all early societies and
there was in early Greece a time when no such reading class existed If
we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed we
should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were
first committed to writing Now the period which may with the greatest
probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of
the narrowest reading class in Greece is the middle of the seventh
century before the Christian aera BC 660 to BC 630 the age of
Terpander Kallinus Archilochus Simonides of Amorgus c I ground this
supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of
Grecian poetry and musicthe elegiac and the iambic measures having been
introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter and poetical compositions
having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and
real life Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only
known mode of publication to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable
yet the nearest approaching to the sense It argued a new way of looking
at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new
poetical effect and the men who stood forward in it may well be
considered as desirous to study and competent to criticize from their
own individual point of view the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies
just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais
as the production of Homer There seems therefore ground for
conjecturing that for the use of this newlyformed and important but
very narrow class manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old
epicsthe Thebais and the Cypria as well as the Iliad and the
Odysseybegan to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century
BC 1 and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce which took place
about the same period would furnish increased facilities for obtaining
the requisite papyrus to write upon A reading class when once formed
would doubtless slowly increase and the number of manuscripts along with
it so that before the time of Solon fifty years afterwards both readers
and manuscripts though still comparatively few might have attained a
certain recognized authority and formed a tribunal of reference against
the carelessness of individual rhapsodes26

But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the
credit and we cannot help feeling the force of the following
observations


    There are several incidental circumstances which in our opinion
    throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid
    compilation at least over the theory that the Iliad was cast
    into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of
    the Athenian ruler If the great poets who flourished at the
    bright period of Grecian song of which alas we have inherited
    little more than the fame and the faint echo if Stesichorus
    Anacreon and Simonides were employed in the noble task of
    compiling the Iliad and Odyssey so much must have been done to
    arrange to connect to harmonize that it is almost incredible
    that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain
    Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected anomalies which no
    doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the
    Homeric age however the irregular use of the digamma may have
    perplexed our Bentleys to whom the name of Helen is said to have
    caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among
    the heroes of her age however Mr Knight may have failed in
    reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form however
    finally the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more
    marked and distinguishing characteristicsstill it is difficult to
    suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and
    transitions and connecting parts should not more clearly betray
    the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of
    expression It is not quite in character with such a period to
    imitate an antique style in order to piece out an imperfect poem
    in the character of the original as Sir Walter Scott has done in
    his continuation of Sir Tristram

    If however not even such faint and indistinct traces of
    Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the
    poems the total absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps
    no less worthy of observation In later and it may fairly be
    suspected in earlier times the Athenians were more than
    ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors But amid all
    the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the
    Iliad the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant
    part Even the few passages which relate to their ancestors Mr
    Knight suspects to be interpolations It is possible indeed that
    in its leading outline the Iliad may be true to historic fact
    that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against
    the rival and halfkindred empire of the Laomedontiadae the
    chieftain of Thessaly from his valour and the number of his
    forces may have been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian
    sovereign the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the
    Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the
    Athenians to yield to their taste The songs which spoke of their
    own great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublimity and
    popularity or at first sight a Theseid would have been much
    more likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers
    of ancient song than an Achilleid or an Olysseid Could France
    have given birth to a Tasso Tancred would have been the hero of
    the Jerusalem If however the Homeric ballads as they are
    sometimes called which related the wrath of Achilles with all
    its direful consequences were so far superior to the rest of the
    poetic cycle as to admit no rivalryit is still surprising that
    throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never
    betray the workmanship of an Athenian hand and that the national
    spirit of a race who have at a later period not inaptly been
    compared to our self admiring neighbours the French should
    submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of
    their own ancestorsor at least to the questionable dignity of
    only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military
    tactics of his age27


To return to the Wolfian theory While it is to be confessed that Wolfs
objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never
been wholly got over we cannot help discovering that they have failed to
enlighten us as to any substantial point and that the difficulties with
which the whole subject is beset are rather augmented than otherwise if
we admit his hypothesis Nor is Lachmanns28 modification of his theory
any better He divides the first twentytwo books of the Iliad into
sixteen different songs and treats as ridiculous the belief that their
amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the
age of Peisistratus This as Grote observes explains the gaps and
contradictions in the narrative but it explains nothing else Moreover
we find no contradictions warranting this belief and the socalled
sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the
first battle after the secession of Achilles Elphenor chief of the
Euboeans Tlepolemus of the Rhodians Pandarus of the Lycians Odius of
the Halizonians Pirous and Acamas of the Thracians None of these heroes
again make their appearance and we can but agree with Colonel Mure that
it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so
harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel The
discrepancy by which Pylaemenes who is represented as dead in the fifth
book weeps at his sons funeral in the thirteenth can only be regarded
as the result of an interpolation

Grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the
subject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian
theory and of Lachmanns modifications with the character of
Peisistratus But he has also shown and we think with equal success that
the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems or
supposing that impossible the unison of these parts by Peisistratus and
not before his time are essentially distinct In short a man may
believe the Iliad to have been put together out of preexisting songs
without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the period of its first
compilation The friends or literary employes of Peisistratus must have
found an Iliad that was already ancient and the silence of the
Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic recension goes far to
prove that among the numerous manuscripts they examined this was either
wanting or thought unworthy of attention

Moreover he continues the whole tenor of the poems themselves
confirms what is here remarked There is nothing either in the Iliad or
Odyssey which savours of modernism applying that term to the age of
Peisistratusnothing which brings to our view the alterations brought
about by two centuries in the Greek language the coined money the
habits of writing and reading the despotisms and republican governments
the close military array the improved construction of ships the
Amphiktyonic convocations the mutual frequentation of religious
festivals the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion c familiar to
the latter epoch These alterations Onomakritus and the other literary
friends of Peisistratus could hardly have failed to notice even without
design had they then for the first time undertaken the task of piecing
together many self existent epics into one large aggregate Everything in
the two great Homeric poems both in substance and in language belongs to
an age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus Indeed even the
interpolations or those passages which on the best grounds are
pronounced to be such betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ
and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinusin some cases
even by Arktinus and Hesiodas genuine Homeric matter29 As far as the
evidences on the case as well internal as external enable us to judge
we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited
substantially as they now stand always allowing for paitial divergences
of text and interpolations in 776 BC our first trustworthy mark of
Grecian time and this ancient date let it be added as it is the
bestauthenticated fact so it is also the most important attribute of the
Homeric poems considered in reference to Grecian history for they thus
afford us an insight into the antihistorical character of the Greeks
enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation and to
seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later
condition30

On the whole I am inclined to believe that the labours of Peisistratus
were wholly of an editorial character although I must confess that I
can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours At the same
time so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of
these poems in their present form was the work of Peisistratus I am
rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that Athenian31
would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems
rather than to patch and reconstruct them according to a fanciful
hypothesis I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the
poems were written or not or whether the art of writing was known in the
time of their reputed author Suffice it to say that the more we read
the less satisfied we are upon either subject

I cannot however help thinking that the story which attributes the
preservation of these poems to Lycurgus is little else than a version of
the same story as that of Peisistratus while its historical probability
must be measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan Confucius

I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attempt made
by an ingenious friend to unite them into something like consistency It
is as follows


    No doubt the common soldiers of that age had like the common
    sailors of some fifty years ago some one qualified to discourse
    in excellent music among them Many of these like those of the
    negroes in the United States were extemporaneous and allusive to
    events passing around them But what was passing around them The
    grand events of a spiritstirring war occurrences likely to
    impress themselves as the mystical legends of former times had
    done upon their memory besides which a retentive memory was
    deemed a virtue of the first water and was cultivated accordingly
    in those ancient times Ballads at first and down to the
    beginning of the war with Troy were merely recitations with an
    intonation Then followed a species of recitative probably with
    an intoned burden Tune next followed as it aided the memory
    considerably

    It was at this period about four hundred years after the war
    that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes or Moeonides
    but most probably the former He saw that these ballads might be
    made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the
    social position of Hellas and as a collection he published
    these lays connecting them by a tale of his own This poem now
    exists under the title of the Odyssea The author however did
    not affix his own name to the poem which in fact was great
    part of it remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete in which
    tongue the ballads were found by him He therefore called it the
    poem of Homeros or the Collector but this is rather a proof of
    his modesty and talent than of his mere drudging arrangement of
    other peoples ideas for as Grote has finely observed arguing
    for the unity of authorship a great poet might have recast
    preexisting separate songs into one comprehensive whole but no
    mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so

    While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus he met with a
    ballad recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon His noble
    mind seized the hint that there presented itself and the
    Achilleis32 grew under his hand Unity of design however
    caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his
    former work and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were
    joined together like those relating to the Cid into a chronicle
    history named the Iliad Melesigenes knew that the poem was
    destined to be a lasting one and so it has proved but first
    the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and
    corruptions by the people who took to singing them in the
    streets assemblies and agoras However Solon first and then
    Peisistratus and afterwards Aristoteles and others revised the
    poems and restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their
    original integrity in a great measure33


Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have
developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject I must
still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the
Homeric poems To deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure
them and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there
have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist
would be an absurd and captious assumption but it is to a higher
criticism that we must appeal if we would either understand or enjoy
these poems In maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one
author be he Homer or Melesigenes quocunque nomine vocari eum jus
fasque sit I feel conscious that while the whole weight of historical
evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to
a plurality of authors the most powerful internal evidence and that
which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul
also speaks eloquently to the contrary

The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise Indeed
considering the character of some of my own books such an attempt would
be gross inconsistency But while I appreciate its importance in a
philological view I am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic
value especially in poetry Three parts of the emendations made upon
poets are mere alterations some of which had they been suggested to the
author by his Maecenas or Africanus he would probably have adopted
Moreover those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal
criticism and interpretation are often least competent to carry out their
own precepts Grammarians are not poets by profession but may be so per
accidens I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer
calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage although a
mass of remarks from Herodotus down to Loewe have given us the history
of a thousand minute points without which our Greek knowledge would be
gloomy and jejune

But it is not on words only that grammarians mere grammarians will
exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity Binding down an
heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously
dissected his words and sentences they proceed to use the axe and the
pruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in everything but their wish
to make out a case of unlawful affiliation they cut out book after book
passage after passage till the author is reduced to a collection of
fragments or till those who fancied they possessed the works of some
great man find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up
at second hand If we compare the theories of Knight Wolf Lachmann and
others we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of
criticism than of the apocryphal position of Homer One rejects what
another considers the turningpoint of his theory One cuts a supposed
knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else

Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a
literary novelty Justus Lipsius a scholar of no ordinary skill seems to
revel in the imaginary discovery that the tragedies attributed to Seneca
are by four different authors34 Now I will venture to assert that
these tragedies are so uniform not only in their borrowed phraseologya
phraseology with which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were
more charmed than ourselvesin their freedom from real poetry and last
but not least in an ultrarefined and consistent abandonment of good
taste that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities
of the same gentleman be he Seneca or not to produce not only these but
a great many more equally bad With equal sagacity Father Hardouin
astonished the world with the startling announcement that the Ćneid of
Virgil and the satires of Horace were literary deceptions Now without
wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and
learningnay the refined acutenesswhich scholars like Wolf have
bestowed upon this subject I must express my fears that many of our
modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and
entertainment rather than the instruction of posterity Nor can I help
thinking that the literary history of more recent times will account for
many points of difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to
a period so remote from that of their first creation

I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus were
of a purely editorial character and there seems no more reason why
corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in his
day than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should have
given so much trouble to Poggio Scaliger and others But after all the
main fault in all the Homeric theories is that they demand too great a
sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals and
which are its most fitting judges The ingenuity which has sought to rob
us of the name and existence of Homer does too much violence to that
inward emotion which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration
for the blind bard of Chios To believe the author of the Iliad a mere
compiler is to degrade the powers of human invention to elevate
analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the
soul and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus There is
a catholicity so to speak in the very name of Homer Our faith in the
author of the Iliad may be a mistaken one but as yet nobody has taught us
a better

While however I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature
herself for its mainspring while I can join with old Ennius in believing
in Homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hovers round the bed
of the poet and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination
which a host of imitators could not exhauststill I am far from wishing
to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of
tradition a wellstocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive
both subject and embellishment But it is one thing to use existing
romances in the embellishment of a poem another to patch up the poem
itself from such materials What consistency of style and execution can be
hoped for from such an attempt or rather what bad taste and tedium will
not be the infallible result

A blending of popular legends and a free use of the songs of other bards
are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality In fact the
most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressionsnay even
his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the
impulses of imagination But unless there be some grand pervading
principlesome invisible yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the
great whole a poem like the Iliad can never come to the birth Traditions
the most picturesque episodes the most pathetic local associations
teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men may crowd in one mighty
vision or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the
poet but except the power to create a grand whole to which these shall
be but as details and embellishments be present we shall have nought but
a scrapbook a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each
other in their wild redundancy we shall have a cento of rags and tatters
which will require little acuteness to detect

Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and aware as
I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief it
still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a
higher criticism than it has often obtained We are not by nature intended
to know all things still less to compass the powers by which the
greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal Were faith no
virtue then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance on any
matter But we are too well taught the contrary lesson and it seems as
though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the
events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity
And there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and
the good which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would
allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue and measure the
giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter

Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts
even to his incongruities or rather if we read in a right spirit and
with a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled too deeply wrapped
in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the minute spots which mere
analysis can discover In reading an heroic poem we must transform
ourselves into heroes of the time being we in imagination must fight over
the same battles woo the same loves burn with the same sense of injury
as an Achilles or a Hector And if we can but attain this degree of
enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of
Homer we shall feel that the poems of Homer are not only the work of one
writer but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by
the power of song

And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their
powerful influence over the minds of the men of old Heeren who is
evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finely observes


    It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation No
    poet has ever as a poet exercised a similar influence over his
    countrymen Prophets lawgivers and sages have formed the
    character of other nations it was reserved to a poet to form that
    of the Greeks This is a feature in their character which was not
    wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy When
    lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece the work of the poet had
    already been accomplished and they paid homage to his superior
    genius He held up before his nation the mirror in which they
    were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble
    mortals and to behold them reflected with purity and truth His
    poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature on the
    love of children wife and country on that passion which
    outweighs all others the love of glory His songs were poured
    forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of
    man and therefore they enter and will continue to enter every
    breast which cherishes the same sympathies If it is granted to
    his immortal spirit from another heaven than any of which he
    dreamed on earth to look down on his race to see the nations
    from the fields of Asia to the forests of Hercynia performing
    pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow
    if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand of
    elevated of glorious productions which had been called into
    being by means of his songs wherever his immortal spirit may
    reside this alone would suffice to complete his happiness35


Can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the Apotheosis of
Homer36 is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing association
how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds is
lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition The more we
read and the more we thinkthink as becomes the readers of Homerthe
more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this
rich inheritance whole and entire Whatever were the means of its
preservation let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and
eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek to make it a mere centre
around which to drive a series of theories whose wildness is only
equalled by their inconsistency with each other

As the hymns and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer are not
included in Popes translation I will content myself with a brief account
of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice from the pen of a writer who has done
it full justice37


    This poem says Coleridge is a short mockheroic of ancient
    date The text varies in different editions and is obviously
    disturbed and corrupt to a great degree it is commonly said to
    have been a juvenile essay of Homers genius others have
    attributed it to the same Pigrees mentioned above and whose
    reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of
    any piece of ancient wit the author of which was uncertain so
    little did the Greeks before the age of the Ptolemies know or
    care about that department of criticism employed in determining
    the genuineness of ancient writings As to this little poem being
    a youthful prolusion of Homer it seems sufficient to say that
    from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody
    not only of the general spirit but of the numerous passages of
    the Iliad itself and even if no such intention to parody were
    discernible in it the objection would still remain that to
    suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of
    poetry in a simple age seems to reverse that order in the
    development of national taste which the history of every other
    people in Europe and of many in Asia has almost ascertained to
    be a law of the human mind it is in a state of society much more
    refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad that any
    popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is
    contained in this poem and the fact of there having existed three
    other poems of the same kind attributed for aught we can see
    with as much reason to Homer is a strong inducement to believe
    that none of them were of the Homeric age Knight infers from the
    usage of the word deltos writing tablet instead of diphthera
    skin which according to Herod 5 58 was the material
    employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose that this poem
    was another offspring of Attic ingenuity and generally that the
    familiar mention of the cock v 191 is a strong argument against
    so ancient a date for its composition


Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Popes design
I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation and on my own
purpose in the present edition

Pope was not a Grecian His whole education had been irregular and his
earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby It
is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a
disposition to be satisfied with the general sense rather than to dive
deeply into the minute and delicate features of language Hence his whole
work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a
translation There are to be sure certain conventional anecdotes which
prove that Pope consulted various friends whose classical attainments
were sounder than his own during the undertaking but it is probable that
these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions
already existing than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the
original And in those days what is called literal translation was less
cultivated than at present If something like the general sense could be
decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet if the charms of
metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a
fair interpretation of the poets meaning his words were less jealously
sought for and those who could read so good a poem as Popes Iliad had
fair reason to be satisfied

It would be absurd therefore to test Popes translation by our own
advancing knowledge of the original text We must be content to look at it
as a most delightful work in itselfa work which is as much a part of
English literature as Homer himself is of Greek We must not be torn from
our kindly associations with the old Iliad that once was our most
cherished companion or our most lookedfor prize merely because
Buttmann Loewe and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to
amphikupellon being an adjective and not a substantive Far be it from us
to defend the faults of Pope especially when we think of Chapmans fine
bold rough old Englishfar be it from us to hold up his translation as
what a translation of Homer might be But we can still dismiss Popes
Iliad to the hands of our readers with the consciousness that they must
have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow

As to the Notes accompanying the present volume they are drawn up without
pretension and mainly with the view of helping the general reader Having
some little time since translated all the works of Homer for another
publisher I might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter
sometimes of a critical character to bear upon the text But Popes
version was no field for such a display and my purpose was to touch
briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions to notice occasionally
some departures from the original and to give a few parallel passages
from our English Homer Milton In the latter task I cannot pretend to
novelty but I trust that my other annotations while utterly disclaiming
high scholastic views will be found to convey as much as is wanted at
least as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected
to admit To write a commentary on Homer is not my present aim but if I
have made Popes translation a little more entertaining and instructive to
a mass of miscellaneous readers I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily
accomplished

POPES PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER


Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any
writer whatever The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with
him and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences
but his invention remains yet unrivalled Nor is it a wonder if he has
ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets who most excelled in that
which is the very foundation of poetry It is the invention that in
different degrees distinguishes all great geniuses the utmost stretch of
human study learning and industry which masters everything besides can
never attain to this It furnishes art with all her materials and without
it judgment itself can at best but steal wisely for art is only like a
prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature Whatever
praises may be given to works of judgment there is not even a single
beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute as in the most
regular gardens art can only reduce beauties of nature to more
regularity and such a figure which the common eye may better take in
and is therefore more entertained with And perhaps the reason why
common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to
a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves
to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art
than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature

Our authors work is a wild paradise where if we cannot see all the
beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because the
number of them is infinitely greater It is like a copious nursery which
contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out of which those
who followed him have but selected some particular plants each according
to his fancy to cultivate and beautify If some things are too luxuriant
it is owing to the richness of the soil and if others are not arrived to
perfection or maturity it is only because they are overrun and oppressed
by those of a stronger nature

It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that
unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer that no man of
a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him What he
writes is of the most animated nature imaginable every thing moves every
thing lives and is put in action If a council be called or a battle
fought you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a
third person the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the
poets imagination and turns in one place to a hearer in another to a
spectator The course of his verses resembles that of the army he
describes

  Hoid ar isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito

They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it It
is however remarkable that his fancy which is everywhere vigorous is
not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest
splendour it grows in the progress both upon himself and others and
becomes on fire like a chariotwheel by its own rapidity Exact
disposition just thought correct elocution polished numbers may have
been found in a thousand but this poetic fire this vivida vis animi
in a very few Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected
this can overpower criticism and make us admire even while we disapprove
Nay where this appears though attended with absurdities it brightens
all the rubbish about it till we see nothing but its own splendour This
fire is discerned in Virgil but discerned as through a glass reflected
from Homer more shining than fierce but everywhere equal and constant
in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted
flashes In Milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour
by the force of art in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware like an
accidental fire from heaven but in Homer and in him only it burns
everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly

I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a
manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts
of his work as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which
distinguishes him from all other authors

This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star which in the
violence of its course drew all things within its vortex It seemed not
enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts and the whole compass of
nature to supply his maxims and reflections all the inward passions and
affections of mankind to furnish his characters and all the outward
forms and images of things for his descriptions but wanting yet an ampler
sphere to expatiate in he opened a new and boundless walk for his
imagination and created a world for himself in the invention of fable
That which Aristotle calls the soul of poetry was first breathed into
it by Homer I shall begin with considering him in his part as it is
naturally the first and I speak of it both as it means the design of a
poem and as it is taken for fiction

Fable may be divided into the probable the allegorical and the
marvellous The probable fable is the recital of such actions as though
they did not happen yet might in the common course of nature or of such
as though they did became fables by the additional episodes and manner
of telling them Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem The
return of Ulysses the settlement of the Trojans in Italy or the like
That of the Iliad is the anger of Achilles the most short and single
subject that ever was chosen by any poet Yet this he has supplied with a
vaster variety of incidents and events and crowded with a greater number
of councils speeches battles and episodes of all kinds than are to be
found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and
irregularity The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit and
its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days Virgil for want of
so warm a genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject as
well as a greater length of time and contracting the design of both
Homers poems into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his
The other epic poets have used the same practice but generally carried it
so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables destroy the unity of
action and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time Nor is
it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his
invention but they have followed him in every episode and part of story
If he has given a regular catalogue of an army they all draw up their
forces in the same order If he has funeral games for Patroclus Virgil
has the same for Anchises and Statius rather than omit them destroys
the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus If Ulysses visit the
shades the Ćneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him If he
be detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso so is Ćneas by
Dido and Rinaldo by Armida If Achilles be absent from the army on the
score of a quarrel through half the poem Rinaldo must absent himself just
as long on the like account If he gives his hero a suit of celestial
armour Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs Virgil has not
only observed this close imitation of Homer but where he had not led the
way supplied the want from other Greek authors Thus the story of Sinon
and the taking of Troy was copied says Macrobius almost word for word
from Pisander as the loves of Dido and Ćneas are taken from those of
Medea and Jason in Apollonius and several others in the same manner

To proceed to the allegorical fableIf we reflect upon those innumerable
knowledges those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer is
generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories what a new and
ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us How fertile will
that imagination appear which as able to clothe all the properties of
elements the qualifications of the mind the virtues and vices in forms
and persons and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of
the things they shadowed This is a field in which no succeeding poets
could dispute with Homer and whatever commendations have been allowed
them on this head are by no means for their invention in having enlarged
his circle but for their judgment in having contracted it For when the
mode of learning changed in the following ages and science was delivered
in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets
to lay it aside as it was in Homer to make use of it And perhaps it was
no unhappy circumstance for Virgil that there was not in his time that
demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing
all those allegorical parts of a poem

The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especially the
machines of the gods If Homer was not the first who introduced the
deities as Herodotus imagines into the religion of Greece he seems the
first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry and such a
one as makes its greatest importance and dignity for we find those
authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods
constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support of
it But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a
philosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poetic that
mankind have been ever since contented to follow them none have been able
to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set every
attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful and after all the various
changes of times and religions his gods continue to this day the gods of
poetry

We come now to the characters of his persons and here we shall find no
author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprising a variety
or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them Every one has
something so singularly his own that no painter could have distinguished
them more by their features than the poet has by their manners Nothing
can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different
degrees of virtues and vices The single quality of courage is wonderfully
diversified in the several characters of the Iliad That of Achilles is
furious and intractable that of Diomede forward yet listening to advice
and subject to command that of Ajax is heavy and selfconfiding of
Hector active and vigilant the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by
love of empire and ambition that of Menelaus mixed with softness and
tenderness for his people we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier in
Sarpedon a gallant and generous one Nor is this judicious and astonishing
diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the
main of each character but even in the under parts of it to which he
takes care to give a tincture of that principal one For example the main
characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom and they are distinct
in this that the wisdom of one is artificial and various of the other
natural open and regular But they have besides characters of courage
and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference
of his prudence for one in the war depends still upon caution the other
upon experience It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds
The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner
they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished and where they
are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer
His characters of valour are much alike even that of Turnus seems no way
peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that
differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus Cloanthus or
the rest In like manner it may be remarked of Statiuss heroes that an
air of impetuosity runs through them all the same horrid and savage
courage appears in his Capaneus Tydeus Hippomedon c They have a
parity of character which makes them seem brothers of one family I
believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection if he will
pursue it through the epic and tragic writers he will be convinced how
infinitely superior in this point the invention of Homer was to that of
all others

The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters being
perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those
who utter them As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad so
there is of speeches than in any other poem Everything in it has
manner as Aristotle expresses it that is everything is acted or
spoken It is hardly credible in a work of such length how small a
number of lines are employed in narration In Virgil the dramatic part is
less in proportion to the narrative and the speeches often consist of
general reflections or thoughts which might be equally just in any
persons mouth upon the same occasion As many of his persons have no
apparent characters so many of his speeches escape being applied and
judged by the rule of propriety We oftener think of the author himself
when we read Virgil than when we are engaged in Homer all which are the
effects of a colder invention that interests us less in the action
described Homer makes us hearers and Virgil leaves us readers

If in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the same
presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts
Longinus has given his opinion that it was in this part Homer principally
excelled What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence
of his sentiments in general is that they have so remarkable a parity
with those of the Scripture Duport in his Gnomologia Homerica has
collected innumerable instances of this sort And it is with justice an
excellent modern writer allows that if Virgil has not so many thoughts
that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble
and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments
where he is not fired by the Iliad

If we observe his descriptions images and similes we shall find the
invention still predominant To what else can we ascribe that vast
comprehension of images of every sort where we see each circumstance of
art and individual of nature summoned together by the extent and
fecundity of his imagination to which all things in their various views
presented themselves in an instant and had their impressions taken off to
perfection at a heat Nay he not only gives us the full prospects of
things but several unexpected peculiarities and side views unobserved by
any painter but Homer Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his
battles which take up no less than half the Iliad and are supplied with
so vast a variety of incidents that no one bears a likeness to another
such different kinds of deaths that no two heroes are wounded in the same
manner and such a profusion of noble ideas that every battle rises above
the last in greatness horror and confusion It is certain there is not
near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet though every
one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him and it is
evident of Virgil especially that he has scarce any comparisons which are
not drawn from his master

If we descend from hence to the expression we see the bright imagination
of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it We acknowledge him
the father of poetical diction the first who taught that language of the
gods to men His expression is like the colouring of some great masters
which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with rapidity
It is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touched with
the greatest spirit Aristotle had reason to say he was the only poet who
had found out living words there are in him more daring figures and
metaphors than in any good author whatever An arrow is impatient to be
on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the
like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great
in proportion to it It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the
diction which rises with it and forms itself about it for in the same
degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter as that
is more strong this will become more perspicuous like glass in the
furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater
clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more
intense

To throw his language more out of prose Homer seems to have affected the
compound epithets This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to
poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assisted and
filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp and likewise conduced in
some measure to thicken the images On this last consideration I cannot
but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention since as
he has managed them they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the
persons or things to which they were joined We see the motion of Hectors
plumes in the epithet Korythaiolos the landscape of Mount Neritus in that
of Einosiphyllos and so of others which particular images could not have
been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description though but
of a single line without diverting the reader too much from the principal
action or figure As a metaphor is a short simile one of these epithets
is a short description

Lastly if we consider his versification we shall be sensible what a
share of praise is due to his invention in that also He was not satisfied
with his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece but
searched through its different dialects with this particular view to
beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater
mixture of vowels or consonants and accordingly employed them as the
verse required either a greater smoothness or strength What he most
affected was the Ionic which has a peculiar sweetness from its never
using contractions and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into
two syllables so as to make the words open themselves with a more
spreading and sonorous fluency With this he mingled the Attic
contractions the broader Doric and the feebler Ćolic which often
rejects its aspirate or takes off its accent and completed this variety
by altering some letters with the licence of poetry Thus his measures
instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run
along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a further
representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sounds to
what they signified Out of all these he has derived that harmony which
makes us confess he had not only the richest head but the finest ear in
the world This is so great a truth that whoever will but consult the
tune of his verses even without understanding them with the same sort of
diligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas will
find more sweetness variety and majesty of sound than in any other
language of poetry The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to
be copied but faintly by Virgil himself though they are so just as to
ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue indeed the Greek has some
advantages both from the natural sound of its words and the turn and
cadence of its verse which agree with the genius of no other language
Virgil was very sensible of this and used the utmost diligence in working
up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of
and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a
beautiful agreement with its sense If the Grecian poet has not been so
frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman the only reason is
that fewer critics have understood one language than the other Dionysius
of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our authors beauties in this
kind in his treatise of the Composition of Words It suffices at present
to observe of his numbers that they flow with so much ease as to make
one imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the
Muses dictated and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting
vigour that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet They
roll along as a plentiful river always in motion and always full while
we are borne away by a tide of verse the most rapid and yet the most
smooth imaginable

Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer what principally strikes us is
his invention It is that which forms the character of each part of his
work and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and
copious than any other his manners more lively and strongly marked his
speeches more affecting and transported his sentiments more warm and
sublime his images and descriptions more full and animated his
expression more raised and daring and his numbers more rapid and various
I hope in what has been said of Virgil with regard to any of these
heads I have no way derogated from his character Nothing is more absurd
or endless than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an
opposition of particular passages in them and forming a judgment from
thence of their merit upon the whole We ought to have a certain knowledge
of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each it is in
that we are to consider him and in proportion to his degree in that we
are to admire him No author or man ever excelled all the world in more
than one faculty and as Homer has done this in invention Virgil has in
judgment Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment because
Virgil had it in a more eminent degree or that Virgil wanted invention
because Homer possessed a larger share of it each of these great authors
had more of both than perhaps any man besides and are only said to have
less in comparison with one another Homer was the greater genius Virgil
the better artist In one we most admire the man in the other the work
Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity Virgil
leads us with an attractive majesty Homer scatters with a generous
profusion Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence Homer like the
Nile pours out his riches with a boundless overflow Virgil like a river
in its banks with a gentle and constant stream When we behold their
battles methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate Homer
boundless and resistless as Achilles bears all before him and shines
more and more as the tumult increases Virgil calmly daring like Ćneas
appears undisturbed in the midst of the action disposes all about him
and conquers with tranquillity And when we look upon their machines
Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors shaking Olympus
scattering the lightnings and firing the heavens Virgil like the same
power in his benevolence counselling with the gods laying plans for
empires and regularly ordering his whole creation

But after all it is with great parts as with great virtues they
naturally border on some imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish
exactly where the virtue ends or the fault begins As prudence may
sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgment decline to coldness
and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great
invention to redundancy or wildness If we look upon Homer in this view
we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so
noble a cause as the excess of this faculty

Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions upon which so
much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds of
probability Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as with
gigantic bodies which exerting themselves with unusual strength exceed
what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts to become miracles
in the whole and like the old heroes of that make commit something near
extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances
Thus Homer has his speaking horses and Virgil his myrtles distilling
blood where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy
intervention of a deity to save the probability

It is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have been thought
too exuberant and full of circumstances The force of this faculty is seen
in nothing more than in its inability to confine itself to that single
circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded it runs out into
embellishments of additional images which however are so managed as not
to overpower the main one His similes are like pictures where the
principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the
original but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects The
same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons
together in one breath when his fancy suggested to him at once so many
various and correspondent images The reader will easily extend this
observation to more objections of the same kind

If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or
narrowness of genius than an excess of it those seeming defects will be
found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he
lived in Such are his grosser representations of the gods and the
vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes but I must here speak a word
of the latter as it is a point generally carried into extremes both by
the censurers and defenders of Homer It must be a strange partiality to
antiquity to think with Madame Dacier38 that those times and manners
are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours Who
can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those
ages when a spirit of revenge and cruelty joined with the practice of
rapine and robbery reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but
for the sake of lucre when the greatest princes were put to the sword
and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines On the other
side I would not be so delicate as those modern critics who are shocked
at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the
heroes of Homer engaged There is a pleasure in taking a view of that
simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages in beholding
monarchs without their guards princes tending their flocks and
princesses drawing water from the springs When we read Homer we ought to
reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world
and those who consider him in this light will double their pleasure in
the perusal of him Let them think they are growing acquainted with
nations and people that are now no more that they are stepping almost
three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity and entertaining
themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be
found the only true mirror of that ancient world By this means alone
their greatest obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their
dislike will become a satisfaction

This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the
same epithets to his gods and heroes such as the fardarting Phoebus
the blueeyed Pallas the swiftfooted Achilles c which some have
censured as impertinent and tediously repeated Those of the gods
depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them and
had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions
in which they were used they were a sort of attributes with which it was
a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions and which it was an
irreverence to omit As for the epithets of great men Mons Boileau is of
opinion that they were in the nature of surnames and repeated as such
for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers were obliged to
add some other distinction of each person either naming his parents
expressly or his place of birth profession or the like as Alexander
the son of Philip Herodotus of Halicarnassus Diogenes the Cynic c
Homer therefore complying with the custom of his country used such
distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry And indeed we have
something parallel to these in modern times such as the names of Harold
Harefoot Edmund Ironside Edward Longshanks Edward the Black Prince c
If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the
repetition I shall add a further conjecture Hesiod dividing the world
into its different ages has placed a fourth age between the brazen and
the iron one of heroes distinct from other men a divine race who fought
at Thebes and Troy are called demigods and live by the care of Jupiter
in the islands of the blessed Now among the divine honours which were
paid them they might have this also in common with the gods not to be
mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet and such as might be
acceptable to them by celebrating their families actions or qualities

What other cavils have been raised against Homer are such as hardly
deserve a reply but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the
course of the work Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour
to exalt Virgil which is much the same as if one should think to raise
the superstructure by undermining the foundation one would imagine by
the whole course of their parallels that these critics never so much as
heard of Homers having written first a consideration which whoever
compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye Some accuse him
for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when
they prefer the fable and moral of the Ćneis to those of the Iliad for
the same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the Ćneis as that the
hero is a wiser man and the action of the one more beneficial to his
country than that of the other or else they blame him for not doing what
he never designed as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince
as Ćneas when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character
it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil Others
select those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as
some that Virgil drew out of them this is the whole management of
Scaliger in his Poetics Others quarrel with what they take for low and
mean expressions sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement
oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original and then triumph
in the awkwardness of their own translations this is the conduct of
Perrault in his Parallels Lastly there are others who pretending to a
fairer proceeding distinguish between the personal merit of Homer and
that of his work but when they come to assign the causes of the great
reputation of the Iliad they found it upon the ignorance of his times
and the prejudice of those that followed and in pursuance of this
principle they make those accidents such as the contention of the
cities c to be the causes of his fame which were in reality the
consequences of his merit The same might as well be said of Virgil or
any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual
additions to their reputation This is the method of Mons de la Mott who
yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived he must
have been the greatest poet of his nation and that he may be said in his
sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him39

In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the
honour of the chief invention and as long as this which is indeed the
characteristic of poetry itself remains unequalled by his followers he
still continues superior to them A cooler judgment may commit fewer
faults and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics but that
warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which
holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment Homer not
only appears the inventor of poetry but excels all the inventors of other
arts in this that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded
him What he has done admitted no increase it only left room for
contraction or regulation He showed all the stretch of fancy at once and
if he has failed in some of his flights it was but because he attempted
everything A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from
the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and
produces the finest fruit nature and art conspire to raise it pleasure
and profit join to make it valuable and they who find the justest faults
have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness
of nature might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance

Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original it remains
to treat of the translation with the same view to the chief
characteristic As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem such
as the fable manners and sentiments no translator can prejudice it but
by wilful omissions or contractions As it also breaks out in every
particular image description and simile whoever lessens or too much
softens those takes off from this chief character It is the first grand
duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed and for the
rest the diction and versification only are his proper province since
these must be his own but the others he is to take as he finds them

It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in
our language for the graces of these in the Greek It is certain no
literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior
language but it is a great mistake to imagine as many have done that a
rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less
in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern
manners of expression If there be sometimes a darkness there is often a
light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost
literal I know no liberties one ought to take but those which are
necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original and supporting the
poetical style of the translation and I will venture to say there have
not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to
the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope
of raising and improving their author It is not to be doubted that the
fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is
most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be
content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without
endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular
place It is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when
poetical and figurative and it is what Homer will teach us if we will
but follow modestly in his footsteps Where his diction is bold and lofty
let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we
ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the
censure of a mere English critic Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to
have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of
his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the
sublime others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of
simplicity Methinks I see these different followers of Homer some
sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds the certain
signs of false mettle others slowly and servilely creeping in his train
while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and
equal majesty before them However of the two extremes one could sooner
pardon frenzy than frigidity no author is to be envied for such
commendations as he may gain by that character of style which his
friends must agree together to call simplicity and the rest of the world
will call dulness There is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well
as a bold and sordid one which differ as much from each other as the air
of a plain man from that of a sloven it is one thing to be tricked up
and another not to be dressed at all Simplicity is the mean between
ostentation and rusticity

This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the
Scripture and our author One may affirm with all respect to the inspired
writings that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words but what were
intelligible and common to men at that time and in that part of the
world and as Homer is the author nearest to those his style must of
course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any
other writer This consideration together with what has been observed of
the parity of some of his thoughts may methinks induce a translator on
the one hand to give in to several of those general phrases and manners
of expression which have attained a veneration even in our language from
being used in the Old Testament as on the other to avoid those which
have been appropriated to the Divinity and in a manner consigned to
mystery and religion

For a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care
should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and
proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet They have
something venerable and as I may say oracular in that unadorned gravity
and shortness with which they are delivered a grace which would be
utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious
that is a more modern turn in the paraphrase

Perhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of
Milton if done without too much affectation might not have an ill effect
in a version of this particular work which most of any other seems to
require a venerable antique cast But certainly the use of modern terms
of war and government such as platoon campaign junto or the like
into which some of his translators have fallen cannot be allowable
those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects
in any living language

There are two peculiarities in Homers diction which are a sort of marks
or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight those
who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects and those who
are seemed pleased with them as beauties I speak of his compound
epithets and of his repetitions Many of the former cannot be done
literally into English without destroying the purity of our language I
believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an
English compound without violence to the ear or to the received rules of
composition as well as those which have received a sanction from the
authority of our best poets and are become familiar through their use of
them such as the cloudcompelling Jove c As for the rest whenever
any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a
compounded one the course to be taken is obvious

Some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or
two words may have justice done them by circumlocution as the epithet
einosiphyllos to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated
literally leafshaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis
the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods Others that admit of
different significations may receive an advantage from a judicious
variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced For
example the epithet of Apollo hekaebolos or farshooting is capable
of two explications one literal in respect of the darts and bow the
ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the
sun therefore in such places where Apollo is represented as a god in
person I would use the former interpretation and where the effects of
the sun are described I would make choice of the latter Upon the whole
it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same
epithets which we find in Homer and which though it might be
accommodated as has been already shown to the ear of those times is by
no means so to ours but one may wait for opportunities of placing them
where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they
are employed and in doing this properly a translator may at once show
his fancy and his judgment

As for Homers repetitions we may divide them into three sorts of whole
narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse or
hemistitch I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these as
neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand nor to
offend the reader too much on the other The repetition is not ungraceful
in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of
insolence to alter his words as in the messages from gods to men or from
higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state or where the ceremonial
of religion seems to require it in the solemn forms of prayers oaths or
the like In other cases I believe the best rule is to be guided by the
nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the
original when they follow too close one may vary the expression but it
is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any
if they be tedious the author is to answer for it

It only remains to speak of the versification Homer as has been said is
perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on every new
subject This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry and
attainable by very few I only know of Homer eminent for it in the Greek
and Virgil in the Latin I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by
chance when a writer is warm and fully possessed of his image however
it may reasonably be believed they designed this in whose verse it so
manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others Few readers have
the ear to be judges of it but those who have will see I have
endeavoured at this beauty

Upon the whole I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice
to Homer I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain
without much vanity of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any
entire translation in verse has yet done We have only those of Chapman
Hobbes and Ogilby Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable
length of verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any paraphrase
more loose and rambling than his He has frequent interpolations of four
or six lines and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey
ver 312 where he has spun twenty verses out of two He is often mistaken
in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he
did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles
He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out
of his author insomuch as to promise in his rhyming preface a poem of
the mysteries he had revealed in Homer and perhaps he endeavoured to
strain the obvious sense to this end His expression is involved in
fustian a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings as
in the tragedy of Bussy dAmboise c In a word the nature of the man
may account for his whole performance for he appears from his preface
and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn and an enthusiast in
poetry His own boast of having finished half the Iliad in less than
fifteen weeks shows with what negligence his version was performed But
that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover
his defects is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which
is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ
before he arrived at years of discretion

Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general but for
particulars and circumstances he continually lops them and often omits
the most beautiful As for its being esteemed a close translation I doubt
not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which
proceeds not from his following the original line by line but from the
contractions above mentioned He sometimes omits whole similes and
sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes into which no writer of
his learning could have fallen but through carelessness His poetry as
well as Ogilbys is too mean for criticism

It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr Dryden did not live to
translate the Iliad He has left us only the first book and a small part
of the sixth in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the
sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of
the haste he was obliged to write in He seems to have had too much regard
to Chapman whose words he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed
him in passages where he wanders from the original However had he
translated the whole work I would no more have attempted Homer after him
than Virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is
the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language But the
fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers though they are
confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters they must be envied
and calumniated only for being at the head of it

That which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who
translates Homer is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire
which makes his chief character in particular places where the sense can
bear any doubt to follow the strongest and most poetical as most
agreeing with that character to copy him in all the variations of his
style and the different modulations of his numbers to preserve in the
more active or descriptive parts a warmth and elevation in the more
sedate or narrative a plainness and solemnity in the speeches a fulness
and perspicuity in the sentences a shortness and gravity not to neglect
even the little figures and turns on the words nor sometimes the very
cast of the periods neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of
antiquity perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass
than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved
either the sense or poetry What I would further recommend to him is to
study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how
learned soever or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the
world to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the
ancients and with Milton above all the moderns Next these the
Archbishop of Cambrays Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the
spirit and turn of our author and Bossus admirable Treatise of the Epic
Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct But after all with
whatever judgment and study a man may proceed or with whatever happiness
he may perform such a work he must hope to please but a few those only
who have at once a taste of poetry and competent learning For to satisfy
such a want either is not in the nature of this undertaking since a mere
modern wit can like nothing that is not modern and a pedant nothing that
is not Greek

What I have done is submitted to the public from whose opinions I am
prepared to learn though I fear no judges so little as our best poets
who are most sensible of the weight of this task As for the worst
whatever they shall please to say they may give me some concern as they
are unhappy men but none as they are malignant writers I was guided in
this translation by judgments very different from theirs and by persons
for whom they can have no kindness if an old observation be true that
the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit Mr
Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task
who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as I
cannot repeat without vanity I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a
very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public Dr Swift
promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his
friend The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never
knew wanting on any occasion I must also acknowledge with infinite
pleasure the many friendly offices as well as sincere criticisms of Mr
Congreve who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer I
must add the names of Mr Rowe and Dr Parnell though I shall take a
further opportunity of doing justice to the last whose good nature to
give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning The
favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them
so true an affection But what can I say of the honour so many of the
great have done me while the first names of the age appear as my
subscribers and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning
as my chief encouragers Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to
find that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to
the name of poet that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased
I should undertake the author to whom he has given in his excellent
Essay so complete a praise

  Read Homer once and you can read no more
  For all books else appear so mean so poor
  Verse will seem prose but still persist to read
  And Homer will be all the books you need

That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me of whom it is
hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to
his generosity or his example that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke
not more distinguished in the great scenes of business than in all the
useful and entertaining parts of learning has not refused to be the
critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer and that the noble
author of the tragedy of Heroic Love has continued his partiality to me
from my writing pastorals to my attempting the Iliad I cannot deny myself
the pride of confessing that I have had the advantage not only of their
advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several
particulars of this translation

I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the
Earl of Carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particularize any one
generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of
them Mr Stanhope the present secretary of state will pardon my desire
of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair The
particular zeal of Mr Harcourt the son of the late Lord Chancellor gave
me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his friendship I must
attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends to whom
all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a
familiar correspondence and I am satisfied I can no way better oblige men
of their turn than by my silence

In short I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted He would have
thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that has been
shown me by its learned rival the University of Oxford And I can hardly
envy him those pompous honours he received after death when I reflect on
the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations and easy friendships
which make the satisfaction of life This distinction is the more to be
acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the
prejudices of particular parties or the vanities of particular men
Whatever the success may prove I shall never repent of an undertaking in
which I have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of
merit and in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that are
generally lost in a circle of follies after a manner neither wholly
unuseful to others nor disagreeable to myself

ARGUMENT40

THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON

In the war of Troy the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring
towns and taken from thence two beautiful captives Chryseis and Briseis
allotted the first to Agamemnon and the last to Achilles Chryses the
father of Chryseis and priest of Apollo comes to the Grecian camp to
ransom her with which the action of the poem opens in the tenth year of
the siege The priest being refused and insolently dismissed by
Agamemnon entreats for vengeance from his god who inflicts a pestilence
on the Greeks Achilles calls a council and encourages Chalcas to declare
the cause of it who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseis The king
being obliged to send back his captive enters into a furious contest with
Achilles which Nestor pacifies however as he had the absolute command
of the army he seizes on Briseis in revenge Achilles in discontent
withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks and
complaining to Thetis she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of
the wrong done to her son by giving victory to the Trojans Jupiter
granting her suit incenses Juno between whom the debate runs high till
they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan

The time of twoandtwenty days is taken up in this book nine during the
plague one in the council and quarrel of the princes and twelve for
Jupiters stay with the Ćthiopians at whose return Thetis prefers her
petition The scene lies in the Grecian camp then changes to Chrysa and
lastly to Olympus

  Achilles wrath to Greece the direful spring
  Of woes unnumberd heavenly goddess sing
  That wrath which hurld to Plutos gloomy reign
  The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain
  Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore
  Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore41
  Since great Achilles and Atrides strove
  Such was the sovereign doom and such the will of Jove42

  Declare O Muse in what illfated hour43
  Sprung the fierce strife from what offended power
  Latonas son a dire contagion spread44
  And heapd the camp with mountains of the dead
  The king of men his reverent priest defied45
  And for the kings offence the people died

  For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
  His captive daughter from the victors chain
  Suppliant the venerable father stands
  Apollos awful ensigns grace his hands
  By these he begs and lowly bending down
  Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
  He sued to all but chief implored for grace
  The brotherkings of Atreus royal race46

  Ye kings and warriors may your vows be crownd
  And Troys proud walls lie level with the ground
  May Jove restore you when your toils are oer
  Safe to the pleasures of your native shore
  But oh relieve a wretched parents pain
  And give Chryseis to these arms again
  If mercy fail yet let my presents move
  And dread avenging Phoebus son of Jove

  The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare
  The priest to reverence and release the fair
  Not so Atrides he with kingly pride
  Repulsed the sacred sire and thus replied

  Hence on thy life and fly these hostile plains
  Nor ask presumptuous what the king detains
  Hence with thy laurel crown and golden rod
  Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god
  Mine is thy daughter priest and shall remain
  And prayers and tears and bribes shall plead in vain
  Till time shall rifle every youthful grace
  And age dismiss her from my cold embrace
  In daily labours of the loom employd
  Or doomd to deck the bed she once enjoyd
  Hence then to Argos shall the maid retire
  Far from her native soil and weeping sire

  The trembling priest along the shore returnd
  And in the anguish of a father mournd
  Disconsolate not daring to complain
  Silent he wanderd by the sounding main
  Till safe at distance to his god he prays
  The god who darts around the world his rays

  O Smintheus sprung from fair Latonas line47
  Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine48
  Thou source of light whom Tenedos adores
  And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysas shores
  If eer with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane49
  Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain
  God of the silver bow thy shafts employ
  Avenge thy servant and the Greeks destroy

  Thus Chryses praydthe favouring power attends
  And from Olympus lofty tops descends
  Bent was his bow the Grecian hearts to wound50
  Fierce as he moved his silver shafts resound
  Breathing revenge a sudden night he spread
  And gloomy darkness rolld about his head
  The fleet in view he twangd his deadly bow
  And hissing fly the featherd fates below
  On mules and dogs the infection first began51
  And last the vengeful arrows fixd in man
  For nine long nights through all the dusky air
  The pyres thickflaming shot a dismal glare
  But ere the tenth revolving day was run
  Inspired by Juno Thetis godlike son
  Convened to council all the Grecian train
  For much the goddess mournd her heroes slain52
  The assembly seated rising oer the rest
  Achilles thus the king of men addressd

  Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore
  And measure back the seas we crossd before
  The plague destroying whom the sword would spare
  Tis time to save the few remains of war
  But let some prophet or some sacred sage
  Explore the cause of great Apollos rage
  Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove
  By mystic dreams for dreams descend from Jove53
  If broken vows this heavy curse have laid
  Let altars smoke and hecatombs be paid
  So Heaven atoned shall dying Greece restore
  And Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more

  He said and sat when Chalcas thus replied
  Chalcas the wise the Grecian priest and guide
  That sacred seer whose comprehensive view
  The past the present and the future knew
  Uprising slow the venerable sage
  Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age

  Beloved of Jove Achilles wouldst thou know
  Why angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow
  First give thy faith and plight a princes word
  Of sure protection by thy power and sword
  For I must speak what wisdom would conceal
  And truths invidious to the great reveal
  Bold is the task when subjects grown too wise
  Instruct a monarch where his error lies
  For though we deem the shortlived fury past
  Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last
  To whom PelidesFrom thy inmost soul
  Speak what thou knowst and speak without control
  Een by that god I swear who rules the day
  To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey
  And whose blessd oracles thy lips declare
  Long as Achilles breathes this vital air
  No daring Greek of all the numerous band
  Against his priest shall lift an impious hand
  Not een the chief by whom our hosts are led
  The king of kings shall touch that sacred head

  Encouraged thus the blameless man replies
  Nor vows unpaid nor slighted sacrifice
  But he our chief provoked the raging pest
  Apollos vengeance for his injured priest
  Nor will the gods awakend fury cease
  But plagues shall spread and funeral fires increase
  Till the great king without a ransom paid
  To her own Chrysa send the blackeyed maid54
  Perhaps with added sacrifice and prayer
  The priest may pardon and the god may spare

  The prophet spoke when with a gloomy frown
  The monarch started from his shining throne
  Black choler filld his breast that boild with ire
  And from his eyeballs flashd the living fire
  Augur accursed denouncing mischief still
  Prophet of plagues for ever boding ill
  Still must that tongue some wounding message bring
  And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king
  For this are Phoebus oracles explored
  To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord
  For this with falsehood is my honour staind
  Is heaven offended and a priest profaned
  Because my prize my beauteous maid I hold
  And heavenly charms prefer to profferd gold
  A maid unmatchd in manners as in face
  Skilld in each art and crownd with every grace
  Not half so dear were Clytaemnestras charms
  When first her blooming beauties blessd my arms
  Yet if the gods demand her let her sail
  Our cares are only for the public weal
  Let me be deemd the hateful cause of all
  And suffer rather than my people fall
  The prize the beauteous prize I will resign
  So dearly valued and so justly mine
  But since for common good I yield the fair
  My private loss let grateful Greece repair
  Nor unrewarded let your prince complain
  That he alone has fought and bled in vain
  Insatiate king Achilles thus replies
  Fond of the power but fonder of the prize
  Wouldst thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield
  The due reward of many a wellfought field

  The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain
  We share with justice as with toil we gain
  But to resume whateer thy avarice craves
  That trick of tyrants may be borne by slaves
  Yet if our chief for plunder only fight
  The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite
  Wheneer by Joves decree our conquering powers
  Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers

  Then thus the king Shall I my prize resign
  With tame content and thou possessd of thine
  Great as thou art and like a god in fight
  Think not to rob me of a soldiers right
  At thy demand shall I restore the maid
  First let the just equivalent be paid
  Such as a king might ask and let it be
  A treasure worthy her and worthy me
  Or grant me this or with a monarchs claim
  This hand shall seize some other captive dame
  The mighty Ajax shall his prize resign55
  Ulysses spoils or even thy own be mine
  The man who suffers loudly may complain
  And rage he may but he shall rage in vain
  But this when time requiresIt now remains
  We launch a bark to plough the watery plains
  And waft the sacrifice to Chrysas shores
  With chosen pilots and with labouring oars
  Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend
  And some deputed prince the charge attend
  This Cretas king or Ajax shall fulfil
  Or wise Ulysses see performd our will
  Or if our royal pleasure shall ordain
  Achilles self conduct her oer the main
  Let fierce Achilles dreadful in his rage
  The god propitiate and the pest assuage

  And now the example of the third remaind
  All viewd with awe the venerable man
  Who thus with mild benevolence began

  What shame what woe is this to Greece what joy
  To Troys proud monarch and the friends of Troy
  That adverse gods commit to stern debate
  The best the bravest of the Grecian state
  Young as ye are this youthful heat restrain
  Nor think your Nestors years and wisdom vain
  A godlike race of heroes once I knew
  Such as no more these aged eyes shall view
  Lives there a chief to match Pirithous fame
  Dryas the bold or Ceneus deathless name
  Theseus endued with more than mortal might
  Or Polyphemus like the gods in fight
  With these of old to toils of battle bred
  In early youth my hardy days I led
  Fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds
  And smit with love of honourable deeds
  Strongest of men they pierced the mountain boar
  Ranged the wild deserts red with monsters gore
  And from their hills the shaggy Centaurs tore
  Yet these with soft persuasive arts I swayd
  When Nestor spoke they listend and obeyd
  If in my youth even these esteemd me wise
  Do you young warriors hear my age advise
  Atrides seize not on the beauteous slave
  That prize the Greeks by common suffrage gave
  Nor thou Achilles treat our prince with pride
  Let kings be just and sovereign power preside
  Thee the first honours of the war adorn
  Like gods in strength and of a goddess born
  Him awful majesty exalts above
  The powers of earth and sceptred sons of Jove
  Let both unite with wellconsenting mind
  So shall authority with strength be joind
  Leave me O king to calm Achilles rage
  Rule thou thyself as more advanced in age
  Forbid it gods Achilles should be lost
  The pride of Greece and bulwark of our host

  This said he ceased The king of men replies
  Thy years are awful and thy words are wise
  But that imperious that unconquerd soul
  No laws can limit no respect control
  Before his pride must his superiors fall
  His word the law and he the lord of all
  Him must our hosts our chiefs ourself obey
  What king can bear a rival in his sway
  Grant that the gods his matchless force have given
  Has foul reproach a privilege from heaven

  Here on the monarchs speech Achilles broke
  And furious thus and interrupting spoke
  Tyrant I well deserved thy galling chain
  To live thy slave and still to serve in vain
  Should I submit to each unjust decree
  Command thy vassals but command not me
  Seize on Briseis whom the Grecians doomd
  My prize of war yet tamely see resumed
  And seize secure no more Achilles draws
  His conquering sword in any womans cause
  The gods command me to forgive the past
  But let this first invasion be the last
  For know thy blood when next thou darest invade
  Shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade

  At this they ceased the stern debate expired
  The chiefs in sullen majesty retired

  Achilles with Patroclus took his way
  Where near his tents his hollow vessels lay
  Meantime Atrides launchd with numerous oars
  A wellriggd ship for Chrysas sacred shores
  High on the deck was fair Chryseis placed
  And sage Ulysses with the conduct graced
  Safe in her sides the hecatomb they stowd
  Then swiftly sailing cut the liquid road

  The host to expiate next the king prepares
  With pure lustrations and with solemn prayers
  Washd by the briny wave the pious train59
  Are cleansed and cast the ablutions in the main
  Along the shore whole hecatombs were laid
  And bulls and goats to Phoebus altars paid
  The sable fumes in curling spires arise
  And waft their grateful odours to the skies

  The army thus in sacred rites engaged
  Atrides still with deep resentment raged
  To wait his will two sacred heralds stood
  Talthybius and Eurybates the good
  Haste to the fierce Achilles tent he cries
  Thence bear Briseis as our royal prize
  Submit he must or if they will not part
  Ourself in arms shall tear her from his heart

  The unwilling heralds act their lords commands
  Pensive they walk along the barren sands
  Arrived the hero in his tent they find
  With gloomy aspect on his arm reclined
  At awful distance long they silent stand
  Loth to advance and speak their hard command
  Decent confusion This the godlike man
  Perceived and thus with accent mild began

  With leave and honour enter our abodes
  Ye sacred ministers of men and gods60
  I know your message by constraint you came
  Not you but your imperious lord I blame
  Patroclus haste the fair Briseis bring
  Conduct my captive to the haughty king
  But witness heralds and proclaim my vow
  Witness to gods above and men below
  But first and loudest to your prince declare
  That lawless tyrant whose commands you bear
  Unmoved as death Achilles shall remain
  Though prostrate Greece shall bleed at every vein
  The raging chief in frantic passion lost
  Blind to himself and useless to his host
  Unskilld to judge the future by the past
  In blood and slaughter shall repent at last

  Patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought
  She in soft sorrows and in pensive thought
  Passd silent as the heralds held her hand
  And of lookd back slowmoving oer the strand
  Not so his loss the fierce Achilles bore
  But sad retiring to the sounding shore
  Oer the wild margin of the deep he hung
  That kindred deep from whence his mother sprung61
  There bathed in tears of anger and disdain
  Thus loud lamented to the stormy main

  O parent goddess since in early bloom
  Thy son must fall by too severe a doom
  Sure to so short a race of glory born
  Great Jove in justice should this span adorn
  Honour and fame at least the thunderer owed
  And ill he pays the promise of a god
  If yon proud monarch thus thy son defies
  Obscures my glories and resumes my prize

  Far from the deep recesses of the main
  Where aged Ocean holds his watery reign
  The goddessmother heard The waves divide
  And like a mist she rose above the tide
  Beheld him mourning on the naked shores
  And thus the sorrows of his soul explores
  Why grieves my son Thy anguish let me share
  Reveal the cause and trust a parents care

  He deeply sighing said To tell my woe
  Is but to mention what too well you know
  From Thebe sacred to Apollos name62
  Aetions realm our conquering army came
  With treasure loaded and triumphant spoils
  Whose just division crownd the soldiers toils
  But bright Chryseis heavenly prize was led
  By vote selected to the generals bed
  The priest of Phoebus sought by gifts to gain
  His beauteous daughter from the victors chain
  The fleet he reachd and lowly bending down
  Held forth the sceptre and the laurel crown
  Intreating all but chief implored for grace
  The brotherkings of Atreus royal race
  The generous Greeks their joint consent declare
  The priest to reverence and release the fair
  Not so Atrides he with wonted pride
  The sire insulted and his gifts denied
  The insulted sire his gods peculiar care
  To Phoebus prayd and Phoebus heard the prayer
  A dreadful plague ensues the avenging darts
  Incessant fly and pierce the Grecian hearts
  A prophet then inspired by heaven arose
  And points the crime and thence derives the woes
  Myself the first the assembled chiefs incline
  To avert the vengeance of the power divine
  Then rising in his wrath the monarch stormd
  Incensed he threatend and his threats performd
  The fair Chryseis to her sire was sent
  With offerd gifts to make the god relent
  But now he seized Briseis heavenly charms
  And of my valours prize defrauds my arms
  Defrauds the votes of all the Grecian train63
  And service faith and justice plead in vain
  But goddess thou thy suppliant son attend
  To high Olympus shining court ascend
  Urge all the ties to former service owed
  And sue for vengeance to the thundering god
  Oft hast thou triumphd in the glorious boast
  That thou stoodst forth of all the ethereal host
  When bold rebellion shook the realms above
  The undaunted guard of cloudcompelling Jove
  When the bright partner of his awful reign
  The warlike maid and monarch of the main
  The traitorgods by mad ambition driven
  Durst threat with chains the omnipotence of Heaven
  Then calld by thee the monster Titan came
  Whom gods Briareus men Ćgeon name
  Through wondering skies enormous stalkd along
  Not he that shakes the solid earth so strong
  With giantpride at Joves high throne he stands
  And brandishd round him all his hundred hands
  The affrighted gods confessd their awful lord
  They droppd the fetters trembled and adored64
  This goddess this to his remembrance call
  Embrace his knees at his tribunal fall
  Conjure him far to drive the Grecian train
  To hurl them headlong to their fleet and main
  To heap the shores with copious death and bring
  The Greeks to know the curse of such a king
  Let Agamemnon lift his haughty head
  Oer all his wide dominion of the dead
  And mourn in blood that eer he durst disgrace
  The boldest warrior of the Grecian race

  Unhappy son fair Thetis thus replies
  While tears celestial trickle from her eyes
  Why have I borne thee with a mothers throes
  To Fates averse and nursed for future woes65
  So short a space the light of heaven to view
  So short a space and filld with sorrow too
  O might a parents careful wish prevail
  Far far from Ilion should thy vessels sail
  And thou from camps remote the danger shun
  Which now alas too nearly threats my son
  Yet what I can to move thy suit Ill go
  To great Olympus crownd with fleecy snow
  Meantime secure within thy ships from far
  Behold the field not mingle in the war
  The sire of gods and all the ethereal train
  On the warm limits of the farthest main
  Now mix with mortals nor disdain to grace
  The feasts of Ćthiopias blameless race66
  Twelve days the powers indulge the genial rite
  Returning with the twelfth revolving light
  Then will I mount the brazen dome and move
  The high tribunal of immortal Jove

  The goddess spoke the rolling waves unclose
  Then down the steep she plunged from whence she rose
  And left him sorrowing on the lonely coast
  In wild resentment for the fair he lost

  In Chrysas port now sage Ulysses rode
  Beneath the deck the destined victims stowd
  The sails they furld they lash the mast aside
  And droppd their anchors and the pinnace tied
  Next on the shore their hecatomb they land
  Chryseis last descending on the strand
  Her thus returning from the furrowd main
  Ulysses led to Phoebus sacred fane
  Where at his solemn altar as the maid
  He gave to Chryses thus the hero said

  Hail reverend priest to Phoebus awful dome
  A suppliant I from great Atrides come
  Unransomd here receive the spotless fair
  Accept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare
  And may thy god who scatters darts around
  Atoned by sacrifice desist to wound67

  At this the sire embraced the maid again
  So sadly lost so lately sought in vain
  Then near the altar of the darting king
  Disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring
  With water purify their hands and take
  The sacred offering of the salted cake
  While thus with arms devoutly raised in air
  And solemn voice the priest directs his prayer

  God of the silver bow thy ear incline
  Whose power incircles Cilla the divine
  Whose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveys
  And gilds fair Chrysa with distinguishd rays
  If fired to vengeance at thy priests request
  Thy direful darts inflict the raging pest
  Once more attend avert the wasteful woe
  And smile propitious and unbend thy bow

  So Chryses prayd Apollo heard his prayer
  And now the Greeks their hecatomb prepare
  Between their horns the salted barley threw
  And with their heads to heaven the victims slew68
  The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide
  The thighs selected to the gods divide
  On these in double cauls involved with art
  The choicest morsels lay from every part
  The priest himself before his altar stands
  And burns the offering with his holy hands
  Pours the black wine and sees the flames aspire
  The youth with instruments surround the fire
  The thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dressd
  The assistants part transfix and roast the rest
  Then spread the tables the repast prepare
  Each takes his seat and each receives his share
  When now the rage of hunger was repressd
  With pure libations they conclude the feast
  The youths with wine the copious goblets crownd
  And pleased dispense the flowing bowls around69
  With hymns divine the joyous banquet ends
  The paeans lengthend till the sun descends
  The Greeks restored the grateful notes prolong
  Apollo listens and approves the song

  Twas night the chiefs beside their vessel lie
  Till rosy morn had purpled oer the sky
  Then launch and hoist the mast indulgent gales
  Supplied by Phoebus fill the swelling sails
  The milkwhite canvas bellying as they blow
  The parted ocean foams and roars below
  Above the bounding billows swift they flew
  Till now the Grecian camp appeard in view
  Far on the beach they haul their bark to land
  The crooked keel divides the yellow sand
  Then part where stretchd along the winding bay
  The ships and tents in mingled prospect lay

  But raging still amidst his navy sat
  The stern Achilles stedfast in his hate
  Nor mixd in combat nor in council joind
  But wasting cares lay heavy on his mind
  In his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll
  And scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul

  Twelve days were past and now the dawning light
  The gods had summond to the Olympian height
  Jove first ascending from the watery bowers
  Leads the long order of ethereal powers
  When like the morningmist in early day
  Rose from the flood the daughter of the sea
  And to the seats divine her flight addressd
  There far apart and high above the rest
  The thunderer sat where old Olympus shrouds
  His hundred heads in heaven and props the clouds
  Suppliant the goddess stood one hand she placed
  Beneath his beard and one his knees embraced
  If eer O father of the gods she said
  My words could please thee or my actions aid
  Some marks of honour on my son bestow
  And pay in glory what in life you owe
  Fame is at least by heavenly promise due
  To life so short and now dishonourd too
  Avenge this wrong O ever just and wise
  Let Greece be humbled and the Trojans rise
  Till the proud king and all the Achaian race
  Shall heap with honours him they now disgrace

  Thus Thetis spoke but Jove in silence held
  The sacred counsels of his breast conceald
  Not so repulsed the goddess closer pressd
  Still graspd his knees and urged the dear request
  O sire of gods and men thy suppliant hear
  Refuse or grant for what has Jove to fear
  Or oh declare of all the powers above
  Is wretched Thetis least the care of Jove

  She said and sighing thus the god replies
  Who rolls the thunder oer the vaulted skies

  What hast thou askd ah why should Jove engage
  In foreign contests and domestic rage
  The gods complaints and Junos fierce alarms
  While I too partial aid the Trojan arms
  Go lest the haughty partner of my sway
  With jealous eyes thy close access survey
  But part in peace secure thy prayer is sped
  Witness the sacred honours of our head
  The nod that ratifies the will divine
  The faithful fixd irrevocable sign
  This seals thy suit and this fulfils thy vows
  He spoke and awful bends his sable brows70
  Shakes his ambrosial curls and gives the nod
  The stamp of fate and sanction of the god
  High heaven with trembling the dread signal took
  And all Olympus to the centre shook71

  Swift to the seas profound the goddess flies
  Jove to his starry mansions in the skies
  The shining synod of the immortals wait
  The coming god and from their thrones of state
  Arising silent wrappd in holy fear
  Before the majesty of heaven appear
  Trembling they stand while Jove assumes the throne
  All but the gods imperious queen alone
  Late had she viewd the silverfooted dame
  And all her passions kindled into flame
  Say artful manager of heaven she cries
  Who now partakes the secrets of the skies
  Thy Juno knows not the decrees of fate
  In vain the partner of imperial state
  What favourite goddess then those cares divides
  Which Jove in prudence from his consort hides

  To this the thunderer Seek not thou to find
  The sacred counsels of almighty mind
  Involved in darkness likes the great decree
  Nor can the depths of fate be pierced by thee
  What fits thy knowledge thou the first shalt know
  The first of gods above and men below
  But thou nor they shall search the thoughts that roll
  Deep in the close recesses of my soul

  Rolld the large orbs of her majestic eyes
  And thus returndAustere Saturnius say
  From whence this wrath or who controls thy sway
  Thy boundless will for me remains in force
  And all thy counsels take the destined course
  But tis for Greece I fear for late was seen
  In close consult the silverfooted queen
  Jove to his Thetis nothing could deny
  Nor was the signal vain that shook the sky
  What fatal favour has the goddess won
  To grace her fierce inexorable son
  Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plain
  And glut his vengeance with my people slain

  Then thus the god O restless fate of pride
  That strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide
  Vain is the search presumptuous and abhorrd
  Anxious to thee and odious to thy lord
  Let this suffice the immutable decree
  No force can shake what is that ought to be
  Goddess submit nor dare our will withstand
  But dread the power of this avenging hand
  The united strength of all the gods above
  In vain resists the omnipotence of Jove

  His mother menaced and the gods in awe

  Thus interposed the architect divine

  Vulcan with awkward grace his office plies
  And unextinguishd laughter shakes the skies

  Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong
  In feasts ambrosial and celestial song75
  Apollo tuned the lyre the Muses round
  With voice alternate aid the silver sound
  Meantime the radiant sun to mortal sight

  And Juno slumberd on the golden bed

ARGUMENT

THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES

Jupiter in pursuance of the request of Thetis sends a deceitful vision
to Agamemnon persuading him to lead the army to battle in order to make
the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles The general who is deluded
with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance but fears the army
was discouraged by his absence and the late plague as well as by the
length of time contrives to make trial of their disposition by a
stratagem He first communicates his design to the princes in council
that he would propose a return to the soldiers and that they should put a
stop to them if the proposal was embraced Then he assembles the whole
host and upon moving for a return to Greece they unanimously agree to
it and run to prepare the ships They are detained by the management of
Ulysses who chastises the insolence of Thersites The assembly is
recalled several speeches made on the occasion and at length the advice
of Nestor followed which was to make a general muster of the troops and
to divide them into their several nations before they proceeded to
battle This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the
Greeks and Trojans and in a large catalogue

The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day The scene
lies in the Grecian camp and upon the seashore towards the end it
removes to Troy

  Now pleasing sleep had seald each mortal eye
  Stretchd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie
  The immortals slumberd on their thrones above
  All but the everwakeful eyes of Jove76
  To honour Thetis son he bends his care
  And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war
  Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight
  And thus commands the vision of the night

  Fly hence deluding Dream and light as air77
  To Agamemnons ample tent repair
  Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train
  Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain
  Declare een now tis given him to destroy
  The lofty towers of wideextended Troy
  For now no more the gods with fate contend
  At Junos suit the heavenly factions end
  Destruction hangs oer yon devoted wall
  And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall

  Swift as the word the vain illusion fled
  Descends and hovers oer Atrides head
  Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage
  Renownd for wisdom and revered for age
  Around his temples spreads his golden wing
  And thus the flattering dream deceives the king

  For now no more the gods with fate contend
  At Junos suit the heavenly factions end
  Destruction hangs oer yon devoted wall
  And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall
  Awake but waking this advice approve
  And trust the vision that descends from Jove

  The phantom said then vanishd from his sight
  Resolves to air and mixes with the night
  A thousand schemes the monarchs mind employ
  Elate in thought he sacks untaken Troy
  Vain as he was and to the future blind
  Nor saw what Jove and secret fate designd
  What mighty toils to either host remain
  What scenes of grief and numbers of the slain
  Eager he rises and in fancy hears
  The voice celestial murmuring in his ears
  First on his limbs a slender vest he drew
  Around him next the regal mantle threw
  The embroiderd sandals on his feet were tied
  The starry falchion glitterd at his side
  And last his arm the massy sceptre loads
  Unstaind immortal and the gift of gods

  Now rosy Morn ascends the court of Jove
  Lifts up her light and opens day above
  The king despatchd his heralds with commands
  To range the camp and summon all the bands
  The gathering hosts the monarchs word obey
  While to the fleet Atrides bends his way
  In his black ship the Pylian prince he found
  There calls a senate of the peers around
  The assembly placed the king of men expressd
  The counsels labouring in his artful breast

  Friends and confederates with attentive ear
  Receive my words and credit what you hear
  Late as I slumberd in the shades of night
  A dream divine appeard before my sight
  Whose visionary form like Nestor came
  The same in habit and in mien the same80
  The heavenly phantom hoverd oer my head
  And dost thou sleep O Atreus son he said
  Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides
  Directs in council and in war presides
  To whom its safety a whole people owes
  To waste long nights in indolent repose
  Monarch awake tis Joves command I bear
  Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care
  In just array draw forth the embattled train
  And lead the Grecians to the dusty plain
  Een now O king tis given thee to destroy
  The lofty towers of wideextended Troy
  For now no more the gods with fate contend
  At Junos suit the heavenly factions end
  Destruction hangs oer yon devoted wall
  And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall

  This hear observant and the gods obey
  The vision spoke and passd in air away
  Now valiant chiefs since heaven itself alarms
  Unite and rouse the sons of Greece to arms
  But first with caution try what yet they dare
  Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war
  To move the troops to measure back the main
  Be mine and yours the province to detain

  He spoke and sat when Nestor rising said
  Nestor whom Pylos sandy realms obeyd
  Princes of Greece your faithful ears incline
  Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine
  Sent by great Jove to him who rules the host
  Forbid it heaven this warning should be lost
  Then let us haste obey the gods alarms
  And join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms

  Thus spoke the sage the kings without delay
  Dissolve the council and their chief obey
  The sceptred rulers lead the following host
  Pourd forth by thousands darkens all the coast
  As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees
  Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees
  Rolling and blackening swarms succeeding swarms
  With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms
  Dusky they spread a close embodied crowd
  And oer the vale descends the living cloud81
  So from the tents and ships a lengthend train
  Spreads all the beach and wide oershades the plain
  Along the region runs a deafening sound
  Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground
  Fame flies before the messenger of Jove
  And shining soars and claps her wings above
  Nine sacred heralds now proclaiming loud82
  The monarchs will suspend the listening crowd
  Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear
  And fainter murmurs died upon the ear
  The king of kings his awful figure raised
  High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed
  The golden sceptre of celestial flame
  By Vulcan formd from Jove to Hermes came
  To Pelops he the immortal gift resignd
  The immortal gift great Pelops left behind
  In Atreus hand which not with Atreus ends
  To rich Thyestes next the prize descends
  And now the mark of Agamemnons reign
  Subjects all Argos and controls the main83

  On this bright sceptre now the king reclined
  And artful thus pronounced the speech designd
  Ye sons of Mars partake your leaders care
  Heroes of Greece and brothers of the war
  Of partial Jove with justice I complain
  And heavenly oracles believed in vain
  A safe return was promised to our toils
  Renownd triumphant and enrichd with spoils
  Now shameful flight alone can save the host
  Our blood our treasure and our glory lost
  So Jove decrees resistless lord of all
  At whose command whole empires rise or fall
  He shakes the feeble props of human trust
  And towns and armies humbles to the dust
  What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage
  Oh lasting shame in every future age
  Once great in arms the common scorn we grow
  Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe
  So small their number that if wars were ceased
  And Greece triumphant held a general feast
  All rankd by tens whole decades when they dine
  Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine84
  But other forces have our hopes oerthrown
  And Troy prevails by armies not her own
  Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run
  Since first the labours of this war begun
  Our cordage torn decayd our vessels lie
  And scarce insure the wretched power to fly
  Haste then for ever leave the Trojan wall
  Our weeping wives our tender children call
  Love duty safety summon us away
  Tis natures voice and nature we obey
  Our shatterd barks may yet transport us oer
  Safe and inglorious to our native shore
  Fly Grecians fly your sails and oars employ
  And dream no more of heavendefended Troy

  His deep design unknown the hosts approve
  Atrides speech The mighty numbers move
  So roll the billows to the Icarian shore
  From east and south when winds begin to roar
  Burst their dark mansions in the clouds and sweep
  The whitening surface of the ruffled deep
  And as on corn when western gusts descend85
  Before the blast the lofty harvests bend
  Thus oer the field the moving host appears
  With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears
  The gathering murmur spreads their trampling feet
  Beat the loose sands and thicken to the fleet
  With longresounding cries they urge the train
  To fit the ships and launch into the main
  They toil they sweat thick clouds of dust arise
  The doubling clamours echo to the skies
  Een then the Greeks had left the hostile plain
  And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain
  But Joves imperial queen their flight surveyd
  And sighing thus bespoke the blueeyed maid

  Shall then the Grecians fly O dire disgrace
  And leave unpunishd this perfidious race
  Shall Troy shall Priam and the adulterous spouse
  In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows
  And bravest chiefs in Helens quarrel slain
  Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain
  No let my Greeks unmoved by vain alarms
  Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms
  Haste goddess haste the flying host detain
  Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main

  Pallas obeys and from Olympus height
  Swift to the ships precipitates her flight
  Ulysses first in public cares she found
  For prudent counsel like the gods renownd
  Oppressd with generous grief the hero stood
  Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood
  And is it thus divine Laertes son
  Thus fly the Greeks the martial maid begun
  Thus to their country bear their own disgrace
  And fame eternal leave to Priams race
  Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed
  Still unrevenged a thousand heroes bleed
  Haste generous Ithacus prevent the shame
  Recall your armies and your chiefs reclaim
  Your own resistless eloquence employ
  And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy

  The voice divine confessd the warlike maid
  Ulysses heard nor uninspired obeyd
  Then meeting first Atrides from his hand
  Received the imperial sceptre of command
  Thus graced attention and respect to gain
  He runs he flies through all the Grecian train
  Each prince of name or chief in arms approved
  He fired with praise or with persuasion moved

  Warriors like you with strength and wisdom blessd
  By brave examples should confirm the rest
  The monarchs will not yet reveald appears
  He tries our courage but resents our fears
  The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke
  Not thus the king in secret council spoke
  Jove loves our chief from Jove his honour springs
  Beware for dreadful is the wrath of kings

  But if a clamorous vile plebeian rose
  Him with reproof he checkd or tamed with blows
  Be still thou slave and to thy betters yield
  Unknown alike in council and in field
  Ye gods what dastards would our host command
  Swept to the war the lumber of a land
  Be silent wretch and think not here allowd
  That worst of tyrants an usurping crowd
  To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway
  His are the laws and him let all obey86

  With words like these the troops Ulysses ruled
  The loudest silenced and the fiercest coold
  Back to the assembly roll the thronging train
  Desert the ships and pour upon the plain
  Murmuring they move as when old ocean roars
  And heaves huge surges to the trembling shores
  The groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound
  The rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound
  At length the tumult sinks the noises cease
  And a still silence lulls the camp to peace
  Thersites only clamourd in the throng
  Loquacious loud and turbulent of tongue
  Awed by no shame by no respect controlld
  In scandal busy in reproaches bold
  With witty malice studious to defame
  Scorn all his joy and laughter all his aim
  But chief he gloried with licentious style
  To lash the great and monarchs to revile
  His figure such as might his soul proclaim
  One eye was blinking and one leg was lame
  His mountain shoulders half his breast oerspread
  Thin hairs bestrewd his long misshapen head
  Spleen to mankind his envious heart possessd
  And much he hated all but most the best
  Ulysses or Achilles still his theme
  But royal scandal his delight supreme
  Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek
  Vexd when he spoke yet still they heard him speak
  Sharp was his voice which in the shrillest tone
  Thus with injurious taunts attackd the throne

  Amidst the glories of so bright a reign
  What moves the great Atrides to complain
  Tis thine whateer the warriors breast inflames
  The golden spoil and thine the lovely dames
  With all the wealth our wars and blood bestow
  Thy tents are crowded and thy chests oerflow
  Thus at full ease in heaps of riches rolld
  What grieves the monarch Is it thirst of gold
  Say shall we march with our unconquerd powers
  The Greeks and I to Ilions hostile towers
  And bring the race of royal bastards here
  For Troy to ransom at a price too dear
  But safer plunder thy own host supplies
  Say wouldst thou seize some valiant leaders prize
  Or if thy heart to generous love be led
  Some captive fair to bless thy kingly bed
  Whateer our master craves submit we must
  Plagued with his pride or punishd for his lust
  Oh women of Achaia men no more
  Hence let us fly and let him waste his store
  In loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore
  We may be wanted on some busy day
  When Hector comes so great Achilles may
  From him he forced the prize we jointly gave
  From him the fierce the fearless and the brave
  And durst he as he ought resent that wrong
  This mighty tyrant were no tyrant long

  Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs87
  In generous vengeance of the king of kings
  With indignation sparkling in his eyes
  He views the wretch and sternly thus replies

  Peace factious monster born to vex the state
  With wrangling talents formd for foul debate
  Curb that impetuous tongue nor rashly vain
  And singly mad asperse the sovereign reign
  Have we not known thee slave of all our host
  The man who acts the least upbraids the most
  Think not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring
  Nor let those lips profane the name of king
  For our return we trust the heavenly powers
  Be that their care to fight like men be ours
  But grant the host with wealth the general load
  Except detraction what hast thou bestowd
  Suppose some hero should his spoils resign
  Art thou that hero could those spoils be thine
  Gods let me perish on this hateful shore
  And let these eyes behold my son no more
  If on thy next offence this hand forbear
  To strip those arms thou ill deservst to wear
  Expel the council where our princes meet
  And send thee scourged and howling through the fleet

  He said and cowering as the dastard bends
  The weighty sceptre on his bank descends88
  On the round bunch the bloody tumours rise
  The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes
  Trembling he sat and shrunk in abject fears
  From his vile visage wiped the scalding tears
  While to his neighbour each expressd his thought

  Ye gods what wonders has Ulysses wrought
  What fruits his conduct and his courage yield
  Great in the council glorious in the field
  Generous he rises in the crowns defence
  To curb the factious tongue of insolence
  Such just examples on offenders shown
  Sedition silence and assert the throne

  Twas thus the general voice the hero praised
  Who rising high the imperial sceptre raised
  The blueeyed Pallas his celestial friend
  In form a herald bade the crowds attend
  The expecting crowds in still attention hung
  To hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue
  Then deeply thoughtful pausing ere he spoke
  His silence thus the prudent hero broke

  Unhappy monarch whom the Grecian race
  With shame deserting heap with vile disgrace
  Not such at Argos was their generous vow
  Once all their voice but ah forgotten now
  Neer to return was then the common cry
  Till Troys proud structures should in ashes lie
  Behold them weeping for their native shore
  What could their wives or helpless children more
  What heart but melts to leave the tender train
  And one short month endure the wintry main
  Few leagues removed we wish our peaceful seat
  When the ship tosses and the tempests beat
  Then well may this long stay provoke their tears
  The tedious length of nine revolving years
  Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame
  But vanquishd baffled oh eternal shame
  Expect the time to Troys destruction given
  And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven
  What passd at Aulis Greece can witness bear89
  And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air
  Beside a fountains sacred brink we raised
  Our verdant altars and the victims blazed
  Twas where the planetree spread its shades around
  The altars heaved and from the crumbling ground
  A mighty dragon shot of dire portent
  From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent
  Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he rolld
  And curld around in many a winding fold
  The topmost branch a motherbird possessd
  Eight callow infants filld the mossy nest
  Herself the ninth the serpent as he hung
  Stretchd his black jaws and crushd the crying young
  While hovering near with miserable moan
  The drooping mother waild her children gone
  The mother last as round the nest she flew
  Seized by the beating wing the monster slew
  Nor long survived to marble turnd he stands
  A lasting prodigy on Aulis sands
  Such was the will of Jove and hence we dare
  Trust in his omen and support the war
  For while around we gazed with wondering eyes
  And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice
  Full of his god the reverend Chalcas cried90
  Ye Grecian warriors lay your fears aside
  This wondrous signal Jove himself displays
  Of long long labours but eternal praise
  As many birds as by the snake were slain
  So many years the toils of Greece remain
  But wait the tenth for Ilions fall decreed
  Thus spoke the prophet thus the Fates succeed
  Obey ye Grecians with submission wait
  Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate
  He said the shores with loud applauses sound
  The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound
  Then Nestor thusThese vain debates forbear
  Ye talk like children not like heroes dare
  Where now are all your high resolves at last
  Your leagues concluded your engagements past
  Vowd with libations and with victims then
  Now vanishd like their smoke the faith of men
  While useless words consume the unactive hours
  No wonder Troy so long resists our powers
  Rise great Atrides and with courage sway
  We march to war if thou direct the way
  But leave the few that dare resist thy laws
  The mean deserters of the Grecian cause
  To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares
  And view with envy our successful wars
  On that great day when first the martial train
  Big with the fate of Ilion ploughd the main
  Jove on the right a prosperous signal sent
  And thunder rolling shook the firmament
  Encouraged hence maintain the glorious strife
  Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife
  Till Helens woes at full revenged appear
  And Troys proud matrons render tear for tear
  Before that day if any Greek invite
  His countrys troops to base inglorious flight
  Stand forth that Greek and hoist his sail to fly
  And die the dastard first who dreads to die
  But now O monarch all thy chiefs advise91
  Nor what they offer thou thyself despise
  Among those counsels let not mine be vain
  In tribes and nations to divide thy train
  His separate troops let every leader call
  Each strengthen each and all encourage all
  What chief or soldier of the numerous band
  Or bravely fights or ill obeys command
  When thus distinct they war shall soon be known
  And what the cause of Ilion not oerthrown
  If fate resists or if our arms are slow
  If gods above prevent or men below

  To him the king How much thy years excel
  In arts of counsel and in speaking well
  O would the gods in love to Greece decree
  But ten such sages as they grant in thee
  Such wisdom soon should Priams force destroy
  And soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy
  But Jove forbids who plunges those he hates
  In fierce contention and in vain debates
  Now great Achilles from our aid withdraws
  By me provoked a captive maid the cause
  If eer as friends we join the Trojan wall
  Must shake and heavy will the vengeance fall
  But now ye warriors take a short repast
  And well refreshd to bloody conflict haste
  His sharpend spear let every Grecian wield
  And every Grecian fix his brazen shield
  Let all excite the fiery steeds of war
  And all for combat fit the rattling car
  This day this dreadful day let each contend
  No rest no respite till the shades descend
  Till darkness or till death shall cover all
  Let the war bleed and let the mighty fall
  Till bathed in sweat be every manly breast
  With the huge shield each brawny arm depressd
  Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw
  And each spent courser at the chariot blow
  Who dares inglorious in his ships to stay
  Who dares to tremble on this signal day
  That wretch too mean to fall by martial power
  The birds shall mangle and the dogs devour

  The monarch spoke and straight a murmur rose
  Loud as the surges when the tempest blows
  That dashd on broken rocks tumultuous roar
  And foam and thunder on the stony shore
  Straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend
  The fires are kindled and the smokes ascend
  With hasty feasts they sacrifice and pray
  To avert the dangers of the doubtful day
  A steer of five years age large limbd and fed92
  To Joves high altars Agamemnon led
  There bade the noblest of the Grecian peers
  And Nestor first as most advanced in years
  Next came Idomeneus93
  and Tydeus son94
  Ajax the less and Ajax Telamon95
  Then wise Ulysses in his rank was placed
  And Menelaus came unbid the last96
  The chiefs surround the destined beast and take
  The sacred offering of the salted cake
  When thus the king prefers his solemn prayer
  O thou whose thunder rends the clouded air
  Who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne
  Supreme of gods unbounded and alone
  Hear and before the burning sun descends
  Before the night her gloomy veil extends
  Low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires
  Be Priams palace sunk in Grecian fires
  In Hectors breast be plunged this shining sword
  And slaughterd heroes groan around their lord

  Thus prayed the chief his unavailing prayer
  Great Jove refused and tossd in empty air
  The God averse while yet the fumes arose
  Prepared new toils and doubled woes on woes
  Their prayers performd the chiefs the rite pursue
  The barley sprinkled and the victim slew
  The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide
  The thighs selected to the gods divide
  On these in double cauls involved with art
  The choicest morsels lie from every part
  From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire
  While the fat victims feed the sacred fire
  The thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dressd
  The assistants part transfix and roast the rest
  Then spread the tables the repast prepare
  Each takes his seat and each receives his share
  Soon as the rage of hunger was suppressd
  The generous Nestor thus the prince addressd

  Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms
  And call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms
  Now seize the occasion now the troops survey
  And lead to war when heaven directs the way

  He said the monarch issued his commands
  Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands
  The chiefs inclose their king the hosts divide
  In tribes and nations rankd on either side
  High in the midst the blueeyed virgin flies
  From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes
  The dreadful aegis Joves immortal shield
  Blazed on her arm and lightend all the field
  Round the vast orb a hundred serpents rolld
  Formd the bright fringe and seemd to burn in gold
  With this each Grecians manly breast she warms
  Swells their bold hearts and strings their nervous arms
  No more they sigh inglorious to return
  But breathe revenge and for the combat burn

  As on some mountain through the lofty grove
  The crackling flames ascend and blaze above
  The fires expanding as the winds arise
  Shoot their long beams and kindle half the skies
  So from the polishd arms and brazen shields
  A gleamy splendour flashd along the fields
  Not less their number than the embodied cranes
  Or milkwhite swans in Asius watery plains
  That oer the windings of Caysters springs97
  Stretch their long necks and clap their rustling wings
  Now tower aloft and course in airy rounds
  Now light with noise with noise the field resounds
  Thus numerous and confused extending wide
  The legions crowd Scamanders flowery side98
  With rushing troops the plains are coverd oer
  And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore
  Along the rivers level meads they stand
  Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land
  Or leaves the trees or thick as insects play
  The wandering nation of a summers day
  That drawn by milky steams at evening hours
  In gatherd swarms surround the rural bowers
  From pail to pail with busy murmur run
  The gilded legions glittering in the sun
  So throngd so close the Grecian squadrons stood
  In radiant arms and thirst for Trojan blood
  Each leader now his scatterd force conjoins
  In close array and forms the deepening lines
  Not with more ease the skilful shepherdswain
  Collects his flocks from thousands on the plain
  The king of kings majestically tall
  Towers oer his armies and outshines them all
  Like some proud bull that round the pastures leads
  His subject herds the monarch of the meads
  Great as the gods the exalted chief was seen
  His strength like Neptune and like Mars his mien99
  Jove oer his eyes celestial glories spread
  And dawning conquest played around his head

  Say virgins seated round the throne divine
  Allknowing goddesses immortal nine100
  Since earths wide regions heavens umneasurd height
  And hells abyss hide nothing from your sight
  We wretched mortals lost in doubts below
  But guess by rumour and but boast we know
  O say what heroes fired by thirst of fame
  Or urged by wrongs to Troys destruction came
  To count them all demands a thousand tongues
  A throat of brass and adamantine lungs
  Daughters of Jove assist inspired by you
  The mighty labour dauntless I pursue
  What crowded armies from what climes they bring
  Their names their numbers and their chiefs I sing

  Penelius Leitus Prothoenor led
  With these Arcesilaus and Clonius stand
  Equal in arms and equal in command
  These head the troops that rocky Aulis yields
  And Eteons hills and Hyries watery fields
  And Schoenos Scholos Graea near the main
  And Mycalessias ample piny plain
  Those who in Peteon or Ilesion dwell
  Or Harma where Apollos prophet fell
  Heleon and Hyle which the springs oerflow
  And Medeon lofty and Ocalea low
  Or in the meads of Haliartus stray
  Or Thespia sacred to the god of day
  Onchestus Neptunes celebrated groves
  Copae and Thisbe famed for silver doves
  For flocks Erythrae Glissa for the vine
  Platea green and Nysa the divine
  And they whom Thebes wellbuilt walls inclose
  Where Myde Eutresis Corone rose
  And Arne rich with purple harvests crownd
  And Anthedon Boeotias utmost bound
  Full fifty ships they send and each conveys
  Twice sixty warriors through the foaming seas102

  To these succeed Aspledons martial train

  With equal oars the hoarseresounding deep

  The Phocians next in forty barks repair
  Epistrophus and Schedius head the war
  From those rich regions where Cephisus leads
  His silver current through the flowery meads
  From Panopea Chrysa the divine
  Where Anemorias stately turrets shine
  Where Pytho Daulis Cyparissus stood
  And fair Lilaea views the rising flood
  These ranged in order on the floating tide
  Close on the left the bold Boeotians side

  Fierce Ajax led the Locrian squadrons on
  Ajax the less Oileus valiant son
  Skilld to direct the flying dart aright
  Swift in pursuit and active in the fight
  Him as their chief the chosen troops attend
  Which Bessa Thronus and rich Cynos send
  Opus Calliarus and Scarphes bands
  And those who dwell where pleasing Augia stands
  And where Boagrius floats the lowly lands
  Or in fair Tarphes sylvan seats reside
  In forty vessels cut the yielding tide

  Euboea next her martial sons prepares
  And sends the brave Abantes to the wars
  Breathing revenge in arms they take their way
  From Chalcis walls and strong Eretria
  The Isteian fields for generous vines renownd
  The fair Caristos and the Styrian ground
  Where Dios from her towers oerlooks the plain
  And high Cerinthus views the neighbouring main
  Down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair
  Their hands dismiss not the long lance in air
  But with protended spears in fighting fields
  Pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields
  Twice twenty ships transport the warlike bands
  Which bold Elphenor fierce in arms commands

  Full fifty more from Athens stem the main
  Led by Menestheus through the liquid plain
  Athens the fair where great Erectheus swayd
  That owed his nurture to the blueeyed maid
  But from the teeming furrow took his birth
  The mighty offspring of the foodful earth
  Him Pallas placed amidst her wealthy fane
  Adored with sacrifice and oxen slain
  Where as the years revolve her altars blaze
  And all the tribes resound the goddess praise
  No chief like thee Menestheus Greece could yield
  To marshal armies in the dusty field
  The extended wings of battle to display
  Or close the embodied host in firm array
  Nestor alone improved by length of days
  For martial conduct bore an equal praise

  With these appear the Salaminian bands
  Whom the gigantic Telamon commands
  In twelve black ships to Troy they steer their course
  And with the great Athenians join their force

  Next move to war the generous Argive train
  From high Troezene and Masetas plain
  And fair Ćgina circled by the main
  Whom strong Tyrinthes lofty walls surround
  And Epidaure with viny harvests crownd
  And where fair Asinen and Hermoin show

  Great Agamemnon rules the numerous band
  A hundred vessels in long order stand
  And crowded nations wait his dread command
  High on the deck the king of men appears
  And his refulgent arms in triumph wears
  Proud of his host unrivalld in his reign
  In silent pomp he moves along the main

  His brother follows and to vengeance warms
  The hardy Spartans exercised in arms
  Phares and Brysias valiant troops and those
  Whom Lacedaemons lofty hills inclose
  Or Messes towers for silver doves renownd
  Amyclae Laas Augias happy ground
  And those whom OEtylos low walls contain
  And Helos on the margin of the main
  These oer the bending ocean Helens cause
  In sixty ships with Menelaus draws
  Eager and loud from man to man he flies
  Revenge and fury flaming in his eyes
  While vainly fond in fancy oft he hears
  The fair ones grief and sees her falling tears

  In ninety sail from Pylos sandy coast
  Nestor the sage conducts his chosen host
  From Amphigenias everfruitful land
  Where Ćpy high and little Pteleon stand
  Where beauteous Arene her structures shows
  And Thryons walls Alpheus streams inclose
  And Dorion famed for Thamyris disgrace
  Superior once of all the tuneful race
  Till vain of mortals empty praise he strove
  To match the seed of cloudcompelling Jove
  Too daring bard whose unsuccessful pride
  The immortal Muses in their art defied
  The avenging Muses of the light of day
  Deprived his eyes and snatchd his voice away
  No more his heavenly voice was heard to sing
  His hand no more awaked the silver string

  Where under high Cyllene crownd with wood
  The shaded tomb of old Ćpytus stood
  From Ripe Stratie Tegeas bordering towns

  Those where fair Elis and Buprasium join
  Whom Hyrmin here and Myrsinus confine
  And bounded there where oer the valleys rose
  The Olenian rock and where Alisium flows
  Beneath four chiefs a numerous army came
  The strength and glory of the Epean name
  In separate squadrons these their train divide
  Each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide
  One was Amphimachus and Thalpius one
  Eurytus this and that Teatus son
  Diores sprung from Amarynceus line
  And great Polyxenus of force divine

  But those who view fair Elis oer the seas
  From the blest islands of the Echinades
  In forty vessels under Meges move
  Begot by Phyleus the beloved of Jove
  To strong Dulichium from his sire he fled
  And thence to Troy his hardy warriors led

  Ulysses followd through the watery road
  A chief in wisdom equal to a god
  With those whom Cephalenias line inclosed
  Or till their fields along the coast opposed
  Or where fair Ithaca oerlooks the floods
  Where high Neritos shakes his waving woods
  Where Ćgilipas rugged sides are seen
  Crocylia rocky and Zacynthus green
  These in twelve galleys with vermilion prores
  Beneath his conduct sought the Phrygian shores

  Thoas came next Andraemons valiant son
  From Pleurons walls and chalky Calydon
  And rough Pylene and the Olenian steep
  And Chalcis beaten by the rolling deep
  He led the warriors from the Ćtolian shore
  For now the sons of OEneus were no more
  The glories of the mighty race were fled
  OEneus himself and Meleager dead
  To Thoas care now trust the martial train
  His forty vessels follow through the main

  Next eighty barks the Cretan king commands
  Of Gnossus Lyctus and Gortynas bands
  And those who dwell where Rhytions domes arise
  Or white Lycastus glitters to the skies
  Or where by Phaestus silver Jardan runs
  Cretes hundred cities pour forth all her sons
  These marchd Idomeneus beneath thy care
  And Merion dreadful as the god of war

  Tlepolemus the sun of Hercules
  Led nine swift vessels through the foamy seas
  From Rhodes with everlasting sunshine bright
  Jalyssus Lindus and Camirus white
  His captive mother fierce Alcides bore
  From Ephyrs walls and Selles winding shore
  Where mighty towns in ruins spread the plain
  And saw their blooming warriors early slain
  The hero when to manly years he grew
  Alcides uncle old Licymnius slew
  For this constraind to quit his native place
  And shun the vengeance of the Herculean race
  A fleet he built and with a numerous train
  Of willing exiles wanderd oer the main
  Where many seas and many sufferings past
  On happy Rhodes the chief arrived at last
  There in three tribes divides his native band
  And rules them peaceful in a foreign land
  Increased and prosperd in their new abodes
  By mighty Jove the sire of men and gods
  With joy they saw the growing empire rise
  And showers of wealth descending from the skies

  Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore
  Nireus whom Aglae to Charopus bore
  Nireus in faultless shape and blooming grace
  The loveliest youth of all the Grecian race104
  Pelides only matchd his early charms
  But few his troops and small his strength in arms

  Next thirty galleys cleave the liquid plain
  Of those Calydnaes seagirt isles contain
  With them the youth of Nisyrus repair
  Casus the strong and Crapathus the fair
  Cos where Eurypylus possessd the sway
  Till great Alcides made the realms obey
  These Antiphus and bold Phidippus bring
  Sprung from the god by Thessalus the king

  Now Muse recount Pelasgic Argos powers
  From Alos Alope and Trechins towers
  From Phthias spacious vales and Hella blessd
  With female beauty far beyond the rest
  Full fifty ships beneath Achilles care
  The Achaians Myrmidons Hellenians bear
  Thessalians all though various in their name
  The same their nation and their chief the same
  But now inglorious stretchd along the shore
  They hear the brazen voice of war no more
  No more the foe they face in dire array
  Close in his fleet the angry leader lay
  Since fair Briseis from his arms was torn
  The noblest spoil from sackd Lyrnessus borne
  Then when the chief the Theban walls oerthrew
  And the bold sons of great Evenus slew
  There mournd Achilles plunged in depth of care
  But soon to rise in slaughter blood and war

  To these the youth of Phylace succeed
  Itona famous for her fleecy breed
  And grassy Pteleon deckd with cheerful greens
  The bowers of Ceres and the sylvan scenes
  Sweet Pyrrhasus with blooming flowerets crownd
  And Antrons watery dens and cavernd ground
  These ownd as chief Protesilas the brave
  Who now lay silent in the gloomy grave
  The first who boldly touchd the Trojan shore
  And dyed a Phrygian lance with Grecian gore
  There lies far distant from his native plain
  Unfinishd his proud palaces remain
  And his sad consort beats her breast in vain
  His troops in forty ships Podarces led
  Iphiclus son and brother to the dead
  Nor he unworthy to command the host
  Yet still they mournd their ancient leader lost

  The men who Glaphyras fair soil partake
  Where hills incircle Boebes lowly lake
  Where Phaere hears the neighbouring waters fall
  Or proud Iolcus lifts her airy wall
  In ten black ships embarkd for Ilions shore
  With bold Eumelus whom Alceste bore
  All Pelias race Alceste far outshined
  The grace and glory of the beauteous kind

  The troops Methone or Thaumacia yields
  Olizons rocks or Meliboeas fields
  With Philoctetes saild whose matchless art
  From the tough bow directs the featherd dart
  Seven were his ships each vessel fifty row
  Skilld in his science of the dart and bow
  But he lay raging on the Lemnian ground
  A poisonous hydra gave the burning wound
  There groand the chief in agonizing pain
  Whom Greece at length shall wish nor wish in vain
  His forces Medon led from Lemnos shore
  Oileus son whom beauteous Rhena bore

  The OEchalian race in those high towers containd
  Where once Eurytus in proud triumph reignd
  Or where her humbler turrets Tricca rears
  Or where Ithome rough with rocks appears
  In thirty sail the sparkling waves divide
  Which Podalirius and Machaon guide
  To these his skill their parentgod imparts
  Divine professors of the healing arts

  The bold Ormenian and Asterian bands
  In forty barks Eurypylus commands
  Where Titan hides his hoary head in snow
  And where Hyperias silver fountains flow
  Thy troops Argissa Polypoetes leads
  And Eleon shelterd by Olympus shades
  Gyrtones warriors and where Orthe lies
  And Oloossons chalky cliffs arise
  Sprung from Pirithous of immortal race
  The fruit of fair Hippodames embrace
  That day when hurld from Pelions cloudy head
  To distant dens the shaggy Centaurs fled
  With Polypoetes joind in equal sway
  Leonteus leads and forty ships obey

  In twenty sail the bold Perrhaebians came
  From Cyphus Guneus was their leaders name
  With these the Enians joind and those who freeze
  Where cold Dodona lifts her holy trees
  Or where the pleasing Titaresius glides
  And into Peneus rolls his easy tides
  Yet oer the silvery surface pure they flow
  The sacred stream unmixd with streams below
  Sacred and awful from the dark abodes
  Styx pours them forth the dreadful oath of gods

  Last under Prothous the Magnesians stood
  Prothous the swift of old Tenthredons blood
  Who dwell where Pelion crownd with piny boughs
  Obscures the glade and nods his shaggy brows
  Or where through flowery Tempe Peneus strayd
  The region stretchd beneath his mighty shade
  In forty sable barks they stemmd the main
  Such were the chiefs and such the Grecian train

  Say next O Muse of all Achaia breeds
  Who bravest fought or reind the noblest steeds
  Eumelus mares were foremost in the chase
  As eagles fleet and of Pheretian race
  Bred where Pierias fruitful fountains flow
  And traind by him who bears the silver bow
  Fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flame
  Their height their colour and their age the same
  Oer fields of death they whirl the rapid car
  And break the ranks and thunder through the war
  Ajax in arms the first renown acquired
  While stern Achilles in his wrath retired
  His was the strength that mortal might exceeds
  And his the unrivalld race of heavenly steeds
  But Thetis son now shines in arms no more
  His troops neglected on the sandy shore
  In empty air their sportive javelins throw
  Or whirl the disk or bend an idle bow
  Unstaind with blood his coverd chariots stand
  The immortal coursers graze along the strand
  But the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored
  And wandering oer the camp required their lord

  Now like a deluge covering all around
  The shining armies sweep along the ground
  Swift as a flood of fire when storms arise
  Floats the wild field and blazes to the skies
  Earth groand beneath them as when angry Jove
  Hurls down the forky lightning from above
  On Arime when he the thunder throws
  And fires Typhoeus with redoubled blows
  Where Typhon pressd beneath the burning load
  Still feels the fury of the avenging god

  But various Iris Joves commands to bear
  Speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air
  In Priams porch the Trojan chiefs she found
  The old consulting and the youths around
  Polites shape the monarchs son she chose
  Who from Ćsetes tomb observed the foes105
  High on the mound from whence in prospect lay
  The fields the tents the navy and the bay
  In this dissembled form she hastes to bring
  The unwelcome message to the Phrygian king

  Cease to consult the time for action calls
  War horrid war approaches to your walls
  Assembled armies oft have I beheld
  But neer till now such numbers charged a field
  Thick as autumnal leaves or driving sand
  The moving squadrons blacken all the strand
  Thou godlike Hector all thy force employ
  Assemble all the united bands of Troy
  In just array let every leader call
  The foreign troops this day demands them all

  The voice divine the mighty chief alarms
  The council breaks the warriors rush to arms
  The gates unfolding pour forth all their train
  Nations on nations fill the dusky plain
  Men steeds and chariots shake the trembling ground
  The tumult thickens and the skies resound

  Amidst the plain in sight of Ilion stands
  A rising mount the work of human hands
  This for Myrinnes tomb the immortals know
  Though calld Bateia in the world below
  Beneath their chiefs in martial order here
  The auxiliar troops and Trojan hosts appear

  The godlike Hector high above the rest
  Shakes his huge spear and nods his plumy crest
  In throngs around his native bands repair
  And groves of lances glitter in the air

  Divine Ćneas brings the Dardan race
  Anchises son by Venus stolen embrace
  Born in the shades of Idas secret grove
  A mortal mixing with the queen of love
  Archilochus and Acamas divide
  The warriors toils and combat by his side

  Who fair Zeleias wealthy valleys till106
  Fast by the foot of Idas sacred hill
  Or drink Ćsepus of thy sable flood
  Were led by Pandarus of royal blood
  To whom his art Apollo deignd to show
  Graced with the presents of his shafts and bow

  From rich Apaesus and Adrestias towers
  High Terees summits and Pityeas bowers
  From these the congregated troops obey
  Young Amphius and Adrastus equal sway
  Old Merops sons whom skilld in fates to come
  The sire forewarnd and prophesied their doom
  Fate urged them on the sire forewarnd in vain
  They rushd to war and perishd on the plain

  From Practius stream Percotes pasture lands
  And Sestos and Abydos neighbouring strands
  From great Arisbas walls and Selles coast
  Asius Hyrtacides conducts his host
  High on his car he shakes the flowing reins
  His fiery coursers thunder oer the plains

  The fierce Pelasgi next in war renownd
  March from Larissas everfertile ground
  In equal arms their brother leaders shine
  Hippothous bold and Pyleus the divine

  Next Acamas and Pyrous lead their hosts
  In dread array from Thracias wintry coasts
  Round the bleak realms where Hellespontus roars
  And Boreas beats the hoarseresounding shores

  With great Euphemus the Ciconians move
  Sprung from Troezenian Ceus loved by Jove

  Pyraechmes the Paeonian troops attend
  Skilld in the fight their crooked bows to bend
  From Axius ample bed he leads them on
  Axius that laves the distant Amydon
  Axius that swells with all his neighbouring rills
  And wide around the floating region fills

  The Paphlagonians Pylaemenes rules
  Where rich Henetia breeds her savage mules
  Where Erythinus rising cliffs are seen
  Thy groves of box Cytorus ever green
  And where Ćgialus and Cromna lie
  And lofty Sesamus invades the sky
  And where Parthenius rolld through banks of flowers
  Reflects her bordering palaces and bowers

  Here marchd in arms the Halizonian band
  Whom Odius and Epistrophus command
  From those far regions where the sun refines
  The ripening silver in Alybean mines

  There mighty Chromis led the Mysian train
  And augur Ennomus inspired in vain
  For stern Achilles loppd his sacred head
  Rolld down Scamander with the vulgar dead

  Phorcys and brave Ascanius here unite
  The Ascanian Phrygians eager for the fight

  Of those who round Maeonias realms reside
  Or whom the vales in shades of Tmolus hide
  Mestles and Antiphus the charge partake
  Born on the banks of Gyges silent lake
  There from the fields where wild Maeander flows
  High Mycale and Latmos shady brows
  And proud Miletus came the Carian throngs
  With mingled clamours and with barbarous tongues107
  Amphimachus and Naustes guide the train
  Naustes the bold Amphimachus the vain
  Who trickd with gold and glittering on his car
  Rode like a woman to the field of war
  Fool that he was by fierce Achilles slain
  The river swept him to the briny main
  There whelmd with waves the gaudy warrior lies
  The valiant victor seized the golden prize

  The forces last in fair array succeed
  Which blameless Glaucus and Sarpedon lead
  The warlike bands that distant Lycia yields
  Where gulfy Xanthus foams along the fields





BOOK III


ARGUMENT

THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS

The armies being ready to engage a single combat is agreed upon between
Menelaus and Paris by the intervention of Hector for the determination
of the war Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the fight She leads her
to the walls of Troy where Priam sat with his counsellers observing the
Grecian leaders on the plain below to whom Helen gives an account of the
chief of them The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the
conditions of the combat The duel ensues wherein Paris being overcome
he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus and transported to his apartment
She then calls Helen from the walls and brings the lovers together
Agamemnon on the part of the Grecians demands the restoration of Helen
and the performance of the articles

The threeandtwentieth day still continues throughout this book The
scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy and sometimes in Troy
itself

  Thus by their leaders care each martial band
  Moves into ranks and stretches oer the land
  With shouts the Trojans rushing from afar
  Proclaim their motions and provoke the war
  So when inclement winters vex the plain
  With piercing frosts or thickdescending rain
  To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly108
  With noise and order through the midway sky
  To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring
  And all the war descends upon the wing
  But silent breathing rage resolved and skilld109
  By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field
  Swift march the Greeks the rapid dust around
  Darkening arises from the labourd ground
  Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds
  A night of vapours round the mountain heads
  Swiftgliding mists the dusky fields invade
  To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade
  While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey
  Lost and confused amidst the thickend day
  So wrappd in gathering dust the Grecian train
  A moving cloud swept on and hid the plain

  Now front to front the hostile armies stand
  Eager of fight and only wait command
  When to the van before the sons of fame
  Whom Troy sent forth the beauteous Paris came
  In form a god the panthers speckled hide
  Flowd oer his armour with an easy pride
  His bended bow across his shoulders flung
  His sword beside him negligently hung
  Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace
  And dared the bravest of the Grecian race

  As thus with glorious air and proud disdain
  He boldly stalkd the foremost on the plain
  Him Menelaus loved of Mars espies
  With heart elated and with joyful eyes
  So joys a lion if the branching deer
  Or mountain goat his bulky prize appear
  Eager he seizes and devours the slain
  Pressd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain
  Thus fond of vengeance with a furious bound
  In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground
  From his high chariot him approaching near
  The beauteous champion views with marks of fear
  Smit with a conscious sense retires behind
  And shuns the fate he well deserved to find
  As when some shepherd from the rustling trees110
  Shot forth to view a scaly serpent sees
  Trembling and pale he starts with wild affright
  And all confused precipitates his flight
  So from the king the shining warrior flies
  And plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies

  As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat
  He thus upbraids him with a generous heat
  Unhappy Paris but to women brave111
  So fairly formd and only to deceive
  Oh hadst thou died when first thou sawst the light
  Or died at least before thy nuptial rite
  A better fate than vainly thus to boast
  And fly the scandal of thy Trojan host
  Gods how the scornful Greeks exult to see
  Their fears of danger undeceived in thee
  Thy figure promised with a martial air
  But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair
  In former days in all thy gallant pride
  When thy tall ships triumphant stemmd the tide
  When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow
  And crowds stood wondering at the passing show
  Say was it thus with such a baffled mien
  You met the approaches of the Spartan queen
  Thus from her realm conveyd the beauteous prize
  And both her warlike lords outshined in Helens eyes
  This deed thy foes delight thy own disgrace
  Thy fathers grief and ruin of thy race
  This deed recalls thee to the profferd fight
  Or hast thou injured whom thou darst not right
  Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know
  Thou keepst the consort of a braver foe
  Thy graceful form instilling soft desire
  Thy curling tresses and thy silver lyre
  Beauty and youth in vain to these you trust
  When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust
  Troy yet may wake and one avenging blow
  Crush the dire author of his countrys woe

  His silence here with blushes Paris breaks
  Tis just my brother what your anger speaks
  But who like thee can boast a soul sedate
  So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate
  Thy force like steel a temperd hardness shows
  Still edged to wound and still untired with blows
  Like steel uplifted by some strenuous swain
  With falling woods to strew the wasted plain
  Thy gifts I praise nor thou despise the charms
  With which a lover golden Venus arms
  Soft moving speech and pleasing outward show
  No wish can gain them but the gods bestow
  Yet wouldst thou have the profferd combat stand
  The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand
  Then let a midway space our hosts divide
  And on that stage of war the cause be tried
  By Paris there the Spartan king be fought
  For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought
  And who his rival can in arms subdue
  His be the fair and his the treasure too
  Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease
  And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace
  Thus may the Greeks review their native shore
  Much famed for generous steeds for beauty more

  He said The challenge Hector heard with joy
  Then with his spear restraind the youth of Troy
  Held by the midst athwart and near the foe
  Advanced with steps majestically slow
  While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour
  Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower

  Then thus the monarch great Atrides cried
  Forbear ye warriors lay the darts aside
  A parley Hector asks a message bears
  We know him by the various plume he wears
  Awed by his high command the Greeks attend
  The tumult silence and the fight suspend

  While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes
  On either host and thus to both applies
  Hear all ye Trojan all ye Grecian bands
  What Paris author of the war demands
  Your shining swords within the sheath restrain
  And pitch your lances in the yielding plain
  Here in the midst in either armys sight
  He dares the Spartan king to single fight
  And wills that Helen and the ravishd spoil
  That caused the contest shall reward the toil
  Let these the brave triumphant victor grace
  And different nations part in leagues of peace

  He spoke in still suspense on either side
  Each army stood the Spartan chief replied

  Me too ye warriors hear whose fatal right
  A world engages in the toils of fight
  To me the labour of the field resign
  Me Paris injured all the war be mine
  Fall he that must beneath his rivals arms
  And live the rest secure of future harms
  Two lambs devoted by your countrys rite
  To earth a sable to the sun a white
  Prepare ye Trojans while a third we bring
  Select to Jove the inviolable king
  Let reverend Priam in the truce engage
  And add the sanction of considerate age
  His sons are faithless headlong in debate
  And youth itself an empty wavering state
  Cool age advances venerably wise
  Turns on all hands its deepdiscerning eyes
  Sees what befell and what may yet befall
  Concludes from both and best provides for all

  The nations hear with rising hopes possessd
  And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast
  Within the lines they drew their steeds around
  And from their chariots issued on the ground
  Next all unbuckling the rich mail they wore
  Laid their bright arms along the sable shore
  On either side the meeting hosts are seen
  With lances fixd and close the space between
  Two heralds now despatchd to Troy invite
  The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite

  Talthybius hastens to the fleet to bring
  The lamb for Jove the inviolable king

  Meantime to beauteous Helen from the skies
  The various goddess of the rainbow flies
  Like fair Laodice in form and face
  The loveliest nymph of Priams royal race
  Her in the palace at her loom she found
  The golden web her own sad story crownd
  The Trojan wars she weaved herself the prize
  And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes
  To whom the goddess of the painted bow
  Approach and view the wondrous scene below112
  Each hardy Greek and valiant Trojan knight
  So dreadful late and furious for the fight
  Now rest their spears or lean upon their shields
  Ceased is the war and silent all the fields
  Paris alone and Spartas king advance
  In single fight to toss the beamy lance
  Each met in arms the fate of combat tries
  Thy love the motive and thy charms the prize

  This said the manycoloured maid inspires
  Her husbands love and wakes her former fires
  Her country parents all that once were dear
  Rush to her thought and force a tender tear
  Oer her fair face a snowy veil she threw
  And softly sighing from the loom withdrew
  Her handmaids Clymene and Ćthra wait
  Her silent footsteps to the Scaean gate

  There sat the seniors of the Trojan race
  Old Priams chiefs and most in Priams grace
  The king the first Thymoetes at his side
  Lampus and Clytius long in council tried
  Panthus and Hicetaon once the strong
  And next the wisest of the reverend throng
  Antenor grave and sage Ucalegon
  Leand on the walls and baskd before the sun
  Chiefs who no more in bloody fights engage
  But wise through time and narrative with age
  In summer days like grasshoppers rejoice
  A bloodless race that send a feeble voice
  These when the Spartan queen approachd the tower
  In secret ownd resistless beautys power
  They cried No wonder such celestial charms113
  For nine long years have set the world in arms
  What winning graces what majestic mien
  She moves a goddess and she looks a queen
  Yet hence O Heaven convey that fatal face
  And from destruction save the Trojan race

  The good old Priam welcomed her and cried
  Approach my child and grace thy fathers side
  See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears
  The friends and kindred of thy former years
  No crime of thine our present sufferings draws
  Not thou but Heavens disposing will the cause
  The gods these armies and this force employ
  The hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy
  But lift thy eyes and say what Greek is he
  Far as from hence these aged orbs can see
  Around whose brow such martial graces shine
  So tall so awful and almost divine
  Though some of larger stature tread the green
  None match his grandeur and exalted mien
  He seems a monarch and his countrys pride
  Thus ceased the king and thus the fair replied

  Before thy presence father I appear
  With conscious shame and reverential fear
  Ah had I died ere to these walk I fled
  False to my country and my nuptial bed
  My brothers friends and daughter left behind
  False to them all to Paris only kind
  For this I mourn till grief or dire disease
  Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please
  The king of kings Atrides you survey
  Great in the war and great in arts of sway
  My brother once before my days of shame
  And oh that still he bore a brothers name

  With wonder Priam viewd the godlike man
  Extolld the happy prince and thus began
  O blessd Atrides born to prosperous fate
  Successful monarch of a mighty state
  How vast thy empire Of your matchless train
  What numbers lost what numbers yet remain
  In Phrygia once were gallant armies known
  In ancient time when Otreus filld the throne
  When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse
  And I to join them raised the Trojan force
  Against the manlike Amazons we stood114
  And Sangars stream ran purple with their blood
  But far inferior those in martial grace
  And strength of numbers to this Grecian race

  This said once more he viewd the warrior train
  Whats he whose arms lie scatterd on the plain
  Broad is his breast his shoulders larger spread
  Though great Atrides overtops his head
  Nor yet appear his care and conduct small
  From rank to rank he moves and orders all
  The stately ram thus measures oer the ground
  And master of the flock surveys them round

  Then Helen thus Whom your discerning eyes
  Have singled out is Ithacus the wise
  A barren island boasts his glorious birth
  His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth

  Antenor took the word and thus began115
  Myself O king have seen that wondrous man
  When trusting Jove and hospitable laws
  To Troy he came to plead the Grecian cause
  Great Menelaus urged the same request
  My house was honourd with each royal guest
  I knew their persons and admired their parts
  Both brave in arms and both approved in arts
  Erect the Spartan most engaged our view
  Ulysses seated greater reverence drew
  When Atreus son harangued the listening train
  Just was his sense and his expression plain
  His words succinct yet full without a fault
  He spoke no more than just the thing he ought
  But when Ulysses rose in thought profound116
  His modest eyes he fixd upon the ground
  As one unskilld or dumb he seemd to stand
  Nor raised his head nor stretchd his sceptred hand
  But when he speaks what elocution flows
  Soft as the fleeces of descending snows117
  The copious accents fall with easy art
  Melting they fall and sink into the heart
  Wondering we hear and fixd in deep surprise
  Our ears refute the censure of our eyes

  The king then askd as yet the camp he viewd
  What chief is that with giant strength endued
  Whose brawny shoulders and whose swelling chest
  And lofty stature far exceed the rest
  Ajax the great the beauteous queen replied
  Himself a host the Grecian strength and pride
  See bold Idomeneus superior towers
  Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers
  Great as a god I saw him once before
  With Menelaus on the Spartan shore
  The rest I know and could in order name
  All valiant chiefs and men of mighty fame
  Yet two are wanting of the numerous train
  Whom long my eyes have sought but sought in vain
  Castor and Pollux first in martial force
  One bold on foot and one renownd for horse
  My brothers these the same our native shore
  One house containd us as one mother bore
  Perhaps the chiefs from warlike toils at ease
  For distant Troy refused to sail the seas
  Perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws
  Ashamed to combat in their sisters cause

  So spoke the fair nor knew her brothers doom118
  Wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb
  Adornd with honours in their native shore
  Silent they slept and heard of wars no more

  Meantime the heralds through the crowded town
  Bring the rich wine and destined victims down
  Idaeus arms the golden goblets pressd119
  Who thus the venerable king addressd
  Arise O father of the Trojan state
  The nations call thy joyful people wait
  To seal the truce and end the dire debate
  Paris thy son and Spartas king advance
  In measured lists to toss the weighty lance
  And who his rival shall in arms subdue
  His be the dame and his the treasure too
  Thus with a lasting league our toils may cease
  And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace
  So shall the Greeks review their native shore
  Much famed for generous steeds for beauty more

  With grief he heard and bade the chiefs prepare
  To join his milkwhite coursers to the car
  He mounts the seat Antenor at his side
  The gentle steeds through Scaeas gates they guide120
  Next from the car descending on the plain
  Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train
  Slow they proceed the sage Ulysses then
  Arose and with him rose the king of men
  On either side a sacred herald stands
  The wine they mix and on each monarchs hands
  Pour the full urn then draws the Grecian lord
  His cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword
  From the signd victims crops the curling hair121
  The heralds part it and the princes share
  Then loudly thus before the attentive bands
  He calls the gods and spreads his lifted hands

  O first and greatest power whom all obey
  Who high on Idas holy mountain sway
  Eternal Jove and you bright orb that roll
  From east to west and view from pole to pole
  Thou mother Earth and all ye living floods
  Infernal furies and Tartarean gods
  Who rule the dead and horrid woes prepare
  For perjured kings and all who falsely swear
  Hear and be witness If by Paris slain
  Great Menelaus press the fatal plain
  The dame and treasures let the Trojan keep
  And Greece returning plough the watery deep
  If by my brothers lance the Trojan bleed
  Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed
  The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay
  And every age record the signal day
  This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield
  Arms must revenge and Mars decide the field

  With that the chief the tender victims slew
  And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw
  The vital spirit issued at the wound
  And left the members quivering on the ground
  From the same urn they drink the mingled wine
  And add libations to the powers divine
  While thus their prayers united mount the sky
  Hear mighty Jove and hear ye gods on high
  And may their blood who first the league confound
  Shed like this wine disdain the thirsty ground
  May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust
  And all their lust be scatterd as the dust
  Thus either host their imprecations joind
  Which Jove refused and mingled with the wind

  The rites now finishd reverend Priam rose
  And thus expressd a heart oercharged with woes
  Ye Greeks and Trojans let the chiefs engage
  But spare the weakness of my feeble age
  In yonder walls that object let me shun
  Nor view the danger of so dear a son
  Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall
  Heaven only knows for heaven disposes all

  This said the hoary king no longer stayd
  But on his car the slaughterd victims laid
  Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide
  And drove to Troy Antenor at his side

  Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose
  The lists of combat and the ground inclose
  Next to decide by sacred lots prepare
  Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air
  The people pray with elevated hands
  And words like these are heard through all the bands
  Immortal Jove high Heavens superior lord
  On lofty Idas holy mount adored
  Whoeer involved us in this dire debate
  O give that author of the war to fate
  And shades eternal let division cease
  And joyful nations join in leagues of peace

  With eyes averted Hector hastes to turn
  The lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn
  Then Paris thine leapd forth by fatal chance
  Ordaind the first to whirl the weighty lance
  Both armies sat the combat to survey
  Beside each chief his azure armour lay
  And round the lists the generous coursers neigh
  The beauteous warrior now arrays for fight
  In gilded arms magnificently bright
  The purple cuishes clasp his thighs around
  With flowers adornd with silver buckles bound
  Lycaons corslet his fair body dressd
  Braced in and fitted to his softer breast
  A radiant baldric oer his shoulder tied
  Sustaind the sword that glitterd at his side
  His youthful face a polishd helm oerspread
  The waving horsehair nodded on his head
  His figured shield a shining orb he takes
  And in his hand a pointed javelin shakes
  With equal speed and fired by equal charms
  The Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms

  Now round the lists the admiring armies stand
  With javelins fixd the Greek and Trojan band
  Amidst the dreadful vale the chiefs advance
  All pale with rage and shake the threatening lance
  The Trojan first his shining javelin threw
  Full on Atrides ringing shield it flew
  Nor pierced the brazen orb but with a bound122
  Leapd from the buckler blunted on the ground
  Atrides then his massy lance prepares
  In act to throw but first prefers his prayers

  Give me great Jove to punish lawless lust
  And lay the Trojan gasping in the dust
  Destroy the aggressor aid my righteous cause
  Avenge the breach of hospitable laws
  Let this example future times reclaim
  And guard from wrong fair friendships holy name
  Be said and poised in air the javelin sent
  Through Paris shield the forceful weapon went
  His corslet pierces and his garment rends
  And glancing downward near his flank descends
  The wary Trojan bending from the blow
  Eludes the death and disappoints his foe
  But fierce Atrides waved his sword and strook
  Full on his casque the crested helmet shook
  The brittle steel unfaithful to his hand
  Broke short the fragments glitterd on the sand
  The raging warrior to the spacious skies
  Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes
  Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust
  And is it thus the gods assist the just
  When crimes provoke us Heaven success denies
  The dart falls harmless and the falchion flies
  Furious he said and towards the Grecian crew
  Seized by the crest the unhappy warrior drew
  Struggling he followed while the embroiderd thong
  That tied his helmet draggd the chief along
  Then had his ruin crownd Atrides joy
  But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy
  Unseen she came and burst the golden band
  And left an empty helmet in his hand
  The casque enraged amidst the Greeks he threw
  The Greeks with smiles the polishd trophy view
  Then as once more he lifts the deadly dart
  In thirst of vengeance at his rivals heart
  The queen of love her favourd champion shrouds
  For gods can all things in a veil of clouds
  Raised from the field the panting youth she led
  And gently laid him on the bridal bed
  With pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews
  And all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews
  Meantime the brightest of the female kind
  The matchless Helen oer the walls reclined
  To her beset with Trojan beauties came
  In borrowd form the laughterloving dame
  She seemd an ancient maid wellskilld to cull
  The snowy fleece and wind the twisted wool
  The goddess softly shook her silken vest
  That shed perfumes and whispering thus addressd

  Haste happy nymph for thee thy Paris calls
  Safe from the fight in yonder lofty walls
  Fair as a god with odours round him spread
  He lies and waits thee on the wellknown bed
  Not like a warrior parted from the foe
  But some gay dancer in the public show

  She spoke and Helens secret soul was moved
  She scornd the champion but the man she loved
  Fair Venus neck her eyes that sparkled fire
  And breast reveald the queen of soft desire123
  Struck with her presence straight the lively red
  Forsook her cheek and trembling thus she said
  Then is it still thy pleasure to deceive
  And womans frailty always to believe
  Say to new nations must I cross the main
  Or carry wars to some soft Asian plain
  For whom must Helen break her second vow
  What other Paris is thy darling now
  Left to Atrides victor in the strife
  An odious conquest and a captive wife
  Hence let me sail and if thy Paris bear
  My absence ill let Venus ease his care
  A handmaid goddess at his side to wait
  Renounce the glories of thy heavenly state
  Be fixd for ever to the Trojan shore
  His spouse or slave and mount the skies no more
  For me to lawless love no longer led
  I scorn the coward and detest his bed
  Else should I merit everlasting shame
  And keen reproach from every Phrygian dame
  Ill suits it now the joys of love to know
  Too deep my anguish and too wild my woe

  Then thus incensed the Paphian queen replies
  Obey the power from whom thy glories rise
  Should Venus leave thee every charm must fly
  Fade from thy cheek and languish in thy eye
  Cease to provoke me lest I make thee more
  The worlds aversion than their love before
  Now the bright prize for which mankind engage
  Than the sad victim of the public rage

  At this the fairest of her sex obeyd
  And veild her blushes in a silken shade
  Unseen and silent from the train she moves
  Led by the goddess of the Smiles and Loves
  Arrived and enterd at the palace gate
  The maids officious round their mistress wait
  Then all dispersing various tasks attend
  The queen and goddess to the prince ascend
  Full in her Paris sight the queen of love
  Had placed the beauteous progeny of Jove
  Where as he viewd her charms she turnd away
  Her glowing eyes and thus began to say

  Is this the chief who lost to sense of shame
  Late fled the field and yet survives his fame
  O hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword
  Of that brave man whom once I calld my lord
  The boaster Paris oft desired the day
  With Spartas king to meet in single fray
  Go now once more thy rivals rage excite
  Provoke Atrides and renew the fight
  Yet Helen bids thee stay lest thou unskilld
  Shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field

  The prince replies Ah cease divinely fair
  Nor add reproaches to the wounds I bear
  This day the foe prevaild by Pallas power
  We yet may vanquish in a happier hour
  There want not gods to favour us above
  But let the business of our life be love
  These softer moments let delights employ
  And kind embraces snatch the hasty joy
  Not thus I loved thee when from Spartas shore
  My forced my willing heavenly prize I bore
  When first entranced in Cranaes isle I lay124
  Mixd with thy soul and all dissolved away
  Thus having spoke the enamourd Phrygian boy
  Rushd to the bed impatient for the joy
  Him Helen followd slow with bashful charms
  And claspd the blooming hero in her arms

  While these to loves delicious rapture yield
  The stern Atrides rages round the field
  So some fell lion whom the woods obey
  Roars through the desert and demands his prey
  Paris he seeks impatient to destroy
  But seeks in vain along the troops of Troy
  Even those had yielded to a foe so brave
  The recreant warrior hateful as the grave
  Then speaking thus the king of kings arose
  Ye Trojans Dardans all our generous foes
  Hear and attest from Heaven with conquest crownd
  Our brothers arms the just success have found
  Be therefore now the Spartan wealth restord
  Let Argive Helen own her lawful lord
  The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay
  And age to age record this signal day

  He ceased his armys loud applauses rise
  And the long shout runs echoing through the skies

BOOK IV


ARGUMENT

THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE AND THE FIRST BATTLE

The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war they agree upon
the continuation of it and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the truce
She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus who is wounded but
cured by Machaon In the meantime some of the Trojan troops attack the
Greeks Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general he
reviews the troops and exhorts the leaders some by praises and others by
reproof Nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline
The battle joins and great numbers are slain on both sides

The same day continues through this as through the last book as it does
also through the two following and almost to the end of the seventh
book The scene is wholly in the field before Troy

  And now Olympus shining gates unfold
  The gods with Jove assume their thrones of gold
  Immortal Hebe fresh with bloom divine
  The golden goblet crowns with purple wine
  While the full bowls flow round the powers employ
  Their careful eyes on longcontended Troy

  When Jove disposed to tempt Saturnias spleen
  Thus waked the fury of his partial queen
  Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid
  Imperial Juno and the martial maid125
  But high in heaven they sit and gaze from far
  The tame spectators of his deeds of war
  Not thus fair Venus helps her favourd knight
  The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight
  Each danger wards and constant in her care
  Saves in the moment of the last despair
  Her act has rescued Paris forfeit life
  Though great Atrides gaind the glorious strife
  Then say ye powers what signal issue waits
  To crown this deed and finish all the fates
  Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare
  Or rouse the furies and awake the war
  Yet would the gods for human good provide
  Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride
  Still Priams walls in peaceful honours grow
  And through his gates the crowding nations flow

  Thus while he spoke the queen of heaven enraged
  And queen of war in close consult engaged
  Apart they sit their deep designs employ
  And meditate the future woes of Troy
  Though secret anger swelld Minervas breast
  The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppressd
  But Juno impotent of passion broke
  Her sullen silence and with fury spoke

                 Illustration THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS

                         THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS


  Shall then O tyrant of the ethereal reign
  My schemes my labours and my hopes be vain
  Have I for this shook Ilion with alarms
  Assembled nations set two worlds in arms
  To spread the war I flew from shore to shore
  The immortal coursers scarce the labour bore
  At length ripe vengeance oer their heads impends
  But Jove himself the faithless race defends
  Loth as thou art to punish lawless lust
  Not all the gods are partial and unjust

  The sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies
  Sighs from his inmost soul and thus replies
  Oh lasting rancour oh insatiate hate
  To Phrygias monarch and the Phrygian state
  What high offence has fired the wife of Jove
  Can wretched mortals harm the powers above
  That Troy and Troys whole race thou wouldst confound
  And yon fair structures level with the ground
  Haste leave the skies fulfil thy stern desire
  Burst all her gates and wrap her walls in fire
  Let Priam bleed if yet you thirst for more
  Bleed all his sons and Ilion float with gore
  To boundless vengeance the wide realm be given
  Till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven
  So let it be and Jove his peace enjoy126
  When heaven no longer hears the name of Troy
  But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate
  On thy loved realms whose guilt demands their fate
  Presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay
  Remember Troy and give the vengeance way
  For know of all the numerous towns that rise
  Beneath the rolling sun and starry skies
  Which gods have raised or earthborn men enjoy
  None stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy
  No mortals merit more distinguishd grace
  Than godlike Priam or than Priams race
  Still to our name their hecatombs expire
  And altars blaze with unextinguishd fire

  At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes
  Then on the Thunderer fixd them and replies
  Three towns are Junos on the Grecian plains
  More dear than all the extended earth contains
  Mycenae Argos and the Spartan wall127

  These thou mayst raze nor I forbid their fall
  Tis not in me the vengeance to remove
  The crimes sufficient that they share my love
  Of power superior why should I complain
  Resent I may but must resent in vain
  Yet some distinction Juno might require
  Sprung with thyself from one celestial sire
  A goddess born to share the realms above
  And styled the consort of the thundering Jove
  Nor thou a wife and sisters right deny128
  Let both consent and both by terms comply
  So shall the gods our joint decrees obey
  And heaven shall act as we direct the way
  See ready Pallas waits thy high commands
  To raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands
  Their sudden friendship by her arts may cease
  And the proud Trojans first infringe the peace

  The sire of men and monarch of the sky
  The advice approved and bade Minerva fly
  Dissolve the league and all her arts employ
  To make the breach the faithless act of Troy
  Fired with the charge she headlong urged her flight
  And shot like lightning from Olympus height
  As the red comet from Saturnius sent
  To fright the nations with a dire portent
  A fatal sign to armies on the plain
  Or trembling sailors on the wintry main
  With sweeping glories glides along in air
  And shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair129
  Between both armies thus in open sight
  Shot the bright goddess in a trail of light
  With eyes erect the gazing hosts admire
  The power descending and the heavens on fire
  The gods they cried the gods this signal sent
  And fate now labours with some vast event
  Jove seals the league or bloodier scenes prepares
  Jove the great arbiter of peace and wars

  They said while Pallas through the Trojan throng
  In shape a mortal passd disguised along
  Like bold Laodocus her course she bent
  Who from Antenor traced his high descent
  Amidst the ranks Lycaons son she found
  The warlike Pandarus for strength renownd
  Whose squadrons led from black Ćsepus flood130
  With flaming shields in martial circle stood
  To him the goddess Phrygian canst thou hear
  A welltimed counsel with a willing ear
  What praise were thine couldst thou direct thy dart
  Amidst his triumph to the Spartans heart
  What gifts from Troy from Paris wouldst thou gain
  Thy countrys foe the Grecian glory slain
  Then seize the occasion dare the mighty deed
  Aim at his breast and may that aim succeed
  But first to speed the shaft address thy vow
  To Lycian Phoebus with the silver bow
  And swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay
  On Zelias altars to the god of day131

  He heard and madly at the motion pleased
  His polishd bow with hasty rashness seized
  Twas formd of horn and smoothd with artful toil
  A mountain goat resignd the shining spoil
  Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled
  The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead
  And sixteen palms his brows large honours spread
  The workmen joind and shaped the bended horns
  And beaten gold each taper point adorns
  This by the Greeks unseen the warrior bends
  Screend by the shields of his surrounding friends
  There meditates the mark and couching low
  Fits the sharp arrow to the wellstrung bow
  One from a hundred featherd deaths he chose
  Fated to wound and cause of future woes
  Then offers vows with hecatombs to crown
  Apollos altars in his native town

  Now with full force the yielding horn he bends
  Drawn to an arch and joins the doubling ends
  Close to his breast he strains the nerve below
  Till the barbd points approach the circling bow
  The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing
  Sounds the tough horn and twangs the quivering string

  But thee Atrides in that dangerous hour
  The gods forget not nor thy guardian power
  Pallas assists and weakened in its force
  Diverts the weapon from its destined course
  So from her babe when slumber seals his eye
  The watchful mother wafts the envenomd fly
  Just where his belt with golden buckles joind
  Where linen folds the double corslet lined
  She turnd the shaft which hissing from above
  Passd the broad belt and through the corslet drove
  The folds it pierced the plaited linen tore
  And razed the skin and drew the purple gore
  As when some stately trappings are decreed
  To grace a monarch on his bounding steed
  A nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred
  Stains the pure ivory with a lively red
  With equal lustre various colours vie
  The shining whiteness and the Tyrian dye
  So great Atrides showd thy sacred blood
  As down thy snowy thigh distilld the streaming flood
  With horror seized the king of men descried
  The shaft infixd and saw the gushing tide
  Nor less the Spartan feard before he found
  The shining barb appear above the wound
  Then with a sigh that heaved his manly breast
  The royal brother thus his grief expressd
  And graspd his hand while all the Greeks around
  With answering sighs returnd the plaintive sound

  Oh dear as life did I for this agree
  The solemn truce a fatal truce to thee
  Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train
  To fight for Greece and conquer to be slain
  The race of Trojans in thy ruin join
  And faith is scornd by all the perjured line
  Not thus our vows confirmd with wine and gore
  Those hands we plighted and those oaths we swore
  Shall all be vain when Heavens revenge is slow
  Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow
  The day shall come that great avenging day
  When Troys proud glories in the dust shall lay
  When Priams powers and Priams self shall fall
  And one prodigious ruin swallow all
  I see the god already from the pole
  Bare his red arm and bid the thunder roll
  I see the Eternal all his fury shed
  And shake his aegis oer their guilty head
  Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait
  But thou alas deservst a happier fate
  Still must I mourn the period of thy days
  And only mourn without my share of praise
  Deprived of thee the heartless Greeks no more
  Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore
  Troy seized of Helen and our glory lost
  Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast
  While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries
  And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies
  Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings
  And such the conquest of her king of kings
  Lo his proud vessels scatterd oer the main
  And unrevenged his mighty brother slain
  Oh ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame
  Oerwhelm me earth and hide a monarchs shame

  He said a leaders and a brothers fears
  Possess his soul which thus the Spartan cheers
  Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate
  The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate
  Stiff with the rich embroiderd work around
  My varied belt repelld the flying wound

  To whom the king My brother and my friend
  Thus always thus may Heaven thy life defend
  Now seek some skilful hand whose powerful art
  May stanch the effusion and extract the dart
  Herald be swift and bid Machaon bring
  His speedy succour to the Spartan king
  Pierced with a winged shaft the deed of Troy
  The Grecians sorrow and the Dardans joy

  With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies
  Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes
  And finds Machaon where sublime he stands132
  In arms incircled with his native bands
  Then thus Machaon to the king repair
  His wounded brother claims thy timely care
  Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow
  A grief to us a triumph to the foe

  The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man
  Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran
  The dauntless king yet standing firm he found
  And all the chiefs in deep concern around
  Where to the steely point the reed was joind
  The shaft he drew but left the head behind
  Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced
  He loosed the corslet from his breast unbraced
  Then suckd the blood and sovereign balm infused133
  Which Chiron gave and Ćsculapius used

  While round the prince the Greeks employ their care
  The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war
  Once more they glitter in refulgent arms
  Once more the fields are filld with dire alarms
  Nor had you seen the king of men appear
  Confused unactive or surprised with fear
  But fond of glory with severe delight
  His beating bosom claimd the rising fight
  No longer with his warlike steeds he stayd
  Or pressd the car with polishd brass inlaid
  But left Eurymedon the reins to guide
  The fiery coursers snorted at his side
  On foot through all the martial ranks he moves
  And these encourages and those reproves
  Brave men he cries to such who boldly dare
  Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war
  Your ancient valour on the foes approve
  Jove is with Greece and let us trust in Jove
  Tis not for us but guilty Troy to dread
  Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head
  Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains
  And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains

  Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires
  Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires
  Shame to your country scandal of your kind
  Born to the fate ye well deserve to find
  Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain
  Prepared for flight but doomd to fly in vain
  Confused and panting thus the hunted deer
  Falls as he flies a victim to his fear
  Still must ye wait the foes and still retire
  Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire
  Or trust ye Jove a valiant foe shall chase
  To save a trembling heartless dastard race

  This said he stalkd with ample strides along
  To Cretes brave monarch and his martial throng
  High at their head he saw the chief appear
  And bold Meriones excite the rear
  At this the king his generous joy expressd
  And claspd the warrior to his armed breast
  Divine Idomeneus what thanks we owe
  To worth like thine what praise shall we bestow
  To thee the foremost honours are decreed
  First in the fight and every graceful deed
  For this in banquets when the generous bowls
  Restore our blood and raise the warriors souls
  Though all the rest with stated rules we bound
  Unmixd unmeasured are thy goblets crownd
  Be still thyself in arms a mighty name
  Maintain thy honours and enlarge thy fame
  To whom the Cretan thus his speech addressd
  Secure of me O king exhort the rest
  Fixd to thy side in every toil I share
  Thy firm associate in the day of war
  But let the signal be this moment given
  To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven
  The field shall prove how perjuries succeed
  And chains or death avenge the impious deed

  Charmd with this heat the king his course pursues
  And next the troops of either Ajax views
  In one firm orb the bands were ranged around
  A cloud of heroes blackend all the ground
  Thus from the lofty promontorys brow
  A swain surveys the gathering storm below
  Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise
  Spread in dim streams and sail along the skies
  Till black as night the swelling tempest shows
  The cloud condensing as the westwind blows
  He dreads the impending storm and drives his flock
  To the close covert of an arching rock

  Such and so thick the embattled squadrons stood
  With spears erect a moving iron wood
  A shady light was shot from glimmering shields
  And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields

  O heroes worthy such a dauntless train
  Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain
  Exclaimd the king who raise your eager bands
  With great examples more than loud commands
  Ah would the gods but breathe in all the rest
  Such souls as burn in your exalted breast
  Soon should our arms with just success be crownd
  And Troys proud walls lie smoking on the ground

  Then to the next the general bends his course
  His heart exults and glories in his force
  There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands
  And with inspiring eloquence commands
  With strictest order sets his train in arms
  The chiefs advises and the soldiers warms
  Alastor Chromius Haemon round him wait
  Bias the good and Pelagon the great
  The horse and chariots to the front assignd
  The foot the strength of war he ranged behind
  The middle space suspected troops supply
  Inclosed by both nor left the power to fly
  He gives command to curb the fiery steed
  Nor cause confusion nor the ranks exceed
  Before the rest let none too rashly ride
  No strength nor skill but just in time be tried
  The charge once made no warrior turn the rein
  But fight or fall a firm embodied train
  He whom the fortune of the field shall cast
  From forth his chariot mount the next in haste
  Nor seek unpractised to direct the car
  Content with javelins to provoke the war
  Our great forefathers held this prudent course
  Thus ruled their ardour thus preserved their force
  By laws like these immortal conquests made
  And earths proud tyrants low in ashes laid

  So spoke the master of the martial art
  And touchd with transport great Atrides heart
  Oh hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires
  And nerves to second what thy soul inspires
  But wasting years that wither human race
  Exhaust thy spirits and thy arms unbrace
  What once thou wert oh ever mightst thou be
  And age the lot of any chief but thee

  Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried
  He shook his hoary locks and thus replied
  Well might I wish could mortal wish renew134
  That strength which once in boiling youth I knew
  Such as I was when Ereuthalion slain
  Beneath this arm fell prostrate on the plain
  But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows
  These years with wisdom crowns with action those
  The field of combat fits the young and bold
  The solemn council best becomes the old
  To you the glorious conflict I resign
  Let sage advice the palm of age be mine

  He said With joy the monarch marchd before
  And found Menestheus on the dusty shore
  With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands
  And next Ulysses with his subject bands
  Remote their forces lay nor knew so far
  The peace infringed nor heard the sounds of war
  The tumult late begun they stood intent
  To watch the motion dubious of the event
  The king who saw their squadrons yet unmoved
  With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved

  Can Peleus son forget a warriors part
  And fears Ulysses skilld in every art
  Why stand you distant and the rest expect
  To mix in combat which yourselves neglect
  From you twas hoped among the first to dare
  The shock of armies and commence the war
  For this your names are calld before the rest
  To share the pleasures of the genial feast
  And can you chiefs without a blush survey
  Whole troops before you labouring in the fray
  Say is it thus those honours you requite
  The first in banquets but the last in fight

  Ulysses heard the heros warmth oerspread
  His cheek with blushes and severe he said
  Take back the unjust reproach Behold we stand
  Sheathed in bright arms and but expect command
  If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight
  Behold me plunging in the thickest fight
  Then give thy warriorchief a warriors due
  Who dares to act whateer thou darst to view
  Struck with his generous wrath the king replies

  O great in action and in council wise
  With ours thy care and ardour are the same
  Nor need I to commend nor aught to blame
  Sage as thou art and learnd in human kind
  Forgive the transport of a martial mind
  Haste to the fight secure of just amends
  The gods that make shall keep the worthy friends

  He said and passd where great Tydides lay
  His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array
  The warlike Sthenelus attends his side135
  To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried
  O son of Tydeus he whose strength could tame
  The bounding steed in arms a mighty name
  Canst thou remote the mingling hosts descry
  With hands unactive and a careless eye
  Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter feard
  Still first in front the matchless prince appeard
  What glorious toils what wonders they recite
  Who viewd him labouring through the ranks of fight
  I saw him once when gathering martial powers
  A peaceful guest he sought Mycenaes towers
  Armies he askd and armies had been given
  Not we denied but Jove forbade from heaven
  While dreadful comets glaring from afar
  Forewarnd the horrors of the Theban war136
  Next sent by Greece from where Asopus flows
  A fearless envoy he approachd the foes
  Thebes hostile walls unguarded and alone
  Dauntless he enters and demands the throne
  The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found
  And dared to combat all those chiefs around
  Dared and subdued before their haughty lord
  For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword
  Stung with the shame within the winding way
  To bar his passage fifty warriors lay
  Two heroes led the secret squadron on
  Mason the fierce and hardy Lycophon
  Those fifty slaughterd in the gloomy vale
  He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale
  Such Tydeus was and such his martial fire
  Gods how the son degenerates from the sire

  No words the godlike Diomed returnd
  But heard respectful and in secret burnd
  Not so fierce Capaneus undaunted son
  Stern as his sire the boaster thus begun

  What needs O monarch this invidious praise
  Ourselves to lessen while our sire you raise
  Dare to be just Atrides and confess
  Our value equal though our fury less
  With fewer troops we stormd the Theban wall
  And happier saw the sevenfold city fall137
  In impious acts the guilty father died
  The sons subdued for Heaven was on their side
  Far more than heirs of all our parents fame
  Our glories darken their diminishd name

  To him Tydides thus My friend forbear
  Suppress thy passion and the king revere
  His high concern may well excuse this rage
  Whose cause we follow and whose war we wage
  His the first praise were Ilions towers oerthrown
  And if we fail the chief disgrace his own
  Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite
  Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight

  He spoke and ardent on the trembling ground
  Sprung from his car his ringing arms resound
  Dire was the clang and dreadful from afar
  Of armd Tydides rushing to the war
  As when the winds ascending by degrees138
  First move the whitening surface of the seas
  The billows float in order to the shore
  The wave behind rolls on the wave before
  Till with the growing storm the deeps arise
  Foam oer the rocks and thunder to the skies
  So to the fight the thick battalions throng
  Shields urged on shields and men drove men along
  Sedate and silent move the numerous bands
  No sound no whisper but the chiefs commands
  Those only heard with awe the rest obey
  As if some god had snatchd their voice away
  Not so the Trojans from their host ascends
  A general shout that all the region rends
  As when the fleecy flocks unnumberd stand
  In wealthy folds and wait the milkers hand
  The hollow vales incessant bleating fills
  The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills
  Such clamours rose from various nations round
  Mixd was the murmur and confused the sound
  Each host now joins and each a god inspires
  These Mars incites and those Minerva fires
  Pale flight around and dreadful terror reign
  And discord raging bathes the purple plain
  Discord dire sister of the slaughtering power
  Small at her birth but rising every hour
  While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound
  She stalks on earth and shakes the world around139
  The nations bleed whereer her steps she turns
  The groan still deepens and the combat burns

  Now shield with shield with helmet helmet closed
  To armour armour lance to lance opposed
  Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew
  The sounding darts in iron tempests flew
  Victors and vanquishd joind promiscuous cries
  And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise
  With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed
  And slaughterd heroes swell the dreadful tide

  As torrents roll increased by numerous rills
  With rage impetuous down their echoing hills
  Rush to the vales and pourd along the plain
  Roar through a thousand channels to the main
  The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound
  So mix both hosts and so their cries rebound

  The bold Antilochus the slaughter led
  The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead
  At great Echepolus the lance arrives
  Razed his high crest and through his helmet drives
  Warmd in the brain the brazen weapon lies
  And shades eternal settle oer his eyes
  So sinks a tower that long assaults had stood
  Of force and fire its walls besmeard with blood
  Him the bold leader of the Abantian throng140
  Seized to despoil and draggd the corpse along
  But while he strove to tug the inserted dart
  Agenors javelin reachd the heros heart
  His flank unguarded by his ample shield
  Admits the lance he falls and spurns the field
  The nerves unbraced support his limbs no more
  The soul comes floating in a tide of gore
  Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain
  The war renews the warriors bleed again
  As oer their prey rapacious wolves engage
  Man dies on man and all is blood and rage

  In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell
  Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell
  Fair Simoisius whom his mother bore
  Amid the flocks on silver Simois shore
  The nymph descending from the hills of Ide
  To seek her parents on his flowery side
  Brought forth the babe their common care and joy
  And thence from Simois named the lovely boy
  Short was his date by dreadful Ajax slain
  He falls and renders all their cares in vain
  So falls a poplar that in watery ground
  Raised high the head with stately branches crownd
  Felld by some artist with his shining steel
  To shape the circle of the bending wheel
  Cut down it lies tall smooth and largely spread
  With all its beauteous honours on its head
  There left a subject to the wind and rain
  And scorchd by suns it withers on the plain
  Thus pierced by Ajax Simoisius lies
  Stretchd on the shore and thus neglected dies

  At Ajax Antiphus his javelin threw
  The pointed lance with erring fury flew
  And Leucus loved by wise Ulysses slew
  He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain
  And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain
  This saw Ulysses and with grief enraged
  Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged
  Armd with his spear he meditates the wound
  In act to throw but cautious lookd around
  Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew
  And trembling heard the javelin as it flew
  A chief stood nigh who from Abydos came
  Old Priams son Democoon was his name
  The weapon entered close above his ear
  Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear141
  With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath
  His eyeballs darken with the shades of death
  Ponderous he falls his clanging arms resound
  And his broad buckler rings against the ground

  Seized with affright the boldest foes appear
  Een godlike Hector seems himself to fear
  Slow he gave way the rest tumultuous fled
  The Greeks with shouts press on and spoil the dead
  But Phoebus now from Ilions towering height
  Shines forth reveald and animates the fight
  Trojans be bold and force with force oppose
  Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes
  Nor are their bodies rocks nor ribbd with steel
  Your weapons enter and your strokes they feel
  Have ye forgot what seemd your dread before
  The great the fierce Achilles fights no more

  Apollo thus from Ilions lofty towers
  Arrayd in terrors roused the Trojan powers
  While wars fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe
  And shouts and thunders in the fields below
  Then great Diores fell by doom divine
  In vain his valour and illustrious line
  A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw
  Who from cold Ćnus led the Thracian crew142
  Full on his ankle droppd the ponderous stone
  Burst the strong nerves and crashd the solid bone
  Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands
  Before his helpless friends and native bands
  And spreads for aid his unavailing hands
  The foe rushd furious as he pants for breath
  And through his navel drove the pointed death
  His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground
  And the warm life came issuing from the wound

  His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent
  Deep in his breast above the pap it went
  Amid the lungs was fixd the winged wood
  And quivering in his heaving bosom stood
  Till from the dying chief approaching near
  The Ćtolian warrior tuggd his weighty spear
  Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round
  And gashd his belly with a ghastly wound
  The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain
  To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain
  The Thracian bands against the victor pressd
  A grove of lances glitterd at his breast
  Stern Thoas glaring with revengeful eyes
  In sullen fury slowly quits the prize

  Thus fell two heroes one the pride of Thrace
  And one the leader of the Epeian race
  Deaths sable shade at once oercast their eyes
  In dust the vanquishd and the victor lies
  With copious slaughter all the fields are red
  And heapd with growing mountains of the dead

  Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld
  By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field
  Might darts be bid to turn their points away
  And swords around him innocently play
  The wars whole art with wonder had he seen
  And counted heroes where he counted men

  So fought each host with thirst of glory fired
  And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired

BOOK V


ARGUMENT

THE ACTS OF DIOMED

Diomed assisted by Pallas performs wonders in this days battle
Pandarus wounds him with an arrow but the goddess cures him enables him
to discern gods from mortals and prohibits him from contending with any
of the former excepting Venus Ćneas joins Pandarus to oppose him
Pandarus is killed and Ćneas in great danger but for the assistance of
Venus who as she is removing her son from the fight is wounded on the
hand by Diomed Apollo seconds her in his rescue and at length carries
off Ćneas to Troy where he is healed in the temple of Pergamus Mars
rallies the Trojans and assists Hector to make a stand In the meantime
Ćneas is restored to the field and they overthrow several of the Greeks
among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon Juno and Minerva descend
to resist Mars the latter incites Diomed to go against that god he
wounds him and sends him groaning to heaven

The first battle continues through this book The scene is the same as in
the former

  But Pallas now Tydides soul inspires143
  Fills with her force and warms with all her fires
  Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise
  And crown her hero with distinguishd praise
  High on his helm celestial lightnings play
  His beamy shield emits a living ray
  The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies
  Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies
  When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight
  And bathed in ocean shoots a keener light
  Such glories Pallas on the chief bestowd
  Such from his arms the fierce effulgence flowd
  Onward she drives him furious to engage
  Where the fight burns and where the thickest rage

  The sons of Dares first the combat sought
  A wealthy priest but rich without a fault
  In Vulcans fane the fathers days were led
  The sons to toils of glorious battle bred
  These singled from their troops the fight maintain
  These from their steeds Tydides on the plain
  Fierce for renown the brotherchiefs draw near
  And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear
  Which oer the warriors shoulder took its course
  And spent in empty air its erring force
  Not so Tydides flew thy lance in vain
  But pierced his breast and stretchd him on the plain
  Seized with unusual fear Idaeus fled
  Left the rich chariot and his brother dead
  And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid
  He too had sunk to deaths eternal shade
  But in a smoky cloud the god of fire
  Preserved the son in pity to the sire
  The steeds and chariot to the navy led
  Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed

  Struck with amaze and shame the Trojan crew
  Or slain or fled the sons of Dares view
  When by the bloodstaind hand Minerva pressd
  The god of battles and this speech addressd

  Stern power of war by whom the mighty fall
  Who bathe in blood and shake the lofty wall
  Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide
  And whose the conquest mighty Jove decide
  While we from interdicted fields retire
  Nor tempt the wrath of heavens avenging sire

  Her words allay the impetuous warriors heat
  The god of arms and martial maid retreat
  Removed from fight on Xanthus flowery bounds
  They sat and listend to the dying sounds

  Meantime the Greeks the Trojan race pursue
  And some bold chieftain every leader slew
  First Odius falls and bites the bloody sand
  His death ennobled by Atrides hand

  As he to flight his wheeling car addressd
  The speedy javelin drove from back to breast
  In dust the mighty Halizonian lay
  His arms resound the spirit wings its way

  Thy fate was next O Phaestus doomd to feel
  The great Idomeneus protended steel
  Whom Borus sent his son and only joy
  From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy
  The Cretan javelin reachd him from afar
  And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car
  Back from the car he tumbles to the ground
  And everlasting shades his eyes surround

  Then died Scamandrius expert in the chase
  In woods and wilds to wound the savage race
  Diana taught him all her sylvan arts
  To bend the bow and aim unerring darts
  But vainly here Dianas arts he tries
  The fatal lance arrests him as he flies
  From Menelaus arm the weapon sent
  Through his broad back and heaving bosom went
  Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound
  His brazen armour rings against the ground

  Next artful Phereclus untimely fell
  Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell
  Thy fathers skill O Phereclus was thine
  The graceful fabric and the fair design
  For loved by Pallas Pallas did impart
  To him the shipwrights and the builders art
  Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose
  The fatal cause of all his countrys woes
  But he the mystic will of heaven unknown
  Nor saw his countrys peril nor his own
  The hapless artist while confused he fled
  The spear of Merion mingled with the dead
  Through his right hip with forceful fury cast
  Between the bladder and the bone it passd
  Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries
  And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes

  From Meges force the swift Pedaeus fled
  Antenors offspring from a foreign bed
  Whose generous spouse Theanor heavenly fair
  Nursed the young stranger with a mothers care
  How vain those cares when Meges in the rear
  Full in his nape infixd the fatal spear
  Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides
  And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides

  Then died Hypsenor generous and divine
  Sprung from the brave Dolopions mighty line
  Who near adored Scamander made abode
  Priest of the stream and honoured as a god
  On him amidst the flying numbers found
  Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound
  On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand
  Thence glancing downwards loppd his holy hand
  Which staind with sacred blood the blushing sand
  Down sunk the priest the purple hand of death
  Closed his dim eye and fate suppressd his breath

  Thus toild the chiefs in different parts engaged
  In every quarter fierce Tydides raged
  Amid the Greek amid the Trojan train
  Rapt through the ranks he thunders oer the plain
  Now here now there he darts from place to place
  Pours on the rear or lightens in their face
  Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong
  Deluge whole fields and sweep the trees along
  Through ruind moles the rushing wave resounds
  Oerwhelms the bridge and bursts the lofty bounds
  The yellow harvests of the ripend year
  And flatted vineyards one sad waste appear144
  While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain
  And all the labours of mankind are vain

  So raged Tydides boundless in his ire
  Drove armies back and made all Troy retire
  With grief the leader of the Lycian band
  Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand
  His bended bow against the chief he drew
  Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew
  Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore
  Deep in his shoulder pierced and drank the gore
  The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed
  While the proud archer thus exulting cried

  Hither ye Trojans hither drive your steeds
  Lo by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds
  Not long the deathful dart he can sustain
  Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain
  So spoke he boastful but the winged dart
  Stoppd short of life and mockd the shooters art
  The wounded chief behind his car retired
  The helping hand of Sthenelus required
  Swift from his seat he leapd upon the ground
  And tuggd the weapon from the gushing wound
  When thus the king his guardian power addressd
  The purple current wandering oer his vest

  O progeny of Jove unconquerd maid
  If eer my godlike sire deserved thy aid
  If eer I felt thee in the fighting field
  Now goddess now thy sacred succour yield
  O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight
  Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guardst in fight
  And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore
  That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more

  Thus prayd Tydides and Minerva heard
  His nerves confirmd his languid spirits cheerd
  He feels each limb with wonted vigour light
  His beating bosom claimd the promised fight
  Be bold she cried in every combat shine
  War be thy province thy protection mine
  Rush to the fight and every foe control
  Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul
  Strength swells thy boiling breast infused by me
  And all thy godlike father breathes in thee
  Yet more from mortal mists I purge thy eyes145
  And set to view the warring deities
  These see thou shun through all the embattled plain
  Nor rashly strive where human force is vain
  If Venus mingle in the martial band
  Her shalt thou wound so Pallas gives command

  With that the blueeyed virgin wingd her flight
  The hero rushd impetuous to the fight
  With tenfold ardour now invades the plain
  Wild with delay and more enraged by pain
  As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls
  Amidst the field a brindled lion falls
  If chance some shepherd with a distant dart
  The savage wound he rouses at the smart
  He foams he roars the shepherd dares not stay
  But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey
  Heaps fall on heaps he bathes with blood the ground
  Then leaps victorious oer the lofty mound
  Not with less fury stern Tydides flew
  And two brave leaders at an instant slew
  Astynous breathless fell and by his side
  His peoples pastor good Hypenor died
  Astynous breast the deadly lance receives
  Hypenors shoulder his broad falchion cleaves
  Those slain he left and sprung with noble rage
  Abas and Polyidus to engage
  Sons of Eurydamus who wise and old
  Could fate foresee and mystic dreams unfold
  The youths returnd not from the doubtful plain
  And the sad father tried his arts in vain
  No mystic dream could make their fates appear
  Though now determined by Tydides spear

  Young Xanthus next and Thoon felt his rage
  The joy and hope of Phaenops feeble age
  Vast was his wealth and these the only heirs
  Of all his labours and a life of cares
  Cold death oertakes them in their blooming years
  And leaves the father unavailing tears
  To strangers now descends his heapy store
  The race forgotten and the name no more

  Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride
  Glittering in arms and combat side by side
  As when the lordly lion seeks his food
  Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood
  He leaps amidst them with a furious bound
  Bends their strong necks and tears them to the ground
  So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn
  Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne

  With deep concern divine Ćneas viewd
  The foe prevailing and his friends pursued
  Through the thick storm of singing spears he flies
  Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes
  At length he found Lycaons mighty son
  To whom the chief of Venus race begun

  Where Pandarus are all thy honours now
  Thy winged arrows and unerring bow
  Thy matchless skill thy yet unrivalld fame
  And boasted glory of the Lycian name
  O pierce that mortal if we mortal call
  That wondrous force by which whole armies fall
  Or god incensed who quits the distant skies
  To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice
  Which oh avert from our unhappy state
  For what so dreadful as celestial hate
  Whoeer he be propitiate Jove with prayer
  If man destroy if god entreat to spare

  To him the Lycian Whom your eyes behold
  If right I judge is Diomed the bold
  Such coursers whirl him oer the dusty field
  So towers his helmet and so flames his shield
  If tis a god he wears that chiefs disguise
  Or if that chief some guardian of the skies
  Involved in clouds protects him in the fray
  And turns unseen the frustrate dart away
  I wingd an arrow which not idly fell
  The stroke had fixd him to the gates of hell
  And but some god some angry god withstands
  His fate was due to these unerring hands
  Skilld in the bow on foot I sought the war
  Nor joind swift horses to the rapid car
  Ten polishd chariots I possessd at home
  And still they grace Lycaons princely dome
  There veild in spacious coverlets they stand
  And twice ten coursers wait their lords command
  The good old warrior bade me trust to these
  When first for Troy I saild the sacred seas
  In fields aloft the whirling car to guide
  And through the ranks of death triumphant ride
  But vain with youth and yet to thrift inclined
  I heard his counsels with unheedful mind
  And thought the steeds your large supplies unknown
  Might fail of forage in the straitend town
  So took my bow and pointed darts in hand
  And left the chariots in my native land

  Too late O friend my rashness I deplore
  These shafts once fatal carry death no more
  Tydeus and Atreus sons their points have found
  And undissembled gore pursued the wound
  In vain they bleed this unavailing bow
  Serves not to slaughter but provoke the foe
  In evil hour these bended horns I strung
  And seized the quiver where it idly hung
  Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field
  Without a warriors arms the spear and shield
  If eer with life I quit the Trojan plain
  If eer I see my spouse and sire again
  This bow unfaithful to my glorious aims
  Broke by my hand shall feed the blazing flames

  To whom the leader of the Dardan race
  Be calm nor Phoebus honourd gift disgrace
  The distant dart be praised though here we need
  The rushing chariot and the bounding steed
  Against yon hero let us bend our course
  And hand to hand encounter force with force
  Now mount my seat and from the chariots height
  Observe my fathers steeds renownd in fight
  Practised alike to turn to stop to chase
  To dare the shock or urge the rapid race
  Secure with these through fighting fields we go
  Or safe to Troy if Jove assist the foe
  Haste seize the whip and snatch the guiding rein
  The warriors fury let this arm sustain
  Or if to combat thy bold heart incline
  Take thou the spear the chariots care be mine

  O prince Lycaons valiant son replied
  As thine the steeds be thine the task to guide
  The horses practised to their lords command
  Shall bear the rein and answer to thy hand
  But if unhappy we desert the fight
  Thy voice alone can animate their flight
  Else shall our fates be numberd with the dead
  And these the victors prize in triumph led
  Thine be the guidance then with spear and shield
  Myself will charge this terror of the field

  And now both heroes mount the glittering car
  The bounding coursers rush amidst the war
  Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied
  Who thus alarmd to great Tydides cried

  O friend two chiefs of force immense I see
  Dreadful they come and bend their rage on thee
  Lo the brave heir of old Lycaons line
  And great Ćneas sprung from race divine
  Enough is given to fame Ascend thy car
  And save a life the bulwark of our war

  At this the hero cast a gloomy look
  Fixd on the chief with scorn and thus he spoke

  Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight
  Me wouldst thou move to base inglorious flight
  Know tis not honest in my soul to fear
  Nor was Tydides born to tremble here
  I hate the cumbrous chariots slow advance
  And the long distance of the flying lance
  But while my nerves are strong my force entire
  Thus front the foe and emulate my sire
  Nor shall yon steeds that fierce to fight convey
  Those threatening heroes bear them both away
  One chief at least beneath this arm shall die
  So Pallas tells me and forbids to fly
  But if she dooms and if no god withstand
  That both shall fall by one victorious hand
  Then heed my words my horses here detain
  Fixd to the chariot by the straitend rein
  Swift to Ćneas empty seat proceed
  And seize the coursers of ethereal breed
  The race of those which once the thundering god146
  For ravishd Ganymede on Tros bestowd
  The best that eer on earths broad surface run
  Beneath the rising or the setting sun
  Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown
  By mortal mares from fierce Laomedon
  Four of this race his ample stalls contain
  And two transport Ćneas oer the plain
  These were the rich immortal prize our own
  Through the wide world should make our glory known

  Thus while they spoke the foe came furious on
  And stern Lycaons warlike race begun

  Prince thou art met Though late in vain assaild
  The spear may enter where the arrow faild

  He said then shook the ponderous lance and flung
  On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung
  Pierced the tough orb and in his cuirass hung
  He bleeds the pride of Greece the boaster cries
  Our triumph now the mighty warrior lies
  Mistaken vaunter Diomed replied
  Thy dart has erred and now my spear be tried
  Ye scape not both one headlong from his car
  With hostile blood shall glut the god of war

  He spoke and rising hurld his forceful dart
  Which driven by Pallas pierced a vital part
  Full in his face it enterd and betwixt
  The nose and eyeball the proud Lycian fixd
  Crashd all his jaws and cleft the tongue within
  Till the bright point lookd out beneath the chin
  Headlong he falls his helmet knocks the ground
  Earth groans beneath him and his arms resound
  The starting coursers tremble with affright
  The soul indignant seeks the realms of night

  To guard his slaughterd friend Ćneas flies
  His spear extending where the carcase lies
  Watchful he wheels protects it every way
  As the grim lion stalks around his prey
  Oer the falln trunk his ample shield displayd
  He hides the hero with his mighty shade
  And threats aloud the Greeks with longing eyes
  Behold at distance but forbear the prize
  Then fierce Tydides stoops and from the fields
  Heaved with vast force a rocky fragment wields
  Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise
  Such men as live in these degenerate days147
  He swung it round and gathering strength to throw
  Discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe
  Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites
  Full on the bone the pointed marble lights
  Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone
  And strippd the skin and crackd the solid bone
  Sunk on his knees and staggering with his pains
  His falling bulk his bended arm sustains
  Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies
  A sudden cloud comes swimming oer his eyes
  There the brave chief who mighty numbers swayd
  Oppressd had sunk to deaths eternal shade
  But heavenly Venus mindful of the love
  She bore Anchises in the Idaean grove
  His danger views with anguish and despair
  And guards her offspring with a mothers care
  About her muchloved son her arms she throws
  Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows
  Screend from the foe behind her shining veil
  The swords wave harmless and the javelins fail
  Safe through the rushing horse and featherd flight
  Of sounding shafts she bears him from the fight

  Nor Sthenelus with unassisting hands
  Remaind unheedful of his lords commands
  His panting steeds removed from out the war
  He fixd with straitend traces to the car
  Next rushing to the Dardan spoil detains
  The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes
  These in proud triumph to the fleet conveyd
  No longer now a Trojan lord obeyd
  That charge to bold Deipylus he gave
  Whom most he loved as brave men love the brave
  Then mounting on his car resumed the rein
  And followd where Tydides swept the plain

  Meanwhile his conquest ravished from his eyes
  The raging chief in chase of Venus flies
  No goddess she commissiond to the field
  Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield
  Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall
  While flames ascend and mighty ruins fall
  He knew soft combats suit the tender dame
  New to the field and still a foe to fame
  Through breaking ranks his furious course he bends
  And at the goddess his broad lance extends
  Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove
  The ambrosial veil which all the Graces wove
  Her snowy hand the razing steel profaned
  And the transparent skin with crimson staind
  From the clear vein a stream immortal flowd
  Such stream as issues from a wounded god148
  Pure emanation uncorrupted flood
  Unlike our gross diseased terrestrial blood
  For not the bread of man their life sustains
  Nor wines inflaming juice supplies their veins
  With tender shrieks the goddess filld the place
  And droppd her offspring from her weak embrace
  Him Phoebus took he casts a cloud around
  The fainting chief and wards the mortal wound

  Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies
  The king insults the goddess as she flies
  Ill with Joves daughter bloody fights agree
  The field of combat is no scene for thee
  Go let thy own soft sex employ thy care
  Go lull the coward or delude the fair
  Taught by this stroke renounce the wars alarms
  And learn to tremble at the name of arms

  Tydides thus The goddess seized with dread
  Confused distracted from the conflict fled
  To aid her swift the winged Iris flew
  Wrapt in a mist above the warring crew
  The queen of love with faded charms she found
  Pale was her cheek and livid lookd the wound
  To Mars who sat remote they bent their way
  Far on the left with clouds involved he lay
  Beside him stood his lance distaind with gore
  And reind with gold his foaming steeds before
  Low at his knee she beggd with streaming eyes
  Her brothers car to mount the distant skies
  And showd the wound by fierce Tydides given
  A mortal man who dares encounter heaven
  Stern Mars attentive hears the queen complain
  And to her hand commits the golden rein
  She mounts the seat oppressd with silent woe
  Driven by the goddess of the painted bow
  The lash resounds the rapid chariot flies
  And in a moment scales the lofty skies
  They stoppd the car and there the coursers stood
  Fed by fair Iris with ambrosial food
  Before her mother loves bright queen appears
  Oerwhelmed with anguish and dissolved in tears
  She raised her in her arms beheld her bleed
  And askd what god had wrought this guilty deed

  Then she This insult from no god I found
  An impious mortal gave the daring wound
  Behold the deed of haughty Diomed
  Twas in the sons defence the mother bled
  The war with Troy no more the Grecians wage
  But with the gods the immortal gods engage

  Dione then Thy wrongs with patience bear
  And share those griefs inferior powers must share
  Unnumberd woes mankind from us sustain
  And men with woes afflict the gods again
  The mighty Mars in mortal fetters bound149
  And lodged in brazen dungeons underground
  Full thirteen moons imprisond roard in vain
  Otus and Ephialtes held the chain
  Perhaps had perishd had not Hermes care
  Restored the groaning god to upper air
  Great Junos self has borne her weight of pain
  The imperial partner of the heavenly reign
  Amphitryons son infixd the deadly dart150
  And filld with anguish her immortal heart
  Een hells grim king Alcides power confessd
  The shaft found entrance in his iron breast
  To Joves high palace for a cure he fled
  Pierced in his own dominions of the dead
  Where Paeon sprinkling heavenly balm around
  Assuaged the glowing pangs and closed the wound
  Rash impious man to stain the blessd abodes
  And drench his arrows in the blood of gods

  But thou though Pallas urged thy frantic deed
  Whose spear illfated makes a goddess bleed
  Know thou whoeer with heavenly power contends
  Short is his date and soon his glory ends
  From fields of death when late he shall retire
  No infant on his knees shall call him sire
  Strong as thou art some god may yet be found
  To stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground
  Thy distant wife Ćgiale the fair151
  Starting from sleep with a distracted air
  Shall rouse thy slaves and her lost lord deplore
  The brave the great the glorious now no more

  This said she wiped from Venus wounded palm
  The sacred ichor and infused the balm
  Juno and Pallas with a smile surveyd
  And thus to Jove began the blueeyed maid

  Permit thy daughter gracious Jove to tell
  How this mischance the Cyprian queen befell
  As late she tried with passion to inflame
  The tender bosom of a Grecian dame
  Allured the fair with moving thoughts of joy
  To quit her country for some youth of Troy
  The clasping zone with golden buckles bound
  Razed her soft hand with this lamented wound

  The sire of gods and men superior smiled
  And calling Venus thus addressd his child
  Not these O daughter are thy proper cares
  Thee milder arts befit and softer wars
  Sweet smiles are thine and kind endearing charms
  To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms

  Thus they in heaven while on the plain below
  The fierce Tydides charged his Dardan foe
  Flushd with celestial blood pursued his way
  And fearless dared the threatening god of day
  Already in his hopes he saw him killd
  Though screend behind Apollos mighty shield
  Thrice rushing furious at the chief he strook
  His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook
  He tried the fourth when breaking from the cloud
  A more than mortal voice was heard aloud

  O son of Tydeus cease be wise and see
  How vast the difference of the gods and thee
  Distance immense between the powers that shine
  Above eternal deathless and divine
  And mortal man a wretch of humble birth
  A shortlived reptile in the dust of earth

  So spoke the god who darts celestial fires
  He dreads his fury and some steps retires
  Then Phoebus bore the chief of Venus race
  To Troys high fane and to his holy place
  Latona there and Phoebe heald the wound
  With vigour armd him and with glory crownd
  This done the patron of the silver bow
  A phantom raised the same in shape and show
  With great Ćneas such the form he bore
  And such in fight the radiant arms he wore
  Around the spectre bloody wars are waged
  And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged
  Meantime on Ilions tower Apollo stood
  And calling Mars thus urged the raging god

  Stern power of arms by whom the mighty fall
  Who bathest in blood and shakest the embattled wall
  Rise in thy wrath to hells abhorrd abodes
  Despatch yon Greek and vindicate the gods
  First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage
  Me next he charged and dares all heaven engage
  The wretch would brave high heavens immortal sire
  His triple thunder and his bolts of fire

  The god of battle issues on the plain
  Stirs all the ranks and fires the Trojan train
  In form like Acamas the Thracian guide
  Enraged to Troys retiring chiefs he cried

  How long ye sons of Priam will ye fly
  And unrevenged see Priams people die
  Still unresisted shall the foe destroy
  And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy
  Lo brave Ćneas sinks beneath his wound
  Not godlike Hector more in arms renownd
  Haste all and take the generous warriors part
  He saidnew courage swelld each heros heart
  Sarpedon first his ardent soul expressd
  And turnd to Hector these bold words addressd

  Say chief is all thy ancient valour lost
  Where are thy threats and where thy glorious boast
  That proppd alone by Priams race should stand
  Troys sacred walls nor need a foreign hand
  Now now thy country calls her wonted friends
  And the proud vaunt in just derision ends
  Remote they stand while alien troops engage
  Like trembling hounds before the lions rage
  Far distant hence I held my wide command
  Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land
  With ample wealth the wish of mortals blessd
  A beauteous wife and infant at her breast
  With those I left whatever dear could be
  Greece if she conquers nothing wins from me
  Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer
  And long to meet this mighty man ye fear
  While Hector idle stands nor bids the brave
  Their wives their infants and their altars save
  Haste warrior haste preserve thy threatend state
  Or one vast burst of allinvolving fate
  Full oer your towers shall fall and sweep away
  Sons sires and wives an undistinguishd prey
  Rouse all thy Trojans urge thy aids to fight
  These claim thy thoughts by day thy watch by night
  With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose
  Such cares thy friends deserve and such thy foes

  Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears
  But just reproof with decent silence bears
  From his proud car the prince impetuous springs
  On earth he leaps his brazen armour rings
  Two shining spears are brandishd in his hands
  Thus armd he animates his drooping bands
  Revives their ardour turns their steps from flight
  And wakes anew the dying flames of fight
  They turn they stand the Greeks their fury dare
  Condense their powers and wait the growing war

  As when on Ceres sacred floor the swain
  Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain
  And the light chaff before the breezes borne
  Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn
  The grey dust rising with collected winds
  Drives oer the barn and whitens all the hinds
  So white with dust the Grecian host appears
  From trampling steeds and thundering charioteers
  The dusky clouds from labourd earth arise
  And roll in smoking volumes to the skies
  Mars hovers oer them with his sable shield
  And adds new horrors to the darkend field
  Pleased with his charge and ardent to fulfil
  In Troys defence Apollos heavenly will
  Soon as from fight the blueeyed maid retires
  Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires
  And now the god from forth his sacred fane
  Produced Ćneas to the shouting train
  Alive unharmd with all his peers around
  Erect he stood and vigorous from his wound
  Inquiries none they made the dreadful day
  No pause of words admits no dull delay
  Fierce Discord storms Apollo loud exclaims
  Fame calls Mars thunders and the fields in flames

  Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood
  And great Ulysses bathed in hostile blood
  Embodied close the labouring Grecian train
  The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain
  Unmoved and silent the whole war they wait
  Serenely dreadful and as fixd as fate
  So when the embattled clouds in dark array
  Along the skies their gloomy lines display
  When now the North his boisterous rage has spent
  And peaceful sleeps the liquid element
  The lowhung vapours motionless and still
  Rest on the summits of the shaded hill
  Till the mass scatters as the winds arise
  Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies

  Nor was the general wanting to his train
  From troop to troop he toils through all the plain
  Ye Greeks be men the charge of battle bear
  Your brave associates and yourselves revere
  Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire
  And catch from breast to breast the noble fire
  On valours side the odds of combat lie
  The brave live glorious or lamented die
  The wretch who trembles in the field of fame
  Meets death and worse than death eternal shame

  These words he seconds with his flying lance
  To meet whose point was strong Deicoons chance
  Ćneas friend and in his native place
  Honourd and loved like Priams royal race
  Long had he fought the foremost in the field
  But now the monarchs lance transpierced his shield
  His shield too weak the furious dart to stay
  Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way
  The grisly wound dismissd his soul to hell
  His arms around him rattled as he fell

  Then fierce Ćneas brandishing his blade
  In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid
  Whose sire Diocleus wealthy brave and great
  In wellbuilt Pherae held his lofty seat152
  Sprung from Alpheus plenteous stream that yields
  Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields
  He got Orsilochus Diocleus he
  And these descended in the third degree
  Too early expert in the martial toil
  In sable ships they left their native soil
  To avenge Atrides now untimely slain
  They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain
  So two young mountain lions nursed with blood
  In deep recesses of the gloomy wood
  Rush fearless to the plains and uncontrolld
  Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold
  Till pierced at distance from their native den
  Oerpowered they fall beneath the force of men
  Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay
  Like mountain firs as tall and straight as they
  Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes
  Lifts his bright lance and at the victor flies
  Mars urged him on yet ruthless in his hate
  The god but urged him to provoke his fate
  He thus advancing Nestors valiant son
  Shakes for his danger and neglects his own
  Struck with the thought should Helens lord be slain
  And all his countrys glorious labours vain
  Already met the threatening heroes stand
  The spears already tremble in their hand
  In rushd Antilochus his aid to bring
  And fall or conquer by the Spartan king
  These seen the Dardan backward turnd his course
  Brave as he was and shunnd unequal force
  The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew
  Then mix in combat and their toils renew

  First Pylaemenes great in battle bled
  Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led
  Atrides markd him where sublime he stood
  Fixd in his throat the javelin drank his blood
  The faithful Mydon as he turnd from fight
  His flying coursers sunk to endless night
  A broken rock by Nestors son was thrown
  His bended arm received the falling stone
  From his numbd hand the ivorystudded reins
  Droppd in the dust are traild along the plains
  Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound
  He groans in death and ponderous sinks to ground
  Deep drove his helmet in the sands and there
  The head stood fixd the quivering legs in air
  Till trampled flat beneath the coursers feet
  The youthful victor mounts his empty seat
  And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet

  Great Hector saw and raging at the view
  Pours on the Greeks the Trojan troops pursue
  He fires his host with animating cries
  And brings along the furies of the skies
  Mars stern destroyer and Bellona dread
  Flame in the front and thunder at their head
  This swells the tumult and the rage of fight
  That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light
  Where Hector marchd the god of battles shined
  Now stormd before him and now raged behind

  Tydides paused amidst his full career
  Then first the heros manly breast knew fear
  As when some simple swain his cot forsakes
  And wide through fens an unknown journey takes
  If chance a swelling brook his passage stay
  And foam impervious cross the wanderers way
  Confused he stops a length of country passd
  Eyes the rough waves and tired returns at last
  Amazed no less the great Tydides stands
  He stayd and turning thus addressd his bands

  No wonder Greeks that all to Hector yield
  Secure of favouring gods he takes the field
  His strokes they second and avert our spears
  Behold where Mars in mortal arms appears
  Retire then warriors but sedate and slow
  Retire but with your faces to the foe
  Trust not too much your unavailing might
  Tis not with Troy but with the gods ye fight

  Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew
  And first two leaders valiant Hector slew
  His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found
  In every art of glorious war renownd
  In the same car the chiefs to combat ride
  And fought united and united died
  Struck at the sight the mighty Ajax glows
  With thirst of vengeance and assaults the foes
  His massy spear with matchless fury sent
  Through Amphius belt and heaving belly went
  Amphius Apaesus happy soil possessd
  With herds abounding and with treasure blessd
  But fate resistless from his country led
  The chief to perish at his peoples head
  Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung
  And fierce to seize it conquering Ajax sprung
  Around his head an iron tempest raind
  A wood of spears his ample shield sustaind
  Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he pressd
  And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast
  He could no more the showering darts denied
  To spoil his glittering arms and plumy pride
  Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields
  With bristling lances and compacted shields
  Till in the steely circle straitend round
  Forced he gives way and sternly quits the ground

  While thus they strive Tlepolemus the great153
  Urged by the force of unresisted fate
  Burns with desire Sarpedons strength to prove
  Alcides offspring meets the son of Jove
  Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on
  Joves great descendant and his greater son
  Prepared for combat ere the lance he tossd
  The daring Rhodian vents his haughty boast

  What brings this Lycian counsellor so far
  To tremble at our arms not mix in war
  Know thy vain self nor let their flattery move
  Who style thee son of cloudcompelling Jove
  How far unlike those chiefs of race divine
  How vast the difference of their deeds and thine
  Jove got such heroes as my sire whose soul
  No fear could daunt nor earth nor hell control
  Troy felt his arm and yon proud ramparts stand
  Raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand
  With six small ships and but a slender train
  He left the town a widedeserted plain
  But what art thou who deedless lookst around
  While unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground
  Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be
  But wert thou greater thou must yield to me
  Pierced by my spear to endless darkness go
  I make this present to the shades below

  The son of Hercules the Rhodian guide
  Thus haughty spoke The Lycian king replied

  Thy sire O prince oerturnd the Trojan state
  Whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate
  Those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far
  False he detaind the just reward of war
  Nor so content the generous chief defied
  With base reproaches and unmanly pride
  But you unworthy the high race you boast
  Shall raise my glory when thy own is lost
  Now meet thy fate and by Sarpedon slain
  Add one more ghost to Plutos gloomy reign

  He said both javelins at an instant flew
  Both struck both wounded but Sarpedons slew
  Full in the boasters neck the weapon stood
  Transfixd his throat and drank the vital blood
  The soul disdainful seeks the caves of night
  And his seald eyes for ever lose the light

  Yet not in vain Tlepolemus was thrown
  Thy angry lance which piercing to the bone
  Sarpedons thigh had robbd the chief of breath
  But Jove was present and forbade the death
  Borne from the conflict by his Lycian throng
  The wounded hero draggd the lance along
  His friends each busied in his several part
  Through haste or danger had not drawn the dart
  The Greeks with slain Tlepolemus retired
  Whose fall Ulysses viewd with fury fired
  Doubtful if Joves great son he should pursue
  Or pour his vengeance on the Lycian crew
  But heaven and fate the first design withstand
  Nor this great death must grace Ulysses hand
  Minerva drives him on the Lycian train
  Alastor Cronius Halius strewd the plain
  Alcander Prytanis Noemon fell154
  And numbers more his sword had sent to hell
  But Hector saw and furious at the sight
  Rushd terrible amidst the ranks of fight
  With joy Sarpedon viewd the wishd relief
  And faint lamenting thus implored the chief

  O suffer not the foe to bear away
  My helpless corpse an unassisted prey
  If I unblessd must see my son no more
  My muchloved consort and my native shore
  Yet let me die in Ilions sacred wall
  Troy in whose cause I fell shall mourn my fall

  He said nor Hector to the chief replies
  But shakes his plume and fierce to combat flies
  Swift as a whirlwind drives the scattering foes
  And dyes the ground with purple as he goes

  Beneath a beech Joves consecrated shade
  His mournful friends divine Sarpedon laid
  Brave Pelagon his favourite chief was nigh
  Who wrenchd the javelin from his sinewy thigh
  The fainting soul stood ready wingd for flight
  And oer his eyeballs swam the shades of night
  But Boreas rising fresh with gentle breath
  Recalld his spirit from the gates of death

  The generous Greeks recede with tardy pace
  Though Mars and Hector thunder in their face
  None turn their backs to mean ignoble flight
  Slow they retreat and even retreating fight
  Who first who last by Mars and Hectors hand
  Stretchd in their blood lay gasping on the sand
  Tenthras the great Orestes the renownd
  For managed steeds and Trechus pressd the ground
  Next OEnomaus and OEnops offspring died
  Oresbius last fell groaning at their side
  Oresbius in his painted mitre gay
  In fat Boeotia held his wealthy sway
  Where lakes surround low Hyles watery plain
  A prince and people studious of their gain

  The carnage Juno from the skies surveyd
  And touchd with grief bespoke the blueeyed maid
  Oh sight accursed Shall faithless Troy prevail
  And shall our promise to our people fail
  How vain the word to Menelaus given
  By Joves great daughter and the queen of heaven
  Beneath his arms that Priams towers should fall
  If warring gods for ever guard the wall
  Mars red with slaughter aids our hated foes
  Haste let us arm and force with force oppose

  She spoke Minerva burns to meet the war
  And now heavens empress calls her blazing car
  At her command rush forth the steeds divine
  Rich with immortal gold their trappings shine
  Bright Hebe waits by Hebe ever young
  The whirling wheels are to the chariot hung
  On the bright axle turns the bidden wheel
  Of sounding brass the polished axle steel
  Eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame
  The circles gold of uncorrupted frame
  Such as the heavens produce and round the gold

  Braces of gold suspend the moving throne

  The bending concave formd an arch before
  Silver the beam the extended yoke was gold
  And golden reins the immortal coursers hold
  Herself impatient to the ready car
  The coursers joins and breathes revenge and war

  Pallas disrobes her radiant veil untied
  With flowers adornd with art diversified
  The laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove
  Flows on the pavement of the court of Jove
  Now heavens dread arms her mighty limbs invest
  Joves cuirass blazes on her ample breast
  Deckd in sad triumph for the mournful field
  Oer her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield
  Dire black tremendous Round the margin rolld
  A fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold
  Here all the terrors of grim War appear
  Here rages Force here tremble Flight and Fear
  Here stormd Contention and here Fury frownd
  And the dire orb portentous Gorgon crownd
  The massy golden helm she next assumes
  That dreadful nods with four oershading plumes
  So vast the broad circumference contains
  A hundred armies on a hundred plains
  The goddess thus the imperial car ascends
  Shook by her arm the mighty javelin bends
  Ponderous and huge that when her fury burns
  Proud tyrants humbles and whole hosts oerturns

  Swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly
  While the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky
  Heavens gates spontaneous open to the powers155

  Commissiond in alternate watch they stand
  The suns bright portals and the skies command
  Involve in clouds the eternal gates of day
  Or the dark barrier roll with ease away
  The sounding hinges ring on either side
  The gloomy volumes pierced with light divide
  The chariot mounts where deep in ambient skies
  Confused Olympus hundred heads arise
  Where far apart the Thunderer fills his throne
  Oer all the gods superior and alone
  There with her snowy hand the queen restrains
  The fiery steeds and thus to Jove complains

  O sire can no resentment touch thy soul
  Can Mars rebel and does no thunder roll
  What lawless rage on yon forbidden plain
  What rash destruction and what heroes slain
  Venus and Phoebus with the dreadful bow
  Smile on the slaughter and enjoy my woe
  Mad furious power whose unrelenting mind
  No god can govern and no justice bind
  Say mighty father shall we scourge this pride
  And drive from fight the impetuous homicide

  To whom assenting thus the Thunderer said
  Go and the great Minerva be thy aid
  To tame the monstergod Minerva knows
  And oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes

  He said Saturnia ardent to obey
  Lashd her white steeds along the aerial way
  Swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls
  Between the expanded earth and starry poles
  Far as a shepherd from some point on high157
  Oer the wide main extends his boundless eye
  Through such a space of air with thundering sound
  At every leap the immortal coursers bound
  Troy now they reachd and touchd those banks divine
  Where silver Simois and Scamander join
  There Juno stoppd and her fair steeds unloosed
  Of air condensed a vapour circumfused
  For these impregnate with celestial dew
  On Simois brink ambrosial herbage grew
  Thence to relieve the fainting Argive throng
  Smooth as the sailing doves they glide along

  The best and bravest of the Grecian band
  A warlike circle round Tydides stand
  Such was their look as lions bathed in blood
  Or foaming boars the terror of the wood
  Heavens empress mingles with the mortal crowd
  And shouts in Stentors sounding voice aloud
  Stentor the strong endued with brazen lungs158
  Whose throats surpassd the force of fifty tongues

  Inglorious Argives to your race a shame
  And only men in figure and in name
  Once from the walls your timorous foes engaged
  While fierce in war divine Achilles raged
  Now issuing fearless they possess the plain
  Now win the shores and scarce the seas remain

  Her speech new fury to their hearts conveyd
  While near Tydides stood the Athenian maid
  The king beside his panting steeds she found
  Oerspent with toil reposing on the ground
  To cool his glowing wound he sat apart
  The wound inflicted by the Lycian dart
  Large drops of sweat from all his limbs descend
  Beneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend
  Whose ample belt that oer his shoulder lay
  He eased and washd the clotted gore away
  The goddess leaning oer the bending yoke
  Beside his coursers thus her silence broke

  Degenerate prince and not of Tydeus kind
  Whose little body lodged a mighty mind
  Foremost he pressd in glorious toils to share
  And scarce refraind when I forbade the war
  Alone unguarded once he dared to go
  And feast incircled by the Theban foe
  There braved and vanquishd many a hardy knight
  Such nerves I gave him and such force in fight
  Thou too no less hast been my constant care
  Thy hands I armd and sent thee forth to war
  But thee or fear deters or sloth detains
  No drop of all thy father warms thy veins

  The chief thus answered mild Immortal maid
  I own thy presence and confess thy aid
  Not fear thou knowst withholds me from the plains
  Nor sloth hath seized me but thy word restrains
  From warring gods thou badst me turn my spear
  And Venus only found resistance here
  Hence goddess heedful of thy high commands
  Loth I gave way and warnd our Argive bands
  For Mars the homicide these eyes beheld
  With slaughter red and raging round the field

  Then thus MinervaBrave Tydides hear
  Not Mars himself nor aught immortal fear
  Full on the god impel thy foaming horse
  Pallas commands and Pallas lends thee force
  Rash furious blind from these to those he flies
  And every side of wavering combat tries
  Large promise makes and breaks the promise made
  Now gives the Grecians now the Trojans aid159

  She said and to the steeds approaching near
  Drew from his seat the martial charioteer
  The vigorous power the trembling car ascends
  Fierce for revenge and Diomed attends
  The groaning axle bent beneath the load
  So great a hero and so great a god
  She snatchd the reins she lashd with all her force
  And full on Mars impelled the foaming horse
  But first to hide her heavenly visage spread
  Black Orcus helmet oer her radiant head

  Just then gigantic Periphas lay slain
  The strongest warrior of the Ćtolian train
  The god who slew him leaves his prostrate prize
  Stretchd where he fell and at Tydides flies
  Now rushing fierce in equal arms appear
  The daring Greek the dreadful god of war
  Full at the chief above his coursers head
  From Marss arm the enormous weapon fled
  Pallas opposed her hand and caused to glance
  Far from the car the strong immortal lance
  Then threw the force of Tydeus warlike son
  The javelin hissd the goddess urged it on
  Where the broad cincture girt his armour round
  It pierced the god his groin received the wound
  From the rent skin the warrior tugs again
  The smoking steel Mars bellows with the pain
  Loud as the roar encountering armies yield
  When shouting millions shake the thundering field
  Both armies start and trembling gaze around
  And earth and heaven rebellow to the sound
  As vapours blown by Austers sultry breath
  Pregnant with plagues and shedding seeds of death
  Beneath the rage of burning Sirius rise
  Choke the parchd earth and blacken all the skies
  In such a cloud the god from combat driven
  High oer the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven
  Wild with his pain he sought the bright abodes
  There sullen sat beneath the sire of gods
  Showd the celestial blood and with a groan
  Thus pourd his plaints before the immortal throne

  Can Jove supine flagitious facts survey
  And brook the furies of this daring day
  For mortal men celestial powers engage
  And gods on gods exert eternal rage
  From thee O father all these ills we bear
  And thy fell daughter with the shield and spear
  Thou gavest that fury to the realms of light
  Pernicious wild regardless of the right
  All heaven beside reveres thy sovereign sway
  Thy voice we hear and thy behests obey
  Tis hers to offend and even offending share
  Thy breast thy counsels thy distinguishd care
  So boundless she and thou so partial grown
  Well may we deem the wondrous birth thy own
  Now frantic Diomed at her command
  Against the immortals lifts his raging hand
  The heavenly Venus first his fury found
  Me next encountering me he dared to wound
  Vanquishd I fled even I the god of fight
  From mortal madness scarce was saved by flight
  Else hadst thou seen me sink on yonder plain
  Heapd round and heaving under loads of slain
  Or pierced with Grecian darts for ages lie
  Condemnd to pain though fated not to die

  Him thus upbraiding with a wrathful look
  The lord of thunders viewd and stern bespoke
  To me perfidious this lamenting strain
  Of lawless force shall lawless Mars complain
  Of all the gods who tread the spangled skies
  Thou most unjust most odious in our eyes
  Inhuman discord is thy dire delight
  The waste of slaughter and the rage of fight
  No bounds no law thy fiery temper quells
  And all thy mother in thy soul rebels
  In vain our threats in vain our power we use
  She gives the example and her son pursues
  Yet long the inflicted pangs thou shall not mourn
  Sprung since thou art from Jove and heavenlyborn
  Else singed with lightning hadst thou hence been thrown
  Where chaind on burning rocks the Titans groan

  Thus he who shakes Olympus with his nod
  Then gave to Paeons care the bleeding god160
  With gentle hand the balm he pourd around
  And heald the immortal flesh and closed the wound
  As when the figs pressd juice infused in cream
  To curds coagulates the liquid stream
  Sudden the fluids fix the parts combined
  Such and so soon the ethereal texture joind
  Cleansed from the dust and gore fair Hebe dressd
  His mighty limbs in an immortal vest
  Glorious he sat in majesty restored
  Fast by the throne of heavens superior lord
  Juno and Pallas mount the blessd abodes
  Their task performd and mix among the gods

ARGUMENT

THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE

The gods having left the field the Grecians prevail Helenus the chief
augur of Troy commands Hector to return to the city in order to appoint
a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the temple of
Minerva to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight The battle
relaxing during the absence of Hector Glaucus and Diomed have an
interview between the two armies where coming to the knowledge of the
friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors they make
exchange of their arms Hector having performed the orders of Helenus
prevails upon Paris to return to the battle and taking a tender leave of
his wife Andromache hastens again to the field

The scene is first in the field of battle between the rivers Simois and
Scamander and then changes to Troy

  Now heaven forsakes the fight the immortals yield
  To human force and human skill the field
  Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes
  Now here now there the tide of combat flows
  While Troys famed streams that bound the deathful plain
  On either side run purple to the main

  Great Ajax first to conquest led the way
  Broke the thick ranks and turnd the doubtful day
  The Thracian Acamas his falchion found
  And hewd the enormous giant to the ground
  His thundering arm a deadly stroke impressd
  Where the black horsehair nodded oer his crest
  Fixd in his front the brazen weapon lies
  And seals in endless shades his swimming eyes
  Next Teuthras son distaind the sands with blood
  Axylus hospitable rich and good
  In fair Arisbes walls his native place161
  He held his seat a friend to human race
  Fast by the road his everopen door
  Obliged the wealthy and relieved the poor
  To stern Tydides now he falls a prey
  No friend to guard him in the dreadful day
  Breathless the good man fell and by his side
  His faithful servant old Calesius died

  By great Euryalus was Dresus slain
  And next he laid Opheltius on the plain
  Two twins were near bold beautiful and young
  From a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung
  Laomedons white flocks Bucolion fed
  That monarchs firstborn by a foreign bed
  In secret woods he won the naiads grace
  And two fair infants crownd his strong embrace
  Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms
  The ruthless victor strippd their shining arms

  Astyalus by Polypoetes fell
  Ulysses spear Pidytes sent to hell
  By Teucers shaft brave Aretaon bled
  And Nestors son laid stern Ablerus dead
  Great Agamemnon leader of the brave
  The mortal wound of rich Elatus gave
  Who held in Pedasus his proud abode162
  And tilld the banks where silver Satnio flowd
  Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain
  And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain

  Unblessd Adrastus next at mercy lies
  Beneath the Spartan spear a living prize
  Scared with the din and tumult of the fight
  His headlong steeds precipitate in flight
  Rushd on a tamarisks strong trunk and broke
  The shatterd chariot from the crooked yoke
  Wide oer the field resistless as the wind
  For Troy they fly and leave their lord behind
  Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel
  Atrides oer him shakes his vengeful steel
  The fallen chief in suppliant posture pressd
  The victors knees and thus his prayer addressd

  O spare my youth and for the life I owe
  Large gifts of price my father shall bestow
  When fame shall tell that not in battle slain
  Thy hollow ships his captive son detain
  Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told163
  And steel welltemperd and persuasive gold

  He said compassion touchd the heros heart
  He stood suspended with the lifted dart
  As pity pleaded for his vanquishd prize
  Stern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies
  And furious thus Oh impotent of mind164
  Shall these shall these Atrides mercy find
  Well hast thou known proud Troys perfidious land
  And well her natives merit at thy hand
  Not one of all the race nor sex nor age
  Shall save a Trojan from our boundless rage
  Ilion shall perish whole and bury all
  Her babes her infants at the breast shall fall165
  A dreadful lesson of exampled fate
  To warn the nations and to curb the great

  The monarch spoke the words with warmth addressd
  To rigid justice steeld his brothers breast
  Fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust
  The monarchs javelin stretchd him in the dust
  Then pressing with his foot his panting heart
  Forth from the slain he tuggd the reeking dart
  Old Nestor saw and roused the warriors rage
  Thus heroes thus the vigorous combat wage
  No son of Mars descend for servile gains
  To touch the booty while a foe remains
  Behold yon glittering host your future spoil
  First gain the conquest then reward the toil

  And now had Greece eternal fame acquired
  And frighted Troy within her walls retired
  Had not sage Helenus her state redressd
  Taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast
  Where Hector stood with great Ćneas joind
  The seer reveald the counsels of his mind

  Ye generous chiefs on whom the immortals lay
  The cares and glories of this doubtful day
  On whom your aids your countrys hopes depend
  Wise to consult and active to defend
  Here at our gates your brave efforts unite
  Turn back the routed and forbid the flight
  Ere yet their wives soft arms the cowards gain
  The sport and insult of the hostile train
  When your commands have heartend every band
  Ourselves here fixd will make the dangerous stand
  Pressd as we are and sore of former fight
  These straits demand our last remains of might
  Meanwhile thou Hector to the town retire
  And teach our mother what the gods require
  Direct the queen to lead the assembled train
  Of Troys chief matrons to Minervas fane166
  Unbar the sacred gates and seek the power
  With offerd vows in Ilions topmost tower
  The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold
  Most prized for art and labourd oer with gold
  Before the goddess honourd knees be spread
  And twelve young heifers to her altars led
  If so the power atoned by fervent prayer
  Our wives our infants and our city spare
  And far avert Tydides wasteful ire
  That mows whole troops and makes all Troy retire
  Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread
  Sprung though he was from more than mortal bed
  Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight
  In rage unbounded and unmatchd in might

  Hector obedient heard and with a bound
  Leapd from his trembling chariot to the ground
  Through all his host inspiring force he flies
  And bids the thunder of the battle rise
  With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow
  And turn the tide of conflict on the foe
  Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears
  All Greece recedes and midst her triumphs fears
  Some god they thought who ruled the fate of wars
  Shot down avenging from the vault of stars

  Then thus aloud Ye dauntless Dardans hear
  And you whom distant nations send to war
  Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore
  Be still yourselves and Hector asks no more
  One hour demands me in the Trojan wall
  To bid our altars flame and victims fall
  Nor shall I trust the matrons holy train
  And reverend elders seek the gods in vain

  This said with ample strides the hero passd
  The shields large orb behind his shoulder cast
  His neck oershading to his ankle hung
  And as he marchd the brazen buckler rung

  Now paused the battle godlike Hector gone167
  Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus son
  Between both armies met the chiefs from far
  Observed each other and had markd for war
  Near as they drew Tydides thus began

  What art thou boldest of the race of man
  Our eyes till now that aspect neer beheld
  Where fame is reapd amid the embattled field
  Yet far before the troops thou darst appear
  And meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear
  Unhappy they and born of luckless sires
  Who tempt our fury when Minerva fires
  But if from heaven celestial thou descend
  Know with immortals we no more contend
  Not long Lycurgus viewd the golden light
  That daring man who mixd with gods in fight
  Bacchus and Bacchus votaries he drove
  With brandishd steel from Nyssas sacred grove
  Their consecrated spears lay scatterd round
  With curling vines and twisted ivy bound
  While Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood
  And Thetis arms received the trembling god
  Nor faild the crime the immortals wrath to move
  The immortals blessd with endless ease above
  Deprived of sight by their avenging doom
  Cheerless he breathed and wanderd in the gloom
  Then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes
  A wretch accursed and hated by the gods
  I brave not heaven but if the fruits of earth
  Sustain thy life and human be thy birth
  Bold as thou art too prodigal of breath
  Approach and enter the dark gates of death

  What or from whence I am or who my sire
  Replied the chief can Tydeus son inquire
  Like leaves on trees the race of man is found
  Now green in youth now withering on the ground
  Another race the following spring supplies
  They fall successive and successive rise
  So generations in their course decay
  So flourish these when those are passd away
  But if thou still persist to search my birth
  Then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth

  A city stands on Argos utmost bound
  Argos the fair for warlike steeds renownd
  Aeolian Sisyphus with wisdom blessd
  In ancient time the happy wall possessd
  Then calld Ephyre Glaucus was his son
  Great Glaucus father of Bellerophon
  Who oer the sons of men in beauty shined
  Loved for that valour which preserves mankind
  Then mighty Praetus Argos sceptre swayd
  Whose hard commands Bellerophon obeyd
  With direful jealousy the monarch raged
  And the brave prince in numerous toils engaged
  For him Antaea burnd with lawless flame
  And strove to tempt him from the paths of fame
  In vain she tempted the relentless youth
  Endued with wisdom sacred fear and truth
  Fired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled
  And beggd revenge for her insulted bed
  Incensed he heard resolving on his fate
  But hospitable laws restraind his hate
  To Lycia the devoted youth he sent
  With tablets seald that told his dire intent168
  Now blessd by every power who guards the good
  The chief arrived at Xanthus silver flood
  There Lycias monarch paid him honours due
  Nine days he feasted and nine bulls he slew
  But when the tenth bright morning orient glowd
  The faithful youth his monarchs mandate showd
  The fatal tablets till that instant seald
  The deathful secret to the king reveald
  First dire Chimaeras conquest was enjoind
  A mingled monster of no mortal kind
  Behind a dragons fiery tail was spread
  A goats rough body bore a lions head
  Her pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire
  Her gaping throat emits infernal fire

  This pest he slaughterd for he read the skies
  And trusted heavens informing prodigies
  Then met in arms the Solymaean crew169
  Fiercest of men and those the warrior slew
  Next the bold Amazons whole force defied
  And conquerd still for heaven was on his side

  Nor ended here his toils his Lycian foes
  At his return a treacherous ambush rose
  With levelld spears along the winding shore
  There fell they breathless and returnd no more

  At length the monarch with repentant grief
  Confessd the gods and goddescended chief
  His daughter gave the stranger to detain
  With half the honours of his ample reign
  The Lycians grant a chosen space of ground
  With woods with vineyards and with harvests crownd
  There long the chief his happy lot possessd
  With two brave sons and one fair daughter blessd
  Fair een in heavenly eyes her fruitful love
  Crownd with Sarpedons birth the embrace of Jove
  But when at last distracted in his mind
  Forsook by heaven forsaking humankind
  Wide oer the Aleian field he chose to stray
  A long forlorn uncomfortable way170
  Woes heapd on woes consumed his wasted heart
  His beauteous daughter fell by Phoebes dart
  His eldest born by raging Mars was slain
  In combat on the Solymaean plain
  Hippolochus survived from him I came
  The honourd author of my birth and name
  By his decree I sought the Trojan town
  By his instructions learn to win renown
  To stand the first in worth as in command
  To add new honours to my native land
  Before my eyes my mighty sires to place
  And emulate the glories of our race

  He spoke and transport filld Tydides heart
  In earth the generous warrior fixd his dart
  Then friendly thus the Lycian prince addressd
  Welcome my brave hereditary guest
  Thus ever let us meet with kind embrace
  Nor stain the sacred friendship of our race
  Know chief our grandsires have been guests of old
  OEneus the strong Bellerophon the bold
  Our ancient seat his honourd presence graced
  Where twenty days in genial rites he passd
  The parting heroes mutual presents left
  A golden goblet was thy grandsires gift
  OEneus a belt of matchless work bestowed
  That rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glowd
  This from his pledge I learnd which safely stored
  Among my treasures still adorns my board
  For Tydeus left me young when Thebes wall
  Beheld the sons of Greece untimely fall
  Mindful of this in friendship let us join
  If heaven our steps to foreign lands incline
  My guest in Argos thou and I in Lycia thine
  Enough of Trojans to this lance shall yield
  In the full harvest of yon ample field
  Enough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore
  But thou and Diomed be foes no more
  Now change we arms and prove to either host
  We guard the friendship of the line we boast

  Thus having said the gallant chiefs alight
  Their hands they join their mutual faith they plight
  Brave Glaucus then each narrow thought resignd
  Jove warmd his bosom and enlarged his mind
  For Diomeds brass arms of mean device
  For which nine oxen paid a vulgar price
  He gave his own of gold divinely wrought171
  A hundred beeves the shining purchase bought

  Meantime the guardian of the Trojan state
  Great Hector enterd at the Scaean gate172
  Beneath the beechtrees consecrated shades
  The Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids
  Around him flockd all pressd with pious care
  For husbands brothers sons engaged in war
  He bids the train in long procession go
  And seek the gods to avert the impending woe
  And now to Priams stately courts he came
  Raisd on archd columns of stupendous frame
  Oer these a range of marble structure runs
  The rich pavilions of his fifty sons
  In fifty chambers lodged and rooms of state173
  Opposed to those where Priams daughters sate
  Twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone
  Of equal beauty and of polishd stone
  Hither great Hector passd nor passd unseen
  Of royal Hecuba his motherqueen
  With her Laodice whose beauteous face
  Surpassd the nymphs of Troys illustrious race
  Long in a strict embrace she held her son
  And pressd his hand and tender thus begun

  O Hector say what great occasion calls
  My son from fight when Greece surrounds our walls
  Comst thou to supplicate the almighty power
  With lifted hands from Ilions lofty tower
  Stay till I bring the cup with Bacchus crownd
  In Joves high name to sprinkle on the ground
  And pay due vows to all the gods around
  Then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul
  And draw new spirits from the generous bowl
  Spent as thou art with long laborious fight
  The brave defender of thy countrys right

  Far hence be Bacchus gifts the chief rejoind
  Inflaming wine pernicious to mankind
  Unnerves the limbs and dulls the noble mind
  Let chiefs abstain and spare the sacred juice
  To sprinkle to the gods its better use
  By me that holy office were profaned
  Ill fits it me with human gore distaind
  To the pure skies these horrid hands to raise
  Or offer heavens great Sire polluted praise
  You with your matrons go a spotless train
  And burn rich odours in Minervas fane
  The largest mantle your full wardrobes hold
  Most prized for art and labourd oer with gold
  Before the goddess honourd knees be spread
  And twelve young heifers to her altar led
  So may the power atoned by fervent prayer
  Our wives our infants and our city spare
  And far avert Tydides wasteful ire
  Who mows whole troops and makes all Troy retire
  Be this O mother your religious care
  I go to rouse soft Paris to the war
  If yet not lost to all the sense of shame
  The recreant warrior hear the voice of fame
  Oh would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace
  That pest of Troy that ruin of our race174
  Deep to the dark abyss might he descend
  Troy yet should flourish and my sorrows end

  This heard she gave command and summond came
  Each noble matron and illustrious dame
  The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went
  Where treasured odours breathed a costly scent
  There lay the vestures of no vulgar art
  Sidonian maids embroiderd every part
  Whom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore
  With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore
  Here as the queen revolved with careful eyes
  The various textures and the various dyes
  She chose a veil that shone superior far
  And glowd refulgent as the morning star
  Herself with this the long procession leads
  The train majestically slow proceeds
  Soon as to Ilions topmost tower they come
  And awful reach the high Palladian dome
  Antenors consort fair Theano waits
  As Pallas priestess and unbars the gates
  With hands uplifted and imploring eyes
  They fill the dome with supplicating cries
  The priestess then the shining veil displays
  Placed on Minervas knees and thus she prays

  Oh awful goddess everdreadful maid
  Troys strong defence unconquerd Pallas aid
  Break thou Tydides spear and let him fall
  Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall
  So twelve young heifers guiltless of the yoke
  Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke
  But thou atoned by penitence and prayer
  Ourselves our infants and our city spare
  So prayd the priestess in her holy fane
  So vowd the matrons but they vowd in vain

  While these appear before the power with prayers
  Hector to Paris lofty dome repairs175
  Himself the mansion raised from every part
  Assembling architects of matchless art
  Near Priams court and Hectors palace stands
  The pompous structure and the town commands
  A spear the hero bore of wondrous strength
  Of full ten cubits was the lances length
  The steely point with golden ringlets joind
  Before him brandishd at each motion shined
  Thus entering in the glittering rooms he found
  His brotherchief whose useless arms lay round
  His eyes delighting with their splendid show
  Brightening the shield and polishing the bow
  Beside him Helen with her virgins stands
  Guides their rich labours and instructs their hands

  Him thus inactive with an ardent look
  The prince beheld and highresenting spoke
  Thy hate to Troy is this the time to show
  O wretch illfated and thy countrys foe
  Paris and Greece against us both conspire
  Thy close resentment and their vengeful ire
  For thee great Ilions guardian heroes fall
  Till heaps of dead alone defend her wall
  For thee the soldier bleeds the matron mourns
  And wasteful war in all its fury burns
  Ungrateful man deserves not this thy care
  Our troops to hearten and our toils to share
  Rise or behold the conquering flames ascend
  And all the Phrygian glories at an end

  Brother tis just replied the beauteous youth
  Thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth
  Yet charge my absence less O generous chief
  On hate to Troy than conscious shame and grief
  Here hid from human eyes thy brother sate
  And mournd in secret his and Ilions fate
  Tis now enough now glory spreads her charms
  And beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms
  Conquest today my happier sword may bless
  Tis mans to fight but heavens to give success
  But while I arm contain thy ardent mind
  Or go and Paris shall not lag behind

  He said nor answerd Priams warlike son
  When Helen thus with lowly grace begun

  Oh generous brother if the guilty dame
  That caused these woes deserve a sisters name
  Would heaven ere all these dreadful deeds were done
  The day that showd me to the golden sun
  Had seen my death why did not whirlwinds bear
  The fatal infant to the fowls of air
  Why sunk I not beneath the whelming tide
  And midst the roarings of the waters died
  Heaven filld up all my ills and I accursed
  Bore all and Paris of those ills the worst
  Helen at least a braver spouse might claim
  Warmd with some virtue some regard of fame
  Now tired with toils thy fainting limbs recline
  With toils sustaind for Paris sake and mine
  The gods have linkd our miserable doom
  Our present woe and infamy to come
  Wide shall it spread and last through ages long
  Example sad and theme of future song

  The chief replied This time forbids to rest
  The Trojan bands by hostile fury pressd
  Demand their Hector and his arm require
  The combat urges and my souls on fire
  Urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls
  And timely join me ere I leave the walls
  Ere yet I mingle in the direful fray
  My wife my infant claim a moments stay
  This day perhaps the last that sees me here
  Demands a parting word a tender tear
  This day some god who hates our Trojan land
  May vanquish Hector by a Grecian hand

  He said and passd with sad presaging heart
  To seek his spouse his souls far dearer part
  At home he sought her but he sought in vain
  She with one maid of all her menial train
  Had hence retired and with her second joy
  The young Astyanax the hope of Troy
  Pensive she stood on Ilions towery height
  Beheld the war and sickend at the sight
  There her sad eyes in vain her lord explore
  Or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore

  But he who found not whom his soul desired
  Whose virtue charmd him as her beauty fired
  Stood in the gates and askd what way she bent
  Her parting step If to the fane she went
  Where late the mourning matrons made resort
  Or sought her sisters in the Trojan court
  Not to the court replied the attendant train
  Nor mixd with matrons to Minervas fane
  To Ilions steepy tower she bent her way
  To mark the fortunes of the doubtful day
  Troy fled she heard before the Grecian sword
  She heard and trembled for her absent lord
  Distracted with surprise she seemd to fly
  Fear on her cheek and sorrow m her eye
  The nurse attended with her infant boy
  The young Astyanax the hope of Troy

  Hector this heard returnd without delay
  Swift through the town he trod his former way
  Through streets of palaces and walks of state
  And met the mourner at the Scaean gate
  With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair
  His blameless wife Aetions wealthy heir
  Cilician Thebe great Aetion swayd
  And Hippoplacus wide extended shade
  The nurse stood near in whose embraces pressd
  His only hope hung smiling at her breast
  Whom each soft charm and early grace adorn
  Fair as the newborn star that gilds the morn
  To this loved infant Hector gave the name
  Scamandrius from Scamanders honourd stream
  Astyanax the Trojans calld the boy
  From his great father the defence of Troy
  Silent the warrior smiled and pleased resignd
  To tender passions all his mighty mind
  His beauteous princess cast a mournful look
  Hung on his hand and then dejected spoke
  Her bosom laboured with a boding sigh
  And the big tear stood trembling in her eye

  Too daring prince ah whither dost thou run
  Ah too forgetful of thy wife and son
  And thinkst thou not how wretched we shall be
  A widow I a helpless orphan he
  For sure such courage length of life denies
  And thou must fall thy virtues sacrifice
  Greece in her single heroes strove in vain
  Now hosts oppose thee and thou must be slain
  O grant me gods ere Hector meets his doom
  All I can ask of heaven an early tomb
  So shall my days in one sad tenor run
  And end with sorrows as they first begun
  No parent now remains my griefs to share
  No fathers aid no mothers tender care
  The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire
  Laid Thebe waste and slew my warlike sire
  His fate compassion in the victor bred
  Stern as he was he yet revered the dead
  His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil
  And laid him decent on the funeral pile
  Then raised a mountain where his bones were burnd
  The mountainnymphs the rural tomb adornd
  Joves sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow
  A barren shade and in his honour grow

  By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell
  In one sad day beheld the gates of hell
  While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed
  Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled
  My mother lived to wear the victors bands
  The queen of Hippoplacias sylvan lands
  Redeemd too late she scarce beheld again
  Her pleasing empire and her native plain
  When ah oppressd by lifeconsuming woe
  She fell a victim to Dianas bow

  Yet while my Hector still survives I see
  My father mother brethren all in thee
  Alas my parents brothers kindred all
  Once more will perish if my Hector fall
  Thy wife thy infant in thy danger share
  Oh prove a husbands and a fathers care
  That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy
  Where yon wild figtrees join the wall of Troy
  Thou from this tower defend the important post
  There Agamemnon points his dreadful host
  That pass Tydides Ajax strive to gain
  And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train
  Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given
  Or led by hopes or dictated from heaven
  Let others in the field their arms employ
  But stay my Hector here and guard his Troy

  The chief replied That post shall be my care
  Not that alone but all the works of war
  How would the sons of Troy in arms renownd
  And Troys proud dames whose garments sweep the ground
  Attaint the lustre of my former name
  Should Hector basely quit the field of fame
  My early youth was bred to martial pains
  My soul impels me to the embattled plains
  Let me be foremost to defend the throne
  And guard my fathers glories and my own

  Yet come it will the day decreed by fates
  How my heart trembles while my tongue relates
  The day when thou imperial Troy must bend
  And see thy warriors fall thy glories end
  And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind
  My mothers death the ruin of my kind
  Not Priams hoary hairs defiled with gore
  Not all my brothers gasping on the shore
  As thine Andromache Thy griefs I dread
  I see thee trembling weeping captive led
  In Argive looms our battles to design
  And woes of which so large a part was thine
  To bear the victors hard commands or bring
  The weight of waters from Hyperias spring
  There while you groan beneath the load of life
  They cry Behold the mighty Hectors wife
  Some haughty Greek who lives thy tears to see
  Imbitters all thy woes by naming me
  The thoughts of glory past and present shame
  A thousand griefs shall waken at the name
  May I lie cold before that dreadful day
  Pressd with a load of monumental clay
  Thy Hector wrapt in everlasting sleep
  Shall neither hear thee sigh nor see thee weep

  Thus having spoke the illustrious chief of Troy
  Stretchd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy
  The babe clung crying to his nurses breast
  Scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest
  With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled
  And Hector hasted to relieve his child
  The glittering terrors from his brows unbound
  And placed the beaming helmet on the ground
  Then kissd the child and lifting high in air
  Thus to the gods preferrd a fathers prayer

  O thou whose glory fills the ethereal throne
  And all ye deathless powers protect my son
  Grant him like me to purchase just renown
  To guard the Trojans to defend the crown
  Against his countrys foes the war to wage
  And rise the Hector of the future age
  So when triumphant from successful toils
  Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils
  Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim
  And say This chief transcends his fathers fame
  While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy
  His mothers conscious heart oerflows with joy

  He spoke and fondly gazing on her charms
  Restored the pleasing burden to her arms
  Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid
  Hushd to repose and with a smile surveyd
  The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear
  She mingled with a smile a tender tear
  The softend chief with kind compassion viewd
  And dried the falling drops and thus pursued

  Andromache my souls far better part
  Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart
  No hostile hand can antedate my doom
  Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb
  Fixd is the term to all the race of earth
  And such the hard condition of our birth
  No force can then resist no flight can save
  All sink alike the fearful and the brave
  No morebut hasten to thy tasks at home
  There guide the spindle and direct the loom
  Me glory summons to the martial scene
  The field of combat is the sphere for men
  Where heroes war the foremost place I claim
  The first in danger as the first in fame

  Thus having said the glorious chief resumes
  His towery helmet black with shading plumes
  His princess parts with a prophetic sigh
  Unwilling parts and oft reverts her eye
  That streamd at every look then moving slow
  Sought her own palace and indulged her woe
  There while her tears deplored the godlike man
  Through all her train the soft infection ran
  The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed
  And mourn the living Hector as the dead

  But now no longer deaf to honours call
  Forth issues Paris from the palace wall
  In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray
  Swift through the town the warrior bends his way
  The wanton courser thus with reins unbound176
  Breaks from his stall and beats the trembling ground
  Pamperd and proud he seeks the wonted tides
  And laves in height of blood his shining sides
  His head now freed he tosses to the skies
  His mane dishevelld oer his shoulders flies
  He snuffs the females in the distant plain
  And springs exulting to his fields again
  With equal triumph sprightly bold and gay
  In arms refulgent as the god of day
  The son of Priam glorying in his might
  Rushd forth with Hector to the fields of fight

  And now the warriors passing on the way
  The graceful Paris first excused his stay
  To whom the noble Hector thus replied
  O chief in blood and now in arms allied
  Thy power in war with justice none contest
  Known is thy courage and thy strength confessd
  What pity sloth should seize a soul so brave
  Or godlike Paris live a womans slave
  My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say
  And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away
  Haste then in all their glorious labours share
  For much they suffer for thy sake in war
  These ills shall cease wheneer by Joves decree
  We crown the bowl to heaven and liberty
  While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns

ARGUMENT

THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX

The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector Minerva
is under apprehensions for the Greeks Apollo seeing her descend from
Olympus joins her near the Scaean gate They agree to put off the general
engagement for that day and incite Hector to challenge the Greeks to a
single combat Nine of the princes accepting the challenge the lot is
cast and falls upon Ajax These heroes after several attacks are parted
by the night The Trojans calling a council Antenor purposes the delivery
of Helen to the Greeks to which Paris will not consent but offers to
restore them her riches Priam sends a herald to make this offer and to
demand a truce for burning the dead the last of which only is agreed to
by Agamemnon When the funerals are performed the Greeks pursuant to the
advice of Nestor erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp
flanked with towers and defended by a ditch and palisades Neptune
testifies his jealousy at this work but is pacified by a promise from
Jupiter Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens
the Trojans with thunder and other signs of his wrath

The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax the
next day the truce is agreed another is taken up in the funeral rites of
the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships So
that somewhat about three days is employed in this book The scene lies
wholly in the field

  So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state
  Then rushd impetuous through the Scaean gate
  Him Paris followd to the dire alarms
  Both breathing slaughter both resolved in arms
  As when to sailors labouring through the main
  That long have heaved the weary oar in vain
  Jove bids at length the expected gales arise
  The gales blow grateful and the vessel flies
  So welcome these to Troys desiring train
  The bands are cheerd the war awakes again

  Bold Paris first the work of death begun
  On great Menestheus Areithous son
  Sprung from the fair Philomedas embrace
  The pleasing Arne was his native place
  Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below
  Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow177
  Full on his neck from Hectors weighty hand
  And rolld with limbs relaxd along the land
  By Glaucus spear the bold Iphmous bleeds
  Fixd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds
  Headlong he tumbles his slack nerves unbound
  Drop the cold useless members on the ground

  When now Minerva saw her Argives slain
  From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain
  Fierce she descends Apollo marked her flight
  Nor shot less swift from Ilions towery height
  Radiant they met beneath the beechen shade
  When thus Apollo to the blueeyed maid

  What cause O daughter of Almighty Jove
  Thus wings thy progress from the realms above
  Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way
  To give to Greece the long divided day
  Too much has Troy already felt thy hate
  Now breathe thy rage and hush the stern debate
  This day the business of the field suspend
  War soon shall kindle and great Ilion bend
  Since vengeful goddesses confederate join
  To raze her walls though built by hands divine

  To whom the progeny of Jove replies
  I left for this the council of the skies
  But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear
  What art shall calm the furious sons of war
  To her the god Great Hectors soul incite
  To dare the boldest Greek to single fight
  Till Greece provoked from all her numbers show
  A warrior worthy to be Hectors foe

  At this agreed the heavenly powers withdrew
  Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew
  Hector inspired he sought to him addressd
  Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast
  O son of Priam let thy faithful ear
  Receive my words thy friend and brother hear
  Go forth persuasive and a while engage
  The warring nations to suspend their rage
  Then dare the boldest of the hostile train
  To mortal combat on the listed plain
  For not this day shall end thy glorious date
  The gods have spoke it and their voice is fate

  He said the warrior heard the word with joy
  Then with his spear restraind the youth of Troy
  Held by the midst athwart On either hand
  The squadrons part the expecting Trojans stand
  Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear
  They breathe and hush the tumult of the war
  The Athenian maid and glorious god of day178
  With silent joy the settling hosts survey
  In form of vultures on the beechs height
  They sit conceald and wait the future fight

  The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields
  Horrid with bristling spears and gleaming shields
  As when a general darkness veils the main
  Soft Zephyr curling the wide watry plain
  The waves scarce heave the face of ocean sleeps
  And a still horror saddens all the deeps
  Thus in thick orders settling wide around
  At length composed they sit and shade the ground
  Great Hector first amidst both armies broke
  The solemn silence and their powers bespoke

  Hear all ye Trojan all ye Grecian bands
  What my soul prompts and what some god commands
  Great Jove averse our warfare to compose
  Oerwhelms the nations with new toils and woes
  War with a fiercer tide once more returns
  Till Ilion falls or till yon navy burns
  You then O princes of the Greeks appear
  Tis Hector speaks and calls the gods to hear
  From all your troops select the boldest knight
  And him the boldest Hector dares to fight
  Here if I fall by chance of battle slain
  Be his my spoil and his these arms remain
  But let my body to my friends returnd
  By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burnd
  And if Apollo in whose aid I trust
  Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust
  If mine the glory to despoil the foe
  On Phoebus temple Ill his arms bestow
  The breathless carcase to your navy sent
  Greece on the shore shall raise a monument
  Which when some future mariner surveys
  Washd by broad Hellesponts resounding seas
  Thus shall he say A valiant Greek lies there
  By Hector slain the mighty man of war
  The stone shall tell your vanquishd heros name
  And distant ages learn the victors fame

  This fierce defiance Greece astonishd heard
  Blushd to refuse and to accept it feard
  Stern Menelaus first the silence broke
  And inly groaning thus opprobrious spoke

  Women of Greece O scandal of your race
  Whose coward souls your manly form disgrace
  How great the shame when every age shall know
  That not a Grecian met this noble foe
  Go then resolve to earth from whence ye grew
  A heartless spiritless inglorious crew
  Be what ye seem unanimated clay
  Myself will dare the danger of the day
  Tis mans bold task the generous strife to try
  But in the hands of God is victory

  These words scarce spoke with generous ardour pressd
  His manly limbs in azure arms he dressd
  That day Atrides a superior hand
  Had stretchd thee breathless on the hostile strand
  But all at once thy fury to compose
  The kings of Greece an awful band arose
  Even he their chief great Agamemnon pressd
  Thy daring hand and this advice addressd
  Whither O Menelaus wouldst thou run
  And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun
  Grieved though thou art forbear the rash design
  Great Hectors arm is mightier far than thine
  Even fierce Achilles learnd its force to fear
  And trembling met this dreadful son of war
  Sit thou secure amidst thy social band
  Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand
  The mightiest warrior of the Achaian name
  Though bold and burning with desire of fame
  Content the doubtful honour might forego
  So great the danger and so brave the foe

  He said and turnd his brothers vengeful mind
  He stoopd to reason and his rage resignd
  No longer bent to rush on certain harms
  His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms

  He from whose lips divine persuasion flows
  Grave Nestor then in graceful act arose
  Thus to the kings he spoke What grief what shame
  Attend on Greece and all the Grecian name
  How shall alas her hoary heroes mourn
  Their sons degenerate and their race a scorn
  What tears shall down thy silvery beard be rolld
  O Peleus old in arms in wisdom old
  Once with what joy the generous prince would hear
  Of every chief who fought this glorious war
  Participate their fame and pleased inquire
  Each name each action and each heros sire
  Gods should he see our warriors trembling stand
  And trembling all before one hostile hand
  How would he lift his aged arms on high
  Lament inglorious Greece and beg to die
  Oh would to all the immortal powers above
  Minerva Phoebus and almighty Jove
  Years might again roll back my youth renew
  And give this arm the spring which once it knew
  When fierce in war where Jardans waters fall
  I led my troops to Pheas trembling wall
  And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried
  Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide179
  There Ereuthalion braved us in the field
  Proud Areithous dreadful arms to wield
  Great Areithous known from shore to shore
  By the huge knotted iron mace he bore
  No lance he shook nor bent the twanging bow
  But broke with this the battle of the foe
  Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew
  Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew
  Deep in a winding way his breast assailed
  Nor aught the warriors thundering mace availd
  Supine he fell those arms which Mars before
  Had given the vanquishd now the victor bore
  But when old age had dimmd Lycurgus eyes
  To Ereuthalion he consignd the prize
  Furious with this he crushd our levelld bands
  And dared the trial of the strongest hands
  Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay
  All saw and feard his huge tempestuous sway
  Till I the youngest of the host appeard
  And youngest met whom all our army feard
  I fought the chief my arms Minerva crownd
  Prone fell the giant oer a length of ground
  What then I was O were your Nestor now
  Not Hectors self should want an equal foe
  But warriors you that youthful vigour boast
  The flower of Greece the examples of our host
  Sprung from such fathers who such numbers sway
  Can you stand trembling and desert the day

  His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame
  And nine the noblest of the Grecian name
  Upstarted fierce but far before the rest
  The king of men advanced his dauntless breast
  Then bold Tydides great in arms appeard
  And next his bulk gigantic Ajax reard
  Oileus followd Idomen was there180
  And Merion dreadful as the god of war
  With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand
  And wise Ulysses closed the daring band
  All these alike inspired with noble rage
  Demand the fight To whom the Pylian sage

  Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide
  What chief shall combat let the gods decide
  Whom heaven shall choose be his the chance to raise
  His countrys fame his own immortal praise

  The lots produced each hero signs his own
  Then in the generals helm the fates are thrown181
  The people pray with lifted eyes and hands
  And vows like these ascend from all the bands
  Grant thou Almighty in whose hand is fate
  A worthy champion for the Grecian state
  This task let Ajax or Tydides prove
  Or he the king of kings beloved by Jove
  Old Nestor shook the casque By heaven inspired
  Leapd forth the lot of every Greek desired
  This from the right to left the herald bears
  Held out in order to the Grecian peers
  Each to his rival yields the mark unknown
  Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own
  Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes
  Then casts before him and with transport cries

  Warriors I claim the lot and arm with joy
  Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy
  Now while my brightest arms my limbs invest
  To Saturns son be all your vows addressd
  But pray in secret lest the foes should hear
  And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear
  Said I in secret No your vows declare
  In such a voice as fills the earth and air
  Lives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread
  Ajax in all the toils of battle bred
  From warlike Salamis I drew my birth
  And born to combats fear no force on earth

  He said The troops with elevated eyes
  Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies
  O father of mankind superior lord
  On lofty Idas holy hill adored
  Who in the highest heaven hast fixd thy throne
  Supreme of gods unbounded and alone
  Grant thou that Telamon may bear away
  The praise and conquest of this doubtful day
  Or if illustrious Hector be thy care
  That both may claim it and that both may share

  Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on
  Sheathed in bright steel the giantwarrior shone
  He moves to combat with majestic pace
  So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace182
  When Jove to punish faithless men prepares
  And gives whole nations to the waste of wars
  Thus marchd the chief tremendous as a god
  Grimly he smiled earth trembled as he strode183
  His massy javelin quivering in his hand
  He stood the bulwark of the Grecian band
  Through every Argive heart new transport ran
  All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man
  Even Hector paused and with new doubt oppressd
  Felt his great heart suspended in his breast
  Twas vain to seek retreat and vain to fear
  Himself had challenged and the foe drew near

  Stern Telamon behind his ample shield
  As from a brazen tower oerlookd the field
  Huge was its orb with seven thick folds oercast
  Of tough bullhides of solid brass the last
  The work of Tychius who in Hyle dwelld
  And in all arts of armoury excelld
  This Ajax bore before his manly breast
  And threatening thus his adverse chief addressd

  Hector approach my arm and singly know
  What strength thou hast and what the Grecian foe
  Achilles shuns the fight yet some there are
  Not void of soul and not unskilld in war
  Let him unactive on the seabeat shore
  Indulge his wrath and aid our arms no more
  Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast
  And sends thee one a sample of her host
  Such as I am I come to prove thy might
  No morebe sudden and begin the fight

  O son of Telamon thy countrys pride
  To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied
  Me as a boy or woman wouldst thou fright
  New to the field and trembling at the fight
  Thou meetst a chief deserving of thy arms
  To combat born and bred amidst alarms
  I know to shift my ground remount the car
  Turn charge and answer every call of war
  To right to left the dexterous lance I wield
  And bear thick battle on my sounding shield
  But open be our fight and bold each blow
  I steal no conquest from a noble foe

  He said and rising high above the field
  Whirld the long lance against the sevenfold shield
  Full on the brass descending from above
  Through six bullhides the furious weapon drove
  Till in the seventh it fixd Then Ajax threw
  Through Hectors shield the forceful javelin flew
  His corslet enters and his garment rends
  And glancing downwards near his flank descends
  The wary Trojan shrinks and bending low
  Beneath his buckler disappoints the blow
  From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew
  Then close impetuous and the charge renew
  Fierce as the mountainlions bathed in blood
  Or foaming boars the terror of the wood
  At Ajax Hector his long lance extends
  The blunted point against the buckler bends
  But Ajax watchful as his foe drew near
  Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear
  It reachd his neck with matchless strength impelld
  Spouts the black gore and dims his shining shield
  Yet ceased not Hector thus but stooping down
  In his strong hand upheaved a flinty stone
  Black craggy vast to this his force he bends
  Full on the brazen boss the stone descends
  The hollow brass resounded with the shock
  Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock
  Applied each nerve and swinging round on high
  With force tempestuous let the ruin fly
  The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke
  His slackend knees received the numbing stroke
  Great Hector falls extended on the field
  His bulk supporting on the shatterd shield
  Nor wanted heavenly aid Apollos might
  Confirmd his sinews and restored to fight
  And now both heroes their broad falchions drew
  In flaming circles round their heads they flew
  But then by heralds voice the word was given
  The sacred ministers of earth and heaven
  Divine Talthybius whom the Greeks employ
  And sage Idaeus on the part of Troy
  Between the swords their peaceful sceptres reard
  And first Idaeus awful voice was heard

                HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS


  Forbear my sons your further force to prove
  Both dear to men and both beloved of Jove
  To either host your matchless worth is known
  Each sounds your praise and war is all your own
  But now the Night extends her awful shade
  The goddess parts you be the night obeyd184

  To whom great Ajax his high soul expressd
  O sage to Hector be these words addressd
  Let him who first provoked our chiefs to fight
  Let him demand the sanction of the night
  If first he askd it I content obey
  And cease the strife when Hector shows the way

  O first of Greeks his noble foe rejoind
  Whom heaven adorns superior to thy kind
  With strength of body and with worth of mind
  Now martial law commands us to forbear
  Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war
  Some future day shall lengthen out the strife
  And let the gods decide of death or life
  Since then the night extends her gloomy shade
  And heaven enjoins it be the night obeyd
  Return brave Ajax to thy Grecian friends
  And joy the nations whom thy arm defends
  As I shall glad each chief and Trojan wife
  Who wearies heaven with vows for Hectors life
  But let us on this memorable day
  Exchange some gift that Greece and Troy may say
  Not hate but glory made these chiefs contend
  And each brave foe was in his soul a friend

  With that a sword with stars of silver graced
  The baldric studded and the sheath enchased
  He gave the Greek The generous Greek bestowd
  A radiant belt that rich with purple glowd
  Then with majestic grace they quit the plain
  This seeks the Grecian that the Phrygian train

  The Trojan bands returning Hector wait
  And hail with joy the Champion of their state
  Escaped great Ajax they survey him round
  Alive unarmd and vigorous from his wound
  To Troys high gates the godlike man they bear
  Their present triumph as their late despair

  But Ajax glorying in his hardy deed
  The wellarmd Greeks to Agamemnon lead
  A steer for sacrifice the king designd
  Of full five years and of the nobler kind
  The victim falls they strip the smoking hide
  The beast they quarter and the joints divide
  Then spread the tables the repast prepare
  Each takes his seat and each receives his share
  The king himself an honorary sign
  Before great Ajax placed the mighty chine185
  When now the rage of hunger was removed
  Nestor in each persuasive art approved
  The sage whose counsels long had swayd the rest
  In words like these his prudent thought expressd

  How dear O kings this fatal day has cost
  What Greeks are perishd what a people lost
  What tides of blood have drenchd Scamanders shore
  What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more
  Then hear me chief nor let the morrows light
  Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight
  Some space at least permit the war to breathe
  While we to flames our slaughterd friends bequeath
  From the red field their scatterd bodies bear
  And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear
  So decent urns their snowy bones may keep
  And pious children oer their ashes weep
  Here where on one promiscuous pile they blazed
  High oer them all a general tomb be raised
  Next to secure our camp and naval powers
  Raise an embattled wall with lofty towers
  From space to space be ample gates around
  For passing chariots and a trench profound
  So Greece to combat shall in safety go
  Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe
  Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved
  The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved

  Meanwhile convened at Priams palacegate
  The Trojan peers in nightly council sate
  A senate void of order as of choice
  Their hearts were fearful and confused their voice
  Antenor rising thus demands their ear
  Ye Trojans Dardans and auxiliars hear
  Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires
  And I but move what every god requires
  Let Spartas treasures be this hour restored
  And Argive Helen own her ancient lord
  The ties of faith the sworn alliance broke
  Our impious battles the just gods provoke
  As this advice ye practise or reject
  So hope success or dread the dire effect

  The senior spoke and sate To whom replied
  The graceful husband of the Spartan bride
  Cold counsels Trojan may become thy years
  But sound ungrateful in a warriors ears
  Old man if void of fallacy or art
  Thy words express the purpose of thy heart
  Thou in thy time more sound advice hast given
  But wisdom has its date assignd by heaven
  Then hear me princes of the Trojan name
  Their treasures Ill restore but not the dame
  My treasures too for peace I will resign
  But be this bright possession ever mine

  Twas then the growing discord to compose
  Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose
  His godlike aspect deep attention drew
  He paused and these pacific words ensue

  Ye Trojans Dardans and auxiliar bands
  Now take refreshment as the hour demands
  Guard well the walls relieve the watch of night
  Till the new sun restores the cheerful light
  Then shall our herald to the Atrides sent
  Before their ships proclaim my sons intent
  Next let a truce be askd that Troy may burn
  Her slaughterd heroes and their bones inurn
  That done once more the fate of war be tried
  And whose the conquest mighty Jove decide

  The monarch spoke the warriors snatchd with haste
  Each at his post in arms a short repast
  Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day
  To the black ships Idaeus bent his way
  There to the sons of Mars in council found
  He raised his voice the host stood listening round

  Ye sons of Atreus and ye Greeks give ear
  The words of Troy and Troys great monarch hear
  Pleased may ye hear so heaven succeed my prayers
  What Paris author of the war declares
  The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore
  Oh had he perishd ere they touchd our shore
  He proffers injured Greece with large increase
  Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace
  But to restore the beauteous bride again
  This Greece demands and Troy requests in vain
  Next O ye chiefs we ask a truce to burn
  Our slaughterd heroes and their bones inurn
  That done once more the fate of war be tried
  And whose the conquest mighty Jove decide

  The Greeks gave ear but none the silence broke
  At length Tydides rose and rising spoke
  Oh take not friends defrauded of your fame
  Their profferd wealth nor even the Spartan dame
  Let conquest make them ours fate shakes their wall
  And Troy already totters to her fall

  The admiring chiefs and all the Grecian name
  With general shouts returnd him loud acclaim
  Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace
  Herald in him thou hearst the voice of Greece
  For what remains let funeral flames be fed
  With heroes corps I war not with the dead
  Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain
  And gratify the manes of the slain
  Be witness Jove whose thunder rolls on high
  He said and reard his sceptre to the sky

  To sacred Troy where all her princes lay
  To wait the event the herald bent his way
  He came and standing in the midst explaind
  The peace rejected but the truce obtaind
  Straight to their several cares the Trojans move
  Some search the plains some fell the sounding grove
  Nor less the Greeks descending on the shore
  Hewd the green forests and the bodies bore
  And now from forth the chambers of the main
  To shed his sacred light on earth again
  Arose the golden chariot of the day
  And tippd the mountains with a purple ray
  In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train
  Through heaps of carnage searchd the mournful plain
  Scarce could the friend his slaughterd friend explore
  With dust dishonourd and deformed with gore
  The wounds they washd their pious tears they shed
  And laid along their cars deplored the dead
  Sage Priam checkd their grief with silent haste
  The bodies decent on the piles were placed
  With melting hearts the cold remains they burnd
  And sadly slow to sacred Troy returnd
  Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed
  And decent on the pile dispose the dead
  The cold remains consume with equal care
  And slowly sadly to their fleet repair
  Now ere the morn had streakd with reddening light
  The doubtful confines of the day and night
  About the dying flames the Greeks appeard
  And round the pile a general tomb they reard
  Then to secure the camp and naval powers
  They raised embattled walls with lofty towers186
  From space to space were ample gates around
  For passing chariots and a trench profound
  Of large extent and deep in earth below
  Strong piles infixd stood adverse to the foe

  So toild the Greeks meanwhile the gods above
  In shining circle round their father Jove
  Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man
  Then he whose trident shakes the earth began

  What mortals henceforth shall our power adore
  Our fanes frequent our oracles implore
  If the proud Grecians thus successful boast
  Their rising bulwarks on the seabeat coast
  See the long walls extending to the main
  No god consulted and no victim slain
  Their fame shall fill the worlds remotest ends
  Wide as the morn her golden beam extends
  While old Laomedons divine abodes
  Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods
  Shall razed and lost in long oblivion sleep
  Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep

  The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies
  That clouds the world and blackens half the skies
  Strong god of ocean thou whose rage can make
  The solid earths eternal basis shake
  What cause of fear from mortal works could move187
  The meanest subject of our realms above
  Whereer the suns refulgent rays are cast
  Thy power is honourd and thy fame shall last
  But yon proud work no future age shall view
  No trace remain where once the glory grew
  The sappd foundations by thy force shall fall
  And whelmd beneath the waves drop the huge wall
  Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore
  The ruin vanishd and the name no more

  Thus they in heaven while oer the Grecian train
  The rolling sun descending to the main
  Beheld the finishd work Their bulls they slew
  Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew
  And now the fleet arrived from Lemnos strands
  With Bacchus blessings cheered the generous bands
  Of fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent
  A thousant measures to the royal tent
  Eunaeus whom Hypsipyle of yore
  To Jason shepherd of his people bore
  The rest they purchased at their proper cost
  And well the plenteous freight supplied the host
  Each in exchange proportiond treasures gave188
  Some brass or iron some an ox or slave
  All night they feast the Greek and Trojan powers
  Those on the fields and these within their towers
  But Jove averse the signs of wrath displayd
  And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade
  Humbled they stood pale horror seized on all
  While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall
  Each pourd to Jove before the bowl was crownd
  And large libations drenchd the thirsty ground
  Then late refreshd with sleep from toils of fight
  Enjoyd the balmy blessings of the night

ARGUMENT

THE SECOND BATTLE AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS

Jupiter assembles a council of the deities and threatens them with the
pains of Tartarus if they assist either side Minerva only obtains of him
that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels189 his balances the
fates of both and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings
Nestor alone continues in the field in great danger Diomed relieves him
whose exploits and those of Hector are excellently described Juno
endeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks but in
vain The acts of Teucer who is at length wounded by Hector and carried
off Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians but are restrained by
Iris sent from Jupiter The night puts an end to the battle Hector
continues in the field the Greeks being driven to their fortifications
before the ships and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the
camp to prevent the enemy from reembarking and escaping by flight They
kindle fires through all the fields and pass the night under arms

The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem
to the end of this book The scene here except of the celestial machines
lies in the field towards the seashore

  Aurora now fair daughter of the dawn
  Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn
  When Jove convened the senate of the skies
  Where high Olympus cloudy tops arise
  The sire of gods his awful silence broke
  The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke

  Celestial states immortal gods give ear
  Hear our decree and reverence what ye hear
  The fixd decree which not all heaven can move
  Thou fate fulfil it and ye powers approve
  What god but enters yon forbidden field
  Who yields assistance or but wills to yield
  Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven
  Gashd with dishonest wounds the scorn of heaven
  Or far oh far from steep Olympus thrown
  Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan
  With burning chains fixd to the brazen floors
  And lockd by hells inexorable doors
  As deep beneath the infernal centre hurld190
  As from that centre to the ethereal world
  Let him who tempts me dread those dire abodes
  And know the Almighty is the god of gods
  League all your forces then ye powers above
  Join all and try the omnipotence of Jove
  Let down our golden everlasting chain191
  Whose strong embrace holds heaven and earth and main
  Strive all of mortal and immortal birth
  To drag by this the Thunderer down to earth
  Ye strive in vain if I but stretch this hand
  I heave the gods the ocean and the land
  I fix the chain to great Olympus height
  And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight
  For such I reign unbounded and above
  And such are men and gods compared to Jove

  The allmighty spoke nor durst the powers reply
  A reverend horror silenced all the sky
  Trembling they stood before their sovereigns look
  At length his bestbeloved the power of wisdom spoke

  O first and greatest God by gods adored
  We own thy might our father and our lord
  But ah permit to pity human state
  If not to help at least lament their fate
  From fields forbidden we submiss refrain
  With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain
  Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move
  Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove

  The cloudcompelling god her suit approved
  And smiled superior on his best beloved
  Then calld his coursers and his chariot took
  The stedfast firmament beneath them shook
  Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot rolld
  Brass were their hoofs their curling manes of gold
  Of heavens undrossy gold the gods array
  Refulgent flashd intolerable day
  High on the throne he shines his coursers fly
  Between the extended earth and starry sky
  But when to Idas topmost height he came
  Fair nurse of fountains and of savage game
  Where oer her pointed summits proudly raised
  His fane breathed odours and his altar blazed
  There from his radiant car the sacred sire
  Of gods and men released the steeds of fire
  Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced
  High on the cloudy point his seat he placed
  Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys
  The town and tents and navigable seas

  Now had the Grecians snatchd a short repast
  And buckled on their shining arms with haste
  Troy roused as soon for on this dreadful day
  The fate of fathers wives and infants lay
  The gates unfolding pour forth all their train
  Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain
  Men steeds and chariots shake the trembling ground
  The tumult thickens and the skies resound
  And now with shouts the shocking armies closed
  To lances lances shields to shields opposed
  Host against host with shadowy legends drew
  The sounding darts in iron tempests flew
  Victors and vanquishd join promiscuous cries
  Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise
  With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed
  And slaughterd heroes swell the dreadful tide
  Long as the morning beams increasing bright
  Oer heavens clear azure spread the sacred light
  Commutual death the fate of war confounds
  Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds
  But when the sun the height of heaven ascends
  The sire of gods his golden scales suspends192
  With equal hand in these explored the fate
  Of Greece and Troy and poised the mighty weight
  Pressd with its load the Grecian balance lies
  Low sunk on earth the Trojan strikes the skies
  Then Jove from Idas top his horrors spreads
  The clouds burst dreadful oer the Grecian heads
  Thick lightnings flash the muttering thunder rolls
  Their strength he withers and unmans their souls
  Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire
  The gods in terrors and the skies on fire
  Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear
  Nor each stern Ajax thunderbolts of war
  Nor he the king of war the alarm sustaind
  Nestor alone amidst the storm remaind
  Unwilling he remaind for Paris dart
  Had pierced his courser in a mortal part
  Fixd in the forehead where the springing man
  Curld oer the brow it stung him to the brain
  Mad with his anguish he begins to rear
  Paw with his hoofs aloft and lash the air
  Scarce had his falchion cut the reins and freed
  The encumberd chariot from the dying steed
  When dreadful Hector thundering through the war
  Pourd to the tumult on his whirling car
  That day had stretchd beneath his matchless hand
  The hoary monarch of the Pylian band
  But Diomed beheld from forth the crowd
  He rushd and on Ulysses calld aloud

  Whither oh whither does Ulysses run
  Oh flight unworthy great Laertes son
  Mixd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found
  Pierced in the back a vile dishonest wound
  Oh turn and save from Hectors direful rage
  The glory of the Greeks the Pylian sage
  His fruitless words are lost unheard in air
  Ulysses seeks the ships and shelters there
  But bold Tydides to the rescue goes
  A single warrior midst a host of foes
  Before the coursers with a sudden spring
  He leapd and anxious thus bespoke the king

  Great perils father wait the unequal fight
  These younger champions will oppress thy might
  Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow
  Weak is thy servant and thy coursers slow
  Then haste ascend my seat and from the car
  Observe the steeds of Tros renownd in war
  Practised alike to turn to stop to chase
  To dare the fight or urge the rapid race
  These late obeyd Ćneas guiding rein
  Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train
  With these against yon Trojans will we go
  Nor shall great Hector want an equal foe
  Fierce as he is even he may learn to fear
  The thirsty fury of my flying spear

  Thus said the chief and Nestor skilld in war
  Approves his counsel and ascends the car
  The steeds he left their trusty servants hold
  Eurymedon and Sthenelus the bold
  The reverend charioteer directs the course
  And strains his aged arm to lash the horse
  Hector they face unknowing how to fear
  Fierce he drove on Tydides whirld his spear
  The spear with erring haste mistook its way
  But plunged in Eniopeus bosom lay
  His opening hand in death forsakes the rein
  The steeds fly back he falls and spurns the plain
  Great Hector sorrows for his servant killd
  Yet unrevenged permits to press the field
  Till to supply his place and rule the car
  Rose Archeptolemus the fierce in war
  And now had death and horror coverd all193
  Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall
  Inclosed had bled but Jove with awful sound
  Rolld the big thunder oer the vast profound
  Full in Tydides face the lightning flew
  The ground before him flamed with sulphur blue
  The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight
  And Nestors trembling hand confessd his fright
  He droppd the reins and shook with sacred dread
  Thus turning warnd the intrepid Diomed

  O chief too daring in thy friends defence
  Retire advised and urge the chariot hence
  This day averse the sovereign of the skies
  Assists great Hector and our palm denies
  Some other sun may see the happier hour
  When Greece shall conquer by his heavenly power
  Tis not in man his fixd decree to move
  The great will glory to submit to Jove

  O reverend prince Tydides thus replies
  Thy years are awful and thy words are wise
  But ah what grief should haughty Hector boast
  I fled inglorious to the guarded coast
  Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame
  Oerwhelm me earth and hide a warriors shame
  To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied194
  Gods can thy courage fear the Phrygians pride
  Hector may vaunt but who shall heed the boast
  Not those who felt thy arm the Dardan host
  Nor Troy yet bleeding in her heroes lost
  Not even a Phrygian dame who dreads the sword
  That laid in dust her loved lamented lord
  He said and hasty oer the gasping throng
  Drives the swift steeds the chariot smokes along
  The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind
  The storm of hissing javelins pours behind
  Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies
  Pleased Hector braves the warrior as he flies
  Go mighty hero graced above the rest
  In seats of council and the sumptuous feast
  Now hope no more those honours from thy train
  Go less than woman in the form of man
  To scale our walls to wrap our towers in flames
  To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames
  Thy once proud hopes presumptuous prince are fled
  This arm shall reach thy heart and stretch thee dead

  Now fears dissuade him and now hopes invite
  To stop his coursers and to stand the fight
  Thrice turnd the chief and thrice imperial Jove
  On Idas summits thunderd from above
  Great Hector heard he saw the flashing light
  The sign of conquest and thus urged the fight

  Hear every Trojan Lycian Dardan band
  All famed in war and dreadful hand to hand
  Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won
  Your great forefathers glories and your own
  Heard ye the voice of Jove Success and fame
  Await on Troy on Greece eternal shame
  In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall
  Weak bulwarks destined by this arm to fall
  High oer their slighted trench our steeds shall bound
  And pass victorious oer the levelld mound
  Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand
  Fight each with flames and toss the blazing brand
  Till their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires
  All Greece encompassd in one blaze expires

  Furious he said then bending oer the yoke
  Encouraged his proud steeds while thus he spoke

  Now Xanthus Ćthon Lampus urge the chase
  And thou Podargus prove thy generous race
  Be fleet be fearless this important day
  And all your masters wellspent care repay
  For this highfed in plenteous stalls ye stand
  Served with pure wheat and by a princess hand
  For this my spouse of great Aetions line
  So oft has steepd the strengthening grain in wine
  Now swift pursue now thunder uncontrolld
  Give me to seize rich Nestors shield of gold
  From Tydeus shoulders strip the costly load
  Vulcanian arms the labour of a god
  These if we gain then victory ye powers
  This night this glorious night the fleet is ours

  That heard deep anguish stung Saturnias soul
  She shook her throne that shook the starry pole
  And thus to Neptune Thou whose force can make
  The stedfast earth from her foundations shake
  Seest thou the Greeks by fates unjust oppressd
  Nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast
  Yet Ćgae Helice thy power obey195
  And gifts unceasing on thine altars lay
  Would all the deities of Greece combine
  In vain the gloomy Thunderer might repine
  Sole should he sit with scarce a god to friend
  And see his Trojans to the shades descend
  Such be the scene from his Idaean bower
  Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power

  Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design
  What rage what madness furious queen is thine
  I war not with the highest All above
  Submit and tremble at the hand of Jove

  Now godlike Hector to whose matchless might
  Jove gave the glory of the destined fight
  Squadrons on squadrons drives and fills the fields
  With closeranged chariots and with thickend shields
  Where the deep trench in length extended lay
  Compacted troops stand wedged in firm array
  A dreadful front they shake the brands and threat
  With longdestroying flames the hostile fleet
  The king of men by Junos self inspired
  Toild through the tents and all his army fired
  Swift as he moved he lifted in his hand
  His purple robe bright ensign of command
  High on the midmost bark the king appeard
  There from Ulysses deck his voice was heard
  To Ajax and Achilles reachd the sound
  Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound
  O Argives shame of human race he cried
  The hollow vessels to his voice replied
  Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore
  Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore
  Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes
  While the feast lasts and while the goblet flows
  But who to meet one martial man is found
  When the fight rages and the flames surround
  O mighty Jove O sire of the distressd
  Was ever king like me like me oppressd
  With power immense with justice armd in vain
  My glory ravishd and my people slain
  To thee my vows were breathed from every shore
  What altar smoked not with our victims gore
  With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame
  And askd destruction to the Trojan name
  Now gracious god far humbler our demand
  Give these at least to scape from Hectors hand
  And save the relics of the Grecian land

  Thus prayd the king and heavens great father heard
  His vows in bitterness of soul preferrd
  The wrath appeased by happy signs declares
  And gives the people to their monarchs prayers
  His eagle sacred bird of heaven he sent
  A fawn his talons trussd divine portent
  High oer the wondering hosts he soard above
  Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove
  Then let the prey before his altar fall
  The Greeks beheld and transport seized on all
  Encouraged by the sign the troops revive
  And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive
  Tydides first of all the Grecian force
  Oer the broad ditch impelld his foaming horse
  Pierced the deep ranks their strongest battle tore
  And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore
  Young Agelaus Phradmon was his sire
  With flying coursers shunnd his dreadful ire
  Struck through the back the Phrygian fell oppressd
  The dart drove on and issued at his breast
  Headlong he quits the car his arms resound
  His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground
  Forth rush a tide of Greeks the passage freed
  The Atridae first the Ajaces next succeed
  Meriones like Mars in arms renownd
  And godlike Idomen now passed the mound
  Evaemons son next issues to the foe
  And last young Teucer with his bended bow
  Secure behind the Telamonian shield
  The skilful archer wide surveyd the field
  With every shaft some hostile victim slew
  Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew
  The conscious infant so when fear alarms
  Retires for safety to the mothers arms
  Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field
  Moves as he moves and turns the shining shield
  Who first by Teucers mortal arrows bled
  Orsilochus then fell Ormenus dead
  The godlike Lycophon next pressd the plain
  With Chromius Daetor Ophelestes slain
  Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground
  The bloody pile great Melanippus crownd
  Heaps fell on heaps sad trophies of his art
  A Trojan ghost attending every dart
  Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye
  The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly
  O youth forever dear the monarch cried
  Thus always thus thy early worth be tried
  Thy brave example shall retrieve our host
  Thy countrys saviour and thy fathers boast
  Sprung from an aliens bed thy sire to grace
  The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace
  Proud of his boy he ownd the generous flame
  And the brave son repays his cares with fame
  Now hear a monarchs vow If heavens high powers
  Give me to raze Troys longdefended towers
  Whatever treasures Greece for me design
  The next rich honorary gift be thine
  Some golden tripod or distinguished car
  With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war
  Or some fair captive whom thy eyes approve
  Shall recompense the warriors toils with love

  To this the chief With praise the rest inspire
  Nor urge a soul already filld with fire
  What strength I have be now in battle tried
  Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed
  Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe
  Still aimd at Hector have I bent my bow
  Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled
  And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead
  But sure some god denies me to destroy
  This fury of the field this dog of Troy

  He said and twangd the string The weapon flies
  At Hectors breast and sings along the skies
  He missd the mark but pierced Gorgythios heart
  And drenchd in royal blood the thirsty dart
  Fair Castianira nymph of form divine
  This offspring added to king Priams line
  As fullblown poppies overcharged with rain196
  Decline the head and drooping kiss the plain
  So sinks the youth his beauteous head depressd
  Beneath his helmet drops upon his breast
  Another shaft the raging archer drew
  That other shaft with erring fury flew
  From Hector Phoebus turnd the flying wound
  Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground
  Thy breast brave Archeptolemus it tore
  And dippd its feathers in no vulgar gore
  Headlong he falls his sudden fall alarms
  The steeds that startle at his sounding arms
  Hector with grief his charioteer beheld
  All pale and breathless on the sanguine field
  Then bids Cebriones direct the rein
  Quits his bright car and issues on the plain
  Dreadful he shouts from earth a stone he took
  And rushd on Teucer with the lifted rock
  The youth already straind the forceful yew
  The shaft already to his shoulder drew
  The feather in his hand just wingd for flight
  Touchd where the neck and hollow chest unite
  There where the juncture knits the channel bone
  The furious chief discharged the craggy stone
  The bowstring burst beneath the ponderous blow
  And his numbd hand dismissd his useless bow
  He fell but Ajax his broad shield displayd
  And screend his brother with the mighty shade
  Till great Alaster and Mecistheus bore
  The batterd archer groaning to the shore

  Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire
  He armd their hands and filld their breasts with fire
  The Greeks repulsed retreat behind their wall
  Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall
  First of the foe great Hector marchd along
  With terror clothed and more than mortal strong
  As the bold hound that gives the lion chase
  With beating bosom and with eager pace
  Hangs on his haunch or fastens on his heels
  Guards as he turns and circles as he wheels
  Thus oft the Grecians turnd but still they flew
  Thus following Hector still the hindmost slew
  When flying they had passd the trench profound
  And many a chief lay gasping on the ground
  Before the ships a desperate stand they made
  And fired the troops and called the gods to aid
  Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came
  His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame
  That witherd all their host like Mars he stood
  Dire as the monster dreadful as the god
  Their strong distress the wife of Jove surveyd
  Then pensive thus to wars triumphant maid

  O daughter of that god whose arm can wield
  The avenging bolt and shake the sable shield
  Now in this moment of her last despair
  Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care
  Condemnd to suffer the full force of fate
  And drain the dregs of heavens relentless hate
  Gods shall one raging hand thus level all
  What numbers fell what numbers yet shall fall
  What power divine shall Hectors wrath assuage
  Still swells the slaughter and still grows the rage

  So spake the imperial regent of the skies
  To whom the goddess with the azure eyes

  Long since had Hector staind these fields with gore
  Stretchd by some Argive on his native shore
  But he above the sire of heaven withstands
  Mocks our attempts and slights our just demands
  The stubborn god inflexible and hard
  Forgets my service and deserved reward
  Saved I for this his favourite son distressd
  By stern Eurystheus with long labours pressd
  He beggd with tears he beggd in deep dismay
  I shot from heaven and gave his arm the day
  Oh had my wisdom known this dire event
  When to grim Plutos gloomy gates he went
  The triple dog had never felt his chain
  Nor Styx been crossd nor hell explored in vain
  Averse to me of all his heaven of gods
  At Thetis suit the partial Thunderer nods
  To grace her gloomy fierce resenting son
  My hopes are frustrate and my Greeks undone
  Some future day perhaps he may be moved
  To call his blueeyed maid his best beloved
  Haste launch thy chariot through yon ranks to ride
  Myself will arm and thunder at thy side
  Then goddess say shall Hector glory then
  That terror of the Greeks that man of men
  When Junos self and Pallas shall appear
  All dreadful in the crimson walks of war
  What mighty Trojan then on yonder shore
  Expiring pale and terrible no more
  Shall feast the fowls and glut the dogs with gore

  She ceased and Juno reind the steeds with care
  Heavens awful empress Saturns other heir
  Pallas meanwhile her various veil unbound
  With flowers adornd with art immortal crownd
  The radiant robe her sacred fingers wove
  Floats in rich waves and spreads the court of Jove
  Her fathers arms her mighty limbs invest
  His cuirass blazes on her ample breast
  The vigorous power the trembling car ascends
  Shook by her arm the massy javelin bends
  Huge ponderous strong that when her fury burns
  Proud tyrants humbles and whole hosts oerturns

  Saturnia lends the lash the coursers fly
  Smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky
  Heavens gates spontaneous open to the powers
  Heavens golden gates kept by the winged Hours
  Commissiond in alternate watch they stand
  The suns bright portals and the skies command
  Close or unfold the eternal gates of day
  Bar heaven with clouds or roll those clouds away
  The sounding hinges ring the clouds divide
  Prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide
  But Jove incensed from Idas top surveyd
  And thus enjoind the manycolourd maid

  Swift as the wind the variouscolourd maid

  To lift thy lance against the king of heaven

  O daughter of that god whose arm can wield
  The avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
  No more let beings of superior birth
  Contend with Jove for this low race of earth
  Triumphant now now miserably slain

  But Joves high counsels full effect shall find
  And ever constant ever rule mankind

  And now the Thunderer meditates his flight
  From Idas summits to the Olympian height
  Swifter than thought the wheels instinctive fly
  Flame through the vast of air and reach the sky
  Twas Neptunes charge his coursers to unbrace
  And fix the car on its immortal base
  There stood the chariot beaming forth its rays
  Till with a snowy veil he screend the blaze
  He whose allconscious eyes the world behold
  The eternal Thunderer sat enthroned in gold
  High heaven the footstool of his feet he makes
  And wide beneath him all Olympus shakes
  Trembling afar the offending powers appeard
  Confused and silent for his frown they feard
  He saw their soul and thus his word imparts
  Pallas and Juno say why heave your hearts
  Soon was your battle oer proud Troy retired
  Before your face and in your wrath expired
  But know whoeer almighty power withstand
  Unmatchd our force unconquerd is our hand
  Who shall the sovereign of the skies control
  Not all the gods that crown the starry pole
  Your hearts shall tremble if our arms we take
  And each immortal nerve with horror shake
  For thus I speak and what I speak shall stand
  What power soeer provokes our lifted hand
  On this our hill no more shall hold his place
  Cut off and exiled from the ethereal race

  Juno and Pallas grieving hear the doom
  But feast their souls on Ilions woes to come
  Though secret anger swelld Minervas breast
  The prudent goddess yet her wrath repressd
  But Juno impotent of rage replies
  What hast thou said O tyrant of the skies
  Strength and omnipotence invest thy throne
  Tis thine to punish ours to grieve alone
  For Greece we grieve abandond by her fate
  To drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate
  From fields forbidden we submiss refrain
  With arms unaiding see our Argives slain
  Yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move
  Lest all should perish in the rage of Jove

  The goddess thus and thus the god replies
  Who swells the clouds and blackens all the skies

  The morning sun awaked by loud alarms
  Shall see the almighty Thunderer in arms
  What heaps of Argives then shall load the plain
  Those radiant eyes shall view and view in vain
  Nor shall great Hector cease the rage of fight
  The navy flaming and thy Greeks in flight
  Even till the day when certain fates ordain
  That stern Achilles his Patroclus slain
  Shall rise in vengeance and lay waste the plain
  For such is fate nor canst thou turn its course
  With all thy rage with all thy rebel force
  Fly if thy wilt to earths remotest bound
  Where on her utmost verge the seas resound
  Where cursed Iapetus and Saturn dwell
  Fast by the brink within the streams of hell
  No sun eer gilds the gloomy horrors there
  No cheerful gales refresh the lazy air
  There arm once more the bold Titanian band
  And arm in vain for what I will shall stand

  Now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light
  And drew behind the cloudy veil of night
  The conquering Trojans mourn his beams decayd
  The Greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade

  The victors keep the field and Hector calls
  A martial council near the navy walls
  These to Scamanders bank apart he led
  Where thinly scatterd lay the heaps of dead
  The assembled chiefs descending on the ground
  Attend his order and their prince surround
  A massy spear he bore of mighty strength
  Of full ten cubits was the lances length
  The point was brass refulgent to behold
  Fixd to the wood with circling rings of gold
  The noble Hector on his lance reclined
  And bending forward thus reveald his mind

  Ye valiant Trojans with attention hear
  Ye Dardan bands and generous aids give ear
  This day we hoped would wrap in conquering flame
  Greece with her ships and crown our toils with fame
  But darkness now to save the cowards falls
  And guards them trembling in their wooden walls
  Obey the night and use her peaceful hours
  Our steeds to forage and refresh our powers
  Straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought
  And strengthening bread and generous wine be brought
  Wide oer the field high blazing to the sky
  Let numerous fires the absent sun supply
  The flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise
  Till the bright morn her purple beam displays
  Lest in the silence and the shades of night
  Greece on her sable ships attempt her flight
  Not unmolested let the wretches gain
  Their lofty decks or safely cleave the main
  Some hostile wound let every dart bestow
  Some lasting token of the Phrygian foe
  Wounds that long hence may ask their spouses care
  And warn their children from a Trojan war
  Now through the circuit of our Ilion wall
  Let sacred heralds sound the solemn call
  To bid the sires with hoary honours crownd
  And beardless youths our battlements surround
  Firm be the guard while distant lie our powers
  And let the matrons hang with lights the towers
  Lest under covert of the midnight shade
  The insidious foe the naked town invade
  Suffice tonight these orders to obey
  A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day
  The gods I trust shall give to Hectors hand
  From these detested foes to free the land
  Who ploughd with fates averse the watery way
  For Trojan vultures a predestined prey
  Our common safety must be now the care
  But soon as morning paints the fields of air
  Sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage
  And the fired fleet behold the battle rage
  Then then shall Hector and Tydides prove
  Whose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove
  Tomorrows light O haste the glorious morn
  Shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne
  With this keen javelin shall his breast be gored
  And prostrate heroes bleed around their lord
  Certain as this oh might my days endure
  From age inglorious and black death secure
  So might my life and glory know no bound
  Like Pallas worshippd like the sun renownd
  As the next dawn the last they shall enjoy
  Shall crush the Greeks and end the woes of Troy

  The leader spoke From all his host around
  Shouts of applause along the shores resound
  Each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied
  And fixd their headstalls to his chariotside
  Fat sheep and oxen from the town are led
  With generous wine and allsustaining bread
  Full hecatombs lay burning on the shore
  The winds to heaven the curling vapours bore
  Ungrateful offering to the immortal powers197
  Whose wrath hung heavy oer the Trojan towers
  Nor Priam nor his sons obtaind their grace
  Proud Troy they hated and her guilty race

  The troops exulting sat in order round
  And beaming fires illumined all the ground
  As when the moon refulgent lamp of night198
  Oer heavens pure azure spreads her sacred light
  When not a breath disturbs the deep serene
  And not a cloud oercasts the solemn scene
  Around her throne the vivid planets roll
  And stars unnumberd gild the glowing pole

  And tip with silver every mountains head

  And lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays

  Gleam on the walls and tremble on the spires

  And shoot a shady lustre oer the field
  Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend

  Loud neigh the coursers oer their heaps of corn
  And ardent warriors wait the rising morn

ARGUMENT

THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES

Agamemnon after the last days defeat proposes to the Greeks to quit the
siege and return to their country Diomed opposes this and Nestor
seconds him praising his wisdom and resolution He orders the guard to be
strengthened and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are to be
followed in this emergency Agamemnon pursues this advice and Nestor
further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles in order to
move him to a reconciliation Ulysses and Ajax are made choice of who are
accompanied by old Phoenix They make each of them very moving and
pressing speeches but are rejected with roughness by Achilles who
notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent The ambassadors return
unsuccessfully to the camp and the troops betake themselves to sleep

This book and the next following take up the space of one night which
is the twentyseventh from the beginning of the poem The scene lies on
the seashore the station of the Grecian ships

  Thus joyful Troy maintaind the watch of night
  While fear pale comrade of inglorious flight199
  And heavenbred horror on the Grecian part
  Sat on each face and saddend every heart
  As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth
  A double tempest of the west and north
  Swells oer the sea from Thracias frozen shore
  Heaps waves on waves and bids the Ćgean roar
  This way and that the boiling deeps are tossd
  Such various passions urged the troubled host
  Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest
  Superior sorrows swelld his royal breast
  Himself his orders to the heralds bears
  To bid to council all the Grecian peers
  But bid in whispers these surround their chief
  In solemn sadness and majestic grief
  The king amidst the mournful circle rose
  Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows
  So silent fountains from a rocks tall head
  In sable streams softtrickling waters shed
  With more than vulgar grief he stood oppressd
  Words mixd with sighs thus bursting from his breast

  Ye sons of Greece partake your leaders care
  Fellows in arms and princes of the war
  Of partial Jove too justly we complain
  And heavenly oracles believed in vain
  A safe return was promised to our toils
  With conquest honourd and enrichd with spoils
  Now shameful flight alone can save the host
  Our wealth our people and our glory lost
  So Jove decrees almighty lord of all
  Jove at whose nod whole empires rise or fall
  Who shakes the feeble props of human trust
  And towers and armies humbles to the dust
  Haste then for ever quit these fatal fields
  Haste to the joys our native country yields
  Spread all your canvas all your oars employ
  Nor hope the fall of heavendefended Troy

  He said deep silence held the Grecian band
  Silent unmovd in dire dismay they stand
  A pensive scene till Tydeus warlike son
  Rolld on the king his eyes and thus begun
  When kings advise us to renounce our fame
  First let him speak who first has sufferd shame
  If I oppose thee prince thy wrath withhold
  The laws of council bid my tongue be bold
  Thou first and thou alone in fields of fight
  Durst brand my courage and defame my might
  Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appeard
  The Greeks stood witness all our army heard
  The gods O chief from whom our honours spring
  The gods have made thee but by halves a king
  They gave thee sceptres and a wide command
  They gave dominion oer the seas and land
  The noblest power that might the world control
  They gave thee nota brave and virtuous soul
  Is this a generals voice that would suggest
  Fears like his own to every Grecian breast
  Confiding in our want of worth he stands
  And if we fly tis what our king commands
  Go thou inglorious from the embattled plain
  Ships thou hast store and nearest to the main
  A noble care the Grecians shall employ
  To combat conquer and extirpate Troy
  Here Greece shall stay or if all Greece retire
  Myself shall stay till Troy or I expire
  Myself and Sthenelus will fight for fame
  God bade us fight and twas with God we came

  He ceased the Greeks loud acclamations raise
  And voice to voice resounds Tydides praise
  Wise Nestor then his reverend figure reard
  He spoke the host in still attention heard200

  O truly great in whom the gods have joind
  Such strength of body with such force of mind
  In conduct as in courage you excel
  Still first to act what you advise so well
  These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves
  Applauding Greece with common voice approves
  Kings thou canst blame a bold but prudent youth
  And blame even kings with praise because with truth
  And yet those years that since thy birth have run
  Would hardly style thee Nestors youngest son
  Then let me add what yet remains behind
  A thought unfinishd in that generous mind
  Age bids me speak nor shall the advice I bring
  Distaste the people or offend the king

  Cursed is the man and void of law and right
  Unworthy property unworthy light
  Unfit for public rule or private care
  That wretch that monster who delights in war
  Whose lust is murder and whose horrid joy
  To tear his country and his kind destroy
  This night refresh and fortify thy train
  Between the trench and wall let guards remain
  Be that the duty of the young and bold
  But thou O king to council call the old
  Great is thy sway and weighty are thy cares
  Thy high commands must spirit all our wars
  With Thracian wines recruit thy honourd guests
  For happy counsels flow from sober feasts
  Wise weighty counsels aid a state distressd
  And such a monarch as can choose the best
  See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires
  How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires
  Who can unmoved behold the dreadful light
  What eye beholds them and can close tonight
  This dreadful interval determines all
  Tomorrow Troy must flame or Greece must fall

  Thus spoke the hoary sage the rest obey
  Swift through the gates the guards direct their way
  His son was first to pass the lofty mound
  The generous Thrasymed in arms renownd
  Next him Ascalaphus Ialmen stood
  The double offspring of the warriorgod
  Deipyrus Aphareus Merion join
  And Lycomed of Creons noble line
  Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands
  And each bold chief a hundred spears commands
  The fires they light to short repasts they fall
  Some line the trench and others man the wall

  The king of men on public counsels bent
  Convened the princes in his ample tent
  Each seized a portion of the kingly feast
  But stayd his hand when thirst and hunger ceased
  Then Nestor spoke for wisdom long approved
  And slowly rising thus the council moved

  Monarch of nations whose superior sway
  Assembled states and lords of earth obey
  The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given
  And millions own the care of thee and Heaven
  O king the counsels of my age attend
  With thee my cares begin with thee must end
  Thee prince it fits alike to speak and hear
  Pronounce with judgment with regard give ear
  To see no wholesome motion be withstood
  And ratify the best for public good
  Nor though a meaner give advice repine
  But follow it and make the wisdom thine
  Hear then a thought not now conceived in haste
  At once my present judgment and my past
  When from Pelides tent you forced the maid
  I first opposed and faithful durst dissuade
  But bold of soul when headlong fury fired
  You wronged the man by men and gods admired
  Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end
  With prayers to move him or with gifts to bend

  To whom the king With justice hast thou shown
  A princes faults and I with reason own
  That happy man whom Jove still honours most
  Is more than armies and himself a host
  Blessd in his love this wondrous hero stands
  Heaven fights his war and humbles all our bands
  Fain would my heart which errd through frantic rage
  The wrathful chief and angry gods assuage
  If gifts immense his mighty soul can bow201
  Hear all ye Greeks and witness what I vow
  Ten weighty talents of the purest gold
  And twice ten vases of refulgent mould
  Seven sacred tripods whose unsullied frame
  Yet knows no office nor has felt the flame
  Twelve steeds unmatchd in fleetness and in force
  And still victorious in the dusty course
  Rich were the man whose ample stores exceed
  The prizes purchased by their winged speed
  Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line
  Skilld in each art unmatchd in form divine
  The same I chose for more than vulgar charms
  When Lesbos sank beneath the heros arms
  All these to buy his friendship shall be paid
  And joind with these the longcontested maid
  With all her charms Briseis I resign
  And solemn swear those charms were never mine
  Untouchd she stayd uninjured she removes
  Pure from my arms and guiltless of my loves202
  These instant shall be his and if the powers
  Give to our arms proud Ilions hostile towers
  Then shall he store when Greece the spoil divides
  With gold and brass his loaded navys sides
  Besides full twenty nymphs of Trojan race
  With copious love shall crown his warm embrace
  Such as himself will choose who yield to none
  Or yield to Helens heavenly charms alone
  Yet hear me further when our wars are oer
  If safe we land on Argos fruitful shore
  There shall he live my son our honours share
  And with Orestes self divide my care
  Yet morethree daughters in my court are bred
  And each well worthy of a royal bed
  Laodice and Iphigenia fair203
  And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair
  Her let him choose whom most his eyes approve
  I ask no presents no reward for love
  Myself will give the dower so vast a store
  As never father gave a child before
  Seven ample cities shall confess his sway
  Him Enope and Pherae him obey
  Cardamyle with ample turrets crownd
  And sacred Pedasus for vines renownd
  Ćpea fair the pastures Hira yields
  And rich Antheia with her flowery fields204
  The whole extent to Pylos sandy plain
  Along the verdant margin of the main
  There heifers graze and labouring oxen toil
  Bold are the men and generous is the soil
  There shall he reign with power and justice crownd
  And rule the tributary realms around
  All this I give his vengeance to control
  And sure all this may move his mighty soul
  Pluto the grisly god who never spares
  Who feels no mercy and who hears no prayers
  Lives dark and dreadful in deep hells abodes
  And mortals hate him as the worst of gods
  Great though he be it fits him to obey
  Since more than his my years and more my sway

  To Neptune ruler of the seas profound
  Whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround
  They pour forth vows their embassy to bless
  And calm the rage of stern Ćacides
  And now arrived where on the sandy bay
  The Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay
  Amused at ease the godlike man they found
  Pleased with the solemn harps harmonious sound
  The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came
  Of polishd silver was its costly frame
  With this he soothes his angry soul and sings
  The immortal deeds of heroes and of kings
  Patroclus only of the royal train
  Placed in his tent attends the lofty strain
  Full opposite he sat and listend long
  In silence waiting till he ceased the song
  Unseen the Grecian embassy proceeds
  To his high tent the great Ulysses leads
  Achilles starting as the chiefs he spied
  Leapd from his seat and laid the harp aside
  With like surprise arose Menoetius son
  Pelides graspd their hands and thus begun

  Princes all hail whatever brought you here
  Or strong necessity or urgent fear
  Welcome though Greeks for not as foes ye came
  To me more dear than all that bear the name

  With that the chiefs beneath his roof he led
  And placed in seats with purple carpets spread
  Then thusPatroclus crown a larger bowl
  Mix purer wine and open every soul
  Of all the warriors yonder host can send
  Thy friend most honours these and these thy friend

  He said Patroclus oer the blazing fire
  Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire
  The brazen vase Automedon sustains
  Which flesh of porker sheep and goat contains
  Achilles at the genial feast presides
  The parts transfixes and with skill divides
  Meanwhile Patroclus sweats the fire to raise
  The tent is brightend with the rising blaze
  Then when the languid flames at length subside
  He strows a bed of glowing embers wide
  Above the coals the smoking fragments turns
  And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns
  With bread the glittering canisters they load
  Which round the board Menoetius son bestowd
  Himself opposed to Ulysses full in sight
  Each portion parts and orders every rite
  The first fat offering to the immortals due
  Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw
  Then each indulging in the social feast
  His thirst and hunger soberly repressd
  That done to Phoenix Ajax gave the sign
  Not unperceived Ulysses crownd with wine
  The foaming bowl and instant thus began
  His speech addressing to the godlike man

  Health to Achilles happy are thy guests
  Not those more honourd whom Atrides feasts
  Though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards
  That Agamemnons regal tent affords
  But greater cares sit heavy on our souls
  Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls
  What scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear
  The dead we mourn and for the living fear
  Greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands
  And owns no help but from thy saving hands
  Troy and her aids for ready vengeance call
  Their threatening tents already shade our wall
  Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim
  And point at every ship their vengeful flame
  For them the father of the gods declares
  Theirs are his omens and his thunder theirs
  See full of Jove avenging Hector rise
  See heaven and earth the raging chief defies
  What fury in his breast what lightning in his eyes
  He waits but for the morn to sink in flame
  The ships the Greeks and all the Grecian name
  Heavens how my countrys woes distract my mind
  Lest Fate accomplish all his rage designd
  And must we gods our heads inglorious lay
  In Trojan dust and this the fatal day
  Return Achilles oh return though late
  To save thy Greeks and stop the course of Fate
  If in that heart or grief or courage lies
  Rise to redeem ah yet to conquer rise
  The day may come when all our warriors slain
  That heart shall melt that courage rise in vain
  Regard in time O prince divinely brave
  Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave
  When Peleus in his aged arms embraced
  His parting son these accents were his last

  My child with strength with glory and success
  Thy arms may Juno and Minerva bless
  Trust that to Heaven but thou thy cares engage
  To calm thy passions and subdue thy rage
  From gentler manners let thy glory grow
  And shun contention the sure source of woe
  That young and old may in thy praise combine
  The virtues of humanity be thine
  This nowdespised advice thy father gave
  Ah check thy anger and be truly brave
  If thou wilt yield to great Atrides prayers
  Gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares
  If notbut hear me while I number oer
  The profferd presents an exhaustless store
  Ten weighty talents of the purest gold
  And twice ten vases of refulgent mould
  Seven sacred tripods whose unsullied frame
  Yet knows no office nor has felt the flame
  Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force
  And still victorious in the dusty course
  Rich were the man whose ample stores exceed
  The prizes purchased by their winged speed
  Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line
  Skilld in each art unmatchd in form divine
  The same he chose for more than vulgar charms
  When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms
  All these to buy thy friendship shall be paid
  And joind with these the longcontested maid
  With all her charms Briseis hell resign
  And solemn swear those charms were only thine
  Untouchd she stayd uninjured she removes
  Pure from his arms and guiltless of his loves
  These instant shall be thine and if the powers
  Give to our arms proud Ilions hostile towers
  Then shalt thou store when Greece the spoil divides
  With gold and brass thy loaded navys sides
  Besides full twenty nymphs of Trojan race
  With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace
  Such as thyself shall chose who yield to none
  Or yield to Helens heavenly charms alone
  Yet hear me further when our wars are oer
  If safe we land on Argos fruitful shore
  There shalt thou live his son his honour share
  And with Orestes self divide his care
  Yet morethree daughters in his court are bred
  And each well worthy of a royal bed
  Laodice and Iphigenia fair
  And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair
  Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve
  He asks no presents no reward for love
  Himself will give the dower so vast a store
  As never father gave a child before
  Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway
  The Enope and Pherae thee obey
  Cardamyle with ample turrets crownd
  And sacred Pedasus for vines renownd
  Ćpea fair the pastures Hira yields
  And rich Antheia with her flowery fields
  The whole extent to Pylos sandy plain
  Along the verdant margin of the main
  There heifers graze and labouring oxen toil
  Bold are the men and generous is the soil
  There shalt thou reign with power and justice crownd
  And rule the tributary realms around
  Such are the proffers which this day we bring
  Such the repentance of a suppliant king
  But if all this relentless thou disdain
  If honour and if interest plead in vain
  Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford
  And be amongst her guardian gods adored
  If no regard thy suffering country claim
  Hear thy own glory and the voice of fame
  For now that chief whose unresisted ire
  Made nations tremble and whole hosts retire
  Proud Hector now the unequal fight demands
  And only triumphs to deserve thy hands

  Then thus the goddessborn Ulysses hear
  A faithful speech that knows nor art nor fear
  What in my secret soul is understood
  My tongue shall utter and my deeds make good
  Let Greece then know my purpose I retain
  Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain
  Who dares think one thing and another tell
  My heart detests him as the gates of hell

  Then thus in short my fixd resolves attend
  Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend
  Long toils long perils in their cause I bore
  But now the unfruitful glories charm no more
  Fight or not fight a like reward we claim
  The wretch and hero find their prize the same
  Alike regretted in the dust he lies
  Who yields ignobly or who bravely dies
  Of all my dangers all my glorious pains
  A life of labours lo what fruit remains
  As the bold bird her helpless young attends
  From danger guards them and from want defends
  In search of prey she wings the spacious air
  And with the untasted food supplies her care
  For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved
  Her wives her infants by my labours saved
  Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood
  And sweat laborious days in dust and blood
  I sackd twelve ample cities on the main207
  And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain
  Then at Atrides haughty feet were laid
  The wealth I gathered and the spoils I made
  Your mighty monarch these in peace possessd
  Some few my soldiers had himself the rest
  Some present too to every prince was paid
  And every prince enjoys the gift he made
  I only must refund of all his train
  See what preeminence our merits gain
  My spoil alone his greedy soul delights
  My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights
  The woman let him as he may enjoy
  But whats the quarrel then of Greece to Troy
  What to these shores the assembled nations draws
  What calls for vengeance but a womans cause
  Are fair endowments and a beauteous face
  Beloved by none but those of Atreus race
  The wife whom choice and passion doth approve
  Sure every wise and worthy man will love
  Nor did my fair one less distinction claim
  Slave as she was my soul adored the dame
  Wrongd in my love all proffers I disdain
  Deceived for once I trust not kings again
  Ye have my answerwhat remains to do
  Your king Ulysses may consult with you
  What needs he the defence this arm can make
  Has he not walls no human force can shake
  Has he not fenced his guarded navy round
  With piles with ramparts and a trench profound
  And will not these the wonders he has done
  Repel the rage of Priams single son
  There was a time twas when for Greece I fought
  When Hectors prowess no such wonders wrought
  He kept the verge of Troy nor dared to wait
  Achilles fury at the Scaean gate
  He tried it once and scarce was saved by fate
  But now those ancient enmities are oer
  Tomorrow we the favouring gods implore
  Then shall you see our parting vessels crownd
  And hear with oars the Hellespont resound
  The third day hence shall Pthia greet our sails208
  If mighty Neptune send propitious gales
  Pthia to her Achilles shall restore
  The wealth he left for this detested shore
  Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass
  The ruddy gold the steel and shining brass
  My beauteous captives thither Ill convey
  And all that rests of my unravishd prey
  One only valued gift your tyrant gave
  And that resumedthe fair Lyrnessian slave
  Then tell him loud that all the Greeks may hear
  And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear
  For armd in impudence mankind he braves
  And meditates new cheats on all his slaves
  Though shameless as he is to face these eyes
  Is what he dares not if he dares he dies
  Tell him all terms all commerce I decline
  Nor share his council nor his battle join
  For once deceivd was his but twice were mine
  Nolet the stupid prince whom Jove deprives
  Of sense and justice run where frenzy drives
  His gifts are hateful kings of such a kind
  Stand but as slaves before a noble mind
  Not though he profferd all himself possessd
  And all his rapine could from others wrest
  Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown
  The manypeopled Orchomenian town209
  Not all proud Thebes unrivalld walls contain
  The worlds great empress on the Egyptian plain
  That spreads her conquests oer a thousand states
  And pours her heroes through a hundred gates
  Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars
  From each wide portal issuing to the wars210
  Though bribes were heapd on bribes in number more
  Than dust in fields or sands along the shore
  Should all these offers for my friendship call
  Tis he that offers and I scorn them all
  Atrides daughter never shall be led
  An illmatchd consort to Achilles bed
  Like golden Venus though she charmd the heart
  And vied with Pallas in the works of art
  Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace
  I hate alliance with a tyrants race
  If heaven restore me to my realms with life
  The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife
  Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine
  And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine
  Blessd in kind love my years shall glide away
  Content with just hereditary sway
  There deaf for ever to the martial strife
  Enjoy the dear prerogative of life
  Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold
  Not all Apollos Pythian treasures hold
  Or Troy once held in peace and pride of sway
  Can bribe the poor possession of a day
  Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain
  And steeds unrivalld on the dusty plain
  But from our lips the vital spirit fled
  Returns no more to wake the silent dead
  My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed
  And each alternate life or fame proposed
  Here if I stay before the Trojan town
  Short is my date but deathless my renown
  If I return I quit immortal praise
  For years on years and longextended days
  Convinced though late I find my fond mistake
  And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make
  To quit these shores their native seats enjoy
  Nor hope the fall of heavendefended Troy
  Joves arm displayd asserts her from the skies
  Her hearts are strengthend and her glories rise
  Go then to Greece report our fixd design
  Bid all your counsels all your armies join
  Let all your forces all your arts conspire
  To save the ships the troops the chiefs from fire
  One stratagem has faild and others will
  Ye find Achilles is unconquerd still
  Go thendigest my message as ye may
  But here this night let reverend Phoenix stay
  His tedious toils and hoary hairs demand
  A peaceful death in Pthias friendly land
  But whether he remain or sail with me
  His age be sacred and his will be free

  The son of Peleus ceased the chiefs around
  In silence wrapt in consternation drownd
  Attend the stern reply Then Phoenix rose
  Down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows
  And while the fate of suffering Greece he mournd
  With accent weak these tender words returnd

  Divine Achilles wilt thou then retire
  And leave our hosts in blood our fleets on fire
  If wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind
  How shall thy friend thy Phoenix stay behind
  The royal Peleus when from Pthias coast
  He sent thee early to the Achaian host
  Thy youth as then in sage debates unskilld
  And new to perils of the direful field
  He bade me teach thee all the ways of war
  To shine in councils and in camps to dare
  Never ah never let me leave thy side
  No time shall part us and no fate divide
  Not though the god that breathed my life restore
  The bloom I boasted and the port I bore
  When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames
  Delightful Greece the land of lovely dames
  My father faithless to my mothers arms
  Old as he was adored a strangers charms
  I tried what youth could do at her desire
  To win the damsel and prevent my sire
  My sire with curses loads my hated head
  And cries Ye furies barren be his bed
  Infernal Jove the vengeful fiends below
  And ruthless Proserpine confirmd his vow
  Despair and grief distract my labouring mind
  Gods what a crime my impious heart designd
  I thought but some kind god that thought suppressd
  To plunge the poniard in my fathers breast
  Then meditate my flight my friends in vain
  With prayers entreat me and with force detain
  On fat of rams black bulls and brawny swine
  They daily feast with draughts of fragrant wine
  Strong guards they placed and watchd nine nights entire
  The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire
  The tenth I forced the gates unseen of all
  And favourd by the night oerleapd the wall
  My travels thence through spacious Greece extend
  In Phthias court at last my labours end
  Your sire received me as his son caressd
  With gifts enrichd and with possessions blessd
  The strong Dolopians thenceforth ownd my reign
  And all the coast that runs along the main
  By love to thee his bounties I repaid
  And early wisdom to thy soul conveyd
  Great as thou art my lessons made thee brave
  A child I took thee but a hero gave
  Thy infant breast a like affection showd
  Still in my arms an everpleasing load
  Or at my knee by Phoenix wouldst thou stand
  No food was grateful but from Phoenix hand211
  I pass my watchings oer thy helpless years
  The tender labours the compliant cares
  The gods I thought reversed their hard decree
  And Phoenix felt a fathers joys in thee
  Thy growing virtues justified my cares
  And promised comfort to my silver hairs
  Now be thy rage thy fatal rage resignd
  A cruel heart ill suits a manly mind
  The gods the only great and only wise
  Are moved by offerings vows and sacrifice
  Offending man their high compassion wins
  And daily prayers atone for daily sins
  Prayers are Joves daughters of celestial race
  Lame are their feet and wrinkled is their face
  With humble mien and with dejected eyes
  Constant they follow where injustice flies
  Injustice swift erect and unconfined
  Sweeps the wide earth and tramples oer mankind
  While Prayers to heal her wrongs move slow behind
  Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove
  For him they mediate to the throne above
  When man rejects the humble suit they make
  The sire revenges for the daughters sake
  From Jove commissiond fierce injustice then
  Descends to punish unrelenting men
  O let not headlong passion bear the sway
  These reconciling goddesses obey
  Due honours to the seed of Jove belong
  Due honours calm the fierce and bend the strong
  Were these not paid thee by the terms we bring
  Were rage still harbourd in the haughty king
  Nor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage
  Thy friend to plead against so just a rage
  But since what honour asks the general sends
  And sends by those whom most thy heart commends
  The best and noblest of the Grecian train
  Permit not these to sue and sue in vain
  Let me my son an ancient fact unfold
  A great example drawn from times of old
  Hear what our fathers were and what their praise
  Who conquerd their revenge in former days

  Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands212
  Once fought the Ćtolian and Curetian bands
  To guard it those to conquer these advance
  And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance
  The silver Cynthia bade contention rise
  In vengeance of neglected sacrifice
  On OEneus fields she sent a monstrous boar
  That levelld harvests and whole forests tore
  This beast when many a chief his tusks had slain
  Great Meleager stretchd along the plain
  Then for his spoils a new debate arose
  The neighbour nations thence commencing foes
  Strong as they were the bold Curetes faild
  While Meleagers thundering arm prevaild
  Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast
  For rage invades the wisest and the best

  Cursed by Althaea to his wrath he yields
  And in his wifes embrace forgets the fields
  She from Marpessa sprung divinely fair
  And matchless Idas more than man in war
  The god of day adored the mothers charms
  Against the god the father bent his arms
  The afflicted pair their sorrows to proclaim
  From Cleopatra changed their daughters name
  And calld Alcyone a name to show
  The fathers grief the mourning mothers woe
  To her the chief retired from stern debate
  But found no peace from fierce Althaeas hate
  Althaeas hate the unhappy warrior drew
  Whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew
  She beat the ground and calld the powers beneath
  On her own son to wreak her brothers death
  Hell heard her curses from the realms profound
  And the red fiends that walk the nightly round
  In vain Ćtolia her deliverer waits
  War shakes her walls and thunders at her gates
  She sent ambassadors a chosen band
  Priests of the gods and elders of the land
  Besought the chief to save the sinking state
  Their prayers were urgent and their proffers great
  Full fifty acres of the richest ground
  Half pasture green and half with vineyards crownd
  His suppliant father aged OEneus came
  His sisters followd even the vengeful dame
  Althaea sues his friends before him fall
  He stands relentless and rejects them all
  Meanwhile the victors shouts ascend the skies
  The walls are scaled the rolling flames arise
  At length his wife a form divine appears
  With piercing cries and supplicating tears
  She paints the horrors of a conquerd town
  The heroes slain the palaces oerthrown
  The matrons ravishd the whole race enslaved
  The warrior heard he vanquishd and he saved
  The Ćtolians long disdaind now took their turn
  And left the chief their broken faith to mourn
  Learn hence betimes to curb pernicious ire
  Nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire
  Accept the presents draw thy conquering sword
  And be amongst our guardian gods adored

  Thus he the stern Achilles thus replied
  My second father and my reverend guide
  Thy friend believe me no such gifts demands
  And asks no honours from a mortals hands
  Jove honours me and favours my designs
  His pleasure guides me and his will confines
  And here I stay if such his high behest
  While lifes warm spirit beats within my breast
  Yet hear one word and lodge it in thy heart
  No more molest me on Atrides part
  Is it for him these tears are taught to flow
  For him these sorrows for my mortal foe
  A generous friendship no cold medium knows
  Burns with one love with one resentment glows
  One should our interests and our passions be
  My friend must hate the man that injures me
  Do this my Phoenix tis a generous part
  And share my realms my honours and my heart
  Let these return our voyage or our stay
  Rest undetermined till the dawning day

  He ceased then orderd for the sages bed
  A warmer couch with numerous carpets spread
  With that stern Ajax his long silence broke
  And thus impatient to Ulysses spoke

  Hence let us gowhy waste we time in vain
  See what effect our low submissions gain
  Liked or not liked his words we must relate
  The Greeks expect them and our heroes wait
  Proud as he is that iron heart retains
  Its stubborn purpose and his friends disdains
  Stern and unpitying if a brother bleed
  On just atonement we remit the deed
  A sire the slaughter of his son forgives
  The price of blood discharged the murderer lives
  The haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign
  And gifts can conquer every soul but thine213
  The gods that unrelenting breast have steeld
  And cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield
  One womanslave was ravishd from thy arms
  Lo seven are offerd and of equal charms
  Then hear Achilles be of better mind
  Revere thy roof and to thy guests be kind
  And know the men of all the Grecian host
  Who honour worth and prize thy valour most

  O soul of battles and thy peoples guide
  To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied
  Well hast thou spoke but at the tyrants name
  My rage rekindles and my souls on flame
  Tis just resentment and becomes the brave
  Disgraced dishonourd like the vilest slave
  Return then heroes and our answer bear
  The glorious combat is no more my care
  Not till amidst yon sinking navy slain
  The blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main
  Not till the flames by Hectors fury thrown
  Consume your vessels and approach my own
  Just there the impetuous homicide shall stand
  There cease his battle and there feel our hand

  This said each prince a double goblet crownd
  And cast a large libation on the ground
  Then to their vessels through the gloomy shades
  The chiefs return divine Ulysses leads
  Meantime Achilles slaves prepared a bed
  With fleeces carpets and soft linen spread
  There till the sacred morn restored the day
  In slumber sweet the reverend Phoenix lay
  But in his inner tent an ampler space
  Achilles slept and in his warm embrace
  Fair Diomede of the Lesbian race
  Last for Patroclus was the couch prepared
  Whose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared
  Achilles to his friend consignd her charms
  When Scyros fell before his conquering arms

  And now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent
  Passd through the hosts and reachd the royal tent
  Then rising all with goblets in their hands
  The peers and leaders of the Achaian bands
  Haild their return Atrides first begun

  Say what success divine Laertes son
  Achilles high resolves declare to all
  Returns the chief or must our navy fall

  Great king of nations Ithacus replied
  Fixd is his wrath unconquerd is his pride
  He slights thy friendship thy proposals scorns
  And thus implored with fiercer fury burns
  To save our army and our fleets to free
  Is not his care but left to Greece and thee
  Your eyes shall view when morning paints the sky
  Beneath his oars the whitening billows fly
  Us too he bids our oars and sails employ
  Nor hope the fall of heavenprotected Troy
  For Jove oershades her with his arm divine
  Inspires her war and bids her glory shine
  Such was his word what further he declared
  These sacred heralds and great Ajax heard
  But Phoenix in his tent the chief retains
  Safe to transport him to his native plains
  When morning dawns if other he decree
  His age is sacred and his choice is free

  Ulysses ceased the great Achaian host
  With sorrow seized in consternation lost
  Attend the stern reply Tydides broke
  The general silence and undaunted spoke
  Why should we gifts to proud Achilles send
  Or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend
  His countrys woes he glories to deride
  And prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride
  Be the fierce impulse of his rage obeyd
  Our battles let him or desert or aid
  Then let him arm when Jove or he think fit
  That to his madness or to Heaven commit
  What for ourselves we can is always ours
  This night let due repast refresh our powers
  For strength consists in spirits and in blood
  And those are owed to generous wine and food
  But when the rosy messenger of day
  Strikes the blue mountains with her golden ray
  Ranged at the ships let all our squadrons shine
  In flaming arms a longextended line
  In the dread front let great Atrides stand
  The first in danger as in high command

  Shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise
  Then each to Heaven the due libations pays
  Till sleep descending oer the tents bestows
  The grateful blessings of desired repose214

ARGUMENT

THE NIGHTADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES

Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army the distress of
Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner He takes no rest that
night but passes through the camp awaking the leaders and contriving
all possible methods for the public safety Menelaus Nestor Ulysses and
Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains They call a
council of war and determine to send scouts into the enemies camp to
learn their posture and discover their intentions Diomed undertakes this
hazardous enterprise and makes choice of Ulysses for his companion In
their passage they surprise Dolon whom Hector had sent on a like design
to the camp of the Grecians From him they are informed of the situation
of the Trojan and auxiliary forces and particularly of Rhesus and the
Thracians who were lately arrived They pass on with success kill Rhesus
with several of his officers and seize the famous horses of that prince
with which they return in triumph to the camp

The same night continues the scene lies in the two camps

  All night the chiefs before their vessels lay
  And lost in sleep the labours of the day
  All but the king with various thoughts oppressd215
  His countrys cares lay rolling in his breast
  As when by lightnings Joves ethereal power
  Foretels the rattling hail or weighty shower
  Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore
  Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar
  By fits one flash succeeds as one expires
  And heaven flames thick with momentary fires
  So bursting frequent from Atrides breast
  Sighs following sighs his inward fears confessd
  Now oer the fields dejected he surveys
  From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze
  Hears in the passing wind their music blow
  And marks distinct the voices of the foe
  Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast
  Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host
  He rends his hair in sacrifice to Jove
  And sues to him that ever lives above
  Inly he groans while glory and despair
  Divide his heart and wage a double war

  A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves
  To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves
  With him in wholesome counsels to debate
  What yet remains to save the afflicted state
  He rose and first he cast his mantle round
  Next on his feet the shining sandals bound
  A lions yellow spoils his back conceald
  His warlike hand a pointed javelin held
  Meanwhile his brother pressd with equal woes
  Alike denied the gifts of soft repose
  Laments for Greece that in his cause before
  So much had sufferd and must suffer more
  A leopards spotted hide his shoulders spread
  A brazen helmet glitterd on his head
  Thus with a javelin in his hand he went
  To wake Atrides in the royal tent
  Already waked Atrides he descried
  His armour buckling at his vessels side
  Joyful they met the Spartan thus begun
  Why puts my brother his bright armour on
  Sends he some spy amidst these silent hours
  To try yon camp and watch the Trojan powers
  But say what hero shall sustain that task
  Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask
  Guideless alone through nights dark shade to go
  And midst a hostile camp explore the foe

  To whom the king In such distress we stand
  No vulgar counsel our affairs demand
  Greece to preserve is now no easy part
  But asks high wisdom deep design and art
  For Jove averse our humble prayer denies
  And bows his head to Hectors sacrifice
  What eye has witnessd or what ear believed
  In one great day by one great arm achieved
  Such wondrous deeds as Hectors hand has done
  And we beheld the last revolving sun
  What honours the beloved of Jove adorn
  Sprung from no god and of no goddess born
  Yet such his acts as Greeks unborn shall tell
  And curse the battle where their fathers fell

  Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet
  There call great Ajax and the prince of Crete
  Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair
  To keep the guards on duty be his care
  For Nestors influence best that quarter guides
  Whose son with Merion oer the watch presides
  To whom the Spartan These thy orders borne
  Say shall I stay or with despatch return
  There shall thou stay the king of men replied
  Else may we miss to meet without a guide
  The paths so many and the camp so wide
  Still with your voice the slothful soldiers raise
  Urge by their fathers fame their future praise
  Forget we now our state and lofty birth
  Not titles here but works must prove our worth
  To labour is the lot of man below
  And when Jove gave us life he gave us woe

  This said each parted to his several cares
  The king to Nestors sable ship repairs
  The sage protector of the Greeks he found
  Stretchd in his bed with all his arms around
  The variouscolourd scarf the shield he rears
  The shining helmet and the pointed spears
  The dreadful weapons of the warriors rage
  That old in arms disdaind the peace of age
  Then leaning on his hand his watchful head
  The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said

  What art thou speak that on designs unknown
  While others sleep thus range the camp alone
  Seekst thou some friend or nightly sentinel
  Stand off approach not but thy purpose tell

  O son of Neleus thus the king rejoind
  Pride of the Greeks and glory of thy kind
  Lo here the wretched Agamemnon stands
  The unhappy general of the Grecian bands
  Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend
  And woes that only with his life shall end
  Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain
  And scarce my heart support its load of pain
  No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known
  Confused and sad I wander thus alone
  With fears distracted with no fixd design
  And all my peoples miseries are mine
  If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest
  Since cares like mine deprive thy soul of rest
  Impart thy counsel and assist thy friend
  Now let us jointly to the trench descend
  At every gate the fainting guard excite
  Tired with the toils of day and watch of night
  Else may the sudden foe our works invade
  So near and favourd by the gloomy shade

  To him thus Nestor Trust the powers above
  Nor think proud Hectors hopes confirmd by Jove
  How ill agree the views of vain mankind
  And the wise counsels of the eternal mind
  Audacious Hector if the gods ordain
  That great Achilles rise and rage again
  What toils attend thee and what woes remain
  Lo faithful Nestor thy command obeys
  The care is next our other chiefs to raise
  Ulysses Diomed we chiefly need
  Meges for strength Oileus famed for speed
  Some other be despatchd of nimbler feet
  To those tall ships remotest of the fleet
  Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete216
  To rouse the Spartan I myself decree
  Dear as he is to us and dear to thee
  Yet must I tax his sloth that claims no share
  With his great brother in his martial care
  Him it behoved to every chief to sue
  Preventing every part performd by you
  For strong necessity our toils demands
  Claims all our hearts and urges all our hands

  To whom the king With reverence we allow
  Thy just rebukes yet learn to spare them now
  My generous brother is of gentle kind
  He seems remiss but bears a valiant mind
  Through too much deference to our sovereign sway
  Content to follow when we lead the way
  But now our ills industrious to prevent
  Long ere the rest he rose and sought my tent
  The chiefs you named already at his call
  Prepare to meet us near the navywall
  Assembling there between the trench and gates
  Near the nightguards our chosen council waits

  Then none said Nestor shall his rule withstand
  For great examples justify command
  With that the venerable warrior rose
  The shining greaves his manly legs enclose
  His purple mantle golden buckles joind
  Warm with the softest wool and doubly lined
  Then rushing from his tent he snatchd in haste
  His steely lance that lightend as he passd
  The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd
  Stoppd at Ulysses tent and calld aloud
  Ulysses sudden as the voice was sent
  Awakes starts up and issues from his tent
  What new distress what sudden cause of fright
  Thus leads you wandering in the silent night
  O prudent chief the Pylian sage replied
  Wise as thou art be now thy wisdom tried
  Whatever means of safety can be sought
  Whatever counsels can inspire our thought
  Whatever methods or to fly or fight
  All all depend on this important night
  He heard returnd and took his painted shield
  Then joind the chiefs and followd through the field
  Without his tent bold Diomed they found
  All sheathed in arms his brave companions round
  Each sunk in sleep extended on the field
  His head reclining on his bossy shield
  A wood of spears stood by that fixd upright
  Shot from their flashing points a quivering light
  A bulls black hide composed the heros bed
  A splendid carpet rolld beneath his head
  Then with his foot old Nestor gently shakes
  The slumbering chief and in these words awakes

  Rise son of Tydeus to the brave and strong
  Rest seems inglorious and the night too long
  But sleepst thou now when from yon hill the foe
  Hangs oer the fleet and shades our walls below

  At this soft slumber from his eyelids fled
  The warrior saw the hoary chief and said
  Wondrous old man whose soul no respite knows
  Though years and honours bid thee seek repose
  Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake
  Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake
  My friend he answered generous is thy care
  These toils my subjects and my sons might bear
  Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire
  To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire
  But now the last despair surrounds our host
  No hour must pass no moment must be lost
  Each single Greek in this conclusive strife
  Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life
  Yet if my years thy kind regard engage
  Employ thy youth as I employ my age
  Succeed to these my cares and rouse the rest
  He serves me most who serves his country best

  This said the hero oer his shoulders flung
  A lions spoils that to his ankles hung
  Then seized his ponderous lance and strode along
  Meges the bold with Ajax famed for speed
  The warrior roused and to the entrenchments lead

  And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard
  A wakeful squadron each in arms prepared
  The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep
  And couching close repel invading sleep
  So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain
  With toil protected from the prowling train
  When the gaunt lioness with hunger bold
  Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold
  Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear
  Loud and more loud the clamours strike their ear
  Of hounds and men they start they gaze around
  Watch every side and turn to every sound
  Thus watchd the Grecians cautious of surprise
  Each voice each motion drew their ears and eyes
  Each step of passing feet increased the affright
  And hostile Troy was ever full in sight
  Nestor with joy the wakeful band surveyd
  And thus accosted through the gloomy shade
  Tis well my sons your nightly cares employ
  Else must our host become the scorn of Troy
  Watch thus and Greece shall live The hero said
  Then oer the trench the following chieftains led
  His son and godlike Merion marchd behind
  For these the princes to their council joind
  The trenches passd the assembled kings around
  In silent state the consistory crownd
  A place there was yet undefiled with gore
  The spot where Hector stoppd his rage before
  When night descending from his vengeful hand
  Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band
  The plain beside with mangled corps was spread
  And all his progress markd by heaps of dead
  There sat the mournful kings when Neleus son
  The council opening in these words begun

  Is there said he a chief so greatly brave
  His life to hazard and his country save
  Lives there a man who singly dares to go
  To yonder camp or seize some straggling foe
  Or favourd by the night approach so near
  Their speech their counsels and designs to hear
  If to besiege our navies they prepare
  Or Troy once more must be the seat of war
  This could he learn and to our peers recite
  And pass unharmd the dangers of the night
  What fame were his through all succeeding days
  While Phoebus shines or men have tongues to praise
  What gifts his grateful country would bestow
  What must not Greece to her deliverer owe
  A sable ewe each leader should provide
  With each a sable lambkin by her side
  At every rite his share should be increased
  And his the foremost honours of the feast

  Fear held them mute alone untaught to fear
  Tydides spokeThe man you seek is here
  Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way
  Some god within commands and I obey
  But let some other chosen warrior join
  To raise my hopes and second my design
  By mutual confidence and mutual aid
  Great deeds are done and great discoveries made
  The wise new prudence from the wise acquire
  And one brave hero fans anothers fire

  Contending leaders at the word arose
  Each generous breast with emulation glows
  So brave a task each Ajax strove to share
  Bold Merion strove and Nestors valiant heir
  The Spartan wishd the second place to gain
  And great Ulysses wishd nor wishd in vain
  Then thus the king of men the contest ends
  Thou first of warriors and thou best of friends
  Undaunted Diomed what chief to join
  In this great enterprise is only thine
  Just be thy choice without affection made
  To birth or office no respect be paid
  Let worth determine here The monarch spake
  And inly trembled for his brothers sake

  Then thus the godlike Diomed rejoind
  My choice declares the impulse of my mind
  How can I doubt while great Ulysses stands
  To lend his counsels and assist our hands
  A chief whose safety is Minervas care
  So famed so dreadful in the works of war
  Blessd in his conduct I no aid require
  Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire

  It fits thee not before these chiefs of fame
  Replied the sage to praise me or to blame
  Praise from a friend or censure from a foe
  Are lost on hearers that our merits know
  But let us hasteNight rolls the hours away
  The reddening orient shows the coming day
  The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains
  And of nights empire but a third remains

  Thus having spoke with generous ardour pressd
  In arms terrific their huge limbs they dressd
  A twoedged falchion Thrasymed the brave
  And ample buckler to Tydides gave
  Then in a leathern helm he cased his head
  Short of its crest and with no plume oerspread
  Such as by youths unused to arms are worn
  No spoils enrich it and no studs adorn
  Next him Ulysses took a shining sword
  A bow and quiver with bright arrows stored
  A wellproved casque with leather braces bound
  Thy gift Meriones his temples crownd
  Soft wool within without in order spread217
  A boars white teeth grinnd horrid oer his head
  This from Amyntor rich Ormenus son
  Autolycus by fraudful rapine won
  And gave Amphidamas from him the prize
  Molus received the pledge of social ties
  The helmet next by Merion was possessd
  And now Ulysses thoughtful temples pressd
  Thus sheathed in arms the council they forsake
  And dark through paths oblique their progress take
  Just then in sign she favourd their intent
  A longwingd heron great Minerva sent
  This though surrounding shades obscured their view
  By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew
  As from the right she soard Ulysses prayd
  Haild the glad omen and addressd the maid

  O daughter of that god whose arm can wield
  The avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
  O thou for ever present in my way
  Who all my motions all my toils survey
  Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade
  Safe by thy succour to our ships conveyd
  And let some deed this signal night adorn
  To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn

  Then godlike Diomed preferrd his prayer
  Daughter of Jove unconquerd Pallas hear
  Great queen of arms whose favour Tydeus won
  As thou defendst the sire defend the son
  When on Ćsopus banks the banded powers
  Of Greece he left and sought the Theban towers
  Peace was his charge received with peaceful show
  He went a legate but returnd a foe
  Then helpd by thee and coverd by thy shield
  He fought with numbers and made numbers yield
  So now be present O celestial maid
  So still continue to the race thine aid
  A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke
  Untamed unconscious of the galling yoke
  With ample forehead and with spreading horns
  Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns
  The heroes prayd and Pallas from the skies
  Accords their vow succeeds their enterprise
  Now like two lions panting for the prey
  With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way
  Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain
  Through dust through blood oer arms and hills of slain

  Nor less bold Hector and the sons of Troy
  On high designs the wakeful hours employ
  The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed
  Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed

  What glorious man for high attempts prepared
  Dares greatly venture for a rich reward
  Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make
  What watch they keep and what resolves they take
  If now subdued they meditate their flight
  And spent with toil neglect the watch of night
  His be the chariot that shall please him most
  Of all the plunder of the vanquishd host
  His the fair steeds that all the rest excel
  And his the glory to have served so well

  A youth there was among the tribes of Troy
  Dolon his name Eumedes only boy
  Five girls beside the reverend herald told
  Rich was the son in brass and rich in gold
  Not blessd by nature with the charms of face
  But swift of foot and matchless in the race
  Hector he said my courage bids me meet
  This high achievement and explore the fleet
  But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies
  And swear to grant me the demanded prize
  The immortal coursers and the glittering car
  That bear Pelides through the ranks of war
  Encouraged thus no idle scout I go
  Fulfil thy wish their whole intention know
  Even to the royal tent pursue my way
  And all their counsels all their aims betray

  The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high
  Attesting thus the monarch of the sky
  Be witness thou immortal lord of all
  Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall
  By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne
  And him alone the immortal steeds adorn

  Thus Hector swore the gods were calld in vain
  But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain
  Across his back the bended bow he flung
  A wolfs grey hide around his shoulders hung
  A ferrets downy fur his helmet lined
  And in his hand a pointed javelin shined
  Then never to return he sought the shore
  And trod the path his feet must tread no more
  Scarce had he passd the steeds and Trojan throng
  Still bending forward as he coursed along
  When on the hollow way the approaching tread
  Ulysses markd and thus to Diomed

  O friend I hear some step of hostile feet
  Moving this way or hastening to the fleet
  Some spy perhaps to lurk beside the main
  Or nightly pillager that strips the slain
  Yet let him pass and win a little space
  Then rush behind him and prevent his pace
  But if too swift of foot he flies before
  Confine his course along the fleet and shore
  Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ
  And intercept his hoped return to Troy

  With that they steppd aside and stoopd their head
  As Dolon passd behind a heap of dead
  Along the path the spy unwary flew
  Soft at just distance both the chiefs pursue
  So distant they and such the space between
  As when two teams of mules divide the green
  To whom the hind like shares of land allows
  When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs
  Now Dolon listening heard them as they passd
  Hector he thought had sent and checkd his haste
  Till scarce at distance of a javelins throw
  No voice succeeding he perceived the foe
  As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind
  Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind
  Now lost now seen they intercept his way
  And from the herd still turn the flying prey
  So fast and with such fears the Trojan flew
  So close so constant the bold Greeks pursue
  Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls
  And mingles with the guards that watch the walls
  When brave Tydides stoppd a genrous thought
  Inspired by Pallas in his bosom wrought
  Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance
  And snatch the glory from his lifted lance
  Then thus aloud Whoeer thou art remain
  This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain
  He said and high in air the weapon cast
  Which wilful errd and oer his shoulder passd
  Then fixd in earth Against the trembling wood
  The wretch stood proppd and quiverd as he stood
  A sudden palsy seized his turning head
  His loose teeth chatterd and his colour fled
  The panting warriors seize him as he stands
  And with unmanly tears his life demands

  O spare my youth and for the breath I owe
  Large gifts of price my father shall bestow
  Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told
  And steel welltemperd and refulgent gold

  To whom Ulysses made this wise reply
  Whoeer thou art be bold nor fear to die
  What moves thee say when sleep has closed the sight
  To roam the silent fields in dead of night
  Camst thou the secrets of our camp to find
  By Hector prompted or thy daring mind
  Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led
  Through heaps of carnage to despoil the dead

  Then thus pale Dolon with a fearful look
  Still as he spoke his limbs with horror shook
  Hither I came by Hectors words deceived
  Much did he promise rashly I believed
  No less a bribe than great Achilles car
  And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war
  Urged me unwilling this attempt to make
  To learn what counsels what resolves you take
  If now subdued you fix your hopes on flight
  And tired with toils neglect the watch of night

  Bold was thy aim and glorious was the prize
  Ulysses with a scornful smile replies
  Far other rulers those proud steeds demand
  And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand
  Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame
  Achilles sprung from an immortal dame
  But say be faithful and the truth recite
  Where lies encampd the Trojan chief tonight
  Where stand his coursers in what quarter sleep
  Their other princes tell what watch they keep
  Say since this conquest what their counsels are
  Or here to combat from their city far
  Or back to Ilions walls transfer the war

  Ulysses thus and thus Eumedes son
  What Dolon knows his faithful tongue shall own
  Hector the peers assembling in his tent
  A council holds at Ilus monument
  No certain guards the nightly watch partake
  Whereer yon fires ascend the Trojans wake
  Anxious for Troy the guard the natives keep
  Safe in their cares the auxiliar forces sleep
  Whose wives and infants from the danger far
  Discharge their souls of half the fears of war

  Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train
  Inquired the chief or scattered oer the plain
  To whom the spy Their powers they thus dispose
  The Paeons dreadful with their bended bows
  The Carians Caucons the Pelasgian host
  And Leleges encamp along the coast
  Not distant far lie higher on the land
  The Lycian Mysian and Maeonian band
  And Phrygias horse by Thymbras ancient wall
  The Thracians utmost and apart from all
  These Troy but lately to her succour won
  Led on by Rhesus great Eioneus son
  I saw his coursers in proud triumph go
  Swift as the wind and white as wintersnow
  Rich silver plates his shining car infold
  His solid arms refulgent flame with gold
  No mortal shoulders suit the glorious load
  Celestial panoply to grace a god
  Let me unhappy to your fleet be borne
  Or leave me here a captives fate to mourn
  In cruel chains till your return reveal
  The truth or falsehood of the news I tell

  To this Tydides with a gloomy frown
  Think not to live though all the truth be shown
  Shall we dismiss thee in some future strife
  To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life
  Or that again our camps thou mayst explore
  Noonce a traitor thou betrayst no more

  Sternly he spoke and as the wretch prepared
  With humble blandishment to stroke his beard
  Like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew
  Divides the neck and cuts the nerves in two
  One instant snatchd his trembling soul to hell
  The head yet speaking mutterd as it fell
  The furry helmet from his brow they tear
  The wolfs grey hide the unbended bow and spear
  These great Ulysses lifting to the skies
  To favouring Pallas dedicates the prize

  Great queen of arms receive this hostile spoil
  And let the Thracian steeds reward our toil
  Thee first of all the heavenly host we praise
  O speed our labours and direct our ways
  This said the spoils with dropping gore defaced
  High on a spreading tamarisk he placed
  Then heapd with reeds and gathered boughs the plain
  To guide their footsteps to the place again

  Through the still night they cross the devious fields
  Slippery with blood oer arms and heaps of shields
  Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay
  And eased in sleep the labours of the day
  Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band
  The horses yoked beside each warrior stand
  Their arms in order on the ground reclined
  Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined
  Amidst lay Rhesus stretchd in sleep profound
  And the white steeds behind his chariot bound
  The welcome sight Ulysses first descries
  And points to Diomed the tempting prize
  The man the coursers and the car behold
  Described by Dolon with the arms of gold
  Now brave Tydides now thy courage try
  Approach the chariot and the steeds untie
  Or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds
  Urge thou the slaughter while I seize the steeds

  Pallas this said her heros bosom warms
  Breathed in his heart and strung his nervous arms
  Whereer he passd a purple stream pursued
  His thirsty falchion fat with hostile blood
  Bathed all his footsteps dyed the fields with gore
  And a low groan remurmurd through the shore
  So the grim lion from his nightly den
  Oerleaps the fences and invades the pen
  On sheep or goats resistless in his way
  He falls and foaming rends the guardless prey
  Nor stoppd the fury of his vengeful hand
  Till twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band
  Ulysses following as his partner slew
  Back by the foot each slaughterd warrior drew
  The milkwhite coursers studious to convey
  Safe to the ships he wisely cleared the way
  Lest the fierce steeds not yet to battles bred
  Should start and tremble at the heaps of dead
  Now twelve despatchd the monarch last they found
  Tydides falchion fixd him to the ground
  Just then a deathful dream Minerva sent
  A warlike form appeard before his tent
  Whose visionary steel his bosom tore
  So dreamd the monarch and awaked no more218

  Ulysses now the snowy steeds detains
  And leads them fastend by the silver reins
  These with his bow unbent he lashd along
  The scourge forgot on Rhesus chariot hung
  Then gave his friend the signal to retire
  But him new dangers new achievements fire
  Doubtful he stood or with his reeking blade
  To send more heroes to the infernal shade
  Drag off the car where Rhesus armour lay
  Or heave with manly force and lift away
  While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands
  Pallas appears and thus her chief commands

  Enough my son from further slaughter cease
  Regard thy safety and depart in peace
  Haste to the ships the gotten spoils enjoy
  Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy

  The voice divine confessd the martial maid
  In haste he mounted and her word obeyd
  The coursers fly before Ulysses bow
  Swift as the wind and white as wintersnow

  Not unobserved they passd the god of light
  Had watchd his Troy and markd Minervas flight
  Saw Tydeus son with heavenly succour blessd
  And vengeful anger filld his sacred breast
  Swift to the Trojan camp descends the power
  And wakes Hippocoon in the morninghour
  On Rhesus side accustomd to attend
  A faithful kinsman and instructive friend
  He rose and saw the field deformd with blood
  An empty space where late the coursers stood
  The yetwarm Thracians panting on the coast
  For each he wept but for his Rhesus most
  Now while on Rhesus name he calls in vain
  The gathering tumult spreads oer all the plain
  On heaps the Trojans rush with wild affright
  And wondering view the slaughters of the night

  Meanwhile the chiefs arriving at the shade
  Where late the spoils of Hectors spy were laid
  Ulysses stoppd to him Tydides bore
  The trophy dropping yet with Dolons gore
  Then mounts again again their nimbler feet
  The coursers ply and thunder towards the fleet

 Illustration DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS

         DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS


  Old Nestor first perceived the approaching sound
  Bespeaking thus the Grecian peers around
  Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear
  Thickening this way and gathering on my ear
  Perhaps some horses of the Trojan breed
  So may ye gods my pious hopes succeed
  The great Tydides and Ulysses bear
  Returnd triumphant with this prize of war
  Yet much I fear ah may that fear be vain
  The chiefs outnumberd by the Trojan train
  Perhaps even now pursued they seek the shore
  Or oh perhaps those heroes are no more

  Scarce had he spoke when lo the chiefs appear
  And spring to earth the Greeks dismiss their fear
  With words of friendship and extended hands
  They greet the kings and Nestor first demands

  Say thou whose praises all our host proclaim
  Thou living glory of the Grecian name
  Say whence these coursers by what chance bestowd
  The spoil of foes or present of a god
  Not those fair steeds so radiant and so gay
  That draw the burning chariot of the day
  Old as I am to age I scorn to yield
  And daily mingle in the martial field
  But sure till now no coursers struck my sight
  Like these conspicuous through the ranks of fight
  Some god I deem conferred the glorious prize
  Blessd as ye are and favourites of the skies
  The care of him who bids the thunder roar
  And her whose fury bathes the world with gore

  Father not so sage Ithacus rejoind
  The gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind
  Of Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view
  Whose hostile king the brave Tydides slew
  Sleeping he died with all his guards around
  And twelve beside lay gasping on the ground
  These other spoils from conquerd Dolon came
  A wretch whose swiftness was his only fame
  By Hector sent our forces to explore
  He now lies headless on the sandy shore

  Then oer the trench the bounding coursers flew
  The joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue
  Straight to Tydides high pavilion borne
  The matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn
  The neighing coursers their new fellows greet
  And the full racks are heapd with generous wheat
  But Dolons armour to his ships conveyd
  High on the painted stern Ulysses laid
  A trophy destind to the blueeyed maid

  Now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain
  They cleanse their bodies in the neighbring main
  Then in the polished bath refreshd from toil
  Their joints they supple with dissolving oil
  In due repast indulge the genial hour
  And first to Pallas the libations pour
  They sit rejoicing in her aid divine
  And the crownd goblet foams with floods of wine

ARGUMENT

THE THIRD BATTLE AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON

Agamemnon having armed himself leads the Grecians to battle Hector
prepares the Trojans to receive them while Jupiter Juno and Minerva
give the signals of war Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is
commanded by Jupiter who sends Iris for that purpose to decline the
engagement till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field He
then makes a great slaughter of the enemy Ulysses and Diomed put a stop
to him for a time but the latter being wounded by Paris is obliged to
desert his companion who is encompassed by the Trojans wounded and in
the utmost danger till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him Hector comes against
Ajax but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies the Greeks In
the meantime Machaon in the other wing of the army is pierced with an
arrow by Paris and carried from the fight in Nestors chariot Achilles
who overlooked the action from his ship sent Patroclus to inquire which
of the Greeks was wounded in that manner Nestor entertains him in his
tent with an account of the accidents of the day and a long recital of
some former wars which he remembered tending to put Patroclus upon
persuading Achilles to fight for his countrymen or at least to permit him
to do it clad in Achilles armour Patroclus on his return meets
Eurypylus also wounded and assists him in that distress

This book opens with the eight andtwentieth day of the poem and the same
day with its various actions and adventures is extended through the
twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and
part of the eighteenth books The scene lies in the field near the
monument of Ilus

  The saffron morn with early blushes spread219
  Now rose refulgent from Tithonus bed
  With newborn day to gladden mortal sight
  And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light
  When baleful Eris sent by Joves command
  The torch of discord blazing in her hand
  Through the red skies her bloody sign extends
  And wrapt in tempests oer the fleet descends
  High on Ulysses bark her horrid stand
  She took and thunderd through the seas and land

  Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound
  Whose ships remote the guarded navy bound
  Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng
  With horror sounds the loud Orthian song
  The navy shakes and at the dire alarms
  Each bosom boils each warrior starts to arms
  No more they sigh inglorious to return
  But breathe revenge and for the combat burn

                 Illustration THE DESCENT OF DISCORD

                         THE DESCENT OF DISCORD


  The king of men his hardy host inspires
  With loud command with great example fires
  Himself first rose himself before the rest
  His mighty limbs in radiant armour dressd
  And first he cased his manly legs around
  In shining greaves with silver buckles bound
  The beaming cuirass next adornd his breast
  The same which once king Cinyras possessd
  The fame of Greece and her assembled host
  Had reachd that monarch on the Cyprian coast
  Twas then the friendship of the chief to gain
  This glorious gift he sent nor sent in vain
  Ten rows of azure steel the work infold
  Twice ten of tin and twelve of ductile gold
  Three glittering dragons to the gorget rise
  Whose imitated scales against the skies
  Reflected various light and arching bowd
  Like colourd rainbows oer a showery cloud
  Joves wondrous bow of three celestial dies
  Placed as a sign to man amidst the skies
  A radiant baldric oer his shoulder tied
  Sustaind the sword that glitterd at his side
  Gold was the hilt a silver sheath encased
  The shining blade and golden hangers graced
  His bucklers mighty orb was next displayd
  That round the warrior cast a dreadful shade
  Ten zones of brass its ample brim surround
  And twice ten bosses the bright convex crownd
  Tremendous Gorgon frownd upon its field
  And circling terrors filld the expressive shield
  Within its concave hung a silver thong
  On which a mimic serpent creeps along
  His azure length in easy waves extends
  Till in three heads the embroiderd monster ends
  Last oer his brows his fourfold helm he placed
  With nodding horsehair formidably graced
  And in his hands two steely javelins wields
  That blaze to heaven and lighten all the fields

  That instant Juno and the martial maid
  In happy thunders promised Greece their aid
  High oer the chief they clashd their arms in air
  And leaning from the clouds expect the war

  Close to the limits of the trench and mound
  The fiery coursers to their chariots bound
  The squires restraind the foot with those who wield
  The lighter arms rush forward to the field
  To second these in close array combined
  The squadrons spread their sable wings behind
  Now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun
  As with the light the warriors toils begun
  Even Jove whose thunder spoke his wrath distilld
  Red drops of blood oer all the fatal field220
  The woes of men unwilling to survey
  And all the slaughters that must stain the day

  Near Ilus tomb in order ranged around
  The Trojan lines possessd the rising ground
  There wise Polydamas and Hector stood
  Ćneas honourd as a guardian god
  Bold Polybus Agenor the divine
  The brotherwarriors of Antenors line
  With youthful Acamas whose beauteous face
  And fair proportion matchd the ethereal race
  Great Hector coverd with his spacious shield
  Plies all the troops and orders all the field
  As the red star now shows his sanguine fires
  Through the dark clouds and now in night retires
  Thus through the ranks appeard the godlike man
  Plunged in the rear or blazing in the van
  While streamy sparkles restless as he flies
  Flash from his arms as lightning from the skies
  As sweating reapers in some wealthy field
  Ranged in two bands their crooked weapons wield
  Bear down the furrows till their labours meet
  Thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet
  So Greece and Troy the field of war divide
  And falling ranks are strowd on every side
  None stoopd a thought to base inglorious flight221
  But horse to horse and man to man they fight
  Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey
  Each wounds each bleeds but none resign the day
  Discord with joy the scene of death descries
  And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes
  Discord alone of all the immortal train
  Swells the red horrors of this direful plain
  The gods in peace their golden mansions fill
  Ranged in bright order on the Olympian hill
  But general murmurs told their griefs above
  And each accused the partial will of Jove
  Meanwhile apart superior and alone
  The eternal Monarch on his awful throne
  Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate
  And fixd fulfilld the just decrees of fate
  On earth he turnd his allconsidering eyes
  And markd the spot where Ilions towers arise
  The sea with ships the fields with armies spread
  The victors rage the dying and the dead

  Thus while the morningbeams increasing bright
  Oer heavens pure azure spread the glowing light
  Commutual death the fate of war confounds
  Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds
  But now what time in some sequesterd vale
  The weary woodman spreads his sparing meal
  When his tired arms refuse the axe to rear
  And claim a respite from the sylvan war
  But not till half the prostrate forests lay
  Stretchd in long ruin and exposed to day
  Then nor till then the Greeks impulsive might
  Pierced the black phalanx and let in the light
  Great Agamemnon then the slaughter led
  And slew Bienor at his peoples head
  Whose squire Oileus with a sudden spring
  Leapd from the chariot to revenge his king
  But in his front he felt the fatal wound
  Which pierced his brain and stretchd him on the ground
  Atrides spoild and left them on the plain
  Vain was their youth their glittering armour vain
  Now soild with dust and naked to the sky
  Their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie

  Two sons of Priam next to battle move
  The product one of marriage one of love222
  In the same car the brotherwarriors ride
  This took the charge to combat that to guide
  Far other task than when they wont to keep
  On Idas tops their fathers fleecy sheep
  These on the mountains once Achilles found
  And captive led with pliant osiers bound
  Then to their sire for ample sums restored
  But now to perish by Atrides sword
  Pierced in the breast the baseborn Isus bleeds
  Cleft through the head his brothers fate succeeds
  Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls
  And stript their features to his mind recalls
  The Trojans see the youths untimely die
  But helpless tremble for themselves and fly
  So when a lion ranging oer the lawns
  Finds on some grassy lair the couching fawns
  Their bones he cracks their reeking vitals draws
  And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws
  The frighted hind beholds and dares not stay
  But swift through rustling thickets bursts her way
  All drownd in sweat the panting mother flies
  And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes

  Amidst the tumult of the routed train
  The sons of false Antimachus were slain
  He who for bribes his faithless counsels sold
  And voted Helens stay for Paris gold
  Atrides markd as these their safety sought
  And slew the children for the fathers fault
  Their headstrong horse unable to restrain
  They shook with fear and droppd the silken rein
  Then in the chariot on their knees they fall
  And thus with lifted hands for mercy call

  O spare our youth and for the life we owe
  Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow
  Soon as he hears that not in battle slain
  The Grecian ships his captive sons detain
  Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told
  And steel welltempered and persuasive gold

  These words attended with the flood of tears
  The youths addressd to unrelenting ears
  The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply
  If from Antimachus ye spring ye die
  The daring wretch who once in council stood
  To shed Ulysses and my brothers blood
  For profferd peace and sues his seed for grace
  No die and pay the forfeit of your race

  This said Pisander from the car he cast
  And pierced his breast supine he breathed his last
  His brother leapd to earth but as he lay
  The trenchant falchion loppd his hands away
  His severd head was tossd among the throng
  And rolling drew a bloody train along
  Then where the thickest fought the victor flew
  The kings example all his Greeks pursue
  Now by the foot the flying foot were slain
  Horse trod by horse lay foaming on the plain
  From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise
  Shade the black host and intercept the skies
  The brasshoofd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound
  And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground
  Still slaughtering on the king of men proceeds
  The distanced army wonders at his deeds
  As when the winds with raging flames conspire
  And oer the forests roll the flood of fire
  In blazing heaps the groves old honours fall
  And one refulgent ruin levels all
  Before Atrides rage so sinks the foe
  Whole squadrons vanish and proud heads lie low
  The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword
  And many a car now lighted of its lord
  Wide oer the field with guideless fury rolls
  Breaking their ranks and crushing out their souls
  While his keen falchion drinks the warriors lives
  More grateful now to vultures than their wives

  Perhaps great Hector then had found his fate
  But Jove and destiny prolongd his date
  Safe from the darts the care of heaven he stood
  Amidst alarms and death and dust and blood

  Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay
  Through the mid field the routed urge their way
  Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown
  The path they take and speed to reach the town
  As swift Atrides with loud shouts pursued
  Hot with his toil and bathed in hostile blood
  Now near the beechtree and the Scaean gates
  The hero halts and his associates waits
  Meanwhile on every side around the plain
  Dispersed disorderd fly the Trojan train
  So flies a herd of beeves that hear dismayd
  The lions roaring through the midnight shade
  On heaps they tumble with successless haste
  The savage seizes draws and rends the last
  Not with less fury stern Atrides flew
  Still pressd the rout and still the hindmost slew
  Hurld from their cars the bravest chiefs are killd
  And rage and death and carnage load the field

  Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall
  Surveys the towers and meditates their fall
  But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills
  And down their summits pourd a hundred rills
  The unkindled lightning in his hand he took
  And thus the manycoloured maid bespoke

  Iris with haste thy golden wings display
  To godlike Hector this our word convey
  While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around
  Fights in the front and bathes with blood the ground
  Bid him give way but issue forth commands
  And trust the war to less important hands
  But when or wounded by the spear or dart
  That chief shall mount his chariot and depart
  Then Jove shall string his arm and fire his breast
  Then to her ships shall flying Greece be pressd
  Till to the main the burning sun descend
  And sacred night her awful shade extend

  He spoke and Iris at his word obeyd
  On wings of winds descends the various maid
  The chief she found amidst the ranks of war
  Close to the bulwarks on his glittering car
  The goddess then O son of Priam hear
  From Jove I come and his high mandate bear
  While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around
  Fights in the front and bathes with blood the ground
  Abstain from fight yet issue forth commands
  And trust the war to less important hands
  But when or wounded by the spear or dart
  The chief shall mount his chariot and depart
  Then Jove shall string thy arm and fire thy breast
  Then to her ships shall flying Greece be pressd
  Till to the main the burning sun descend
  And sacred night her awful shade extend

  She said and vanishd Hector with a bound
  Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground
  In clanging arms he grasps in either hand
  A pointed lance and speeds from band to band
  Revives their ardour turns their steps from flight
  And wakes anew the dying flames of fight
  They stand to arms the Greeks their onset dare
  Condense their powers and wait the coming war
  New force new spirit to each breast returns
  The fight renewd with fiercer fury burns
  The king leads on all fix on him their eye
  And learn from him to conquer or to die

  Ye sacred nine celestial Muses tell
  Who faced him first and by his prowess fell
  The great Iphidamas the bold and young
  From sage Antenor and Theano sprung
  Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred
  And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed
  Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest
  And early honour warm his generous breast
  When the kind sire consignd his daughters charms
  Theanos sister to his youthful arms
  But calld by glory to the wars of Troy
  He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy
  From his loved bride departs with melting eyes
  And swift to aid his dearer country flies
  With twelve black ships he reachd Percopes strand
  Thence took the long laborious march by land
  Now fierce for fame before the ranks he springs
  Towering in arms and braves the king of kings
  Atrides first discharged the missive spear
  The Trojan stoopd the javelin passd in air
  Then near the corslet at the monarchs heart
  With all his strength the youth directs his dart
  But the broad belt with plates of silver bound
  The point rebated and repelld the wound
  Encumberd with the dart Atrides stands
  Till graspd with force he wrenchd it from his hands
  At once his weighty sword discharged a wound
  Full on his neck that felld him to the ground
  Stretchd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies
  And sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes
  Oh worthy better fate oh early slain
  Thy countrys friend and virtuous though in vain
  No more the youth shall join his consorts side
  At once a virgin and at once a bride
  No more with presents her embraces meet
  Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet
  On whom his passion lavish of his store
  Bestowd so much and vainly promised more
  Unwept uncoverd on the plain he lay
  While the proud victor bore his arms away

  Coon Antenors eldest hope was nigh
  Tears at the sight came starting from his eye
  While pierced with grief the muchloved youth he viewd
  And the pale features now deformd with blood
  Then with his spear unseen his time he took
  Aimd at the king and near his elbow strook
  The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part
  And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart
  Surprised the monarch feels yet void of fear
  On Coon rushes with his lifted spear
  His brothers corpse the pious Trojan draws
  And calls his country to assert his cause
  Defends him breathless on the sanguine field
  And oer the body spreads his ample shield
  Atrides marking an unguarded part
  Transfixd the warrior with his brazen dart
  Prone on his brothers bleeding breast he lay
  The monarchs falchion loppd his head away
  The social shades the same dark journey go
  And join each other in the realms below

  The vengeful victor rages round the fields
  With every weapon art or fury yields
  By the long lance the sword or ponderous stone
  Whole ranks are broken and whole troops oerthrown
  This while yet warm distilld the purple flood
  But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood
  Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend
  Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send
  The powers that cause the teeming matrons throes
  Sad mothers of unutterable woes
  Stung with the smart allpanting with the pain
  He mounts the car and gives his squire the rein
  Then with a voice which fury made more strong
  And pain augmented thus exhorts the throng

  O friends O Greeks assert your honours won
  Proceed and finish what this arm begun
  Lo angry Jove forbids your chief to stay
  And envies half the glories of the day

  He said the driver whirls his lengthful thong
  The horses fly the chariot smokes along
  Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow
  And from their sides the foam descends in snow
  Shot through the battle in a moments space
  The wounded monarch at his tent they place

  No sooner Hector saw the king retired
  But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired
  Hear all ye Dardan all ye Lycian race
  Famed in close fight and dreadful face to face
  Now call to mind your ancient trophies won
  Your great forefathers virtues and your own
  Behold the general flies deserts his powers
  Lo Jove himself declares the conquest ours
  Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds
  And sure of glory dare immortal deeds

  With words like these the fiery chief alarms
  His fainting host and every bosom warms
  As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear
  The brindled lion or the tusky bear
  With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart
  And springs the foremost with his lifted dart
  So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare
  Nor prompts alone but leads himself the war
  On the black body of the foe he pours
  As from the clouds deep bosom swelld with showers
  A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps
  Drives the wild waves and tosses all the deeps
  Say Muse when Jove the Trojans glory crownd
  Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground
  Assaeus Dolops and Autonous died
  Opites next was added to their side
  Then brave Hipponous famed in many a fight
  Opheltius Orus sunk to endless night
  Ćsymnus Agelaus all chiefs of name
  The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame
  As when a western whirlwind charged with storms
  Dispels the gatherd clouds that Notus forms
  The gust continued violent and strong
  Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along
  Now to the skies the foaming billows rears
  Now breaks the surge and wide the bottom bares
  Thus raging Hector with resistless hands
  Oerturns confounds and scatters all their bands
  Now the last ruin the whole host appals
  Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls
  But wise Ulysses calld Tydides forth
  His soul rekindled and awaked his worth
  And stand we deedless O eternal shame
  Till Hectors arm involve the ships in flame
  Haste let us join and combat side by side
  The warrior thus and thus the friend replied

  No martial toil I shun no danger fear
  Let Hector come I wait his fury here
  But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train
  And Jove our foe all human force is vain

  He sighd but sighing raised his vengeful steel
  And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell
  Molion the charioteer pursued his lord
  His death ennobled by Ulysses sword
  There slain they left them in eternal night
  Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight
  So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds
  Then swift revert and wounds return for wounds
  Stern Hectors conquests in the middle plain
  Stood checkd awhile and Greece respired again

  The sons of Merops shone amidst the war
  Towering they rode in one refulgent car
  In deep prophetic arts their father skilld
  Had warnd his children from the Trojan field
  Fate urged them on the father warnd in vain
  They rushd to fight and perishd on the plain
  Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms
  The stern Tydides strips their shining arms
  Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies
  And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize
  Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight
  And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight
  By Tydeus lance Agastrophus was slain
  The farfamed hero of Paeonian strain
  Wingd with his fears on foot he strove to fly
  His steeds too distant and the foe too nigh
  Through broken orders swifter than the wind
  He fled but flying left his life behind
  This Hector sees as his experienced eyes
  Traverse the files and to the rescue flies
  Shouts as he passd the crystal regions rend
  And moving armies on his march attend
  Great Diomed himself was seized with fear
  And thus bespoke his brother of the war

  Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield
  The storm rolls on and Hector rules the field
  Here stand his utmost forceThe warrior said
  Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled
  Nor missd its aim but where the plumage danced
  Razed the smooth cone and thence obliquely glanced
  Safe in his helm the gift of Phoebus hands
  Without a wound the Trojan hero stands
  But yet so stunnd that staggering on the plain
  His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain
  Oer his dim sight the misty vapours rise
  And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes
  Tydides followed to regain his lance
  While Hector rose recoverd from the trance
  Remounts his car and herds amidst the crowd
  The Greek pursues him and exults aloud
  Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath
  Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death
  Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid
  And oft that partial power has lent his aid
  Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand
  If any god assist Tydides hand
  Fly then inglorious but thy flight this day
  Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay

  Him while he triumphd Paris eyed from far
  The spouse of Helen the fair cause of war
  Around the fields his featherd shafts he sent
  From ancient Ilus ruind monument
  Behind the column placed he bent his bow
  And wingd an arrow at the unwary foe
  Just as he stoopd Agastrophuss crest
  To seize and drew the corslet from his breast
  The bowstring twangd nor flew the shaft in vain
  But pierced his foot and naild it to the plain
  The laughing Trojan with a joyful spring
  Leaps from his ambush and insults the king

  He bleeds he cries some god has sped my dart
  Would the same god had fixd it in his heart
  So Troy relieved from that widewasting hand
  Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand
  Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear
  As scatterd lambs the rushing lion fear

  He dauntless thus Thou conqueror of the fair
  Thou womanwarrior with the curling hair
  Vain archer trusting to the distant dart
  Unskilld in arms to act a manly part
  Thou hast but done what boys or women can
  Such hands may wound but not incense a man
  Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave
  A cowards weapon never hurts the brave
  Not so this dart which thou mayst one day feel
  Fate wings its flight and death is on the steel
  Where this but lights some noble life expires
  Its touch makes orphans bathes the cheeks of sires
  Steeps earth in purple gluts the birds of air
  And leaves such objects as distract the fair
  Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart
  Before him steps and bending draws the dart
  Forth flows the blood an eager pang succeeds
  Tydides mounts and to the navy speeds

  Now on the field Ulysses stands alone
  The Greeks all fled the Trojans pouring on
  But stands collected in himself and whole
  And questions thus his own unconquerd soul

  What further subterfuge what hopes remain
  What shame inglorious if I quit the plain
  What danger singly if I stand the ground
  My friends all scatterd all the foes around
  Yet wherefore doubtful let this truth suffice
  The brave meets danger and the coward flies
  To die or conquer proves a heros heart
  And knowing this I know a soldiers part

  Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast
  Near and more near the shady cohorts pressd
  These in the warrior their own fate enclose
  And round him deep the steely circle grows
  So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds
  Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds
  He grinds his ivory tusks he foams with ire
  His sanguine eyeballs glare with living fire
  By these by those on every part is plied
  And the red slaughter spreads on every side
  Pierced through the shoulder first Deiopis fell
  Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell
  Chersidamas beneath the navel thrust
  Falls prone to earth and grasps the bloody dust
  Charops the son of Hippasus was near
  Ulysses reachd him with the fatal spear
  But to his aid his brother Socus flies
  Socus the brave the generous and the wise
  Near as he drew the warrior thus began

  O great Ulysses muchenduring man
  Not deeper skilld in every martial sleight
  Than worn to toils and active in the fight
  This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace
  And end at once the great Hippasian race
  Or thou beneath this lance must press the field
  He said and forceful pierced his spacious shield
  Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown
  Ploughd half his side and bared it to the bone
  By Pallas care the spear though deep infixd
  Stoppd short of life nor with his entrails mixd

  The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew
  Then furious thus but first some steps withdrew
  Unhappy man whose death our hands shall grace
  Fate calls thee hence and finishd is thy race
  Nor longer check my conquests on the foe
  But pierced by this to endless darkness go
  And add one spectre to the realms below

  He spoke while Socus seized with sudden fright
  Trembling gave way and turnd his back to flight
  Between his shoulders pierced the following dart
  And held its passage through the panting heart
  Wide in his breast appeard the grisly wound
  He falls his armour rings against the ground
  Then thus Ulysses gazing on the slain
  Famed son of Hippasus there press the plain
  There ends thy narrow span assignd by fate
  Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date
  Ah wretch no father shall thy corpse compose
  Thy dying eyes no tender mother close
  But hungry birds shall tear those balls away
  And hovering vultures scream around their prey
  Me Greece shall honour when I meet my doom
  With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb

  Then raging with intolerable smart
  He writhes his body and extracts the dart
  The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued
  And gladdend Troy with sight of hostile blood
  Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade
  Forced he recedes and loudly calls for aid
  Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears
  The wellknown voice thrice Menelaus hears
  Alarmd to Ajax Telamon he cried
  Who shares his labours and defends his side
  O friend Ulysses shouts invade my ear
  Distressed he seems and no assistance near
  Strong as he is yet one opposed to all
  Oppressd by multitudes the best may fall
  Greece robbd of him must bid her host despair
  And feel a loss not ages can repair

  Then where the cry directs his course he bends
  Great Ajax like the god of war attends
  The prudent chief in sore distress they found
  With bands of furious Trojans compassd round223
  As when some huntsman with a flying spear
  From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer
  Down his cleft side while fresh the blood distils
  He bounds aloft and scuds from hills to hills
  Till lifes warm vapour issuing through the wound
  Wild mountainwolves the fainting beast surround
  Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade
  The lion rushes through the woodland shade
  The wolves though hungry scour dispersed away
  The lordly savage vindicates his prey
  Ulysses thus unconquerd by his pains
  A single warrior half a host sustains
  But soon as Ajax leaves his towerlike shield
  The scattered crowds fly frighted oer the field
  Atrides arm the sinking hero stays
  And saved from numbers to his car conveys

  Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew
  And first Doryclus Priams son he slew
  On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound
  And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground
  As when a torrent swelld with wintry rains
  Pours from the mountains oer the deluged plains
  And pines and oaks from their foundations torn
  A countrys ruins to the seas are borne
  Fierce Ajax thus oerwhelms the yielding throng
  Men steeds and chariots roll in heaps along

  But Hector from this scene of slaughter far
  Raged on the left and ruled the tide of war
  Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain
  And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain
  There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose
  The warriors fury there the battle glows
  There fierce on foot or from the chariots height
  His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight
  The spouse of Helen dealing darts around
  Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound
  In his right shoulder the broad shaft appeard
  And trembling Greece for her physician feard
  To Nestor then Idomeneus begun
  Glory of Greece old Neleus valiant son
  Ascend thy chariot haste with speed away
  And great Machaon to the ships convey
  A wise physician skilld our wounds to heal
  Is more than armies to the public weal
  Old Nestor mounts the seat beside him rode
  The wounded offspring of the healing god
  He lends the lash the steeds with sounding feet
  Shake the dry field and thunder toward the fleet

  But now Cebriones from Hectors car
  Surveyd the various fortune of the war
  While here he cried the flying Greeks are slain
  Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain
  Before great Ajax see the mingled throng
  Of men and chariots driven in heaps along
  I know him well distinguishd oer the field
  By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield
  Thither O Hector thither urge thy steeds
  There danger calls and there the combat bleeds
  There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite
  And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight

  Thus having spoke the drivers lash resounds
  Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds
  Stung by the stroke the coursers scour the fields
  Oer heaps of carcases and hills of shields
  The horses hoofs are bathed in heroes gore
  And dashing purple all the car before
  The groaning axle sable drops distils
  And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels
  Here Hector plunging through the thickest fight
  Broke the dark phalanx and let in the light
  By the long lance the sword or ponderous stone
  The ranks he scatterd and the troops oerthrown
  Ajax he shuns through all the dire debate
  And fears that arm whose force he felt so late
  But partial Jove espousing Hectors part
  Shot heavenbred horror through the Grecians heart
  Confused unnerved in Hectors presence grown
  Amazed he stood with terrors not his own
  Oer his broad back his moony shield he threw
  And glaring round by tardy steps withdrew
  Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains
  Beset with watchful dogs and shouting swains
  Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls
  Though rage impels him and though hunger calls
  Long stands the showering darts and missile fires
  Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires
  So turnd stern Ajax by whole hosts repelld
  While his swoln heart at every step rebelld

  As the slow beast with heavy strength endued
  In some wide field by troops of boys pursued
  Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain
  Crops the tall harvest and lays waste the plain
  Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound
  The patient animal maintains his ground
  Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased
  And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last
  On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung
  The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung
  Confiding now in bulky strength he stands
  Now turns and backward bears the yielding bands
  Now stiff recedes yet hardly seems to fly
  And threats his followers with retorted eye
  Fixd as the bar between two warring powers
  While hissing darts descend in iron showers
  In his broad buckler many a weapon stood
  Its surface bristled with a quivering wood
  And many a javelin guiltless on the plain
  Marks the dry dust and thirsts for blood in vain
  But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts
  And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts
  Whose eager javelin launchd against the foe
  Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow
  From his torn liver the red current flowd
  And his slack knees desert their dying load
  The victor rushing to despoil the dead
  From Paris bow a vengeful arrow fled
  Fixd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood
  Fixd was the point but broken was the wood
  Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired
  Yet thus retreating his associates fired

  What god O Grecians has your hearts dismayd
  Oh turn to arms tis Ajax claims your aid
  This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage
  And this the last brave battle he shall wage
  Haste join your forces from the gloomy grave
  The warrior rescue and your country save
  Thus urged the chief a generous troop appears
  Who spread their bucklers and advance their spears
  To guard their wounded friend while thus they stand
  With pious care great Ajax joins the band
  Each takes new courage at the heros sight
  The hero rallies and renews the fight

  Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires
  While Nestors chariot far from fight retires
  His coursers steepd in sweat and staind with gore
  The Greeks preserver great Machaon bore
  That hour Achilles from the topmost height
  Of his proud fleet oerlookd the fields of fight
  His feasted eyes beheld around the plain
  The Grecian rout the slaying and the slain
  His friend Machaon singled from the rest
  A transient pity touchd his vengeful breast
  Straight to Menoetius muchloved son he sent
  Graceful as Mars Patroclus quits his tent
  In evil hour Then fate decreed his doom
  And fixd the date of all his woes to come

  Why calls my friend thy loved injunctions lay
  Whateer thy will Patroclus shall obey

  O first of friends Pelides thus replied
  Still at my heart and ever at my side
  The time is come when yon despairing host
  Shall learn the value of the man they lost
  Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan
  And proud Atrides tremble on his throne
  Go now to Nestor and from him be taught
  What wounded warrior late his chariot brought
  For seen at distance and but seen behind
  His form recalld Machaon to my mind
  Nor could I through yon cloud discern his face
  The coursers passd me with so swift a pace

  The hero said His friend obeyd with haste
  Through intermingled ships and tents he passd
  The chiefs descending from their car he found
  The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound
  The warriors standing on the breezy shore
  To dry their sweat and wash away the gore
  Here paused a moment while the gentle gale
  Conveyd that freshness the cool seas exhale
  Then to consult on farther methods went
  And took their seats beneath the shady tent
  The draught prescribed fair Hecamede prepares
  Arsinous daughter graced with golden hairs
  Whom to his aged arms a royal slave
  Greece as the prize of Nestors wisdom gave
  A table first with azure feet she placed
  Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced
  Honey newpressd the sacred flour of wheat
  And wholesome garlic crownd the savoury treat
  Next her white hand an antique goblet brings
  A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings
  From eldest times embossd with studs of gold
  Two feet support it and four handles hold
  On each bright handle bending oer the brink
  In sculptured gold two turtles seem to drink
  A massy weight yet heaved with ease by him
  When the brisk nectar overlookd the brim
  Temperd in this the nymph of form divine
  Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine
  With goatsmilk cheese a flavourous taste bestows
  And last with flour the smiling surface strows
  This for the wounded prince the dame prepares
  The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares
  Salubrious draughts the warriors thirst allay
  And pleasing conference beguiles the day

  Meantime Patroclus by Achilles sent
  Unheard approached and stood before the tent
  Old Nestor rising then the hero led
  To his high seat the chief refused and said

  Tis now no season for these kind delays
  The great Achilles with impatience stays
  To great Achilles this respect I owe
  Who asks what hero wounded by the foe
  Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds
  With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds
  This to report my hasty course I bend
  Thou knowst the fiery temper of my friend
  Can then the sons of Greece the sage rejoind
  Excite compassion in Achilles mind
  Seeks he the sorrows of our host to know
  This is not half the story of our woe
  Tell him not great Machaon bleeds alone
  Our bravest heroes in the navy groan
  Ulysses Agamemnon Diomed
  And stern Eurypylus already bleed
  But ah what flattering hopes I entertain
  Achilles heeds not but derides our pain
  Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays
  And waits the rising of the fatal blaze
  Chief after chief the raging foe destroys
  Calm he looks on and every death enjoys
  Now the slow course of allimpairing time
  Unstrings my nerves and ends my manly prime
  Oh had I still that strength my youth possessd
  When this bold arm the Epeian powers oppressd
  The bulls of Elis in glad triumph led
  And stretchd the great Itymonaeus dead
  Then from my fury fled the trembling swains
  And ours was all the plunder of the plains
  Fifty white flocks full fifty herds of swine
  As many goats as many lowing kine
  And thrice the number of unrivalld steeds
  All teeming females and of generous breeds
  These as my first essay of arms I won
  Old Neleus gloried in his conquering son
  Thus Elis forced her long arrears restored
  And shares were parted to each Pylian lord
  The state of Pyle was sunk to last despair
  When the proud Elians first commenced the war
  For Neleus sons Alcides rage had slain
  Of twelve bold brothers I alone remain
  Oppressd we armd and now this conquest gaind
  My sire three hundred chosen sheep obtaind
  That large reprisal he might justly claim
  For prize defrauded and insulted fame
  When Elis monarch at the public course
  Detaind his chariot and victorious horse
  The rest the people shared myself surveyd
  The just partition and due victims paid
  Three days were past when Elis rose to war
  With many a courser and with many a car
  The sons of Actor at their armys head
  Young as they were the vengeful squadrons led
  High on the rock fair Thryoessa stands
  Our utmost frontier on the Pylian lands
  Not far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow
  The stream they passd and pitchd their tents below
  Pallas descending in the shades of night
  Alarms the Pylians and commands the fight
  Each burns for fame and swells with martial pride
  Myself the foremost but my sire denied
  Feard for my youth exposed to stern alarms
  And stoppd my chariot and detaind my arms
  My sire denied in vain on foot I fled
  Amidst our chariots for the goddess led

  Along fair Arenes delightful plain
  Soft Minyas rolls his waters to the main
  There horse and foot the Pylian troops unite
  And sheathed in arms expect the dawning light
  Thence ere the sun advanced his noonday flame
  To great Alphaeus sacred source we came
  There first to Jove our solemn rites were paid
  An untamed heifer pleased the blueeyed maid
  A bull Alphaeus and a bull was slain
  To the blue monarch of the watery main
  In arms we slept beside the winding flood
  While round the town the fierce Epeians stood
  Soon as the sun with allrevealing ray
  Flamed in the front of Heaven and gave the day
  Bright scenes of arms and works of war appear
  The nations meet there Pylos Elis here
  The first who fell beneath my javelin bled
  King Augias son and spouse of Agamede
  She that all simples healing virtues knew
  And every herb that drinks the morning dew
  I seized his car the van of battle led
  The Epeians saw they trembled and they fled
  The foe dispersed their bravest warrior killd
  Fierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field
  Full fifty captive chariots graced my train
  Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain
  Then Actors sons had died but Neptune shrouds
  The youthful heroes in a veil of clouds
  Oer heapy shields and oer the prostrate throng
  Collecting spoils and slaughtering all along
  Through wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes
  Where oer the vales the Olenian rocks arose
  Till Pallas stoppd us where Alisium flows
  Even there the hindmost of the rear I slay
  And the same arm that led concludes the day
  Then back to Pyle triumphant take my way
  There to high Jove were public thanks assignd
  As first of gods to Nestor of mankind
  Such then I was impelld by youthful blood
  So proved my valour for my countrys good

  Achilles with unactive fury glows
  And gives to passion what to Greece he owes
  How shall he grieve when to the eternal shade
  Her hosts shall sink nor his the power to aid
  0 friend my memory recalls the day
  When gathering aids along the Grecian sea
  I and Ulysses touchd at Phthias port
  And entered Peleus hospitable court
  A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice
  And pourd libations on the flaming thighs
  Thyself Achilles and thy reverend sire
  Menoetius turnd the fragments on the fire
  Achilles sees us to the feast invites
  Social we sit and share the genial rites
  We then explained the cause on which we came
  Urged you to arms and found you fierce for fame
  Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave
  Peleus said only thisMy son be brave
  Menoetius thus Though great Achilles shine
  In strength superior and of race divine
  Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend
  Let thy just counsels aid and rule thy friend
  Thus spoke your father at Thessalias court
  Words now forgot though now of vast import
  Ah try the utmost that a friend can say
  Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey
  Some favouring god Achilles heart may move
  Though deaf to glory he may yield to love
  If some dire oracle his breast alarm
  If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm
  Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine
  If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line
  Clad in Achilles arms if thou appear
  Proud Troy may tremble and desist from war
  Pressd by fresh forces her oerlabourd train
  Shall seek their walls and Greece respire again

  This touchd his generous heart and from the tent
  Along the shore with hasty strides he went
  Soon as he came where on the crowded strand
  The public mart and courts of justice stand
  Where the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies
  And altars to the guardian gods arise
  There sad he met the brave Euaemons son
  Large painful drops from all his members run
  An arrows head yet rooted in his wound
  The sable blood in circles markd the ground
  As faintly reeling he confessd the smart
  Weak was his pace but dauntless was his heart
  Divine compassion touchd Patroclus breast
  Who sighing thus his bleeding friend addressd

  Ah hapless leaders of the Grecian host
  Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast
  Is this your fate to glut the dogs with gore
  Far from your friends and from your native shore
  Say great Eurypylus shall Greece yet stand
  Resists she yet the raging Hectors hand
  Or are her heroes doomd to die with shame
  And this the period of our wars and fame

  Eurypylus replies No more my friend
  Greece is no more this day her glories end
  Even to the ships victorious Troy pursues
  Her force increasing as her toil renews
  Those chiefs that used her utmost rage to meet
  Lie pierced with wounds and bleeding in the fleet
  But thou Patroclus act a friendly part
  Lead to my ships and draw this deadly dart
  With lukewarm water wash the gore away
  With healing balms the raging smart allay
  Such as sage Chiron sire of pharmacy
  Once taught Achilles and Achilles thee
  Of two famed surgeons Podalirius stands
  This hour surrounded by the Trojan bands
  And great Machaon wounded in his tent
  Now wants that succour which so oft he lent

  To him the chief What then remains to do
  The event of things the gods alone can view
  Charged by Achilles great command I fly
  And bear with haste the Pylian kings reply
  But thy distress this instant claims relief
  He said and in his arms upheld the chief
  The slaves their masters slow approach surveyd
  And hides of oxen on the floor displayd
  There stretchd at length the wounded hero lay
  Patroclus cut the forky steel away
  Then in his hands a bitter root he bruised
  The wound he washd the styptic juice infused
  The closing flesh that instant ceased to glow
  The wound to torture and the blood to flow

ARGUMENT

THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL

The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments Hector attempts to
force them but it proving impossible to pass the ditch Polydamas advises
to quit their chariots and manage the attack on foot The Trojans follow
his counsel and having divided their army into five bodies of foot begin
the assault But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons
which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans Polydamas endeavours to
withdraw them again This Hector opposes and continues the attack in
which after many actions Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall
Hector also casting a stone of vast size forces open one of the gates
and enters at the head of his troops who victoriously pursue the Grecians
even to their ships

  While thus the heros pious cares attend
  The cure and safety of his wounded friend
  Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage
  And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage
  Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose
  With gods averse the illfated works arose
  Their powers neglected and no victim slain
  The walls were raised the trenches sunk in vain

  Without the gods how short a period stands
  The proudest monument of mortal hands
  This stood while Hector and Achilles raged
  While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged
  But when her sons were slain her city burnd
  And what survived of Greece to Greece returnd
  Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore
  Then Idas summits pourd their watery store
  Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills
  Caresus roaring down the stony hills
  Ćsepus Granicus with mingled force
  And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source
  And gulfy Simois rolling to the main224
  Helmets and shields and godlike heroes slain
  These turnd by Phoebus from their wonted ways
  Deluged the rampire nine continual days
  The weight of waters saps the yielding wall
  And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall
  Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours
  And half the skies descend in sluicy showers
  The god of ocean marching stern before
  With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore
  Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves
  And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves
  Now smoothd with sand and levelld by the flood
  No fragment tells where once the wonder stood
  In their old bounds the rivers roll again
  Shine twixt the hills or wander oer the plain225

  But this the gods in later times perform
  As yet the bulwark stood and braved the storm
  The strokes yet echoed of contending powers
  War thunderd at the gates and blood distaind the towers
  Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay
  Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay
  Hectors approach in every wind they hear
  And Hectors fury every moment fear
  He like a whirlwind tossd the scattering throng
  Mingled the troops and drove the field along
  So midst the dogs and hunters daring bands
  Fierce of his might a boar or lion stands
  Armd foes around a dreadful circle form
  And hissing javelins rain an iron storm
  His powers untamed their bold assault defy
  And where he turns the rout disperse or die
  He foams he glares he bounds against them all
  And if he falls his courage makes him fall
  With equal rage encompassd Hector glows
  Exhorts his armies and the trenches shows
  The panting steeds impatient fury breathe
  And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath
  Just at the brink they neigh and paw the ground
  And the turf trembles and the skies resound
  Eager they viewd the prospect dark and deep
  Vast was the leap and headlong hung the steep
  The bottom bare a formidable show
  And bristled thick with sharpend stakes below
  The foot alone this strong defence could force
  And try the pass impervious to the horse
  This saw Polydamas who wisely brave
  Restraind great Hector and this counsel gave

  O thou bold leader of the Trojan bands
  And you confederate chiefs from foreign lands
  What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find
  The stakes beneath the Grecian walls behind
  No pass through those without a thousand wounds
  No space for combat in yon narrow bounds
  Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown
  On certain dangers we too rashly run
  If tis will our haughty foes to tame
  Oh may this instant end the Grecian name
  Here far from Argos let their heroes fall
  And one great day destroy and bury all
  But should they turn and here oppress our train
  What hopes what methods of retreat remain
  Wedged in the trench by our own troops confused
  In one promiscuous carnage crushd and bruised
  All Troy must perish if their arms prevail
  Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale
  Hear then ye warriors and obey with speed
  Back from the trenches let your steeds be led
  Then all alighting wedged in firm array
  Proceed on foot and Hector lead the way
  So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power
  And this if Jove consent her fatal hour

                        POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR


  This counsel pleased the godlike Hector sprung
  Swift from his seat his clanging armour rung
  The chiefs example followd by his train
  Each quits his car and issues on the plain
  By orders strict the charioteers enjoind
  Compel the coursers to their ranks behind
  The forces part in five distinguishd bands
  And all obey their several chiefs commands
  The best and bravest in the first conspire
  Pant for the fight and threat the fleet with fire
  Great Hector glorious in the van of these
  Polydamas and brave Cebriones
  Before the next the graceful Paris shines
  And bold Alcathous and Agenor joins
  The sons of Priam with the third appear
  Deiphobus and Helenas the seer
  In arms with these the mighty Asius stood
  Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood
  And whom Arisbas yellow coursers bore
  The coursers fed on Selles winding shore
  Antenors sons the fourth battalion guide
  And great Ćneas born on fountful Ide
  Divine Sarpedon the last band obeyd
  Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid
  Next him the bravest at their armys head
  But he more brave than all the hosts he led

  Now with compacted shields in close array
  The moving legions speed their headlong way
  Already in their hopes they fire the fleet
  And see the Grecians gasping at their feet

  While every Trojan thus and every aid
  The advice of wise Polydamas obeyd
  Asius alone confiding in his car
  His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war
  Unhappy hero and advised in vain
  Those wheels returning neer shall mark the plain
  No more those coursers with triumphant joy
  Restore their master to the gates of Troy
  Black death attends behind the Grecian wall
  And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall
  Fierce to the left he drives where from the plain
  The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain
  Swift through the wall their horse and chariots passd
  The gates halfopend to receive the last
  Thither exulting in his force he flies
  His following host with clamours rend the skies
  To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main
  Such their proud hopes but all their hopes were vain

  To guard the gates two mighty chiefs attend
  Who from the Lapiths warlike race descend
  This Polypoetes great Perithous heir
  And that Leonteus like the god of war
  As two tall oaks before the wall they rise
  Their roots in earth their heads amidst the skies
  Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crownd
  Forbid the tempest and protect the ground
  High on the hills appears their stately form
  And their deep roots for ever brave the storm
  So graceful these and so the shock they stand
  Of raging Asius and his furious band
  Orestes Acamas in front appear
  And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear
  In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields
  In vain around them beat their hollow shields
  The fearless brothers on the Grecians call
  To guard their navies and defend the wall
  Even when they saw Troys sable troops impend
  And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend
  Forth from the portals rushd the intrepid pair
  Opposed their breasts and stood themselves the war
  So two wild boars spring furious from their den
  Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men
  On every side the crackling trees they tear
  And root the shrubs and lay the forest bare
  They gnash their tusks with fire their eyeballs roll
  Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul
  Around their heads the whistling javelins sung
  With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung
  Fierce was the fight while yet the Grecian powers
  Maintaind the walls and mannd the lofty towers
  To save their fleet their last efforts they try
  And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly

  As when sharp Boreas blows abroad and brings
  The dreary winter on his frozen wings
  Beneath the lowhung clouds the sheets of snow
  Descend and whiten all the fields below
  So fast the darts on either army pour
  So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower
  Heavy and thick resound the batterd shields
  And the deaf echo rattles round the fields

  With shame repulsed with grief and fury driven
  The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven
  In powers immortal who shall now believe
  Can those too flatter and can Jove deceive
  What man could doubt but Troys victorious power
  Should humble Greece and this her fatal hour
  But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive
  To guard the entrance of their common hive
  Darkening the rock while with unwearied wings
  They strike the assailants and infix their stings
  A race determined that to death contend
  So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend
  Gods shall two warriors only guard their gates
  Repel an army and defraud the fates

  These empty accents mingled with the wind
  Nor moved great Joves unalterable mind
  To godlike Hector and his matchless might
  Was owed the glory of the destined fight
  Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried
  And all the gates sustaind an equal tide
  Through the long walls the stony showers were heard
  The blaze of flames the flash of arms appeard
  The spirit of a god my breast inspire
  To raise each act to life and sing with fire
  While Greece unconquerd kept alive the war
  Secure of death confiding in despair
  And all her guardian gods in deep dismay
  With unassisting arms deplored the day

  Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain
  The dreadful pass and round them heap the slain
  First Damasus by Polypoetes steel
  Pierced through his helmets brazen visor fell
  The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore
  The warrior sinks tremendous now no more
  Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath
  Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death
  First through the belt Hippomachus he gored
  Then sudden waved his unresisted sword
  Antiphates as through the ranks he broke
  The falchion struck and fate pursued the stroke
  Iamenus Orestes Menon bled
  And round him rose a monument of dead
  Meantime the bravest of the Trojan crew
  Bold Hector and Polydamas pursue
  Fierce with impatience on the works to fall
  And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall
  These on the farther bank now stood and gazed
  By Heaven alarmd by prodigies amazed
  A signal omen stoppd the passing host
  Their martial fury in their wonder lost
  Joves bird on sounding pinions beat the skies
  A bleeding serpent of enormous size
  His talons trussd alive and curling round
  He stung the bird whose throat received the wound
  Mad with the smart he drops the fatal prey
  In airy circles wings his painful way
  Floats on the winds and rends the heaven with cries
  Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies
  They pale with terror mark its spires unrolld
  And Joves portent with beating hearts behold
  Then first Polydamas the silence broke
  Long weighd the signal and to Hector spoke

  How oft my brother thy reproach I bear
  For words well meant and sentiments sincere
  True to those counsels which I judge the best
  I tell the faithful dictates of my breast
  To speak his thoughts is every freemans right
  In peace in war in council and in fight
  And all I move deferring to thy sway
  But tends to raise that power which I obey
  Then hear my words nor may my words be vain
  Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain
  For sure to warn us Jove his omen sent
  And thus my mind explains its clear event
  The victor eagle whose sinister flight
  Retards our host and fills our hearts with fright
  Dismissd his conquest in the middle skies
  Allowd to seize but not possess the prize
  Thus though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet
  Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet
  Toils unforeseen and fiercer are decreed
  More woes shall follow and more heroes bleed
  So bodes my soul and bids me thus advise
  For thus a skilful seer would read the skies

  To him then Hector with disdain returnd
  Fierce as he spoke his eyes with fury burnd
  Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue
  Thy will is partial not thy reason wrong
  Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent
  Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent
  What coward counsels would thy madness move
  Against the word the will reveald of Jove
  The leading sign the irrevocable nod
  And happy thunders of the favouring god
  These shall I slight and guide my wavering mind
  By wandering birds that flit with every wind
  Ye vagrants of the sky your wings extend
  Or where the suns arise or where descend
  To right to left unheeded take your way
  While I the dictates of high heaven obey
  Without a sign his sword the brave man draws
  And asks no omen but his countrys cause
  But why shouldst thou suspect the wars success
  None fears it more as none promotes it less
  Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire
  Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire
  Troy and her sons may find a general grave
  But thou canst live for thou canst be a slave
  Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests
  Spread their cold poison through our soldiers breasts
  My javelin can revenge so base a part
  And free the soul that quivers in thy heart

  Furious he spoke and rushing to the wall
  Calls on his host his host obey the call
  With ardour follow where their leader flies
  Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies
  Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide
  And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide
  He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay
  And gives great Hector the predestined day
  Strong in themselves but stronger in his aid
  Close to the works their rigid siege they laid
  In vain the mounds and massy beams defend
  While these they undermine and those they rend
  Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall
  And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall
  Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms
  The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms
  Shield touching shield a long refulgent row
  Whence hissing darts incessant rain below
  The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower
  And rouse with flame divine the Grecian power
  The generous impulse every Greek obeys
  Threats urge the fearful and the valiant praise

  Fellows in arms whose deeds are known to fame
  And you whose ardour hopes an equal name
  Since not alike endued with force or art
  Behold a day when each may act his part
  A day to fire the brave and warm the cold
  To gain new glories or augment the old
  Urge those who stand and those who faint excite
  Drown Hectors vaunts in loud exhorts of fight
  Conquest not safety fill the thoughts of all
  Seek not your fleet but sally from the wall
  So Jove once more may drive their routed train
  And Troy lie trembling in her walls again

  Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers
  And now the stones descend in heavier showers
  As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms
  And opes his cloudy magazine of storms
  In winters bleak un comfortable reign
  A snowy inundation hides the plain
  He stills the winds and bids the skies to sleep
  Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep
  And first the mountaintops are coverd oer
  Then the green fields and then the sandy shore
  Bent with the weight the nodding woods are seen
  And one bright waste hides all the works of men
  The circling seas alone absorbing all
  Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall
  So from each side increased the stony rain
  And the white ruin rises oer the plain

  Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend
  To force the ramparts and the gates to rend
  Nor Troy could conquer nor the Greeks would yield
  Till great Sarpedon towerd amid the field
  For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame
  His matchless son and urged him on to fame
  In arms he shines conspicuous from afar
  And bears aloft his ample shield in air
  Within whose orb the thick bullhides were rolld
  Ponderous with brass and bound with ductile gold
  And while two pointed javelins arm his hands
  Majestic moves along and leads his Lycian bands

  So pressd with hunger from the mountains brow
  Descends a lion on the flocks below
  So stalks the lordly savage oer the plain
  In sullen majesty and stern disdain
  In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar
  And shepherds gall him with an iron war
  Regardless furious he pursues his way
  He foams he roars he rends the panting prey

  Resolved alike divine Sarpedon glows
  With generous rage that drives him on the foes
  He views the towers and meditates their fall
  To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall
  Then casting on his friend an ardent look
  Fired with the thirst of glory thus he spoke

  Why boast we Glaucus our extended reign226
  Where Xanthus streams enrich the Lycian plain
  Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field
  And hills where vines their purple harvest yield
  Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crownd
  Our feasts enhanced with musics sprightly sound
  Why on those shores are we with joy surveyd
  Admired as heroes and as gods obeyd
  Unless great acts superior merit prove
  And vindicate the bounteous powers above
  Tis ours the dignity they give to grace
  The first in valour as the first in place
  That when with wondering eyes our martial bands
  Behold our deeds transcending our commands
  Such they may cry deserve the sovereign state
  Whom those that envy dare not imitate
  Could all our care elude the gloomy grave
  Which claims no less the fearful and the brave
  For lust of fame I should not vainly dare
  In fighting fields nor urge thy soul to war
  But since alas ignoble age must come
  Disease and deaths inexorable doom
  The life which others pay let us bestow
  And give to fame what we to nature owe
  Brave though we fall and honourd if we live
  Or let us glory gain or glory give

  He said his words the listening chief inspire
  With equal warmth and rouse the warriors fire
  The troops pursue their leaders with delight
  Rush to the foe and claim the promised fight
  Menestheus from on high the storm beheld
  Threatening the fort and blackening in the field
  Around the walls he gazed to view from far
  What aid appeard to avert the approaching war
  And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood
  Of fight insatiate prodigal of blood
  In vain he calls the din of helms and shields
  Rings to the skies and echoes through the fields
  The brazen hinges fly the walls resound
  Heaven trembles roar the mountains thunders all the ground
  Then thus to Thoos Hence with speed he said
  And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid
  Their strength united best may help to bear
  The bloody labours of the doubtful war
  Hither the Lycian princes bend their course
  The best and bravest of the hostile force
  But if too fiercely there the foes contend
  Let Telamon at least our towers defend
  And Teucer haste with his unerring bow
  To share the danger and repel the foe

  Swift at the word the herald speeds along
  The lofty ramparts through the martial throng
  And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore
  Opposed in combat on the dusty shore
  Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands
  Your aid said Thoos Peteus son demands
  Your strength united best may help to bear
  The bloody labours of the doubtful war
  Thither the Lycian princes bend their course
  The best and bravest of the hostile force
  But if too fiercely here the foes contend
  At least let Telamon those towers defend
  And Teucer haste with his unerring bow
  To share the danger and repel the foe

  Straight to the fort great Ajax turnd his care
  And thus bespoke his brothers of the war
  Now valiant Lycomede exert your might
  And brave Oileus prove your force in fight
  To you I trust the fortune of the field
  Till by this arm the foe shall be repelld
  That done expect me to complete the day
  Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away
  With equal steps bold Teucer pressd the shore
  Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore

  High on the walls appeard the Lycian powers
  Like some black tempest gathering round the towers
  The Greeks oppressd their utmost force unite
  Prepared to labour in the unequal fight
  The war renews mixd shouts and groans arise
  Tumultuous clamour mounts and thickens in the skies
  Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades
  And sends the brave Epicles to the shades
  Sarpedons friend Across the warriors way
  Rent from the walls a rocky fragment lay
  In modern ages not the strongest swain
  Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain
  He poised and swung it round then tossd on high
  It flew with force and labourd up the sky
  Full on the Lycians helmet thundering down
  The ponderous ruin crushd his batterd crown
  As skilful divers from some airy steep
  Headlong descend and shoot into the deep
  So falls Epicles then in groans expires
  And murmuring to the shades the soul retires

  While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew
  From Teucers hand a winged arrow flew
  The bearded shaft the destined passage found
  And on his naked arm inflicts a wound
  The chief who feard some foes insulting boast
  Might stop the progress of his warlike host
  Conceald the wound and leaping from his height
  Retired reluctant from the unfinishd fight
  Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld
  Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field
  His beating breast with generous ardour glows
  He springs to fight and flies upon the foes
  Alcmaon first was doomd his force to feel
  Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel
  Then from the yawning wound with fury tore
  The spear pursued by gushing streams of gore
  Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound
  His brazen armour rings against the ground

  Swift to the battlement the victor flies
  Tugs with full force and every nerve applies
  It shakes the ponderous stones disjointed yield
  The rolling ruins smoke along the field
  A mighty breach appears the walls lie bare
  And like a deluge rushes in the war
  At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow
  And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe
  Fixd in his belt the featherd weapon stood
  And through his buckler drove the trembling wood
  But Jove was present in the dire debate
  To shield his offspring and avert his fate
  The prince gave back not meditating flight
  But urging vengeance and severer fight
  Then raised with hope and fired with glorys charms
  His fainting squadrons to new fury warms
  O where ye Lycians is the strength you boast
  Your former fame and ancient virtue lost
  The breach lies open but your chief in vain
  Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain
  Unite and soon that hostile fleet shall fall
  The force of powerful union conquers all

  This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew
  They join they thicken and the assault renew
  Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare
  And fixd support the weight of all the war
  Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers
  Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers
  As on the confines of adjoining grounds
  Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds
  They tug they sweat but neither gain nor yield
  One foot one inch of the contended field
  Thus obstinate to death they fight they fall
  Nor these can keep nor those can win the wall
  Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound
  Loud strokes are heard and rattling arms resound
  The copious slaughter covers all the shore
  And the high ramparts drip with human gore

  As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads
  From side to side the trembling balance nods
  While some laborious matron just and poor
  With nice exactness weighs her woolly store
  Till poised aloft the resting beam suspends
  Each equal weight nor this nor that descends227
  So stood the war till Hectors matchless might
  With fates prevailing turnd the scale of fight
  Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies
  And fires his host with loud repeated cries
  Advance ye Trojans lend your valiant hands
  Haste to the fleet and toss the blazing brands
  They hear they run and gathering at his call
  Raise scaling engines and ascend the wall
  Around the works a wood of glittering spears
  Shoots up and all the rising host appears
  A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw
  Pointed above and rough and gross below
  Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise
  Such men as live in these degenerate days
  Yet this as easy as a swain could bear
  The snowy fleece he tossd and shook in air
  For Jove upheld and lightend of its load
  The unwieldy rock the labour of a god
  Thus armd before the folded gates he came
  Of massy substance and stupendous frame
  With iron bars and brazen hinges strong
  On lofty beams of solid timber hung
  Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway
  Drives the sharp rock the solid beams give way
  The folds are shatterd from the crackling door
  Leap the resounding bars the flying hinges roar
  Now rushing in the furious chief appears
  Gloomy as night and shakes two shining spears228
  A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came
  And from his eyeballs flashd the living flame
  He moves a god resistless in his course
  And seems a match for more than mortal force
  Then pouring after through the gaping space
  A tide of Trojans flows and fills the place
  The Greeks behold they tremble and they fly
  The shore is heapd with death and tumult rends the sky

ARGUMENT

THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS THE ACTS
OF IDOMENEUS

Neptune concerned for the loss of the Grecians upon seeing the
fortification forced by Hector who had entered the gate near the station
of the Ajaces assumes the shape of Calchas and inspires those heroes to
oppose him then in the form of one of the generals encourages the other
Greeks who had retired to their vessels The Ajaces form their troops in a
close phalanx and put a stop to Hector and the Trojans Several deeds of
valour are performed Meriones losing his spear in the encounter repairs
to seek another at the tent of Idomeneus this occasions a conversation
between those two warriors who return together to the battle Idomeneus
signalizes his courage above the rest he kills Othryoneus Asius and
Alcathous Deiphobus and Ćneas march against him and at length Idomeneus
retires Menelaus wounds Helenus and kills Pisander The Trojans are
repulsed on the left wing Hector still keeps his ground against the
Ajaces till being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers Polydamas
advises to call a council of war Hector approves of his advice but goes
first to rally the Trojans upbraids Paris rejoins Polydamas meets Ajax
again and renews the attack

The eightandtwentieth day still continues The scene is between the
Grecian wall and the seashore

  When now the Thunderer on the seabeat coast
  Had fixd great Hector and his conquering host
  He left them to the fates in bloody fray
  To toil and struggle through the wellfought day
  Then turnd to Thracia from the field of fight
  Those eyes that shed insufferable light
  To where the Mysians prove their martial force
  And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse
  And where the farfamed Hippomolgian strays
  Renownd for justice and for length of days229
  Thrice happy race that innocent of blood
  From milk innoxious seek their simple food
  Jove sees delighted and avoids the scene
  Of guilty Troy of arms and dying men
  No aid he deems to either host is given
  While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven

  Meantime the monarch of the watery main
  Observed the Thunderer nor observed in vain
  In Samothracia on a mountains brow
  Whose waving woods oerhung the deeps below
  He sat and round him cast his azure eyes
  Where Idas misty tops confusedly rise
  Below fair Ilions glittering spires were seen
  The crowded ships and sable seas between
  There from the crystal chambers of the main
  Emerged he sat and mournd his Argives slain
  At Jove incensed with grief and fury stung
  Prone down the rocky steep he rushd along
  Fierce as he passd the lofty mountains nod
  The forest shakes earth trembled as he trod
  And felt the footsteps of the immortal god
  From realm to realm three ample strides he took
  And at the fourth the distant Ćgae shook

  Far in the bay his shining palace stands
  Eternal frame not raised by mortal hands
  This having reachd his brasshoofd steeds he reins
  Fleet as the winds and deckd with golden manes
  Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold
  Immortal arms of adamant and gold
  He mounts the car the golden scourge applies
  He sits superior and the chariot flies
  His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep
  The enormous monsters rolling oer the deep
  Gambol around him on the watery way
  And heavy whales in awkward measures play
  The sea subsiding spreads a level plain
  Exults and owns the monarch of the main
  The parting waves before his coursers fly
  The wondering waters leave his axle dry

  Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave
  Between where Tenedos the surges lave
  And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave
  There the great ruler of the azure round
  Stoppd his swift chariot and his steeds unbound
  Fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand
  And linkd their fetlocks with a golden band
  Infrangible immortal there they stay
  The father of the floods pursues his way
  Where like a tempest darkening heaven around
  Or fiery deluge that devours the ground
  The impatient Trojans in a gloomy throng
  Embattled rolld as Hector rushd along
  To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry
  The heavens reecho and the shores reply
  They vow destruction to the Grecian name
  And in their hopes the fleets already flame

  But Neptune rising from the seas profound
  The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground
  Now wears a mortal form like Calchas seen
  Such his loud voice and such his manly mien
  His shouts incessant every Greek inspire
  But most the Ajaces adding fire to fire

               Illustration NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA

                       NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA


  Tis yours O warriors all our hopes to raise
  Oh recollect your ancient worth and praise
  Tis yours to save us if you cease to fear
  Flight more than shameful is destructive here
  On other works though Troy with fury fall
  And pour her armies oer our batterd wall
  There Greece has strength but this this part oerthrown
  Her strength were vain I dread for you alone
  Here Hector rages like the force of fire
  Vaunts of his gods and calls high Jove his sire
  If yet some heavenly power your breast excite
  Breathe in your hearts and string your arms to fight
  Greece yet may live her threatend fleet maintain
  And Hectors force and Joves own aid be vain

  Then with his sceptre that the deep controls
  He touchd the chiefs and steeld their manly souls
  Strength not their own the touch divine imparts
  Prompts their light limbs and swells their daring hearts
  Then as a falcon from the rocky height
  Her quarry seen impetuous at the sight
  Forthspringing instant darts herself from high
  Shoots on the wing and skims along the sky
  Such and so swift the power of ocean flew
  The wide horizon shut him from their view

  The inspiring god Oileus active son
  Perceived the first and thus to Telamon

  Some god my friend some god in human form
  Favouring descends and wills to stand the storm
  Not Calchas this the venerable seer
  Short as he turned I saw the power appear
  I markd his parting and the steps he trod
  His own bright evidence reveals a god
  Even now some energy divine I share
  And seem to walk on wings and tread in air

  With equal ardour Telamon returns
  My soul is kindled and my bosom burns
  New rising spirits all my force alarm
  Lift each impatient limb and brace my arm
  This ready arm unthinking shakes the dart
  The blood pours back and fortifies my heart
  Singly methinks yon towering chief I meet
  And stretch the dreadful Hector at my feet

  Full of the god that urged their burning breast
  The heroes thus their mutual warmth expressd
  Neptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired
  Who breathless pale with length of labours tired
  Pant in the ships while Troy to conquest calls
  And swarms victorious oer their yielding walls
  Trembling before the impending storm they lie
  While tears of rage stand burning in their eye
  Greece sunk they thought and this their fatal hour
  But breathe new courage as they feel the power
  Teucer and Leitus first his words excite
  Then stern Peneleus rises to the fight
  Thoas Deipyrus in arms renownd
  And Merion next the impulsive fury found
  Last Nestors son the same bold ardour takes
  While thus the god the martial fire awakes

  Oh lasting infamy oh dire disgrace
  To chiefs of vigorous youth and manly race
  I trusted in the gods and you to see
  Brave Greece victorious and her navy free
  Ah nothe glorious combat you disclaim
  And one black day clouds all her former fame
  Heavens what a prodigy these eyes survey
  Unseen unthought till this amazing day
  Fly we at length from Troys oftconquerd bands
  And falls our fleet by such inglorious hands
  A rout undisciplined a straggling train
  Not born to glories of the dusty plain
  Like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued
  A prey to every savage of the wood
  Shall these so late who trembled at your name
  Invade your camps involve your ships in flame
  A change so shameful say what cause has wrought
  The soldiers baseness or the generals fault
  Fools will ye perish for your leaders vice
  The purchase infamy and life the price
  Tis not your cause Achilles injured fame
  Anothers is the crime but yours the shame
  Grant that our chief offend through rage or lust
  Must you be cowards if your kings unjust
  Prevent this evil and your country save
  Small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave
  Think and subdue on dastards dead to fame
  I waste no anger for they feel no shame
  But you the pride the flower of all our host
  My heart weeps blood to see your glory lost
  Nor deem this day this battle all you lose
  A day more black a fate more vile ensues
  Let each reflect who prizes fame or breath
  On endless infamy on instant death
  For lo the fated time the appointed shore
  Hark the gates burst the brazen barriers roar
  Impetuous Hector thunders at the wall
  The hour the spot to conquer or to fall

  These words the Grecians fainting hearts inspire
  And listening armies catch the godlike fire
  Fixd at his post was each bold Ajax found
  With wellranged squadrons strongly circled round
  So close their order so disposed their fight
  As Pallas self might view with fixd delight
  Or had the god of war inclined his eyes
  The god of war had ownd a just surprise
  A chosen phalanx firm resolved as fate
  Descending Hector and his battle wait
  An iron scene gleams dreadful oer the fields
  Armour in armour lockd and shields in shields
  Spears lean on spears on targets targets throng
  Helms stuck to helms and man drove man along
  The floating plumes unnumberd wave above
  As when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove
  And levelld at the skies with pointing rays
  Their brandishd lances at each motion blaze

  Thus breathing death in terrible array
  The close compacted legions urged their way
  Fierce they drove on impatient to destroy
  Troy charged the first and Hector first of Troy
  As from some mountains craggy forehead torn
  A rocks round fragment flies with fury borne
  Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends
  Precipitate the ponderous mass descends
  From steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds
  At every shock the crackling wood resounds
  Still gathering force it smokes and urged amain
  Whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain
  There stopsso Hector Their whole force he proved230
  Resistless when he raged and when he stoppd unmoved

  On him the war is bent the darts are shed
  And all their falchions wave around his head
  Repulsed he stands nor from his stand retires
  But with repeated shouts his army fires
  Trojans be firm this arm shall make your way
  Through yon square body and that black array
  Stand and my spear shall rout their scattering power
  Strong as they seem embattled like a tower
  For he that Junos heavenly bosom warms
  The first of gods this day inspires our arms

  He said and roused the soul in every breast
  Urged with desire of fame beyond the rest
  Forth marchd Deiphobus but marching held
  Before his wary steps his ample shield
  Bold Merion aimd a stroke nor aimd it wide
  The glittering javelin pierced the tough bullhide
  But pierced not through unfaithful to his hand
  The point broke short and sparkled in the sand
  The Trojan warrior touchd with timely fear
  On the raised orb to distance bore the spear
  The Greek retreating mournd his frustrate blow
  And cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe
  Then to the ships with surly speed he went
  To seek a surer javelin in his tent

  Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows
  The tumult thickens and the clamour grows
  By Teucers arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds
  The son of Mentor rich in generous steeds
  Ere yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led
  In fair Pedaeus verdant pastures bred
  The youth had dwelt remote from wars alarms
  And blest in bright Medesicastes arms
  This nymph the fruit of Priams ravishd joy
  Allied the warrior to the house of Troy
  To Troy when glory calld his arms he came
  And matchd the bravest of her chiefs in fame
  With Priams sons a guardian of the throne
  He lived beloved and honourd as his own
  Him Teucer pierced between the throat and ear
  He groans beneath the Telamonian spear
  As from some farseen mountains airy crown
  Subdued by steel a tall ash tumbles down
  And soils its verdant tresses on the ground
  So falls the youth his arms the fall resound
  Then Teucer rushing to despoil the dead
  From Hectors hand a shining javelin fled
  He saw and shunnd the death the forceful dart
  Sung on and pierced Amphimachuss heart
  Cteatus son of Neptunes forceful line
  Vain was his courage and his race divine
  Prostrate he falls his clanging arms resound
  And his broad buckler thunders on the ground
  To seize his beamy helm the victor flies
  And just had fastened on the dazzling prize
  When Ajax manly arm a javelin flung
  Full on the shields round boss the weapon rung
  He felt the shock nor more was doomd to feel
  Secure in mail and sheathd in shining steel
  Repulsed he yields the victor Greeks obtain
  The spoils contested and bear off the slain
  Between the leaders of the Athenian line
  Stichius the brave Menestheus the divine
  Deplored Amphimachus sad object lies
  Imbrius remains the fierce Ajaces prize
  As two grim lions bear across the lawn
  Snatchd from devouring hounds a slaughterd fawn
  In their fell jaws highlifting through the wood
  And sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood
  So these the chief great Ajax from the dead
  Strips his bright arms Oileus lops his head
  Tossd like a ball and whirld in air away
  At Hectors feet the gory visage lay

  The god of ocean fired with stern disdain
  And pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain
  Inspires the Grecian hearts confirms their hands
  And breathes destruction on the Trojan bands
  Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet
  He finds the lancefamed Idomen of Crete
  His pensive brow the generous care expressd
  With which a wounded soldier touchd his breast
  Whom in the chance of war a javelin tore
  And his sad comrades from the battle bore
  Him to the surgeons of the camp he sent
  That office paid he issued from his tent
  Fierce for the fight to whom the god begun
  In Thoas voice Andraemons valiant son
  Who ruled where Calydons white rocks arise
  And Pleurons chalky cliffs emblaze the skies

  Wheres now the imperious vaunt the daring boast
  Of Greece victorious and proud Ilion lost

  To whom the king On Greece no blame be thrown
  Arms are her trade and war is all her own
  Her hardy heroes from the wellfought plains
  Nor fear withholds nor shameful sloth detains
  Tis heaven alas and Joves allpowerful doom
  That far far distant from our native home
  Wills us to fall inglorious Oh my friend
  Once foremost in the fight still prone to lend
  Or arms or counsels now perform thy best
  And what thou canst not singly urge the rest

  Thus he and thus the god whose force can make
  The solid globes eternal basis shake
  Ah never may he see his native land
  But feed the vultures on this hateful strand
  Who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay
  Nor dares to combat on this signal day
  For this behold in horrid arms I shine
  And urge thy soul to rival acts with mine
  Together let us battle on the plain
  Two not the worst nor even this succour vain
  Not vain the weakest if their force unite
  But ours the bravest have confessd in fight

  This said he rushes where the combat burns
  Swift to his tent the Cretan king returns
  From thence two javelins glittering in his hand
  And clad in arms that lightend all the strand
  Fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove
  Like lightning bursting from the arm of Jove
  Which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares
  Or terrifies the offending world with wars
  In streamy sparkles kindling all the skies
  From pole to pole the trail of glory flies
  Thus his bright armour oer the dazzled throng
  Gleamd dreadful as the monarch flashd along

  Him near his tent Meriones attends
  Whom thus he questions Ever best of friends
  O say in every art of battle skilld
  What holds thy courage from so brave a field
  On some important message art thou bound
  Or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound
  Inglorious here my soul abhors to stay
  And glows with prospects of th approaching day

  O prince Meriones replies whose care
  Leads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war
  This speaks my grief this headless lance I wield
  The rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield

  To whom the Cretan Enter and receive
  The wonted weapons those my tent can give
  Spears I have store and Trojan lances all
  That shed a lustre round the illumined wall
  Though I disdainful of the distant war
  Nor trust the dart nor aim the uncertain spear
  Yet hand to hand I fight and spoil the slain
  And thence these trophies and these arms I gain
  Enter and see on heaps the helmets rolld
  And highhung spears and shields that flame with gold

  Nor vain said Merion are our martial toils
  We too can boast of no ignoble spoils
  But those my ship contains whence distant far
  I fight conspicuous in the van of war
  What need I more If any Greek there be
  Who knows not Merion I appeal to thee

  To this Idomeneus The fields of fight
  Have proved thy valour and unconquerd might
  And were some ambush for the foes designd
  Even there thy courage would not lag behind
  In that sharp service singled from the rest
  The fear of each or valour stands confessd
  No force no firmness the pale coward shows
  He shifts his place his colour comes and goes
  A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part
  Against his bosom beats his quivering heart
  Terror and death in his wild eyeballs stare
  With chattering teeth he stands and stiffening hair
  And looks a bloodless image of despair
  Not so the bravestill dauntless still the same
  Unchanged his colour and unmoved his frame
  Composed his thought determined is his eye
  And fixd his soul to conquer or to die
  If aught disturb the tenour of his breast
  Tis but the wish to strike before the rest

  In such assays thy blameless worth is known
  And every art of dangerous war thy own
  By chance of fight whatever wounds you bore
  Those wounds were glorious all and all before
  Such as may teach twas still thy brave delight
  Toppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight
  But why like infants cold to honours charms
  Stand we to talk when glory calls to arms
  Gofrom my conquerd spears the choicest take
  And to their owners send them nobly back

  Swift at the word bold Merion snatchd a spear
  And breathing slaughter followd to the war
  So Mars armipotent invades the plain
  The wide destroyer of the race of man
  Terror his bestbeloved son attends his course
  Armd with stern boldness and enormous force
  The pride of haughty warriors to confound
  And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground
  From Thrace they fly calld to the dire alarms
  Of warring Phlegyans and Ephyrian arms
  Invoked by both relentless they dispose
  To these glad conquest murderous rout to those
  So marchd the leaders of the Cretan train
  And their bright arms shot horror oer the plain

  Then first spake Merion Shall we join the right
  Or combat in the centre of the fight
  Or to the left our wonted succour lend
  Hazard and fame all parts alike attend

  Not in the centre Idomen replied
  Our ablest chieftains the main battle guide
  Each godlike Ajax makes that post his care
  And gallant Teucer deals destruction there
  Skilld or with shafts to gall the distant field
  Or bear close battle on the sounding shield
  These can the rage of haughty Hector tame
  Safe in their arms the navy fears no flame
  Till Jove himself descends his bolts to shed
  And hurl the blazing ruin at our head
  Great must he be of more than human birth
  Nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth
  Him neither rocks can crush nor steel can wound
  Whom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground
  In standing fight he mates Achilles force
  Excelld alone in swiftness in the course
  Then to the left our ready arms apply
  And live with glory or with glory die

  He said and Merion to th appointed place
  Fierce as the god of battles urged his pace
  Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld
  Rush like a fiery torrent oer the field
  Their force embodied in a tide they pour
  The rising combat sounds along the shore
  As warring winds in Sirius sultry reign
  From different quarters sweep the sandy plain
  On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise
  And the dry fields are lifted to the skies
  Thus by despair hope rage together driven
  Met the black hosts and meeting darkend heaven
  All dreadful glared the iron face of war
  Bristled with upright spears that flashd afar
  Dire was the gleam of breastplates helms and shields
  And polishd arms emblazed the flaming fields
  Tremendous scene that general horror gave
  But touchd with joy the bosoms of the brave

  Saturns great sons in fierce contention vied
  And crowds of heroes in their anger died
  The sire of earth and heaven by Thetis won
  To crown with glory Peleus godlike son
  Willd not destruction to the Grecian powers
  But spared awhile the destined Trojan towers
  While Neptune rising from his azure main
  Warrd on the king of heaven with stern disdain
  And breathed revenge and fired the Grecian train
  Gods of one source of one ethereal race
  Alike divine and heaven their native place
  But Jove the greater firstborn of the skies
  And more than men or gods supremely wise
  For this of Joves superior might afraid
  Neptune in human form conceald his aid
  These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train
  In war and discords adamantine chain
  Indissolubly strong the fatal tie
  Is stretchd on both and close compelld they die

  Dreadful in arms and grown in combats grey
  The bold Idomeneus controls the day
  First by his hand Othryoneus was slain
  Swelld with false hopes with mad ambition vain
  Calld by the voice of war to martial fame
  From high Cabesus distant walls he came
  Cassandras love he sought with boasts of power
  And promised conquest was the profferd dower
  The king consented by his vaunts abused
  The king consented but the fates refused
  Proud of himself and of the imagined bride
  The field he measured with a larger stride
  Him as he stalkd the Cretan javelin found
  Vain was his breastplate to repel the wound
  His dream of glory lost he plunged to hell
  His arms resounded as the boaster fell
  The great Idomeneus bestrides the dead
  And thus he cries behold thy promise sped
  Such is the help thy arms to Ilion bring
  And such the contract of the Phrygian king
  Our offers now illustrious prince receive
  For such an aid what will not Argos give
  To conquer Troy with ours thy forces join
  And count Atrides fairest daughter thine
  Meantime on further methods to advise
  Come follow to the fleet thy new allies
  There hear what Greece has on her part to say
  He spoke and draggd the gory corse away
  This Asius viewd unable to contain
  Before his chariot warring on the plain
  His crowded coursers to his squire consignd
  Impatient panted on his neck behind
  To vengeance rising with a sudden spring
  He hoped the conquest of the Cretan king
  The wary Cretan as his foe drew near
  Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear
  Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide
  And glitterd extant at the further side
  As when the mountainoak or poplar tall
  Or pine fit mast for some great admiral
  Groans to the oftheaved axe with many a wound
  Then spreads a length of ruin oer the ground
  So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day
  And stretchd before his muchloved coursers lay
  He grinds the dust distaind with streaming gore
  And fierce in death lies foaming on the shore
  Deprived of motion stiff with stupid fear
  Stands all aghast his trembling charioteer
  Nor shuns the foe nor turns the steeds away
  But falls transfixd an unresisting prey
  Pierced by Antilochus he pants beneath
  The stately car and labours out his breath
  Thus Asius steeds their mighty master gone
  Remain the prize of Nestors youthful son

  Stabbd at the sight Deiphobus drew nigh
  And made with force the vengeful weapon fly
  The Cretan saw and stooping caused to glance
  From his slope shield the disappointed lance
  Beneath the spacious targe a blazing round
  Thick with bullhides and brazen orbits bound
  On his raised arm by two strong braces stayd
  He lay collected in defensive shade
  Oer his safe head the javelin idly sung
  And on the tinkling verge more faintly rung
  Even then the spear the vigorous arm confessd
  And pierced obliquely king Hypsenors breast
  Warmd in his liver to the ground it bore
  The chief his peoples guardian now no more

  Not unattended the proud Trojan cries
  Nor unrevenged lamented Asius lies
  For thee through hells black portals stand displayd
  This mate shall joy thy melancholy shade

  Heartpiercing anguish at the haughty boast
  Touchd every Greek but Nestors son the most
  Grieved as he was his pious arms attend
  And his broad buckler shields his slaughterd friend
  Till sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore
  His honourd body to the tented shore

  Nor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws
  Resolved to perish in his countrys cause
  Or find some foe whom heaven and he shall doom
  To wail his fate in deaths eternal gloom
  He sees Alcathous in the front aspire
  Great Ćsyetes was the heros sire
  His spouse Hippodame divinely fair
  Anchises eldest hope and darling care
  Who charmd her parents and her husbands heart
  With beauty sense and every work of art
  He once of Ilions youth the loveliest boy
  The fairest she of all the fair of Troy
  By Neptune now the hapless hero dies
  Who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes
  And fetters every limb yet bent to meet
  His fate he stands nor shuns the lance of Crete
  Fixd as some column or deeprooted oak
  While the winds sleep his breast received the stroke
  Before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields
  Long used to ward the death in fighting fields
  The riven armour sends a jarring sound
  His labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound
  The long lance shakes and vibrates in the wound
  Fast flowing from its source as prone he lay
  Lifes purple tide impetuous gushd away

  Then Idomen insulting oer the slain
  Behold Deiphobus nor vaunt in vain
  See on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend
  This my third victim to the shades I send
  Approaching now thy boasted might approve
  And try the prowess of the seed of Jove
  From Jove enamourd of a mortal dame
  Great Minos guardian of his country came
  Deucalion blameless prince was Minos heir
  His firstborn I the third from Jupiter
  Oer spacious Crete and her bold sons I reign
  And thence my ships transport me through the main
  Lord of a host oer all my host I shine
  A scourge to thee thy father and thy line

  The Trojan heard uncertain or to meet
  Alone with venturous arms the king of Crete
  Or seek auxiliar force at length decreed
  To call some hero to partake the deed
  Forthwith Ćneas rises to his thought
  For him in Troys remotest lines he sought
  Where he incensed at partial Priam stands
  And sees superior posts in meaner hands
  To him ambitious of so great an aid
  The bold Deiphobus approachd and said

  Now Trojan prince employ thy pious arms
  If eer thy bosom felt fair honours charms
  Alcathous dies thy brother and thy friend
  Come and the warriors loved remains defend
  Beneath his cares thy early youth was traind
  One table fed you and one roof containd
  This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe
  Haste and revenge it on th insulting foe

  Ćneas heard and for a space resignd
  To tender pity all his manly mind
  Then rising in his rage he burns to fight
  The Greek awaits him with collected might
  As the fell boar on some rough mountains head
  Armd with wild terrors and to slaughter bred
  When the loud rustics rise and shout from far
  Attends the tumult and expects the war
  Oer his bent back the bristly horrors rise
  Fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes
  His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage
  But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage
  So stood Idomeneus his javelin shook
  And met the Trojan with a lowering look
  Antilochus Deipyrus were near
  The youthful offspring of the god of war
  Merion and Aphareus in field renownd
  To these the warrior sent his voice around
  Fellows in arms your timely aid unite
  Lo great Ćneas rushes to the fight
  Sprung from a god and more than mortal bold
  He fresh in youth and I in arms grown old
  Else should this hand this hour decide the strife
  The great dispute of glory or of life

  He spoke and all as with one soul obeyd
  Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade
  Around the chief Ćneas too demands
  Th assisting forces of his native bands
  Paris Deiphobus Agenor join
  Coaids and captains of the Trojan line
  In order follow all th embodied train
  Like Idas flocks proceeding oer the plain
  Before his fleecy care erect and bold
  Stalks the proud ram the father of the bold
  With joy the swain surveys them as he leads
  To the cool fountains through the wellknown meads
  So joys Ćneas as his native band
  Moves on in rank and stretches oer the land

  Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose
  On every side the steely circle grows
  Now batterd breastplates and hackd helmets ring
  And oer their heads unheeded javelins sing
  Above the rest two towering chiefs appear
  There great Idomeneus Ćneas here
  Like gods of war dispensing fate they stood
  And burnd to drench the ground with mutual blood
  The Trojan weapon whizzd along in air
  The Cretan saw and shunnd the brazen spear
  Sent from an arm so strong the missive wood
  Stuck deep in earth and quiverd where it stood
  But OEnomas received the Cretans stroke
  The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke
  It rippd his belly with a ghastly wound
  And rolld the smoking entrails on the ground
  Stretchd on the plain he sobs away his breath
  And furious grasps the bloody dust in death
  The victor from his breast the weapon tears
  His spoils he could not for the shower of spears
  Though now unfit an active war to wage
  Heavy with cumbrous arms stiff with cold age
  His listless limbs unable for the course
  In standing fight he yet maintains his force
  Till faint with labour and by foes repelld
  His tired slow steps he drags from off the field
  Deiphobus beheld him as he passd
  And fired with hate a parting javelin cast
  The javelin errd but held its course along
  And pierced Ascalaphus the brave and young
  The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground
  And gnashd the dust all bloody with his wound

  Nor knew the furious father of his fall
  Highthroned amidst the great Olympian hall
  On golden clouds th immortal synod sate
  Detaind from bloody war by Jove and Fate

  Now where in dust the breathless hero lay
  For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray
  Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies
  And from his temples rends the glittering prize
  Valiant as Mars Meriones drew near
  And on his loaded arm discharged his spear
  He drops the weight disabled with the pain
  The hollow helmet rings against the plain
  Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey
  From his torn arm the Grecian rent away
  The reeking javelin and rejoind his friends
  His wounded brother good Polites tends
  Around his waist his pious arms he threw
  And from the rage of battle gently drew
  Him his swift coursers on his splendid car
  Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war
  To Troy they drove him groaning from the shore
  And sprinkling as he passd the sands with gore

  Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground
  Heaps fall on heaps and heaven and earth resound
  Bold Aphareus by great Ćneas bled
  As toward the chief he turnd his daring head
  He pierced his throat the bending head depressd
  Beneath his helmet nods upon his breast
  His shield reversed oer the fallen warrior lies
  And everlasting slumber seals his eyes
  Antilochus as Thoon turnd him round
  Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound
  The hollow vein that to the neck extends
  Along the chine his eager javelin rends
  Supine he falls and to his social train
  Spreads his imploring arms but spreads in vain
  Th exulting victor leaping where he lay
  From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away
  His time observed for closed by foes around
  On all sides thick the peals of arms resound
  His shield embossd the ringing storm sustains
  But he impervious and untouchd remains
  Great Neptunes care preserved from hostile rage
  This youth the joy of Nestors glorious age
  In arms intrepid with the first he fought
  Faced every foe and every danger sought
  His winged lance resistless as the wind
  Obeys each motion of the masters mind
  Restless it flies impatient to be free
  And meditates the distant enemy
  The son of Asius Adamas drew near
  And struck his target with the brazen spear
  Fierce in his front but Neptune wards the blow
  And blunts the javelin of th eluded foe
  In the broad buckler half the weapon stood
  Splinterd on earth flew half the broken wood
  Disarmd he mingled in the Trojan crew
  But Merions spear oertook him as he flew
  Deep in the bellys rim an entrance found
  Where sharp the pang and mortal is the wound
  Bending he fell and doubled to the ground
  Lay panting Thus an ox in fetters tied
  While deaths strong pangs distend his labouring side
  His bulk enormous on the field displays
  His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays
  The spear the conqueror from his body drew
  And deaths dim shadows swarm before his view
  Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid
  King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade
  And smote his temples with an arm so strong
  The helm fell off and rolld amid the throng
  There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize
  For dark in death the godlike owner lies
  Raging with grief great Menelaus burns
  And fraught with vengeance to the victor turns
  That shook the ponderous lance in act to throw
  And this stood adverse with the bended bow
  Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell
  But harmless bounded from the plated steel
  As on some ample barns well hardend floor
  The winds collected at each open door
  While the broad fan with force is whirld around
  Light leaps the golden grain resulting from the ground
  So from the steel that guards Atrides heart
  Repelld to distance flies the bounding dart
  Atrides watchful of the unwary foe
  Pierced with his lance the hand that graspd the bow
  And nailed it to the yew the wounded hand
  Traild the long lance that markd with blood the sand
  But good Agenor gently from the wound
  The spear solicits and the bandage bound
  A slings soft wool snatchd from a soldiers side
  At once the tent and ligature supplied

  Behold Pisander urged by fates decree
  Springs through the ranks to fall and fall by thee
  Great Menelaus to enchance thy fame
  Hightowering in the front the warrior came
  First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown
  The lance far distant by the winds was blown
  Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides shield
  Pisanders spear fell shiverd on the field
  Not so discouraged to the future blind
  Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind
  Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord
  Like lightning brandishd his far beaming sword
  His left arm high opposed the shining shield
  His right beneath the coverd poleaxe held
  An olives cloudy grain the handle made
  Distinct with studs and brazen was the blade
  This on the helm discharged a noble blow
  The plume droppd nodding to the plain below
  Shorn from the crest Atrides waved his steel
  Deep through his front the weighty falchion fell
  The crashing bones before its force gave way
  In dust and blood the groaning hero lay
  Forced from their ghastly orbs and spouting gore
  The clotted eyeballs tumble on the shore
  And fierce Atrides spurnd him as he bled
  Tore off his arms and loudexulting said

  Thus Trojans thus at length be taught to fear
  O race perfidious who delight in war
  Already noble deeds ye have performd
  A princess raped transcends a navy stormd
  In such bold feats your impious might approve
  Without th assistance or the fear of Jove
  The violated rites the ravishd dame
  Our heroes slaughterd and our ships on flame
  Crimes heapd on crimes shall bend your glory down
  And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town
  O thou great father lord of earth and skies
  Above the thought of man supremely wise
  If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow
  From whence this favour to an impious foe
  A godless crew abandond and unjust
  Still breathing rapine violence and lust
  The best of things beyond their measure cloy
  Sleeps balmy blessing loves endearing joy
  The feast the dance whateer mankind desire
  Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire
  But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight
  In thirst of slaughter and in lust of fight

  This said he seized while yet the carcase heaved
  The bloody armour which his train received
  Then sudden mixd among the warring crew
  And the bold son of Pylaemenes slew
  Harpalion had through Asia travelld far
  Following his martial father to the war
  Through filial love he left his native shore
  Never ah never to behold it more
  His unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling
  Against the target of the Spartan king
  Thus of his lance disarmd from death he flies
  And turns around his apprehensive eyes
  Him through the hip transpiercing as he fled
  The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead
  Beneath the bone the glancing point descends
  And driving down the swelling bladder rends
  Sunk in his sad companions arms he lay
  And in short pantings sobbd his soul away
  Like some vile worm extended on the ground
  While lifes red torrent gushd from out the wound

  Him on his car the Paphlagonian train
  In slow procession bore from off the plain
  The pensive father father now no more
  Attends the mournful pomp along the shore
  And unavailing tears profusely shed
  And unrevenged deplored his offspring dead

  Paris from far the moving sight beheld
  With pity softend and with fury swelld
  His honourd host a youth of matchless grace
  And loved of all the Paphlagonian race
  With his full strength he bent his angry bow
  And wingd the featherd vengeance at the foe
  A chief there was the brave Euchenor named
  For riches much and more for virtue famed
  Who held his seat in Corinths stately town
  Polydus son a seer of old renown
  Oft had the father told his early doom
  By arms abroad or slow disease at home
  He climbd his vessel prodigal of breath
  And chose the certain glorious path to death
  Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went
  The soul came issuing at the narrow vent
  His limbs unnerved drop useless on the ground
  And everlasting darkness shades him round

  Nor knew great Hector how his legions yield
  Wrappd in the cloud and tumult of the field
  Wide on the left the force of Greece commands
  And conquest hovers oer th Achaian bands
  With such a tide superior virtue swayd
  And he that shakes the solid earth gave aid
  But in the centre Hector fixd remaind
  Where first the gates were forced and bulwarks gaind
  There on the margin of the hoary deep
  Their naval station where the Ajaces keep
  And where low walls confine the beating tides
  Whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides
  Where late in fight both foot and horse engaged
  And all the thunder of the battle raged
  There joind the whole Boeotian strength remains
  The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains
  Locrians and Phthians and th Epaean force
  But joind repel not Hectors fiery course
  The flower of Athens Stichius Phidas led
  Bias and great Menestheus at their head
  Meges the strong the Epaean bands controlld
  And Dracius prudent and Amphion bold
  The Phthians Medon famed for martial might
  And brave Podarces active in the fight
  This drew from Phylacus his noble line
  Iphiclus son and that Oileus thine
  Young Ajax brother by a stolen embrace
  He dwelt far distant from his native place
  By his fierce stepdame from his fathers reign
  Expelld and exiled for her brother slain
  These rule the Phthians and their arms employ
  Mixd with Boeotians on the shores of Troy

  Now side by side with like unwearied care
  Each Ajax laboured through the field of war
  So when two lordly bulls with equal toil
  Force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil
  Joind to one yoke the stubborn earth they tear
  And trace large furrows with the shining share
  Oer their huge limbs the foam descends in snow
  And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow
  A train of heroes followed through the field
  Who bore by turns great Ajax sevenfold shield
  Wheneer he breathed remissive of his might
  Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight
  No following troops his brave associate grace
  In close engagement an unpractised race
  The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield
  Nor bear the helm nor lift the moony shield
  But skilld from far the flying shaft to wing
  Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling
  Dexterous with these they aim a certain wound
  Or fell the distant warrior to the ground
  Thus in the van the Telamonian train
  Throngd in bright arms a pressing fight maintain
  Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie
  Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky
  The mingled tempest on the foes they pour
  Troys scattering orders open to the shower

  Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquired
  And the galld Ilians to their walls retired
  But sage Polydamas discreetly brave
  Addressd great Hector and this counsel gave

  Though great in all thou seemst averse to lend
  Impartial audience to a faithful friend
  To gods and men thy matchless worth is known
  And every art of glorious war thy own
  But in cool thought and counsel to excel
  How widely differs this from warring well
  Content with what the bounteous gods have given
  Seek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven
  To some the powers of bloody war belong
  To some sweet music and the charm of song
  To few and wondrous few has Jove assignd
  A wise extensive allconsidering mind
  Their guardians these the nations round confess
  And towns and empires for their safety bless
  If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast
  Attend O Hector what I judge the best
  See as thou movst on dangers dangers spread
  And wars whole fury burns around thy head
  Behold distressd within yon hostile wall
  How many Trojans yield disperse or fall
  What troops outnumberd scarce the war maintain
  And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain
  Here cease thy fury and the chiefs and kings
  Convoked to council weigh the sum of things
  Whether the gods succeeding our desires
  To yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires
  Or quit the fleet and pass unhurt away
  Contented with the conquest of the day
  I fear I fear lest Greece not yet undone
  Pay the large debt of last revolving sun
  Achilles great Achilles yet remains
  On yonder decks and yet oerlooks the plains

  The counsel pleased and Hector with a bound
  Leapd from his chariot on the trembling ground
  Swift as he leapd his clanging arms resound
  To guard this post he cried thy art employ
  And here detain the scatterd youth of Troy
  Where yonder heroes faint I bend my way
  And hasten back to end the doubtful day

  This said the towering chief prepares to go
  Shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow
  And seems a moving mountain toppd with snow
  Through all his host inspiring force he flies
  And bids anew the martial thunder rise
  To Panthus son at Hectors high command
  Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band
  But round the battlements and round the plain
  For many a chief he lookd but lookd in vain
  Deiphobus nor Helenus the seer
  Nor Asius son nor Asius self appear
  For these were pierced with many a ghastly wound
  Some cold in death some groaning on the ground
  Some low in dust a mournful object lay
  High on the wall some breathed their souls away

  Far on the left amid the throng he found
  Cheering the troops and dealing deaths around
  The graceful Paris whom with fury moved
  Opprobrious thus th impatient chief reproved

  Illfated Paris slave to womankind
  As smooth of face as fraudulent of mind
  Where is Deiphobus where Asius gone
  The godlike father and th intrepid son
  The force of Helenus dispensing fate
  And great Othryoneus so feard of late
  Black fate hangs oer thee from th avenging gods
  Imperial Troy from her foundations nods
  Whelmd in thy countrys ruin shalt thou fall
  And one devouring vengeance swallow all

  When Paris thus My brother and my friend
  Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend
  In other battles I deserved thy blame
  Though then not deedless nor unknown to fame
  But since yon rampart by thy arms lay low
  I scatterd slaughter from my fatal bow
  The chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain
  Of all those heroes two alone remain
  Deiphobus and Helenus the seer
  Each now disabled by a hostile spear
  Go then successful where thy soul inspires
  This heart and hand shall second all thy fires
  What with this arm I can prepare to know
  Till death for death be paid and blow for blow
  But tis not ours with forces not our own
  To combat strength is of the gods alone
  These words the heros angry mind assuage
  Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage
  Around Polydamas distaind with blood
  Cebrion Phalces stern Orthaeus stood
  Palmus with Polypoetes the divine
  And two bold brothers of Hippotions line
  Who reachd fair Ilion from Ascania far
  The former day the next engaged in war
  As when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs
  That bears Joves thunder on its dreadful wings
  Wide oer the blasted fields the tempest sweeps
  Then gatherd settles on the hoary deeps
  The afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar
  The waves behind impel the waves before
  Wide rolling foaming high and tumbling to the shore
  Thus rank on rank the thick battalions throng
  Chief urged on chief and man drove man along
  Far oer the plains in dreadful order bright
  The brazen arms reflect a beamy light
  Full in the blazing van great Hector shined
  Like Mars commissiond to confound mankind
  Before him flaming his enormous shield
  Like the broad sun illumined all the field
  His nodding helm emits a streamy ray
  His piercing eyes through all the battle stray
  And while beneath his targe he flashd along
  Shot terrors round that witherd een the strong

  Thus stalkd he dreadful death was in his look
  Whole nations feard but not an Argive shook
  The towering Ajax with an ample stride
  Advanced the first and thus the chief defied

  Hector come on thy empty threats forbear
  Tis not thy arm tis thundering Jove we fear
  The skill of war to us not idly given
  Lo Greece is humbled not by Troy but Heaven
  Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts
  To force our fleet the Greeks have hands and hearts
  Long ere in flames our lofty navy fall
  Your boasted city and your godbuilt wall
  Shall sink beneath us smoking on the ground
  And spread a long unmeasured ruin round
  The time shall come when chased along the plain
  Even thou shalt call on Jove and call in vain
  Even thou shalt wish to aid thy desperate course
  The wings of falcons for thy flying horse
  Shalt run forgetful of a warriors fame
  While clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame

  As thus he spoke behold in open view
  On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew
  To Joves glad omen all the Grecians rise
  And hail with shouts his progress through the skies
  Farechoing clamours bound from side to side
  They ceased and thus the chief of Troy replied

  From whence this menace this insulting strain
  Enormous boaster doomd to vaunt in vain
  So may the gods on Hector life bestow
  Not that short life which mortals lead below
  But such as those of Joves high lineage born
  The blueeyed maid or he that gilds the morn
  As this decisive day shall end the fame
  Of Greece and Argos be no more a name
  And thou imperious if thy madness wait
  The lance of Hector thou shalt meet thy fate
  That giantcorse extended on the shore
  Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore

  He said and like a lion stalkd along
  With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung
  Sent from his following host the Grecian train
  With answering thunders filld the echoing plain
  A shout that tore heavens concave and above
  Shook the fixd splendours of the throne of Jove

ARGUMENT231

JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS

Nestor sitting at the table with Machaon is alarmed with the increasing
clamour of war and hastens to Agamemnon on his way he meets that prince
with Diomed and Ulysses whom he informs of the extremity of the danger
Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night which Ulysses
withstands to which Diomed adds his advice that wounded as they were
they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence which
advice is pursued Juno seeing the partiality of Jupiter to the Trojans
forms a design to overreach him she sets off her charms with the utmost
care and the more surely to enchant him obtains the magic girdle of
Venus She then applies herself to the god of sleep and with some
difficulty persuades him to seal the eyes of Jupiter this done she goes
to mount Ida where the god at first sight is ravished with her beauty
sinks in her embraces and is laid asleep Neptune takes advantage of his
slumber and succours the Greeks Hector is struck to the ground with a
prodigious stone by Ajax and carried off from the battle several actions
succeed till the Trojans much distressed are obliged to give way the
lesser Ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner

  But not the genial feast nor flowing bowl
  Could charm the cares of Nestors watchful soul
  His startled ears the increasing cries attend
  Then thus impatient to his wounded friend

  What new alarm divine Machaon say
  What mixd events attend this mighty day
  Hark how the shouts divide and how they meet
  And now come full and thicken to the fleet
  Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care
  Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare
  Refresh thy wound and cleanse the clotted gore
  While I the adventures of the day explore

  He said and seizing Thrasymedes shield
  His valiant offspring hastend to the field
  That day the son his fathers buckler bore
  Then snatchd a lance and issued from the door
  Soon as the prospect opend to his view
  His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew
  Dire disarray the tumult of the fight
  The wall in ruins and the Greeks in flight
  As when old oceans silent surface sleeps
  The waves just heaving on the purple deeps
  While yet the expected tempest hangs on high
  Weighs down the cloud and blackens in the sky
  The mass of waters will no wind obey
  Jove sends one gust and bids them roll away
  While wavering counsels thus his mind engage
  Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage
  To join the host or to the general haste
  Debating long he fixes on the last
  Yet as he moves the sight his bosom warms
  The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms
  The gleaming falchions flash the javelins fly
  Blows echo blows and all or kill or die

  Him in his march the wounded princes meet
  By tardy steps ascending from the fleet
  The king of men Ulysses the divine
  And who to Tydeus owes his noble line232
  Their ships at distance from the battle stand
  In lines advanced along the shelving strand
  Whose bay the fleet unable to contain
  At length beside the margin of the main
  Rank above rank the crowded ships they moor
  Who landed first lay highest on the shore
  Supported on the spears they took their way
  Unfit to fight but anxious for the day
  Nestors approach alarmd each Grecian breast
  Whom thus the general of the host addressd

  O grace and glory of the Achaian name
  What drives thee Nestor from the field of fame
  Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfilld
  Our fleets in ashes and our heroes killd
  Such was his threat ah now too soon made good
  On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood
  Is every heart inflamed with equal rage
  Against your king nor will one chief engage
  And have I lived to see with mournful eyes
  In every Greek a new Achilles rise

  Gerenian Nestor then So fate has willd
  And allconfirming time has fate fulfilld
  Not he that thunders from the aerial bower
  Not Jove himself upon the past has power
  The wall our late inviolable bound
  And best defence lies smoking on the ground
  Even to the ships their conquering arms extend
  And groans of slaughterd Greeks to heaven ascend
  On speedy measures then employ your thought
  In such distress if counsel profit aught
  Arms cannot much though Mars our souls incite
  These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight

  To him the monarch That our army bends
  That Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends
  And that the rampart late our surest trust
  And best defence lies smoking in the dust
  All this from Joves afflictive hand we bear
  Who far from Argos wills our ruin here
  Past are the days when happier Greece was blest
  And all his favour all his aid confessd
  Now heaven averse our hands from battle ties
  And lifts the Trojan glory to the skies
  Cease we at length to waste our blood in vain
  And launch what ships lie nearest to the main
  Leave these at anchor till the coming night
  Then if impetuous Troy forbear the fight
  Bring all to sea and hoist each sail for flight
  Better from evils well foreseen to run
  Than perish in the danger we may shun

  Thus he The sage Ulysses thus replies
  While anger flashd from his disdainful eyes
  What shameful words unkingly as thou art
  Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart
  Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers
  And thou the shame of any host but ours
  A host by Jove endued with martial might
  And taught to conquer or to fall in fight
  Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage
  Employd our youth and yet employs our age
  And wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain
  And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain
  In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear
  Speak it in whispers lest a Greek should hear
  Lives there a man so dead to fame who dares
  To think such meanness or the thought declares
  And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway
  The banded legions of all Greece obey
  Is this a generals voice that calls to flight
  While war hangs doubtful while his soldiers fight
  What more could Troy What yet their fate denies
  Thou givest the foe all Greece becomes their prize
  No more the troops our hoisted sails in view
  Themselves abandond shall the fight pursue
  But thy ships flying with despair shall see
  And owe destruction to a prince like thee

  Thy just reproofs Atrides calm replies
  Like arrows pierce me for thy words are wise
  Unwilling as I am to lose the host
  I force not Greece to quit this hateful coast
  Glad I submit whoeer or young or old
  Aught more conducive to our weal unfold

  Tydides cut him short and thus began
  Such counsel if you seek behold the man
  Who boldly gives it and what he shall say
  Young though he be disdain not to obey
  A youth who from the mighty Tydeus springs
  May speak to councils and assembled kings
  Hear then in me the great OEnides son
  Whose honoured dust his race of glory run
  Lies whelmd in ruins of the Theban wall
  Brave in his life and glorious in his fall
  With three bold sons was generous Prothous blessd
  Who Pleurons walls and Calydon possessd
  Melas and Agrius but who far surpassd
  The rest in courage OEneus was the last
  From him my sire From Calydon expelld
  He passd to Argos and in exile dwelld
  The monarchs daughter there so Jove ordaind
  He won and flourishd where Adrastus reignd
  There rich in fortunes gifts his acres tilld
  Beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield
  And numerous flocks that whitend all the field
  Such Tydeus was the foremost once in fame
  Nor lives in Greece a stranger to his name
  Then what for common good my thoughts inspire
  Attend and in the son respect the sire
  Though sore of battle though with wounds oppressd
  Let each go forth and animate the rest
  Advance the glory which he cannot share
  Though not partaker witness of the war
  But lest new wounds on wounds oerpower us quite
  Beyond the missile javelins sounding flight
  Safe let us stand and from the tumult far
  Inspire the ranks and rule the distant war

  He added not the listening kings obey
  Slow moving on Atrides leads the way
  The god of ocean to inflame their rage
  Appears a warrior furrowed oer with age
  Pressd in his own the generals hand he took
  And thus the venerable hero spoke

  Atrides lo with what disdainful eye
  Achilles sees his countrys forces fly
  Blind impious man whose anger is his guide
  Who glories in unutterable pride
  So may he perish so may Jove disclaim
  The wretch relentless and oerwhelm with shame
  But Heaven forsakes not thee oer yonder sands
  Soon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands
  Fly diverse while proud kings and chiefs renownd
  Driven heaps on heaps with clouds involved around
  Of rolling dust their winged wheels employ
  To hide their ignominious heads in Troy

  He spoke then rushd amid the warrior crew
  And sent his voice before him as he flew
  Loud as the shout encountering armies yield
  When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field
  Such was the voice and such the thundering sound
  Of him whose trident rends the solid ground
  Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight
  And grisly war appears a pleasing sight

  Meantime Saturnia from Olympus brow
  Highthroned in gold beheld the fields below
  With joy the glorious conflict she surveyd
  Where her great brother gave the Grecians aid
  But placed aloft on Idas shady height
  She sees her Jove and trembles at the sight
  Jove to deceive what methods shall she try
  What arts to blind his allbeholding eye
  At length she trusts her power resolved to prove
  The old yet still successful cheat of love
  Against his wisdom to oppose her charms
  And lull the lord of thunders in her arms

  Swift to her bright apartment she repairs
  Sacred to dress and beautys pleasing cares
  With skill divine had Vulcan formd the bower
  Safe from access of each intruding power
  Touchd with her secret key the doors unfold
  Selfclosed behind her shut the valves of gold
  Here first she bathes and round her body pours
  Soft oils of fragrance and ambrosial showers
  The winds perfumed the balmy gale convey
  Through heaven through earth and all the aerial way
  Spirit divine whose exhalation greets
  The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets
  Thus while she breathed of heaven with decent pride
  Her artful hands the radiant tresses tied
  Part on her head in shining ringlets rolld
  Part oer her shoulders waved like melted gold
  Around her next a heavenly mantle flowd
  That rich with Pallas labourd colours glowd
  Large clasps of gold the foldings gatherd round
  A golden zone her swelling bosom bound
  Farbeaming pendants tremble in her ear
  Each gem illumined with a triple star
  Then oer her head she cast a veil more white
  Than newfallen snow and dazzling as the light
  Last her fair feet celestial sandals grace
  Thus issuing radiant with majestic pace
  Forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves
  And calls the mother of the smiles and loves

  How long to Venus thus apart she cried
  Shall human strife celestial minds divide
  Ah yet will Venus aid Saturnias joy
  And set aside the cause of Greece and Troy

  Let heavens dread empress Cytheraea said
  Speak her request and deem her will obeyd

  Then grant me said the queen those conquering charms
  That power which mortals and immortals warms
  That love which melts mankind in fierce desires
  And burns the sons of heaven with sacred fires

  For lo I haste to those remote abodes
  Where the great parents sacred source of gods
  Ocean and Tethys their old empire keep
  On the last limits of the land and deep
  In their kind arms my tender years were past
  What time old Saturn from Olympus cast
  Of upper heaven to Jove resignd the reign
  Whelmd under the huge mass of earth and main
  For strife I hear has made the union cease
  Which held so long that ancient pair in peace
  What honour and what love shall I obtain
  If I compose those fatal feuds again
  Once more their minds in mutual ties engage
  And what my youth has owed repay their age

  She said With awe divine the queen of love
  Obeyd the sister and the wife of Jove
  And from her fragrant breast the zone embraced233
  With various skill and high embroidery graced
  In this was every art and every charm
  To win the wisest and the coldest warm
  Fond love the gentle vow the gay desire
  The kind deceit the stillreviving fire
  Persuasive speech and the more persuasive sighs
  Silence that spoke and eloquence of eyes
  This on her hand the Cyprian Goddess laid
  Take this and with it all thy wish she said
  With smiles she took the charm and smiling pressd
  The powerful cestus to her snowy breast

  Then Venus to the courts of Jove withdrew
  Whilst from Olympus pleased Saturnia flew
  Oer high Pieria thence her course she bore
  Oer fair Emathias everpleasing shore
  Oer Hemus hills with snows eternal crownd
  Nor once her flying foot approachd the ground
  Then taking wing from Athos lofty steep
  She speeds to Lemnos oer the rolling deep
  And seeks the cave of Deaths halfbrother Sleep234

  Sweet pleasing Sleep Saturnia thus began
  Who spreadst thy empire oer each god and man
  If eer obsequious to thy Junos will
  O power of slumbers hear and favour still
  Shed thy soft dews on Joves immortal eyes
  While sunk in loves entrancing joys he lies
  A splendid footstool and a throne that shine
  With gold unfading Somnus shall be thine
  The work of Vulcan to indulge thy ease
  When wine and feasts thy golden humours please

  Imperial dame the balmy power replies
  Great Saturns heir and empress of the skies
  Oer other gods I spread my easy chain
  The sire of all old Ocean owns my reign
  And his hushd waves lie silent on the main
  But how unbidden shall I dare to steep
  Joves awful temples in the dew of sleep
  Long since too venturous at thy bold command
  On those eternal lids I laid my hand
  What time deserting Ilions wasted plain
  His conquering son Alcides ploughd the main
  When lo the deeps arise the tempests roar
  And drive the hero to the Coan shore
  Great Jove awaking shook the blest abodes
  With rising wrath and tumbled gods on gods
  Me chief he sought and from the realms on high
  Had hurld indignant to the nether sky
  But gentle Night to whom I fled for aid
  The friend of earth and heaven her wings displayd
  Impowerd the wrath of gods and men to tame
  Even Jove revered the venerable dame

  Vain are thy fears the queen of heaven replies
  And speaking rolls her large majestic eyes
  Thinkst thou that Troy has Joves high favour won
  Like great Alcides his allconquering son
  Hear and obey the mistress of the skies
  Nor for the deed expect a vulgar prize
  For know thy lovedone shall be ever thine
  The youngest Grace Pasithae the divine235

  Swear then he said by those tremendous floods
  That roar through hell and bind the invoking gods
  Let the great parent earth one hand sustain
  And stretch the other oer the sacred main
  Call the black Titans that with Chronos dwell
  To hear and witness from the depths of hell
  That she my lovedone shall be ever mine
  The youngest Grace Pasithae the divine

  The queen assents and from the infernal bowers
  Invokes the sable subtartarean powers
  And those who rule the inviolable floods
  Whom mortals name the dread Titanian gods

                SLEEP ESCAPING FROM THE WRATH OF JUPITER


  Then swift as wind oer Lemnos smoky isle
  They wing their way and Imbrus seabeat soil
  Through air unseen involved in darkness glide
  And light on Lectos on the point of Ide
  Mother of savages whose echoing hills
  Are heard resounding with a hundred rills
  Fair Ida trembles underneath the god
  Hushd are her mountains and her forests nod
  There on a fir whose spiry branches rise
  To join its summit to the neighbouring skies
  Dark in embowering shade conceald from sight
  Sat Sleep in likeness of the bird of night
  Chalcis his name by those of heavenly birth
  But calld Cymindis by the race of earth

  To Idas top successful Juno flies
  Great Jove surveys her with desiring eyes
  The god whose lightning sets the heavens on fire
  Through all his bosom feels the fierce desire
  Fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charms
  Mixd with her soul and melted in her arms
  Fixd on her eyes he fed his eager look
  Then pressd her hand and thus with transport spoke

  Why comes my goddess from the ethereal sky
  And not her steeds and flaming chariot nigh

  Then sheI haste to those remote abodes
  Where the great parents of the deathless gods
  The reverend Ocean and gray Tethys reign
  On the last limits of the land and main
  I visit these to whose indulgent cares
  I owe the nursing of my tender years
  For strife I hear has made that union cease
  Which held so long that ancient pair in peace
  The steeds prepared my chariot to convey
  Oer earth and seas and through the aerial way
  Wait under Ide of thy superior power
  To ask consent I leave the Olympian bower
  Nor seek unknown to thee the sacred cells
  Deep under seas where hoary Ocean dwells

  For that said Jove suffice another day
  But eager love denies the least delay
  Let softer cares the present hour employ
  And be these moments sacred all to joy
  Neer did my soul so strong a passion prove
  Or for an earthly or a heavenly love
  Not when I pressd Ixions matchless dame
  Whence rose Pirithous like the gods in fame
  Not when fair Danae felt the shower of gold
  Stream into life whence Perseus brave and bold
  Not thus I burnd for either Theban dame
  Bacchus from this from that Alcides came
  Nor Phoenix daughter beautiful and young
  Whence godlike Rhadamanth and Minos sprung236
  Not thus I burnd for fair Latonas face
  Nor comelier Ceres more majestic grace
  Not thus even for thyself I felt desire
  As now my veins receive the pleasing fire

  He spoke the goddess with the charming eyes
  Glows with celestial red and thus replies
  Is this a scene for love On Idas height
  Exposed to mortal and immortal sight
  Our joys profaned by each familiar eye
  The sport of heaven and fable of the sky
  How shall I eer review the blest abodes
  Or mix among the senate of the gods
  Shall I not think that with disorderd charms
  All heaven beholds me recent from thy arms
  With skill divine has Vulcan formd thy bower
  Sacred to love and to the genial hour
  If such thy will to that recess retire
  In secret there indulge thy soft desire

  She ceased and smiling with superior love
  Thus answerd mild the cloudcompelling Jove
  Nor god nor mortal shall our joys behold
  Shaded with clouds and circumfused in gold
  Not even the sun who darts through heaven his rays
  And whose broad eye the extended earth surveys

  Gazing he spoke and kindling at the view
  His eager arms around the goddess threw
  Glad Earth perceives and from her bosom pours
  Unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers
  Thick newborn violets a soft carpet spread
  And clustering lotos swelld the rising bed
  And sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow237
  And flamy crocus made the mountain glow
  There golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair
  Steepd in soft joys and circumfused with air
  Celestial dews descending oer the ground
  Perfume the mount and breathe ambrosia round
  At length with love and sleeps soft power oppressd
  The panting thunderer nods and sinks to rest

  Now to the navy borne on silent wings
  To Neptunes ear soft Sleep his message brings
  Beside him sudden unperceived he stood
  And thus with gentle words addressd the god

  Now Neptune now the important hour employ
  To check a while the haughty hopes of Troy
  While Jove yet rests while yet my vapours shed
  The golden vision round his sacred head
  For Junos love and Somnus pleasing ties
  Have closed those awful and eternal eyes
  Thus having said the power of slumber flew
  On human lids to drop the balmy dew
  Neptune with zeal increased renews his care
  And towering in the foremost ranks of war
  Indignant thusOh once of martial fame
  O Greeks if yet ye can deserve the name
  This halfrecoverd day shall Troy obtain
  Shall Hector thunder at your ships again
  Lo still he vaunts and threats the fleet with fires
  While stern Achilles in his wrath retires
  One heros loss too tamely you deplore
  Be still yourselves and ye shall need no more
  Oh yet if glory any bosom warms
  Brace on your firmest helms and stand to arms
  His strongest spear each valiant Grecian wield
  Each valiant Grecian seize his broadest shield
  Let to the weak the lighter arms belong
  The ponderous targe be wielded by the strong
  Thus armd not Hector shall our presence stay
  Myself ye Greeks myself will lead the way

                      Illustration GREEK SHIELD

                              GREEK SHIELD


  The troops assent their martial arms they change
  The busy chiefs their banded legions range
  The kings though wounded and oppressd with pain
  With helpful hands themselves assist the train
  The strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield
  The weaker warrior takes a lighter shield
  Thus sheathd in shining brass in bright array
  The legions march and Neptune leads the way
  His brandishd falchion flames before their eyes
  Like lightning flashing through the frighted skies
  Clad in his might the earthshaking power appears
  Pale mortals tremble and confess their fears

  Troys great defender stands alone unawed
  Arms his proud host and dares oppose a god
  And lo the god and wondrous man appear
  The seas stern ruler there and Hector here
  The roaring main at her great masters call
  Rose in huge ranks and formd a watery wall
  Around the ships seas hanging oer the shores
  Both armies join earth thunders ocean roars
  Not half so loud the bellowing deeps resound
  When stormy winds disclose the dark profound
  Less loud the winds that from the Ćolian hall
  Roar through the woods and make whole forests fall
  Less loud the woods when flames in torrents pour
  Catch the dry mountain and its shades devour
  With such a rage the meeting hosts are driven
  And such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven
  The first bold javelin urged by Hectors force
  Direct at Ajax bosom winged its course
  But there no pass the crossing belts afford
  One braced his shield and one sustaind his sword
  Then back the disappointed Trojan drew
  And cursed the lance that unavailing flew
  But scaped not Ajax his tempestuous hand
  A ponderous stone upheaving from the sand
  Where heaps laid loose beneath the warriors feet
  Or served to ballast or to prop the fleet
  Tossd round and round the missive marble flings
  On the razed shield the fallen ruin rings
  Full on his breast and throat with force descends
  Nor deadend there its giddy fury spends
  But whirling on with many a fiery round
  Smokes in the dust and ploughs into the ground
  As when the bolt redhissing from above
  Darts on the consecrated plant of Jove
  The mountainoak in flaming ruin lies
  Black from the blow and smokes of sulphur rise
  Stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand
  And own the terrors of the almighty hand
  So lies great Hector prostrate on the shore
  His slackend hand deserts the lance it bore
  His following shield the fallen chief oerspread
  Beneath his helmet droppd his fainting head
  His load of armour sinking to the ground
  Clanks on the field a dead and hollow sound
  Loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain
  Greece sees in hope Troys great defender slain
  All spring to seize him storms of arrows fly
  And thicker javelins intercept the sky
  In vain an iron tempest hisses round
  He lies protected and without a wound238
  Polydamas Agenor the divine
  The pious warrior of Anchises line
  And each bold leader of the Lycian band
  With covering shields a friendly circle stand
  His mournful followers with assistant care
  The groaning hero to his chariot bear
  His foaming coursers swifter than the wind
  Speed to the town and leave the war behind

  When now they touchd the meads enamelld side
  Where gentle Xanthus rolls his easy tide
  With watery drops the chief they sprinkle round
  Placed on the margin of the flowery ground
  Raised on his knees he now ejects the gore
  Now faints anew lowsinking on the shore
  By fits he breathes half views the fleeting skies
  And seals again by fits his swimming eyes

  Soon as the Greeks the chiefs retreat beheld
  With double fury each invades the field
  Oilean Ajax first his javelin sped
  Pierced by whose point the son of Enops bled
  Satnius the brave whom beauteous Neis bore
  Amidst her flocks on Satnios silver shore
  Struck through the bellys rim the warrior lies
  Supine and shades eternal veil his eyes
  An arduous battle rose around the dead
  By turns the Greeks by turns the Trojans bled

  Fired with revenge Polydamas drew near
  And at Prothoenor shook the trembling spear
  The driving javelin through his shoulder thrust
  He sinks to earth and grasps the bloody dust
  Lo thus the victor cries we rule the field
  And thus their arms the race of Panthus wield
  From this unerring hand there flies no dart
  But bathes its point within a Grecian heart
  Proppd on that spear to which thou owest thy fall
  Go guide thy darksome steps to Plutos dreary hall

  He said and sorrow touchd each Argive breast
  The soul of Ajax burnd above the rest
  As by his side the groaning warrior fell
  At the fierce foe he launchd his piercing steel
  The foe reclining shunnd the flying death
  But fate Archilochus demands thy breath
  Thy lofty birth no succour could impart
  The wings of death oertook thee on the dart
  Swift to perform heavens fatal will it fled
  Full on the juncture of the neck and head
  And took the joint and cut the nerves in twain
  The dropping head first tumbled on the plain
  So just the stroke that yet the body stood
  Erect then rolld along the sands in blood

  Here proud Polydamas here turn thy eyes
  The towering Ajax loudinsulting cries
  Say is this chief extended on the plain
  A worthy vengeance for Prothoenor slain
  Mark well his port his figure and his face
  Nor speak him vulgar nor of vulgar race
  Some lines methinks may make his lineage known
  Antenors brother or perhaps his son

  He spake and smiled severe for well he knew
  The bleeding youth Troy saddend at the view
  But furious Acamas avenged his cause
  As Promachus his slaughtered brother draws
  He pierced his heartSuch fate attends you all
  Proud Argives destined by our arms to fall
  Not Troy alone but haughty Greece shall share
  The toils the sorrows and the wounds of war
  Behold your Promachus deprived of breath
  A victim owed to my brave brothers death
  Not unappeased he enters Plutos gate
  Who leaves a brother to revenge his fate

  Heartpiercing anguish struck the Grecian host
  But touchd the breast of bold Peneleus most
  At the proud boaster he directs his course
  The boaster flies and shuns superior force
  But young Ilioneus received the spear
  Ilioneus his fathers only care
  Phorbas the rich of all the Trojan train
  Whom Hermes loved and taught the arts of gain
  Full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall
  And from the fibres scoopd the rooted ball
  Drove through the neck and hurld him to the plain
  He lifts his miserable arms in vain
  Swift his broad falchion fierce Peneleus spread
  And from the spouting shoulders struck his head
  To earth at once the head and helmet fly
  The lance yet sticking through the bleeding eye
  The victor seized and as aloft he shook
  The gory visage thus insulting spoke

  Trojans your great Ilioneus behold
  Haste to his father let the tale be told
  Let his high roofs resound with frantic woe
  Such as the house of Promachus must know
  Let doleful tidings greet his mothers ear
  Such as to Promachus sad spouse we bear
  When we victorious shall to Greece return
  And the pale matron in our triumphs mourn

  Dreadful he spoke then tossd the head on high
  The Trojans hear they tremble and they fly
  Aghast they gaze around the fleet and wall
  And dread the ruin that impends on all

ARGUMENT

THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS AND THE ACTS OF AJAX

Jupiter awaking sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches Hector in a
swoon and Neptune at the head of the Greeks he is highly incensed at the
artifice of Juno who appeases him by her submissions she is then sent to
Iris and Apollo Juno repairing to the assembly of the gods attempts
with extraordinary address to incense them against Jupiter in particular
she touches Mars with a violent resentment he is ready to take arms but
is prevented by Minerva Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter Iris
commands Neptune to leave the battle to which after much reluctance and
passion he consents Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour brings him
back to the battle marches before him with his aegis and turns the
fortune of the fight He breaks down great part of the Grecian wall the
Trojans rush in and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet but are
as yet repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter

  Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound
  And many a chief lay gasping on the ground
  Then stoppd and panted where the chariots lie
  Fear on their cheek and horror in their eye
  Meanwhile awakend from his dream of love
  On Idas summit sat imperial Jove
  Round the wide fields he cast a careful view
  There saw the Trojans fly the Greeks pursue
  These proud in arms those scatterd oer the plain
  And midst the war the monarch of the main
  Not far great Hector on the dust he spies
  His sad associates round with weeping eyes
  Ejecting blood and panting yet for breath
  His senses wandering to the verge of death
  The god beheld him with a pitying look
  And thus incensed to fraudful Juno spoke

  O thou still adverse to the eternal will
  For ever studious in promoting ill
  Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield
  And driven his conquering squadrons from the field
  Canst thou unhappy in thy wiles withstand
  Our power immense and brave the almighty hand
  Hast thou forgot when bound and fixd on high
  From the vast concave of the spangled sky
  I hung thee trembling in a golden chain
  And all the raging gods opposed in vain
  Headlong I hurld them from the Olympian hall
  Stunnd in the whirl and breathless with the fall
  For godlike Hercules these deeds were done
  Nor seemd the vengeance worthy such a son
  When by thy wiles induced fierce Boreas tossd
  The shipwreckd hero on the Coan coast
  Him through a thousand forms of death I bore
  And sent to Argos and his native shore
  Hear this remember and our fury dread
  Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head
  Lest arts and blandishments successless prove
  Thy soft deceits and welldissembled love

  The Thunderer spoke imperial Juno mournd
  And trembling these submissive words returnd

  By every oath that powers immortal ties
  The foodful earth and allinfolding skies
  By thy black waves tremendous Styx that flow
  Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below
  By the dread honours of thy sacred head
  And that unbroken vow our virgin bed
  Not by my arts the ruler of the main
  Steeps Troy in blood and ranges round the plain
  By his own ardour his own pity swayd
  To help his Greeks he fought and disobeyd
  Else had thy Juno better counsels given
  And taught submission to the sire of heaven

  Thinkst thou with me fair empress of the skies
  The immortal father with a smile replies
  Then soon the haughty seagod shall obey
  Nor dare to act but when we point the way
  If truth inspires thy tongue proclaim our will
  To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill
  Our high decree let various Iris know
  And call the god that bears the silver bow
  Let her descend and from the embattled plain
  Command the seagod to his watery reign
  While Phoebus hastes great Hector to prepare
  To rise afresh and once more wake the war
  His labouring bosom reinspires with breath
  And calls his senses from the verge of death
  Greece chased by Troy even to Achilles fleet
  Shall fall by thousands at the heros feet
  He not untouchd with pity to the plain
  Shall send Patroclus but shall send in vain
  What youths he slaughters under Ilions walls
  Even my loved son divine Sarpedon falls
  Vanquishd at last by Hectors lance he lies
  Then nor till then shall great Achilles rise
  And lo that instant godlike Hector dies
  From that great hour the wars whole fortune turns
  Pallas assists and lofty Ilion burns
  Not till that day shall Jove relax his rage
  Nor one of all the heavenly host engage
  In aid of Greece The promise of a god
  I gave and seald it with the almighty nod
  Achilles glory to the stars to raise
  Such was our word and fate the word obeys

  The trembling queen the almighty order given
  Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven
  As some wayfaring man who wanders oer
  In thought a length of lands he trod before
  Sends forth his active mind from place to place
  Joins hill to dale and measures space with space
  So swift flew Juno to the blessd abodes
  If thought of man can match the speed of gods
  There sat the powers in awful synod placed
  They bowd and made obeisance as she passd
  Through all the brazen dome with goblets crownd239
  They hail her queen the nectar streams around
  Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl
  And anxious asks what cares disturb her soul

  To whom the whitearmd goddess thus replies
  Enough thou knowst the tyrant of the skies
  Severely bent his purpose to fulfil
  Unmoved his mind and unrestraind his will
  Go thou the feasts of heaven attend thy call
  Bid the crownd nectar circle round the hall
  But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome
  Such stern decrees such threatend woes to come
  As soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise
  And damp the eternal banquets of the skies

  The goddess said and sullen took her place
  Black horror saddend each celestial face
  To see the gathering grudge in every breast
  Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy expressd
  While on her wrinkled front and eyebrow bent
  Sat stedfast care and lowering discontent
  Thus she proceedsAttend ye powers above
  But know tis madness to contest with Jove
  Supreme he sits and sees in pride of sway
  Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey
  Fierce in the majesty of power controls
  Shakes all the thrones of heaven and bends the poles
  Submiss immortals all he wills obey
  And thou great Mars begin and show the way
  Behold Ascalaphus behold him die
  But dare not murmur dare not vent a sigh
  Thy own loved boasted offspring lies oerthrown
  If that loved boasted offspring be thy own

  Stern Mars with anguish for his slaughterd son
  Smote his rebelling breast and fierce begun
  Thus then immortals thus shall Mars obey
  Forgive me gods and yield my vengeance way
  Descending first to yon forbidden plain
  The god of battles dares avenge the slain
  Dares though the thunder bursting oer my head
  Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead

  With that he gives command to Fear and Flight
  To join his rapid coursers for the fight
  Then grim in arms with hasty vengeance flies
  Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies
  And now had Jove by bold rebellion driven
  Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven
  But Pallas springing through the bright abode
  Starts from her azure throne to calm the god
  Struck for the immortal race with timely fear
  From frantic Mars she snatchd the shield and spear
  Then the huge helmet lifting from his head
  Thus to the impetuous homicide she said

  By what wild passion furious art thou tossd
  Strivst thou with Jove thou art already lost
  Shall not the Thunderers dread command restrain
  And was imperial Juno heard in vain
  Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven
  And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven
  Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage
  The skies would yield an ampler scene of rage
  Guilty and guiltless find an equal fate
  And one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state
  Cease then thy offsprings death unjust to call
  Heroes as great have died and yet shall fall
  Why should heavens law with foolish man comply
  Exempted from the race ordaind to die

  This menace fixd the warrior to his throne
  Sullen he sat and curbd the rising groan
  Then Juno calld Joves orders to obey
  The winged Iris and the god of day
  Go wait the Thunderers will Saturnia cried
  On yon tall summit of the fountful Ide
  There in the fathers awful presence stand
  Receive and execute his dread command

  She said and sat the god that gilds the day
  And various Iris wing their airy way
  Swift as the wind to Idas hills they came
  Fair nurse of fountains and of savage game
  There sat the eternal he whose nod controls
  The trembling world and shakes the steady poles
  Veild in a mist of fragrance him they found
  With clouds of gold and purple circled round
  Wellpleased the Thunderer saw their earnest care
  And prompt obedience to the queen of air
  Then while a smile serenes his awful brow
  Commands the goddess of the showery bow

  Iris descend and what we here ordain
  Report to yon mad tyrant of the main
  Bid him from fight to his own deeps repair
  Or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air
  If he refuse then let him timely weigh
  Our elder birthright and superior sway
  How shall his rashness stand the dire alarms
  If heavens omnipotence descend in arms
  Strives he with me by whom his power was given
  And is there equal to the lord of heaven

  The allmighty spoke the goddess wingd her flight
  To sacred Ilion from the Idaean height
  Swift as the rattling hail or fleecy snows
  Drive through the skies when Boreas fiercely blows
  So from the clouds descending Iris falls
  And to blue Neptune thus the goddess calls

  Attend the mandate of the sire above
  In me behold the messenger of Jove
  He bids thee from forbidden wars repair
  To thine own deeps or to the fields of air
  This if refused he bids thee timely weigh
  His elder birthright and superior sway
  How shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms
  If heavens omnipotence descend in arms
  Strivst thou with him by whom all power is given
  And art thou equal to the lord of heaven

  What means the haughty sovereign of the skies
  The king of ocean thus incensed replies
  Rule as he will his portiond realms on high
  No vassal god nor of his train am I
  Three brother deities from Saturn came
  And ancient Rhea earths immortal dame
  Assignd by lot our triple rule we know
  Infernal Pluto sways the shades below
  Oer the wide clouds and oer the starry plain
  Ethereal Jove extends his high domain
  My court beneath the hoary waves I keep
  And hush the roarings of the sacred deep
  Olympus and this earth in common lie
  What claim has here the tyrant of the sky
  Far in the distant clouds let him control
  And awe the younger brothers of the pole
  There to his children his commands be given
  The trembling servile second race of heaven

  And must I then said she O sire of floods
  Bear this fierce answer to the king of gods
  Correct it yet and change thy rash intent
  A noble mind disdains not to repent
  To elder brothers guardian fiends are given
  To scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven

  Great is the profit thus the god rejoind
  When ministers are blest with prudent mind
  Warnd by thy words to powerful Jove I yield
  And quit though angry the contended field
  Not but his threats with justice I disclaim
  The same our honours and our birth the same
  If yet forgetful of his promise given
  To Hermes Pallas and the queen of heaven
  To favour Ilion that perfidious place
  He breaks his faith with half the ethereal race
  Give him to know unless the Grecian train
  Lay yon proud structures level with the plain
  Howeer the offence by other gods be passd
  The wrath of Neptune shall for ever last

  Thus speaking furious from the field he strode
  And plunged into the bosom of the flood
  The lord of thunders from his lofty height
  Beheld and thus bespoke the source of light

  Behold the god whose liquid arms are hurld
  Around the globe whose earthquakes rock the world
  Desists at length his rebelwar to wage
  Seeks his own seas and trembles at our rage
  Else had my wrath heavens thrones all shaking round
  Burnd to the bottom of his seas profound
  And all the gods that round old Saturn dwell
  Had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell
  Well was the crime and well the vengeance spared
  Even power immense had found such battle hard
  Go thou my son the trembling Greeks alarm
  Shake my broad aegis on thy active arm
  Be godlike Hector thy peculiar care
  Swell his bold heart and urge his strength to war
  Let Ilion conquer till the Achaian train
  Fly to their ships and Hellespont again
  Then Greece shall breathe from toils The godhead said
  His will divine the son of Jove obeyd
  Not half so swift the sailing falcon flies
  That drives a turtle through the liquid skies
  As Phoebus shooting from the Idaean brow
  Glides down the mountain to the plain below
  There Hector seated by the stream he sees
  His sense returning with the coming breeze
  Again his pulses beat his spirits rise
  Again his loved companions meet his eyes
  Jove thinking of his pains they passd away
  To whom the god who gives the golden day

  Why sits great Hector from the field so far
  What grief what wound withholds thee from the war

  The fainting hero as the vision bright
  Stood shining oer him half unseald his sight

  What blest immortal with commanding breath
  Thus wakens Hector from the sleep of death
  Has fame not told how while my trusty sword
  Bathed Greece in slaughter and her battle gored
  The mighty Ajax with a deadly blow
  Had almost sunk me to the shades below
  Even yet methinks the gliding ghosts I spy
  And hells black horrors swim before my eye

  To him Apollo Be no more dismayd
  See and be strong the Thunderer sends thee aid
  Behold thy Phoebus shall his arms employ
  Phoebus propitious still to thee and Troy
  Inspire thy warriors then with manly force
  And to the ships impel thy rapid horse
  Even I will make thy fiery coursers way
  And drive the Grecians headlong to the sea

  Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove
  And breathed immortal ardour from above
  As when the pamperd steed with reins unbound
  Breaks from his stall and pours along the ground
  With ample strokes he rushes to the flood
  To bathe his sides and cool his fiery blood
  His head now freed he tosses to the skies
  His mane dishevelld oer his shoulders flies
  He snuffs the females in the wellknown plain
  And springs exulting to his fields again
  Urged by the voice divine thus Hector flew
  Full of the god and all his hosts pursue
  As when the force of men and dogs combined
  Invade the mountain goat or branching hind
  Far from the hunters rage secure they lie
  Close in the rock not fated yet to die
  When lo a lion shoots across the way
  They fly at once the chasers and the prey
  So Greece that late in conquering troops pursued
  And markd their progress through the ranks in blood
  Soon as they see the furious chief appear
  Forget to vanquish and consent to fear

  Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course
  Thoas the bravest of the Ćtolian force
  Skilld to direct the javelins distant flight
  And bold to combat in the standing fight
  Not more in councils famed for solid sense
  Than winning words and heavenly eloquence
  Gods what portent he cried these eyes invades
  Lo Hector rises from the Stygian shades
  We saw him late by thundering Ajax killd
  What god restores him to the frighted field
  And not content that half of Greece lie slain
  Pours new destruction on her sons again
  He comes not Jove without thy powerful will
  Lo still he lives pursues and conquers still
  Yet hear my counsel and his worst withstand
  The Greeks main body to the fleet command
  But let the few whom brisker spirits warm
  Stand the first onset and provoke the storm
  Thus point your arms and when such foes appear
  Fierce as he is let Hector learn to fear

  The warrior spoke the listening Greeks obey
  Thickening their ranks and form a deep array

  Each Ajax Teucer Merion gave command
  The valiant leader of the Cretan band
  And Marslike Meges these the chiefs excite
  Approach the foe and meet the coming fight
  Behind unnumberd multitudes attend
  To flank the navy and the shores defend
  Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear
  And Hector first came towering to the war
  Phoebus himself the rushing battle led
  A veil of clouds involved his radiant head
  High held before him Joves enormous shield
  Portentous shone and shaded all the field
  Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consignd
  To scatter hosts and terrify mankind
  The Greeks expect the shock the clamours rise
  From different parts and mingle in the skies
  Dire was the hiss of darts by heroes flung
  And arrows leaping from the bowstring sung
  These drink the life of generous warriors slain
  Those guiltless fall and thirst for blood in vain
  As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield
  Sat doubtful conquest hovering oer the field
  But when aloft he shakes it in the skies
  Shouts in their ears and lightens in their eyes
  Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast
  Their force is humbled and their fear confessd
  So flies a herd of oxen scatterd wide
  No swain to guard them and no day to guide
  When two fell lions from the mountain come
  And spread the carnage through the shady gloom
  Impending Phoebus pours around them fear
  And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear
  Heaps fall on heaps the slaughter Hector leads
  First great Arcesilas then Stichius bleeds
  One to the bold Boeotians ever dear
  And one Menestheus friend and famed compeer
  Medon and Iasus Ćneas sped
  This sprang from Phelus and the Athenians led
  But hapless Medon from Oileus came
  Him Ajax honourd with a brothers name
  Though born of lawless love from home expelld
  A banishd man in Phylace he dwelld
  Pressd by the vengeance of an angry wife
  Troy ends at last his labours and his life
  Mecystes next Polydamas oerthrew
  And thee brave Clonius great Agenor slew
  By Paris Deiochus inglorious dies
  Pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies
  Polites arm laid Echius on the plain
  Stretchd on one heap the victors spoil the slain
  The Greeks dismayd confused disperse or fall
  Some seek the trench some skulk behind the wall
  While these fly trembling others pant for breath
  And oer the slaughter stalks gigantic death
  On rushd bold Hector gloomy as the night
  Forbids to plunder animates the fight
  Points to the fleet For by the gods who flies240
  Who dares but linger by this hand he dies
  No weeping sister his cold eye shall close
  No friendly hand his funeral pyre compose
  Who stops to plunder at this signal hour
  The birds shall tear him and the dogs devour
  Furious he said the smarting scourge resounds
  The coursers fly the smoking chariot bounds
  The hosts rush on loud clamours shake the shore
  The horses thunder earth and ocean roar
  Apollo planted at the trenchs bound
  Pushd at the bank down sank the enormous mound
  Rolld in the ditch the heapy ruin lay
  A sudden road a long and ample way
  Oer the dread fosse a late impervious space
  Now steeds and men and cars tumultuous pass
  The wondering crowds the downward level trod
  Before them flamed the shield and marchd the god
  Then with his hand he shook the mighty wall
  And lo the turrets nod the bulwarks fall
  Easy as when ashore an infant stands
  And draws imagined houses in the sands
  The sportive wanton pleased with some new play
  Sweeps the slight works and fashiond domes away
  Thus vanishd at thy touch the towers and walls
  The toil of thousands in a moment falls

  The Grecians gaze around with wild despair
  Confused and weary all the powers with prayer
  Exhort their men with praises threats commands
  And urge the gods with voices eyes and hands
  Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skies
  And weeps his country with a fathers eyes

  O Jove if ever on his native shore
  One Greek enrichd thy shrine with offerd gore
  If eer in hope our country to behold
  We paid the fattest firstlings of the fold
  If eer thou signst our wishes with thy nod
  Perform the promise of a gracious god
  This day preserve our navies from the flame
  And save the relics of the Grecian name

  Thus prayed the sage the eternal gave consent
  And peals of thunder shook the firmament
  Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign
  And catchd new fury at the voice divine
  As when black tempests mix the seas and skies
  The roaring deeps in watery mountains rise
  Above the sides of some tall ship ascend
  Its womb they deluge and its ribs they rend
  Thus loudly roaring and oerpowering all
  Mount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall
  Legions on legions from each side arise
  Thick sound the keels the storm of arrows flies
  Fierce on the ships above the cars below
  These wield the mace and those the javelin throw

  While thus the thunder of the battle raged
  And labouring armies round the works engaged
  Still in the tent Patroclus sat to tend
  The good Eurypylus his wounded friend
  He sprinkles healing balms to anguish kind
  And adds discourse the medicine of the mind
  But when he saw ascending up the fleet
  Victorious Troy then starting from his seat
  With bitter groans his sorrows he expressd
  He wrings his hands he beats his manly breast
  Though yet thy state require redress he cries
  Depart I must what horrors strike my eyes
  Charged with Achilles high command I go
  A mournful witness of this scene of woe
  I haste to urge him by his countrys care
  To rise in arms and shine again in war
  Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend
  The voice is powerful of a faithful friend

  He spoke and speaking swifter than the wind
  Sprung from the tent and left the war behind
  The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain
  But strive though numerous to repulse in vain
  Nor could the Trojans through that firm array
  Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way
  As when a shipwright with Palladian art
  Smooths the rough wood and levels every part
  With equal hand he guides his whole design
  By the just rule and the directing line
  The martial leaders with like skill and care
  Preserved their line and equal kept the war
  Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried
  And every ship sustained an equal tide
  At one proud bark hightowering oer the fleet
  Ajax the great and godlike Hector meet
  For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend
  Nor this the ships can fire nor that defend
  One kept the shore and one the vessel trod
  That fixd as fate this acted by a god
  The son of Clytius in his daring hand
  The deck approaching shakes a flaming brand
  But pierced by Telamons huge lance expires
  Thundering he falls and drops the extinguishd fires
  Great Hector viewd him with a sad survey
  As stretchd in dust before the stern he lay
  Oh all of Trojan all of Lycian race
  Stand to your arms maintain this arduous space
  Lo where the son of royal Clytius lies
  Ah save his arms secure his obsequies

  This said his eager javelin sought the foe
  But Ajax shunnd the meditated blow
  Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown
  It stretchd in dust unhappy Lycophron
  An exile long sustaind at Ajax board
  A faithful servant to a foreign lord
  In peace and war for ever at his side
  Near his loved master as he lived he died
  From the high poop he tumbles on the sand
  And lies a lifeless load along the land
  With anguish Ajax views the piercing sight
  And thus inflames his brother to the fight

  Teucer behold extended on the shore
  Our friend our loved companion now no more
  Dear as a parent with a parents care
  To fight our wars he left his native air
  This death deplored to Hectors rage we owe
  Revenge revenge it on the cruel foe
  Where are those darts on which the fates attend
  And where the bow which Phoebus taught to bend

  Impatient Teucer hastening to his aid
  Before the chief his ample bow displayd
  The wellstored quiver on his shoulders hung
  Then hissd his arrow and the bowstring sung
  Clytus Pisenors son renownd in fame
  To thee Polydamas an honourd name
  Drove through the thickest of the embattled plains
  The startling steeds and shook his eager reins
  As all on glory ran his ardent mind
  The pointed death arrests him from behind
  Through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies
  In youths first bloom reluctantly he dies
  Hurld from the lofty seat at distance far
  The headlong coursers spurn his empty car
  Till sad Polydamas the steeds restraind
  And gave Astynous to thy careful hand
  Then fired to vengeance rushd amidst the foe
  Rage edged his sword and strengthend every blow

  Once more bold Teucer in his countrys cause
  At Hectors breast a chosen arrow draws
  And had the weapon found the destined way
  Thy fall great Trojan had renownd that day
  But Hector was not doomd to perish then
  The allwise disposer of the fates of men
  Imperial Jove his present death withstands
  Nor was such glory due to Teucers hands
  At its full stretch as the tough string he drew
  Struck by an arm unseen it burst in two
  Down droppd the bow the shaft with brazen head
  Fell innocent and on the dust lay dead
  The astonishd archer to great Ajax cries
  Some god prevents our destined enterprise
  Some god propitious to the Trojan foe
  Has from my arm unfailing struck the bow
  And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art
  Strong to impel the flight of many a dart

  Since heaven commands it Ajax made reply
  Dismiss the bow and lay thy arrows by
  Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield
  And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield
  In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame
  Thy brave example shall the rest inflame
  Fierce as they are by long successes vain
  To force our fleet or even a ship to gain
  Asks toil and sweat and blood their utmost might
  Shall find its matchNo more tis ours to fight

  Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside
  The fourfold buckler oer his shoulder tied
  On his brave head a crested helm he placed
  With nodding horsehair formidably graced
  A dart whose point with brass refulgent shines
  The warrior wields and his great brother joins

  This Hector saw and thus expressd his joy
  Ye troops of Lycia Dardanus and Troy
  Be mindful of yourselves your ancient fame
  And spread your glory with the navys flame
  Jove is with us I saw his hand but now
  From the proud archer strike his vaunted bow
  Indulgent Jove how plain thy favours shine
  When happy nations bear the marks divine
  How easy then to see the sinking state
  Of realms accursed deserted reprobate
  Such is the fate of Greece and such is ours
  Behold ye warriors and exert your powers
  Death is the worst a fate which all must try
  And for our country tis a bliss to die
  The gallant man though slain in fight he be
  Yet leaves his nation safe his children free
  Entails a debt on all the grateful state
  His own brave friends shall glory in his fate
  His wife live honourd all his race succeed
  And late posterity enjoy the deed

  This roused the soul in every Trojan breast
  The godlike Ajax next his Greeks addressd

  How long ye warriors of the Argive race
  To generous Argos what a dire disgrace
  How long on these cursed confines will ye lie
  Yet undetermined or to live or die
  What hopes remain what methods to retire
  If once your vessels catch the Trojan fire
  Make how the flames approach how near they fall
  How Hector calls and Troy obeys his call
  Not to the dance that dreadful voice invites
  It calls to death and all the rage of fights
  Tis now no time for wisdom or debates
  To your own hands are trusted all your fates
  And better far in one decisive strife
  One day should end our labour or our life
  Than keep this hardgot inch of barren sands
  Still pressd and pressd by such inglorious hands

  The listening Grecians feel their leaders flame
  And every kindling bosom pants for fame
  Then mutual slaughters spread on either side
  By Hector here the Phocian Schedius died
  There pierced by Ajax sunk Laodamas
  Chief of the foot of old Antenors race
  Polydamas laid Otus on the sand
  The fierce commander of the Epeian band
  His lance bold Meges at the victor threw
  The victor stooping from the death withdrew
  That valued life O Phoebus was thy care
  But Croesmus bosom took the flying spear
  His corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore
  His radiant arms triumphant Meges bore
  Dolops the son of Lampus rushes on
  Sprung from the race of old Laomedon
  And famed for prowess in a wellfought field
  He pierced the centre of his sounding shield
  But Meges Phyleus ample breastplate wore
  Wellknown in fight on Selles winding shore
  For king Euphetes gave the golden mail
  Compact and firm with many a jointed scale
  Which oft in cities stormd and battles won
  Had saved the father and now saves the son
  Full at the Trojans head he urged his lance
  Where the high plumes above the helmet dance
  New tingd with Tyrian dye in dust below
  Shorn from the crest the purple honours glow
  Meantime their fight the Spartan king surveyd
  And stood by Meges side a sudden aid
  Through Dolops shoulder urged his forceful dart
  Which held its passage through the panting heart
  And issued at his breast With thundering sound
  The warrior falls extended on the ground
  In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain
  But Hectors voice excites his kindred train
  The hero most from Hicetaon sprung
  Fierce Melanippus gallant brave and young
  He ere to Troy the Grecians crossd the main
  Fed his large oxen on Percotes plain
  But when oppressd his country claimd his care
  Returnd to Ilion and excelld in war
  For this in Priams court he held his place
  Beloved no less than Priams royal race
  Him Hector singled as his troops he led
  And thus inflamed him pointing to the dead

  Lo Melanippus lo where Dolops lies
  And is it thus our royal kinsman dies
  Oermatchd he falls to two at once a prey
  And lo they bear the bloody arms away
  Come ona distant war no longer wage
  But hand to hand thy countrys foes engage
  Till Greece at once and all her glory end
  Or Ilion from her towery height descend
  Heaved from the lowest stone and bury all
  In one sad sepulchre one common fall

  Hector this said rushd forward on the foes
  With equal ardour Melanippus glows
  Then Ajax thusO Greeks respect your fame
  Respect yourselves and learn an honest shame
  Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire
  And catch from breast to breast the noble fire
  On valours side the odds of combat lie
  The brave live glorious or lamented die
  The wretch that trembles in the field of fame
  Meets death and worse than death eternal shame

  His generous sense he not in vain imparts
  It sunk and rooted in the Grecian hearts
  They join they throng they thicken at his call
  And flank the navy with a brazen wall
  Shields touching shields in order blaze above
  And stop the Trojans though impelld by Jove
  The fiery Spartan first with loud applause
  Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause
  Is there he said in arms a youth like you
  So strong to fight so active to pursue
  Why stand you distant nor attempt a deed
  Lift the bold lance and make some Trojan bleed

  He said and backward to the lines retired
  Forth rushd the youth with martial fury fired
  Beyond the foremost ranks his lance he threw
  And round the black battalions cast his view
  The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear
  While the swift javelin hissd along in air
  Advancing Melanippus met the dart
  With his bold breast and felt it in his heart
  Thundering he falls his falling arms resound
  And his broad buckler rings against the ground
  The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize
  Thus on a roe the wellbreathd beagle flies
  And rends his side freshbleeding with the dart
  The distant hunter sent into his heart
  Observing Hector to the rescue flew
  Bold as he was Antilochus withdrew
  So when a savage ranging oer the plain
  Has torn the shepherds dog or shepherds swain
  While conscious of the deed he glares around
  And hears the gathering multitude resound
  Timely he flies the yetuntasted food
  And gains the friendly shelter of the wood
  So fears the youth all Troy with shouts pursue
  While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew
  But enterd in the Grecian ranks he turns
  His manly breast and with new fury burns

  Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove
  Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove
  The sire of gods confirming Thetis prayer
  The Grecian ardour quenchd in deep despair
  But lifts to glory Troys prevailing bands
  Swells all their hearts and strengthens all their hands
  On Idas top he waits with longing eyes
  To view the navy blazing to the skies
  Then nor till then the scale of war shall turn
  The Trojans fly and conquerd Ilion burn
  These fates revolved in his almighty mind
  He raises Hector to the work designd
  Bids him with more than mortal fury glow
  And drives him like a lightning on the foe
  So Mars when human crimes for vengeance call
  Shakes his huge javelin and whole armies fall
  Not with more rage a conflagration rolls
  Wraps the vast mountains and involves the poles
  He foams with wrath beneath his gloomy brow
  Like fiery meteors his red eyeballs glow
  The radiant helmet on his temple burns
  Waves when he nods and lightens as he turns
  For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown
  And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one
  Unhappy glories for his fate was near
  Due to stern Pallas and Pelides spear
  Yet Jove deferrd the death he was to pay
  And gave what fate allowd the honours of a day

  Now all on fire for fame his breast his eyes
  Burn at each foe and single every prize
  Still at the closest ranks the thickest fight
  He points his ardour and exerts his might
  The Grecian phalanx moveless as a tower
  On all sides batterd yet resists his power
  So some tall rock oerhangs the hoary main241
  By winds assaild by billows beat in vain
  Unmoved it hears above the tempest blow
  And sees the watery mountains break below
  Girt in surrounding flames he seems to fall
  Like fire from Jove and bursts upon them all
  Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends
  And swelld with tempests on the ship descends
  White are the decks with foam the winds aloud
  Howl oer the masts and sing through every shroud
  Pale trembling tired the sailors freeze with fears
  And instant death on every wave appears
  So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet
  The chief so thunders and so shakes the fleet

  As when a lion rushing from his den
  Amidst the plain of some widewaterd fen
  Where numerous oxen as at ease they feed
  At large expatiate oer the ranker mead
  Leaps on the herds before the herdsmans eyes
  The trembling herdsman far to distance flies
  Some lordly bull the rest dispersed and fled
  He singles out arrests and lays him dead
  Thus from the rage of Jovelike Hector flew
  All Greece in heaps but one he seized and slew
  Mycenian Periphes a mighty name
  In wisdom great in arms well known to fame
  The minister of stern Eurystheus ire
  Against Alcides Copreus was his sire
  The son redeemd the honours of the race
  A son as generous as the sire was base
  Oer all his countrys youth conspicuous far
  In every virtue or of peace or war
  But doomd to Hectors stronger force to yield
  Against the margin of his ample shield
  He struck his hasty foot his heels upsprung
  Supine he fell his brazen helmet rung
  On the fallen chief the invading Trojan pressd
  And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast
  His circling friends who strove to guard too late
  The unhappy hero fled or shared his fate

  Chased from the foremost line the Grecian train
  Now man the next receding toward the main
  Wedged in one body at the tents they stand
  Walld round with sterns a gloomy desperate band
  Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight
  Now fear itself confines them to the fight
  Man courage breathes in man but Nestor most
  The sage preserver of the Grecian host
  Exhorts adjures to guard these utmost shores
  And by their parents by themselves implores

  Oh friends be men your generous breasts inflame
  With mutual honour and with mutual shame
  Think of your hopes your fortunes all the care
  Your wives your infants and your parents share
  Think of each living fathers reverend head
  Think of each ancestor with glory dead
  Absent by me they speak by me they sue
  They ask their safety and their fame from you
  The gods their fates on this one action lay
  And all are lost if you desert the day

  He spoke and round him breathed heroic fires
  Minerva seconds what the sage inspires
  The mist of darkness Jove around them threw
  She cleard restoring all the war to view
  A sudden ray shot beaming oer the plain
  And showd the shores the navy and the main
  Hector they saw and all who fly or fight
  The scene wideopening to the blaze of light
  First of the field great Ajax strikes their eyes
  His port majestic and his ample size
  A ponderous mace with studs of iron crownd
  Full twenty cubits long he swings around
  Nor fights like others fixd to certain stands
  But looks a moving tower above the bands
  High on the decks with vast gigantic stride
  The godlike hero stalks from side to side
  So when a horseman from the watery mead
  Skilld in the manage of the bounding steed
  Drives four fair coursers practised to obey
  To some great city through the public way
  Safe in his art as side by side they run
  He shifts his seat and vaults from one to one
  And now to this and now to that he flies
  Admiring numbers follow with their eyes

  From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew
  No less the wonder of the warring crew
  As furious Hector thunderd threats aloud
  And rushd enraged before the Trojan crowd
  Then swift invades the ships whose beaky prores
  Lay rankd contiguous on the bending shores
  So the strong eagle from his airy height
  Who marks the swans or cranes embodied flight
  Stoops down impetuous while they light for food
  And stooping darkens with his wings the flood
  Jove leads him on with his almighty hand
  And breathes fierce spirits in his following band
  The warring nations meet the battle roars
  Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores
  Thou wouldst have thought so furious was their fire
  No force could tame them and no toil could tire
  As if new vigour from new fights they won
  And the long battle was but then begun
  Greece yet unconquerd kept alive the war
  Secure of death confiding in despair
  Troy in proud hopes already viewd the main
  Bright with the blaze and red with heroes slain
  Like strength is felt from hope and from despair
  And each contends as his were all the war

  Twas thou bold Hector whose resistless hand
  First seized a ship on that contested strand
  The same which dead Protesilaus bore242
  The first that touchd the unhappy Trojan shore
  For this in arms the warring nations stood
  And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood
  No room to poise the lance or bend the bow
  But hand to hand and man to man they grow
  Wounded they wound and seek each others hearts
  With falchions axes swords and shortend darts
  The falchions ring shields rattle axes sound
  Swords flash in air or glitter on the ground
  With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed
  And slaughterd heroes swell the dreadful tide

  Still raging Hector with his ample hand
  Grasps the high stern and gives this loud command

  This happy day with acclamations greet

ARGUMENT

THE SIXTH BATTLE THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS

Patroclus in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book
entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks with
Achilles troops and armour He agrees to it but at the same time charges
him to content himself with rescuing the fleet without further pursuit of
the enemy The armour horses soldiers and officers are described
Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend after which
Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle The Trojans at the sight of
Patroclus in Achilles armour taking him for that hero are cast into the
uttermost consternation he beats them off from the vessels Hector
himself flies Sarpedon is killed though Jupiter was averse to his fate
Several other particulars of the battle are described in the heat of
which Patroclus neglecting the orders of Achilles pursues the foe to
the walls of Troy where Apollo repulses and disarms him Euphorbus wounds
him and Hector kills him which concludes the book

  So warrd both armies on the ensanguined shore
  While the black vessels smoked with human gore
  Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies
  The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes
  Not faster trickling to the plains below
  From the tall rock the sable waters flow
  Divine Pelides with compassion moved
  Thus spoke indulgent to his best beloved243

  Patroclus say what grief thy bosom bears
  That flows so fast in these unmanly tears
  No girl no infant whom the mother keeps
  From her loved breast with fonder passion weeps
  Not more the mothers soul that infant warms
  Clung to her knees and reaching at her arms
  Than thou hast mine Oh tell me to what end
  Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend

  Grievst thou for me or for my martial band
  Or come sad tidings from our native land
  Our fathers live our first most tender care
  Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital air
  And hoary Peleus yet extends his days
  Pleased in their age to hear their childrens praise
  Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim
  Perhaps yon relics of the Grecian name
  Doomd in their ships to sink by fire and sword
  And pay the forfeit of their haughty lord
  Whateer the cause reveal thy secret care
  And speak those sorrows which a friend would share
  A sigh that instant from his bosom broke
  Another followd and Patroclus spoke

  Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast
  Thyself a Greek and once of Greeks the best
  Lo every chief that might her fate prevent
  Lies pierced with wounds and bleeding in his tent
  Eurypylus Tydides Atreus son
  And wise Ulysses at the navy groan
  More for their countrys wounds than for their own
  Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease
  Thy breast alone no lenitives appease
  May never rage like thine my soul enslave
  O great in vain unprofitably brave
  Thy country slighted in her last distress
  What friend what man from thee shall hope redress
  Nomen unborn and ages yet behind
  Shall curse that fierce that unforgiving mind

  O man unpitying if of man thy race
  But sure thou springst not from a soft embrace
  Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth
  Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth
  Some rugged rocks hard entrails gave thee form
  And raging seas produced thee in a storm
  A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind
  So rough thy manners so untamed thy mind

  If some dire oracle thy breast alarm
  If aught from Jove or Thetis stop thy arm
  Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine
  If I but lead the Myrmidonian line
  Clad in thy dreadful arms if I appear
  Proud Troy shall tremble and desert the war
  Without thy person Greece shall win the day
  And thy mere image chase her foes away
  Pressd by fresh forces her oerlabourd train
  Shall quit the ships and Greece respire again
  Thus blind to fate with supplicating breath
  Thou beggst his arms and in his arms thy death
  Unfortunately good a boding sigh
  Thy friend returnd and with it this reply
  Patroclus thy Achilles knows no fears
  Nor words from Jove nor oracles he hears
  Nor aught a mothers caution can suggest
  The tyrants pride lies rooted in my breast
  My wrongs my wrongs my constant thought engage
  Those my sole oracles inspire my rage
  I made him tyrant gave him power to wrong
  Even my I felt it and shall feel it long
  The maid my blackeyed maid he forced away
  Due to the toils of many a wellfought day
  Due to my conquest of her fathers reign
  Due to the votes of all the Grecian train
  From me he forced her me the bold and brave
  Disgraced dishonourd like the meanest slave
  But bear we thisthe wrongs I grieve are past
  Tis time our fury should relent at last
  I fixd its date the day I wishd appears
  How Hector to my ships his battle bears
  The flames my eyes the shouts invade my ears
  Go then Patroclus court fair honours charms
  In Troys famed fields and in Achilles arms
  Lead forth my martial Myrmidons to fight
  Go save the fleets and conquer in my right
  See the thin relics of their baffled band
  At the last edge of yon deserted land
  Behold all Ilion on their ships descends
  How the cloud blackens how the storm impends
  It was not thus when at my sight amazed
  Troy saw and trembled as this helmet blazed
  Had not the injurious king our friendship lost
  Yon ample trench had buried half her host
  No camps no bulwarks now the Trojans fear
  Those are not dreadful no Achilles there
  No longer flames the lance of Tydeus son
  No more your general calls his heroes on
  Hector alone I hear his dreadful breath
  Commands your slaughter or proclaims your death
  Yet now Patroclus issue to the plain
  Now save the ships the rising fires restrain
  And give the Greeks to visit Greece again
  But heed my words and mark a friends command
  Who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand
  And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host
  Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost
  Rage uncontrolld through all the hostile crew
  But touch not Hector Hector is my due
  Though Jove in thunder should command the war
  Be just consult my glory and forbear
  The fleet once saved desist from further chase
  Nor lead to Ilions walls the Grecian race
  Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy
  Some god like Phoebus ever kind to Troy
  Let Greece redeemd from this destructive strait
  Do her own work and leave the rest to fate
  O would to all the immortal powers above
  Apollo Pallas and almighty Jove
  That not one Trojan might be left alive
  And not a Greek of all the race survive
  Might only we the vast destruction shun
  And only we destroy the accursed town
  Such conference held the chiefs while on the strand
  Great Jove with conquest crownd the Trojan band
  Ajax no more the sounding storm sustaind
  So thick the darts an iron tempest raind
  On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung
  His hollow helm with falling javelins rung
  His breath in quick short pantings comes and goes
  And painful sweat from all his members flows
  Spent and oerpowerd he barely breathes at most
  Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post
  Dangers on dangers all around him glow
  And toil to toil and woe succeeds to woe

  Say Muses throned above the starry frame
  How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame

  Stern Hector waved his sword and standing near
  Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear
  Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped
  That the broad falchion loppd its brazen head
  His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain
  The brazen head falls sounding on the plain
  Great Ajax saw and ownd the hand divine
  Confessing Jove and trembling at the sign
  Warnd he retreats Then swift from all sides pour
  The hissing brands thick streams the fiery shower
  Oer the high stern the curling volumes rise
  And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies

  Divine Achilles viewd the rising flames
  And smote his thigh and thus aloud exclaims
  Arm arm Patroclus Lo the blaze aspires
  The glowing ocean reddens with the fires
  Arm ere our vessels catch the spreading flame
  Arm ere the Grecians be no more a name
  I haste to bring the troopsThe hero said
  The friend with ardour and with joy obeyd

  He cased his limbs in brass and first around
  His manly legs with silver buckles bound
  The clasping greaves then to his breast applies
  The flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes
  Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone
  In the rich belt as in a starry zone
  Achilles shield his ample shoulders spread
  Achilles helmet nodded oer his head
  Adornd in all his terrible array
  He flashd around intolerable day
  Alone untouchd Pelides javelin stands
  Not to be poised but by Pelides hands
  From Pelions shady brow the plant entire
  Old Chiron rent and shaped it for his sire
  Whose sons great arm alone the weapon wields
  The death of heroes and the dread of fields

  The brave Automedon an honourd name
  The second to his lord in love and fame
  In peace his friend and partner of the war
  The winged coursers harnessd to the car
  Xanthus and Balius of immortal breed
  Sprung from the wind and like the wind in speed
  Whom the wingd harpy swift Podarge bore
  By Zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore
  Swift Pedasus was added to their side
  Once great Aetions now Achilles pride
  Who like in strength in swiftness and in grace
  A mortal courser matchd the immortal race

  Achilles speeds from tent to tent and warms
  His hardy Myrmidons to blood and arms
  All breathing death around the chief they stand
  A grim terrific formidable band
  Grim as voracious wolves that seek the springs244
  When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings
  When some tall stag freshslaughtered in the wood
  Has drenchd their wide insatiate throats with blood
  To the black fount they rush a hideous throng
  With paunch distended and with lolling tongue
  Fire fills their eye their black jaws belch the gore
  And gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more
  Like furious rushd the Myrmidonian crew
  Such their dread strength and such their deathful view

  High in the midst the great Achilles stands
  Directs their order and the war commands
  He loved of Jove had launchd for Ilions shores
  Full fifty vessels mannd with fifty oars
  Five chosen leaders the fierce bands obey
  Himself supreme in valour as in sway

  First marchd Menestheus of celestial birth
  Derived from thee whose waters wash the earth
  Divine Sperchius Jovedescended flood
  A mortal mother mixing with a god
  Such was Menestheus but miscalld by fame
  The son of Borus that espoused the dame

  Eudorus next whom Polymele the gay
  Famed in the graceful dance produced today
  Her sly Cellenius loved on her would gaze
  As with swift step she formd the running maze
  To her high chamber from Dianas quire
  The god pursued her urged and crownd his fire
  The son confessd his fathers heavenly race
  And heird his mothers swiftness in the chase
  Strong Echecleus blessd in all those charms
  That pleased a god succeeded to her arms
  Not conscious of those loves long hid from fame
  With gifts of price he sought and won the dame
  Her secret offspring to her sire she bare
  Her sire caressd him with a parents care

  Pisander followd matchless in his art
  To wing the spear or aim the distant dart
  No hand so sure of all the Emathian line
  Or if a surer great Patroclus thine

  The fourth by Phoenix grave command was graced
  Laerces valiant offspring led the last

  Soon as Achilles with superior care
  Had calld the chiefs and orderd all the war
  This stern remembrance to his troops he gave
  Ye farfamed Myrmidons ye fierce and brave
  Think with what threats you dared the Trojan throng
  Think what reproach these ears endured so long
  Stern son of Peleus thus ye used to say
  While restless raging in your ships you lay
  Oh nursed with gall unknowing how to yield
  Whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field
  If that dire fury must for ever burn
  What make we here Return ye chiefs return
  Such were your wordsNow warriors grieve no more
  Lo there the Trojans bathe your swords in gore
  This day shall give you all your soul demands
  Glut all your hearts and weary all your hands

  Thus while he roused the fire in every breast
  Close and more close the listening cohorts pressd
  Ranks wedged in ranks of arms a steely ring
  Still grows and spreads and thickens round the king
  As when a circling wall the builder forms
  Of strength defensive against wind and storms
  Compacted stones the thickening work compose
  And round him wide the rising structure grows
  So helm to helm and crest to crest they throng
  Shield urged on shield and man drove man along
  Thick undistinguishd plumes together joind
  Float in one sea and wave before the wind

  Far oer the rest in glittering pomp appear
  There bold Automedon Patroclus here
  Brothers in arms with equal fury fired
  Two friends two bodies with one soul inspired

  But mindful of the gods Achilles went
  To the rich coffer in his shady tent
  There lay on heaps his various garments rolld
  And costly furs and carpets stiff with gold
  The presents of the silverfooted dame
  From thence he took a bowl of antique frame
  Which never man had stained with ruddy wine
  Nor raised in offerings to the power divine
  But Peleus son and Peleus son to none
  Had raised in offerings but to Jove alone
  This tinged with sulphur sacred first to flame
  He purged and washd it in the running stream
  Then cleansed his hands and fixing for a space
  His eyes on heaven his feet upon the place
  Of sacrifice the purple draught he pourd
  Forth in the midst and thus the god implored

  O thou supreme highthroned all height above
  O great Pelasgic Dodonaean Jove
  Who midst surrounding frosts and vapours chill
  Presidst on bleak Dodonas vocal hill
  Whose groves the Selli race austere surround
  Their feet unwashd their slumbers on the ground
  Who hear from rustling oaks thy dark decrees
  And catch the fates lowwhispered in the breeze
  Hear as of old Thou gavst at Thetis prayer
  Glory to me and to the Greeks despair
  Lo to the dangers of the fighting field
  The best the dearest of my friends I yield
  Though still determined to my ships confined
  Patroclus gone I stay but half behind
  Oh be his guard thy providential care
  Confirm his heart and string his arm to war
  Pressd by his single force let Hector see
  His fame in arms not owing all to me
  But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire
  Let him with conquest and renown retire
  Preserve his arms preserve his social train
  And safe return him to these eyes again

  Great Jove consents to half the chiefs request
  But heavens eternal doom denies the rest
  To free the fleet was granted to his prayer
  His safe return the winds dispersed in air
  Back to his tent the stern Achilles flies
  And waits the combat with impatient eyes

  Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus care
  Invade the Trojans and commence the war
  As wasps provoked by children in their play
  Pour from their mansions by the broad highway
  In swarms the guiltless traveller engage
  Whet all their stings and call forth all their rage
  All rise in arms and with a general cry
  Assert their waxen domes and buzzing progeny
  Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms
  So loud their clamours and so keen their arms
  Their rising rage Patroclus breath inspires
  Who thus inflames them with heroic fires

  O warriors partners of Achilles praise
  Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days
  Your godlike master let your acts proclaim
  And add new glories to his mighty name
  Think your Achilles sees you fight be brave
  And humble the proud monarch whom you save

  Joyful they heard and kindling as he spoke
  Flew to the fleet involved in fire and smoke
  From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound
  The hollow ships return a deeper sound
  The war stood still and all around them gazed
  When great Achilles shining armour blazed
  Troy saw and thought the dread Achilles nigh
  At once they see they tremble and they fly

  Then first thy spear divine Patroclus flew
  Where the war raged and where the tumult grew
  Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore
  Unblessd Protesilaus to Ilions shore
  The great Paeonian bold Pyrechmes stood
  Who led his bands from Axius winding flood
  His shoulderblade receives the fatal wound
  The groaning warrior pants upon the ground
  His troops that see their countrys glory slain
  Fly diverse scatterd oer the distant plain
  Patroclus arm forbids the spreading fires
  And from the halfburnd ship proud Troy retires
  Cleard from the smoke the joyful navy lies
  In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies
  Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends
  And loud acclaim the starry region rends
  So when thick clouds enwrap the mountains head
  Oer heavens expanse like one black ceiling spread
  Sudden the Thunderer with a flashing ray
  Bursts through the darkness and lets down the day
  The hills shine out the rocks in prospect rise
  And streams and vales and forests strike the eyes
  The smiling scene wide opens to the sight
  And all the unmeasured ether flames with light

  But Troy repulsed and scatterd oer the plains
  Forced from the navy yet the fight maintains
  Now every Greek some hostile hero slew
  But still the foremost bold Patroclus flew
  As Areilycus had turnd him round
  Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound
  The brazenpointed spear with vigour thrown
  The thigh transfixd and broke the brittle bone
  Headlong he fell Next Thoas was thy chance
  Thy breast unarmd received the Spartan lance
  Phylides dart as Amphidus drew nigh
  His blow prevented and transpierced his thigh
  Tore all the brawn and rent the nerves away
  In darkness and in death the warrior lay

  In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand
  And two bold brothers of the Lycian band
  By great Antilochus Atymnius dies
  Pierced in the flank lamented youth he lies
  Kind Maris bleeding in his brothers wound
  Defends the breathless carcase on the ground
  Furious he flies his murderer to engage
  But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage
  Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow
  His arm falls spouting on the dust below
  He sinks with endless darkness coverd oer
  And vents his soul effused with gushing gore

  Slain by two brothers thus two brothers bleed
  Sarpedons friends Amisodarus seed
  Amisodarus who by Furies led
  The bane of men abhorrd Chimaera bred
  Skilld in the dart in vain his sons expire
  And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire

  Stoppd in the tumult Cleobulus lies
  Beneath Oileus arm a living prize
  A living prize not long the Trojan stood
  The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood
  Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies
  Black death and fate unpitying seal his eyes

  Amid the ranks with mutual thirst of fame
  Lycon the brave and fierce Peneleus came
  In vain their javelins at each other flew
  Now met in arms their eager swords they drew
  On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foe
  The daring Lycon aimd a noble blow
  The sword broke short but his Peneleus sped
  Full on the juncture of the neck and head
  The head divided by a stroke so just
  Hung by the skin the body sunk to dust

  Oertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds
  Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds
  Back from the car he tumbles to the ground
  His swimming eyes eternal shades surround

  Next Erymas was doomd his fate to feel
  His opend mouth received the Cretan steel
  Beneath the brain the point a passage tore
  Crashd the thin bones and drownd the teeth in gore
  His mouth his eyes his nostrils pour a flood
  He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood

  As when the flocks neglected by the swain
  Or kids or lambs lie scatterd oer the plain
  A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey
  And rend the trembling unresisting prey
  Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came
  Troy fled unmindful of her former fame

  But still at Hector godlike Ajax aimd
  Still pointed at his breast his javelin flamed
  The Trojan chief experienced in the field
  Oer his broad shoulders spread the massy shield
  Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour
  And on his buckler caught the ringing shower
  He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise
  Yet stops and turns and saves his loved allies

  As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms
  And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms
  Dark oer the fields the ascending vapour flies
  And shades the sun and blots the golden skies
  So from the ships along the dusky plain
  Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train
  Even Hector fled through heads of disarray
  The fiery coursers forced their lord away
  While far behind his Trojans fall confused
  Wedged in the trench in one vast carnage bruised
  Chariots on chariots roll the clashing spokes
  Shock while the madding steeds break short their yokes
  In vain they labour up the steepy mound
  Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground
  Fierce on the rear with shouts Patroclus flies
  Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies
  Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight
  Clouds rise on clouds and heaven is snatchd from sight
  The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down
  Scour oer the fields and stretch to reach the town
  Loud oer the rout was heard the victors cry
  Where the war bleeds and where the thickest die
  Where horse and arms and chariots he oerthrown
  And bleeding heroes under axles groan
  No stop no check the steeds of Peleus knew
  From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew
  Highbounding oer the fosse the whirling car
  Smokes through the ranks oertakes the flying war
  And thunders after Hector Hector flies
  Patroclus shakes his lance but fate denies
  Not with less noise with less impetuous force
  The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course
  Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours
  And earth is loaden with incessant showers
  When guilty mortals break the eternal laws
  Or judges bribed betray the righteous cause
  From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise
  And opens all the floodgates of the skies
  The impetuous torrents from their hills obey
  Whole fields are drownd and mountains swept away
  Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main
  And trembling man sees all his labours vain

  And now the chief the foremost troops repelld
  Back to the ships his destined progress held
  Bore down half Troy in his resistless way
  And forced the routed ranks to stand the day
  Between the space where silver Simois flows
  Where lay the fleets and where the rampires rose
  All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands
  And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands
  First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart
  Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart
  Thestor was next who saw the chief appear
  And fell the victim of his coward fear
  Shrunk up he sat with wild and haggard eye
  Nor stood to combat nor had force to fly
  Patroclus markd him as he shunnd the war
  And with unmanly tremblings shook the car
  And droppd the flowing reins Him twixt the jaws
  The javelin sticks and from the chariot draws
  As on a rock that overhangs the main
  An angler studious of the line and cane
  Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore
  Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore
  The gaping dastard as the spear was shook
  He fell and life his heartless breast forsook

  Next on Eryalus he flies a stone
  Large as a rock was by his fury thrown
  Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew
  And burst the helm and cleft the head in two
  Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell
  And death involved him with the shades of hell
  Then low in dust Epaltes Echius lie
  Ipheas Evippus Polymelus die
  Amphoterus and Erymas succeed
  And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed
  Whereer he moves the growing slaughters spread
  In heaps on heaps a monument of dead

  When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld
  Grovelling in dust and gasping on the field
  With this reproach his flying host he warms
  Oh stain to honour oh disgrace to arms
  Forsake inglorious the contended plain
  This hand unaided shall the war sustain
  The task be mine this heros strength to try
  Who mows whole troops and makes an army fly

  He spake and speaking leaps from off the car
  Patroclus lights and sternly waits the war
  As when two vultures on the mountains height
  Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight
  They cuff they tear they raise a screaming cry
  The desert echoes and the rocks reply
  The warriors thus opposed in arms engage
  With equal clamours and with equal rage

  Jove viewd the combat whose event foreseen
  He thus bespoke his sister and his queen
  The hour draws on the destinies ordain245
  My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain
  Already on the verge of death he stands
  His life is owed to fierce Patroclus hands
  What passions in a parents breast debate
  Say shall I snatch him from impending fate
  And send him safe to Lycia distant far
  From all the dangers and the toils of war
  Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield
  And fatten with celestial blood the field

  Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes
  What words are these O sovereign of the skies
  Short is the date prescribed to mortal man
  Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span
  Whose bounds were fixd before his race began
  How many sons of gods foredoomd to death
  Before proud Ilion must resign their breath
  Were thine exempt debate would rise above
  And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove
  Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight
  And when the ascending soul has wingd her flight
  Let Sleep and Death convey by thy command
  The breathless body to his native land
  His friends and people to his future praise
  A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise
  And lasting honours to his ashes give
  His fame tis all the dead can have shall live

  She said the cloudcompeller overcome
  Assents to fate and ratifies the doom
  Then touchd with grief the weeping heavens distilld
  A shower of blood oer all the fatal field
  The god his eyes averting from the plain
  Laments his son predestined to be slain
  Far from the Lycian shores his happy native reign
  Now met in arms the combatants appear
  Each heaved the shield and poised the lifted spear
  From strong Patroclus hand the javelin fled
  And passd the groin of valiant Thrasymed
  The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain
  He falls and falling bites the bloody plain
  Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw
  The first aloof with erring fury flew
  The next transpierced Achilles mortal steed
  The generous Pedasus of Theban breed
  Fixd in the shoulders joint he reeld around
  Rolld in the bloody dust and pawd the slippery ground
  His sudden fall the entangled harness broke
  Each axle crackled and the chariot shook
  When bold Automedon to disengage
  The starting coursers and restrain their rage
  Divides the traces with his sword and freed
  The encumbered chariot from the dying steed
  The rest move on obedient to the rein
  The car rolls slowly oer the dusty plain

  The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance
  And first Sarpedon whirld his weighty lance
  Which oer the warriors shoulder took its course
  And spent in empty air its dying force
  Not so Patroclus nevererring dart
  Aimd at his breast it pierced a mortal part
  Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart
  Then as the mountain oak or poplar tall
  Or pine fit mast for some great admiral
  Nods to the axe till with a groaning sound
  It sinks and spreads its honours on the ground
  Thus fell the king and laid on earth supine
  Before his chariot stretchd his form divine
  He graspd the dust distaind with streaming gore
  And pale in death lay groaning on the shore
  So lies a bull beneath the lions paws
  While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws
  The trembling limbs and sucks the smoking blood
  Deep groans and hollow roars rebellow through the wood

  Then to the leader of the Lycian band
  The dying chief addressd his last command
  Glaucus be bold thy task be first to dare
  The glorious dangers of destructive war
  To lead my troops to combat at their head
  Incite the living and supply the dead
  Tell them I charged them with my latest breath
  Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedons death
  What grief what shame must Glaucus undergo
  If these spoild arms adorn a Grecian foe
  Then as a friend and as a warrior fight
  Defend my body conquer in my right
  That taught by great examples all may try
  Like thee to vanquish or like me to die
  He ceased the Fates suppressd his labouring breath
  And his eyes darkend with the shades of death
  The insulting victor with disdain bestrode
  The prostrate prince and on his bosom trod
  Then drew the weapon from his panting heart
  The reeking fibres clinging to the dart
  From the wide wound gushd out a stream of blood
  And the soul issued in the purple flood
  His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain
  Unguided now their mighty master slain
  Allimpotent of aid transfixd with grief
  Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief
  His painful arm yet useless with the smart
  Inflicted late by Teucers deadly dart
  Supported on his better hand he stayd
  To Phoebus then twas all he could he prayd

  Allseeing monarch whether Lycias coast
  Or sacred Ilion thy bright presence boast
  Powerful alike to ease the wretchs smart
  O hear me god of every healing art
  Lo stiff with clotted blood and pierced with pain
  That thrills my arm and shoots through every vein
  I stand unable to sustain the spear
  And sigh at distance from the glorious war
  Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid
  Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid
  But thou O god of health thy succour lend
  To guard the relics of my slaughterd friend
  For thou though distant canst restore my might
  To head my Lycians and support the fight

  Apollo heard and suppliant as he stood
  His heavenly hand restraind the flux of blood
  He drew the dolours from the wounded part
  And breathed a spirit in his rising heart
  Renewd by art divine the hero stands
  And owns the assistance of immortal hands
  First to the fight his native troops he warms
  Then loudly calls on Troys vindictive arms
  With ample strides he stalks from place to place
  Now fires Agenor now Polydamas
  Ćneas next and Hector he accosts
  Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts

  What thoughts regardless chief thy breast employ
  Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy
  Those generous friends who from their country far
  Breathe their brave souls out in anothers war
  See where in dust the great Sarpedon lies
  In action valiant and in council wise
  Who guarded right and kept his people free
  To all his Lycians lost and lost to thee
  Stretchd by Patroclus arm on yonder plains
  O save from hostile rage his loved remains
  Ah let not Greece his conquerd trophies boast
  Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost

  He spoke each leader in his grief partook
  Troy at the loss through all her legions shook
  Transfixd with deep regret they view oerthrown
  At once his countrys pillar and their own
  A chief who led to Troys beleaguerd wall
  A host of heroes and outshined them all
  Fired they rush on first Hector seeks the foes
  And with superior vengeance greatly glows

  But oer the dead the fierce Patroclus stands
  And rousing Ajax roused the listening bands

  Heroes be men be what you were before
  Or weigh the great occasion and be more
  The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield
  Lies pale in death extended on the field
  To guard his body Troy in numbers flies
  Tis half the glory to maintain our prize
  Haste strip his arms the slaughter round him spread
  And send the living Lycians to the dead

  The heroes kindle at his fierce command
  The martial squadrons close on either hand
  Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms
  Thessalia there and Greece oppose their arms
  With horrid shouts they circle round the slain
  The clash of armour rings oer all the plain
  Great Jove to swell the horrors of the fight
  Oer the fierce armies pours pernicious night
  And round his son confounds the warring hosts
  His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts

  Now Greece gives way and great Epigeus falls
  Agacleus son from Budiums lofty walls
  Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came
  To Peleus and the silverfooted dame
  Now sent to Troy Achilles arms to aid
  He pays due vengeance to his kinsmans shade
  Soon as his luckless hand had touchd the dead
  A rocks large fragment thunderd on his head
  Hurld by Hectorean force it cleft in twain
  His shatterd helm and stretchd him oer the slain

  Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came
  And like an eagle darting at his game
  Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band
  What grief thy heart what fury urged thy hand
  O generous Greek when with full vigour thrown
  At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone
  Which sunk him to the dead when Troy too near
  That arm drew back and Hector learnd to fear
  Far as an able hand a lance can throw
  Or at the lists or at the fighting foe
  So far the Trojans from their lines retired
  Till Glaucus turning all the rest inspired
  Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage
  The only hope of Chalcons trembling age
  Wide oer the land was stretchd his large domain
  With stately seats and riches blest in vain
  Him bold with youth and eager to pursue
  The flying Lycians Glaucus met and slew
  Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound
  He fell and falling made the fields resound
  The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain
  With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain
  And crowd to spoil the dead the Greeks oppose
  An iron circle round the carcase grows

  Then brave Laogonus resignd his breath
  Despatchd by Merion to the shades of death
  On Idas holy hill he made abode
  The priest of Jove and honourd like his god
  Between the jaw and ear the javelin went
  The soul exhaling issued at the vent
  His spear Aeneas at the victor threw
  Who stooping forward from the death withdrew
  The lance hissd harmless oer his covering shield
  And trembling struck and rooted in the field
  There yet scarce spent it quivers on the plain
  Sent by the great Aeneas arm in vain
  Swift as thou art the raging hero cries
  And skilld in dancing to dispute the prize
  My spear the destined passage had it found
  Had fixd thy active vigour to the ground

  O valiant leader of the Dardan host
  Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast
  Strong as you are tis mortal force you trust
  An arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust
  And if to this my lance thy fate be given
  Vain are thy vaunts success is still from heaven
  This instant sends thee down to Plutos coast
  Mine is the glory his thy parting ghost

  O friend Menoetius son this answer gave
  With words to combat ill befits the brave
  Not empty boasts the sons of Troy repel
  Your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell
  To speak beseems the council but to dare
  In glorious action is the task of war

  This said Patroclus to the battle flies
  Great Merion follows and new shouts arise
  Shields helmets rattle as the warriors close
  And thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows
  As through the shrilling vale or mountain ground
  The labours of the woodmans axe resound
  Blows following blows are heard reechoing wide
  While crackling forests fall on every side
  Thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms
  So fell the warriors and so rung their arms

  Now great Sarpedon on the sandy shore
  His heavenly form defaced with dust and gore
  And stuck with darts by warring heroes shed
  Lies undistinguishd from the vulgar dead
  His longdisputed corse the chiefs enclose
  On every side the busy combat grows
  Thick as beneath some shepherds thatchd abode
  The pails high foaming with a milky flood
  The buzzing flies a persevering train
  Incessant swarm and chased return again

  Jove viewd the combat with a stern survey
  And eyes that flashd intolerable day
  Fixd on the field his sight his breast debates
  The vengeance due and meditates the fates
  Whether to urge their prompt effect and call
  The force of Hector to Patroclus fall
  This instant see his shortlived trophies won
  And stretch him breathless on his slaughterd son
  Or yet with many a souls untimely flight
  Augment the fame and horror of the fight
  To crown Achilles valiant friend with praise
  At length he dooms and that his last of days
  Shall set in glory bids him drive the foe
  Nor unattended see the shades below
  Then Hectors mind he fills with dire dismay
  He mounts his car and calls his hosts away
  Sunk with Troys heavy fates he sees decline
  The scales of Jove and pants with awe divine

  Then nor before the hardy Lycians fled
  And left their monarch with the common dead
  Around in heaps on heaps a dreadful wall
  Of carnage rises as the heroes fall
  So Jove decreed At length the Greeks obtain
  The prize contested and despoil the slain
  The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne
  Patroclus ships the glorious spoils adorn

  Then thus to Phoebus in the realms above
  Spoke from his throne the cloudcompelling Jove
  Descend my Phoebus on the Phrygian plain
  And from the fight convey Sarpedon slain
  Then bathe his body in the crystal flood
  With dust dishonourd and deformd with blood
  Oer all his limbs ambrosial odours shed
  And with celestial robes adorn the dead
  Those rites discharged his sacred corse bequeath
  To the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death
  They to his friends the immortal charge shall bear
  His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear
  What honour mortals after death receive
  Those unavailing honours we may give

         SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO LYCIA


  Apollo bows and from mount Idas height
  Swift to the field precipitates his flight
  Thence from the war the breathless hero bore
  Veild in a cloud to silver Simois shore
  There bathed his honourable wounds and dressd
  His manly members in the immortal vest
  And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews
  Restores his freshness and his form renews
  Then Sleep and Death two twins of winged race
  Of matchless swiftness but of silent pace
  Received Sarpedon at the gods command
  And in a moment reachd the Lycian land
  The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid
  Where endless honours wait the sacred shade

  Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains
  With foaming coursers and with loosend reins
  Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew
  Ah blind to fate thy headlong fury flew
  Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain
  Vain was thy friends command thy courage vain
  For he the god whose counsels uncontrolld
  Dismay the mighty and confound the bold
  The god who gives resumes and orders all
  He urged thee on and urged thee on to fall

  Who first brave hero by that arm was slain
  Who last beneath thy vengeance pressd the plain
  When heaven itself thy fatal fury led
  And calld to fill the number of the dead
  Adrestus first Autonous then succeeds
  Echeclus follows next young Megas bleeds
  Epistor Melanippus bite the ground
  The slaughter Elasus and Mulius crownd
  Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night
  The rest dispersing trust their fates to flight

  Now Troy had stoopd beneath his matchless power
  But flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower
  Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook246
  His blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook
  He tried the fourth when bursting from the cloud
  A more than mortal voice was heard aloud

  Patroclus cease this heavendefended wall
  Defies thy lance not fated yet to fall
  Thy friend thy greater far it shall withstand
  Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles hand

  So spoke the god who darts celestial fires
  The Greek obeys him and with awe retires
  While Hector checking at the Scaean gates
  His panting coursers in his breast debates
  Or in the field his forces to employ
  Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy
  Thus while he thought beside him Phoebus stood
  In Asius shape who reigned by Sangars flood
  Thy brother Hecuba from Dymas sprung
  A valiant warrior haughty bold and young
  Thus he accosts him What a shameful sight
  God is it Hector that forbears the fight
  Were thine my vigour this successful spear
  Should soon convince thee of so false a fear
  Turn thee ah turn thee to the field of fame
  And in Patroclus blood efface thy shame
  Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed
  And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed

  So spoke the inspiring god then took his flight
  And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight
  He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car
  The lash resounds the coursers rush to war
  The god the Grecians sinking souls depressd
  And pourd swift spirits through each Trojan breast
  Patroclus lights impatient for the fight
  A spear his left a stone employs his right
  With all his nerves he drives it at the foe
  Pointed above and rough and gross below
  The falling ruin crushd Cebrions head
  The lawless offspring of king Priams bed
  His front brows eyes one undistinguishd wound
  The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground
  The charioteer while yet he held the rein
  Struck from the car falls headlong on the plain
  To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides
  While the proud victor thus his fall derides

  Good heaven what active feats yon artist shows
  What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes
  Mark with what ease they sink into the sand
  Pity that all their practice is by land

  Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize
  To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies
  Swift as a lion terrible and bold
  That sweeps the field depopulates the fold
  Pierced through the dauntless heart then tumbles slain
  And from his fatal courage finds his bane
  At once bold Hector leaping from his car
  Defends the body and provokes the war
  Thus for some slaughterd hind with equal rage
  Two lordly rulers of the wood engage
  Stung with fierce hunger each the prey invades
  And echoing roars rebellow through the shades
  Stern Hector fastens on the warriors head
  And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead
  While all around confusion rage and fright
  Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight
  So pent by hills the wild winds roar aloud
  In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood
  Leaves arms and trees aloft in air are blown
  The broad oaks crackle and the Sylvans groan
  This way and that the rattling thicket bends
  And the whole forest in one crash descends
  Not with less noise with less tumultuous rage
  In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage
  Darts showerd on darts now round the carcase ring
  Now flights of arrows bounding from the string
  Stones follow stones some clatter on the fields
  Some hard and heavy shake the sounding shields
  But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains
  Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains
  And stretchd in death forgets the guiding reins

  Now flaming from the zenith Sol had driven
  His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven
  While on each host with equal tempests fell
  The showering darts and numbers sank to hell
  But when his evening wheels oerhung the main
  Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train
  Then from amidst the tumult and alarms
  They draw the conquerd corse and radiant arms
  Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows
  And breathing slaughter pours amid the foes
  Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew
  And thrice three heroes at each onset slew
  There ends thy glory there the Fates untwine
  The last black remnant of so bright a line
  Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way
  Death calls and heaven allows no longer day

  For lo the god in dusky clouds enshrined
  Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind
  The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel
  His eyes flash sparkles his stunnd senses reel
  In giddy darkness far to distance flung
  His bounding helmet on the champaign rung
  Achilles plume is staind with dust and gore
  That plume which never stoopd to earth before
  Long used untouchd in fighting fields to shine
  And shade the temples of the mad divine
  Jove dooms it now on Hectors helm to nod
  Not longfor fate pursues him and the god

  His spear in shivers falls his ample shield
  Drops from his arm his baldric strows the field
  The corslet his astonishd breast forsakes
  Loose is each joint each nerve with horror shakes
  Stupid he stares and allassistless stands
  Such is the force of more than mortal hands

  A Dardan youth there was well known to fame
  From Panthus sprung Euphorbus was his name
  Famed for the manage of the foaming horse
  Skilld in the dart and matchless in the course
  Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car
  While yet he learnd his rudiments of war
  His venturous spear first drew the heros gore
  He struck he wounded but he durst no more
  Nor though disarmd Patroclus fury stood
  But swift withdrew the longprotended wood
  And turnd him short and herded in the crowd
  Thus by an arm divine and mortal spear
  Wounded at once Patroclus yields to fear
  Retires for succour to his social train
  And flies the fate which heaven decreed in vain
  Stern Hector as the bleeding chief he views
  Breaks through the ranks and his retreat pursues
  The lance arrests him with a mortal wound
  He falls earth thunders and his arms resound
  With him all Greece was sunk that moment all
  Her yetsurviving heroes seemd to fall
  So scorchd with heat along the desert score
  The roaming lion meets a bristly boar
  Fast by the spring they both dispute the flood
  With flaming eyes and jaws besmeard with blood
  At length the sovereign savage wins the strife
  And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life
  Patroclus thus so many chiefs oerthrown
  So many lives effused expires his own
  As dying now at Hectors feet he lies
  He sternly views him and triumphant cries

  Lie there Patroclus and with thee the joy
  Thy pride once promised of subverting Troy
  The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames
  And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames
  Unthinking man I fought those towers to free
  And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee
  But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made
  Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid
  Though much at parting that great chief might say
  And much enjoin thee this important day

  Return not my brave friend perhaps he said
  Without the bloody arms of Hector dead
  He spoke Patroclus marchd and thus he sped

  Supine and wildly gazing on the skies
  With faint expiring breath the chief replies

  Vain boaster cease and know the powers divine
  Joves and Apollos is this deed not thine
  To heaven is owed whateer your own you call
  And heaven itself disarmd me ere my fall
  Had twenty mortals each thy match in might
  Opposed me fairly they had sunk in fight
  By fate and Phoebus was I first oerthrown
  Euphorbus next the third mean part thy own
  But thou imperious hear my latest breath
  The gods inspire it and it sounds thy death
  Insulting man thou shalt be soon as I
  Black fate oerhangs thee and thy hour draws nigh
  Even now on lifes last verge I see thee stand
  I see thee fall and by Achilles hand

  He faints the soul unwilling wings her way
  The beauteous body left a load of clay
  Flits to the lone uncomfortable coast
  A naked wandering melancholy ghost

  Then Hector pausing as his eyes he fed
  On the pale carcase thus addressd the dead

  From whence this boding speech the stern decree
  Of death denounced or why denounced to me
  Why not as well Achilles fate be given
  To Hectors lance Who knows the will of heaven

  Pensive he said then pressing as he lay
  His breathless bosom tore the lance away
  And upwards cast the corse the reeking spear
  He shakes and charges the bold charioteer
  But swift Automedon with loosend reins
  Rapt in the chariot oer the distant plains
  Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove
  The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove

ARGUMENT

THE SEVENTH BATTLE FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUSTHE ACTS OF MENELAUS

Menelaus upon the death of Patroclus defends his body from the enemy
Euphorbus who attempts it is slain Hector advancing Menelaus retires
but soon returns with Ajax and drives him off This Glaucus objects to
Hector as a flight who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from
Patroclus and renews the battle The Greeks give way till Ajax rallies
them Aeneas sustains the Trojans Aeneas and Hector Attempt the chariot
of Achilles which is borne off by Automedon The horses of Achilles
deplore the loss of Patroclus Jupiter covers his body with a thick
darkness the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion Menelaus sends
Antilochus to Achilles with the news of Patroclus death then returns to
the fight where though attacked with the utmost fury he and Meriones
assisted by the Ajaces bear off the body to the ships

The time is the evening of the eightandtwentieth day The scene lies in
the fields before Troy

  On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread
  Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead
  Great Menelaus touchd with generous woe
  Springs to the front and guards him from the foe
  Thus round her newfallen young the heifer moves
  Fruit of her throes and firstborn of her loves
  And anxious helpless as he lies and bare
  Turns and returns her with a mothers care
  Opposed to each that near the carcase came
  His broad shield glimmers and his lances flame

  The son of Panthus skilld the dart to send
  Eyes the dead hero and insults the friend
  This hand Atrides laid Patroclus low
  Warrior desist nor tempt an equal blow
  To me the spoils my prowess won resign
  Depart with life and leave the glory mine

  The Trojan thus the Spartan monarch burnd
  With generous anguish and in scorn returnd
  Laughst thou not Jove from thy superior throne
  When mortals boast of prowess not their own
  Not thus the lion glories in his might
  Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight
  Nor thus the boar those terrors of the plain
  Man only vaunts his force and vaunts in vain
  But far the vainest of the boastful kind
  These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind
  Yet twas but late beneath my conquering steel
  This boasters brother Hyperenor fell
  Against our arm which rashly he defied
  Vain was his vigour and as vain his pride
  These eyes beheld him on the dust expire
  No more to cheer his spouse or glad his sire
  Presumptuous youth like his shall be thy doom
  Go wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom
  Or while thou mayst avoid the threatend fate
  Fools stay to feel it and are wise too late

  Unmoved Euphorbus thus That action known
  Come for my brothers blood repay thy own
  His weeping father claims thy destined head
  And spouse a widow in her bridal bed
  On these thy conquerd spoils I shall bestow
  To soothe a consorts and a parents woe
  No longer then defer the glorious strife
  Let heaven decide our fortune fame and life

  Swift as the word the missile lance he flings
  The wellaimd weapon on the buckler rings
  But blunted by the brass innoxious falls
  On Jove the father great Atrides calls
  Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain
  It pierced his throat and bent him to the plain
  Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound
  Prone sinks the warrior and his arms resound
  The shining circlets of his golden hair
  Which even the Graces might be proud to wear
  Instarrd with gems and gold bestrow the shore
  With dust dishonourd and deformd with gore

  As the young olive in some sylvan scene
  Crownd by fresh fountains with eternal green
  Lifts the gay head in snowy flowerets fair
  And plays and dances to the gentle air
  When lo a whirlwind from high heaven invades
  The tender plant and withers all its shades
  It lies uprooted from its genial bed
  A lovely ruin now defaced and dead
  Thus young thus beautiful Euphorbus lay
  While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away
  Proud of his deed and glorious in the prize
  Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies
  Flies as before some mountain lions ire
  The village curs and trembling swains retire
  When oer the slaughterd bull they hear him roar
  And see his jaws distil with smoking gore
  All pale with fear at distance scatterd round
  They shout incessant and the vales resound

  Meanwhile Apollo viewd with envious eyes
  And urged great Hector to dispute the prize
  In Mentes shape beneath whose martial care
  The rough Ciconians learnd the trade of war247
  Forbear he cried with fruitless speed to chase
  Achilles coursers of ethereal race
  They stoop not these to mortal mans command
  Or stoop to none but great Achilles hand
  Too long amused with a pursuit so vain
  Turn and behold the brave Euphorbus slain
  By Sparta slain for ever now suppressd
  The fire which burnd in that undaunted breast

  Thus having spoke Apollo wingd his flight
  And mixd with mortals in the toils of fight
  His words infixd unutterable care
  Deep in great Hectors soul through all the war
  He darts his anxious eye and instant viewd
  The breathless hero in his blood imbued
  Forth welling from the wound as prone he lay
  And in the victors hands the shining prey
  Sheathd in bright arms through cleaving ranks he flies
  And sends his voice in thunder to the skies
  Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent
  It flew and fired the nations as it went
  Atrides from the voice the storm divined
  And thus explored his own unconquerd mind

  Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain
  Slain in my cause and for my honour slain
  Desert the arms the relics of my friend
  Or singly Hector and his troops attend
  Sure where such partial favour heaven bestowd
  To brave the hero were to brave the god
  Forgive me Greece if once I quit the field
  Tis not to Hector but to heaven I yield
  Yet nor the god nor heaven should give me fear
  Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear
  Still would we turn still battle on the plains
  And give Achilles all that yet remains
  Of his and our Patroclus This no more
  The time allowd Troy thickend on the shore
  A sable scene The terrors Hector led
  Slow he recedes and sighing quits the dead

  So from the fold the unwilling lion parts
  Forced by loud clamours and a storm of darts
  He flies indeed but threatens as he flies
  With heart indignant and retorted eyes
  Now enterd in the Spartan ranks he turnd
  His manly breast and with new fury burnd
  Oer all the black battalions sent his view
  And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew
  Where labouring on the left the warrior stood
  All grim in arms and coverd oer with blood
  There breathing courage where the god of day
  Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay

  To him the king Oh Ajax oh my friend
  Haste and Patroclus loved remains defend
  The body to Achilles to restore
  Demands our care alas we can no more
  For naked now despoiled of arms he lies
  And Hector glories in the dazzling prize
  He said and touchd his heart The raging pair
  Pierced the thick battle and provoke the war
  Already had stern Hector seized his head
  And doomd to Trojan gods the unhappy dead
  But soon as Ajax reard his towerlike shield
  Sprung to his car and measured back the field
  His train to Troy the radiant armour bear
  To stand a trophy of his fame in war

  Meanwhile great Ajax his broad shield displayd
  Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade
  And now before and now behind he stood
  Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood
  With many a step the lioness surrounds
  Her tawny young beset by men and hounds
  Elate her heart and rousing all her powers
  Dark oer the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours
  Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows
  With great revenge and feeds his inward woes

  But Glaucus leader of the Lycian aids
  On Hector frowning thus his flight upbraids

  Where now in Hector shall we Hector find
  A manly form without a manly mind
  Is this O chief a heros boasted fame
  How vain without the merit is the name
  Since battle is renounced thy thoughts employ
  What other methods may preserve thy Troy
  Tis time to try if Ilions state can stand
  By thee alone nor ask a foreign hand
  Mean empty boast but shall the Lycians stake
  Their lives for you those Lycians you forsake
  What from thy thankless arms can we expect
  Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect
  Say shall our slaughterd bodies guard your walls
  While unrevengd the great Sarpedon falls
  Even where he died for Troy you left him there
  A feast for dogs and all the fowls of air
  On my command if any Lycian wait
  Hence let him march and give up Troy to fate
  Did such a spirit as the gods impart
  Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart
  Such as should burn in every soul that draws
  The sword for glory and his countrys cause
  Even yet our mutual arms we might employ
  And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy
  Oh were Patroclus ours we might obtain
  Sarpedons arms and honourd corse again
  Greece with Achilles friend should be repaid
  And thus due honours purchased to his shade
  But words are vainLet Ajax once appear
  And Hector trembles and recedes with fear
  Thou darst not meet the terrors of his eye
  And lo already thou preparst to fly

  The Trojan chief with fixd resentment eyed
  The Lycian leader and sedate replied

  Say is it just my friend that Hectors ear
  From such a warrior such a speech should hear
  I deemd thee once the wisest of thy kind
  But ill this insult suits a prudent mind
  I shun great Ajax I desert my train
  Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain
  I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds
  And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds
  But Joves high will is ever uncontrolld
  The strong he withers and confounds the bold
  Now crowns with fame the mighty man and now
  Strikes the fresh garland from the victors brow
  Come through yon squadrons let us hew the way
  And thou be witness if I fear today
  If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread
  Or yet their hero dare defend the dead

  Then turning to the martial hosts he cries
  Ye Trojans Dardans Lycians and allies
  Be men my friends in action as in name
  And yet be mindful of your ancient fame
  Hector in proud Achilles arms shall shine
  Torn from his friend by right of conquest mine

  He strode along the field as thus he said
  The sable plumage nodded oer his head
  Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look
  One instant saw one instant overtook
  The distant band that on the sandy shore
  The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore
  There his own mail unbraced the field bestrowd
  His train to Troy conveyd the massy load
  Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands
  The work and present of celestial hands
  By aged Peleus to Achilles given
  As first to Peleus by the court of heaven
  His fathers arms not long Achilles wears
  Forbid by fate to reach his fathers years

  Him proud in triumph glittering from afar
  The god whose thunder rends the troubled air
  Beheld with pity as apart he sat
  And conscious lookd through all the scene of fate
  He shook the sacred honours of his head
  Olympus trembled and the godhead said
  Ah wretched man unmindful of thy end
  A moments glory and what fates attend
  In heavenly panoply divinely bright
  Thou standst and armies tremble at thy sight
  As at Achilles self beneath thy dart
  Lies slain the great Achilles dearer part
  Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn
  Which once the greatest of mankind had worn
  Yet live I give thee one illustrious day
  A blaze of glory ere thou fadst away
  For ah no more Andromache shall come
  With joyful tears to welcome Hector home
  No more officious with endearing charms
  From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides arms

  Then with his sable brow he gave the nod
  That seals his word the sanction of the god
  The stubborn arms by Joves command disposed
  Conformd spontaneous and around him closed
  Filld with the god enlarged his members grew
  Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew
  The blood in brisker tides began to roll
  And Mars himself came rushing on his soul
  Exhorting loud through all the field he strode
  And lookd and moved Achilles or a god
  Now Mesthles Glaucus Medon he inspires
  Now Phorcys Chromius and Hippothous fires
  The great Thersilochus like fury found
  Asteropaeus kindled at the sound
  And Ennomus in augury renownd

  Hear all ye hosts and hear unnumberd bands
  Of neighbouring nations or of distant lands
  Twas not for state we summond you so far
  To boast our numbers and the pomp of war
  Ye came to fight a valiant foe to chase
  To save our present and our future race
  Tor this our wealth our products you enjoy
  And glean the relics of exhausted Troy
  Now then to conquer or to die prepare
  To die or conquer are the terms of war
  Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slain
  Whoeer shall drag him to the Trojan train
  With Hectors self shall equal honours claim
  With Hector part the spoil and share the fame

  Fired by his words the troops dismiss their fears
  They join they thicken they protend their spears
  Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array
  And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey
  Vain hope what numbers shall the field oerspread
  What victims perish round the mighty dead

  Great Ajax markd the growing storm from far
  And thus bespoke his brother of the war
  Our fatal day alas is come my friend
  And all our wars and glories at an end
  Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain
  Condemnd to vultures on the Trojan plain
  We too must yield the same sad fate must fall
  On thee on me perhaps my friend on all
  See what a tempest direful Hector spreads
  And lo it bursts it thunders on our heads
  Call on our Greeks if any hear the call
  The bravest Greeks this hour demands them all

  The warrior raised his voice and wide around
  The field reechoed the distressful sound
  O chiefs O princes to whose hand is given
  The rule of men whose glory is from heaven
  Whom with due honours both Atrides grace
  Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race
  All whom this wellknown voice shall reach from far
  All whom I see not through this cloud of war
  Come all let generous rage your arms employ
  And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy

  Oilean Ajax first the voice obeyd
  Swift was his pace and ready was his aid
  Next him Idomeneus more slow with age
  And Merion burning with a heros rage
  The longsucceeding numbers who can name
  But all were Greeks and eager all for fame
  Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng
  Whole Troy embodied rushd with shouts along
  Thus when a mountain billow foams and raves
  Where some swoln river disembogues his waves
  Full in the mouth is stoppd the rushing tide
  The boiling ocean works from side to side
  The river trembles to his utmost shore
  And distant rocks rebellow to the roar

  Nor less resolved the firm Achaian band
  With brazen shields in horrid circle stand
  Jove pouring darkness oer the mingled fight
  Conceals the warriors shining helms in night
  To him the chief for whom the hosts contend
  Had lived not hateful for he lived a friend
  Dead he protects him with superior care
  Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air

             Illustration FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS

                     FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS


  The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain
  Repulsed they yield the Trojans seize the slain
  Then fierce they rally to revenge led on
  By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon
  Ajax to Peleus son the second name
  In graceful stature next and next in fame
  With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore
  So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar
  And rudely scatters for a distance round
  The frighted hunter and the baying hound
  The son of Lethus brave Pelasgus heir
  Hippothous draggd the carcase through the war
  The sinewy ankles bored the feet he bound
  With thongs inserted through the double wound
  Inevitable fate oertakes the deed
  Doomd by great Ajax vengeful lance to bleed
  It cleft the helmets brazen cheeks in twain
  The shatterd crest and horsehair strow the plain
  With nerves relaxd he tumbles to the ground
  The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound
  He drops Patroclus foot and oer him spread
  Now lies a sad companion of the dead
  Far from Larissa lies his native air
  And ill requites his parents tender care
  Lamented youth in lifes first bloom he fell
  Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell

  Once more at Ajax Hectors javelin flies
  The Grecian marking as it cut the skies
  Shunnd the descending death which hissing on
  Stretchd in the dust the great Iphytus son
  Schedius the brave of all the Phocian kind
  The boldest warrior and the noblest mind
  In little Panope for strength renownd
  He held his seat and ruled the realms around
  Plunged in his throat the weapon drank his blood
  And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood
  In clanging arms the hero fell and all
  The fields resounded with his weighty fall

  Phorcys as slain Hippothous he defends
  The Telamonian lance his belly rends
  The hollow armour burst before the stroke
  And through the wound the rushing entrails broke
  In strong convulsions panting on the sands
  He lies and grasps the dust with dying hands

  Struck at the sight recede the Trojan train
  The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain
  And now had Troy by Greece compelld to yield
  Fled to her ramparts and resignd the field
  Greece in her native fortitude elate
  With Jove averse had turnd the scale of fate
  But Phoebus urged Ćneas to the fight
  He seemd like aged Periphas to sight
  A herald in Anchises love grown old
  Revered for prudence and with prudence bold

  Thus heWhat methods yet O chief remain
  To save your Troy though heaven its fall ordain
  There have been heroes who by virtuous care
  By valour numbers and by arts of war
  Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state
  And gaind at length the glorious odds of fate
  But you when fortune smiles when Jove declares
  His partial favour and assists your wars
  Your shameful efforts gainst yourselves employ
  And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy

  Ćneas through the form assumed descries
  The power conceald and thus to Hector cries
  Oh lasting shame to our own fears a prey
  We seek our ramparts and desert the day
  A god nor is he less my bosom warms
  And tells me Jove asserts the Trojan arms

  He spoke and foremost to the combat flew
  The bold example all his hosts pursue
  Then first Leocritus beneath him bled
  In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede
  Who viewd his fall and grieving at the chance
  Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance
  The whirling lance with vigorous force addressd
  Descends and pants in Apisaons breast
  From rich Paeonias vales the warrior came
  Next thee Asteropeus in place and fame
  Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain
  And rushd to combat but he rushd in vain
  Indissolubly firm around the dead
  Rank within rank on buckler buckler spread
  And hemmd with bristled spears the Grecians stood
  A brazen bulwark and an iron wood
  Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care
  And in an orb contracts the crowded war
  Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall
  And stands the centre and the soul of all
  Fixd on the spot they war and wounded wound
  A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground
  On heaps the Greeks on heaps the Trojans bled
  And thickening round them rise the hills of dead

  Greece in close order and collected might
  Yet suffers least and sways the wavering fight
  Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns
  And now it rises now it sinks by turns
  In one thick darkness all the fight was lost
  The sun the moon and all the ethereal host
  Seemd as extinct day ravishd from their eyes
  And all heavens splendours blotted from the skies
  Such oer Patroclus body hung the night
  The rest in sunshine fought and open light
  Unclouded there the aerial azure spread
  No vapour rested on the mountains head
  The golden sun pourd forth a stronger ray
  And all the broad expansion flamed with day
  Dispersed around the plain by fits they fight
  And here and there their scatterd arrows light
  But death and darkness oer the carcase spread
  There burnd the war and there the mighty bled

  Meanwhile the sons of Nestor in the rear
  Their fellows routed toss the distant spear
  And skirmish wide so Nestor gave command
  When from the ships he sent the Pylian band
  The youthful brothers thus for fame contend
  Nor knew the fortune of Achilles friend
  In thought they viewd him still with martial joy
  Glorious in arms and dealing death to Troy

  But round the corse the heroes pant for breath
  And thick and heavy grows the work of death
  Oerlabourd now with dust and sweat and gore
  Their knees their legs their feet are covered oer
  Drops follow drops the clouds on clouds arise
  And carnage clogs their hands and darkness fills their eyes
  As when a slaughterd bulls yet reeking hide
  Straind with full force and tuggd from side to side
  The brawny curriers stretch and labour oer
  The extended surface drunk with fat and gore
  So tugging round the corse both armies stood
  The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood
  While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ
  Now to the ships to force it now to Troy
  Not Pallas self her breast when fury warms
  Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms
  Could blame this scene such rage such horror reignd
  Such Jove to honour the great dead ordaind

  Achilles in his ships at distance lay
  Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day
  He yet unconscious of Patroclus fall
  In dust extended under Ilions wall
  Expects him glorious from the conquered plain
  And for his wishd return prepares in vain
  Though well he knew to make proud Ilion bend
  Was more than heaven had destined to his friend
  Perhaps to him this Thetis had reveald
  The rest in pity to her son conceald

  Still raged the conflict round the hero dead
  And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled
  Cursed be the man even private Greeks would say
  Who dares desert this welldisputed day
  First may the cleaving earth before our eyes
  Gape wide and drink our blood for sacrifice
  First perish all ere haughty Troy shall boast
  We lost Patroclus and our glory lost

  Thus they while with one voice the Trojans said
  Grant this day Jove or heap us on the dead

  Then clash their sounding arms the clangours rise
  And shake the brazen concave of the skies

  Meantime at distance from the scene of blood
  The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood
  Their godlike master slain before their eyes
  They wept and shared in human miseries248
  In vain Automedon now shakes the rein
  Now plies the lash and soothes and threats in vain
  Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go
  Restive they stood and obstinate in woe
  Still as a tombstone never to be moved
  On some good man or woman unreproved
  Lays its eternal weight or fixd as stands
  A marble courser by the sculptors hands
  Placed on the heros grave Along their face
  The big round drops coursed down with silent pace
  Conglobing on the dust Their manes that late
  Circled their arched necks and waved in state
  Traild on the dust beneath the yoke were spread
  And prone to earth was hung their languid head
  Nor Jove disdaind to cast a pitying look
  While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke

  Unhappy coursers of immortal strain
  Exempt from age and deathless now in vain
  Did we your race on mortal man bestow
  Only alas to share in mortal woe
  For ah what is there of inferior birth
  That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth
  What wretched creature of what wretched kind
  Than man more weak calamitous and blind
  A miserable race but cease to mourn
  For not by you shall Priams son be borne
  High on the splendid car one glorious prize
  He rashly boasts the rest our will denies
  Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart
  Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart
  Automedon your rapid flight shall bear
  Safe to the navy through the storm of war
  For yet tis given to Troy to ravage oer
  The field and spread her slaughters to the shore
  The sun shall see her conquer till his fall
  With sacred darkness shades the face of all

  He said and breathing in the immortal horse
  Excessive spirit urged them to the course
  From their high manes they shake the dust and bear
  The kindling chariot through the parted war
  So flies a vulture through the clamorous train
  Of geese that scream and scatter round the plain
  From danger now with swiftest speed they flew
  And now to conquest with like speed pursue
  Sole in the seat the charioteer remains
  Now plies the javelin now directs the reins
  Him brave Alcimedon beheld distressd
  Approachd the chariot and the chief addressd

  What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare
  Alone unaided in the thickest war
  Alas thy friend is slain and Hector wields
  Achilles arms triumphant in the fields

  In happy time the charioteer replies
  The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes
  No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains
  Or holds their fury in suspended reins
  Patroclus while he lived their rage could tame
  But now Patroclus is an empty name
  To thee I yield the seat to thee resign
  The ruling charge the task of fight be mine

  He said Alcimedon with active heat
  Snatches the reins and vaults into the seat
  His friend descends The chief of Troy descried
  And calld Ćneas fighting near his side

  Lo to my sight beyond our hope restored
  Achilles car deserted of its lord
  The glorious steeds our ready arms invite
  Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight
  Can such opponents stand when we assail
  Unite thy force my friend and we prevail

  The son of Venus to the counsel yields
  Then oer their backs they spread their solid shields
  With brass refulgent the broad surface shined
  And thick bullhides the spacious concave lined
  Them Chromius follows Aretus succeeds
  Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds
  In vain brave youths with glorious hopes ye burn
  In vain advance not fated to return

  Unmovd Automedon attends the fight
  Implores the Eternal and collects his might
  Then turning to his friend with dauntless mind
  Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind
  Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow
  For hard the fight determined is the foe
  Tis Hector comes and when he seeks the prize
  War knows no mean he wins it or he dies

  Then through the field he sends his voice aloud
  And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd
  With great Atrides Hither turn he said
  Turn where distress demands immediate aid
  The dead encircled by his friends forego
  And save the living from a fiercer foe
  Unhelpd we stand unequal to engage
  The force of Hector and Ćneas rage
  Yet mighty as they are my force to prove
  Is only mine the event belongs to Jove

  He spoke and high the sounding javelin flung
  Which passd the shield of Aretus the young
  It pierced his belt embossd with curious art
  Then in the lower belly struck the dart
  As when a ponderous axe descending full
  Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull249
  Struck twixt the horns he springs with many a bound
  Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground
  Thus fell the youth the air his soul received
  And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved

  Now at Automedon the Trojan foe
  Discharged his lance the meditated blow
  Stooping he shunnd the javelin idly fled
  And hissd innoxious oer the heros head
  Deep rooted in the ground the forceful spear
  In long vibrations spent its fury there
  With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed
  But each brave Ajax heard and interposed
  Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood
  But left their slain companion in his blood
  His arms Automedon divests and cries
  Accept Patroclus this mean sacrifice
  Thus have I soothed my griefs and thus have paid
  Poor as it is some offering to thy shade

  So looks the lion oer a mangled boar
  All grim with rage and horrible with gore
  High on the chariot at one bound he sprung
  And oer his seat the bloody trophies hung

  And now Minerva from the realms of air
  Descends impetuous and renews the war
  For pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid
  The lord of thunders sent the blueeyed maid
  As when high Jove denouncing future woe
  Oer the dark clouds extends his purple bow
  In sign of tempests from the troubled air
  Or from the rage of man destructive war
  The drooping cattle dread the impending skies
  And from his halftilld field the labourer flies
  In such a form the goddess round her drew
  A livid cloud and to the battle flew
  Assuming Phoenix shape on earth she falls
  And in his wellknown voice to Sparta calls
  And lies Achilles friend beloved by all
  A prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall
  What shame o Greece for future times to tell
  To thee the greatest in whose cause he fell
  O chief O father Atreus son replies
  O full of days by long experience wise
  What more desires my soul than here unmoved
  To guard the body of the man I loved
  Ah would Minerva send me strength to rear
  This wearied arm and ward the storm of war
  But Hector like the rage of fire we dread
  And Joves own glories blaze around his head

  Pleased to be first of all the powers addressd
  She breathes new vigour in her heros breast
  And fills with keen revenge with fell despite
  Desire of blood and rage and lust of fight
  So burns the vengeful hornet soul all oer
  Repulsed in vain and thirsty still of gore
  Bold son of air and heat on angry wings
  Untamed untired he turns attacks and stings
  Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew
  And sent his soul with every lance he threw

  There stood a Trojan not unknown to fame
  Aetions son and Podes was his name
  With riches honourd and with courage blessd
  By Hector loved his comrade and his guest
  Through his broad belt the spear a passage found
  And ponderous as he falls his arms resound
  Sudden at Hectors side Apollo stood
  Like Phaenops Asius son appeard the god
  Asius the great who held his wealthy reign
  In fair Abydos by the rolling main

  Oh prince he cried Oh foremost once in fame
  What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name
  Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield
  A chief once thought no terror of the field
  Yet singly now the longdisputed prize
  He bears victorious while our army flies
  By the same arm illustrious Podes bled
  The friend of Hector unrevenged is dead
  This heard oer Hector spreads a cloud of woe
  Rage lifts his lance and drives him on the foe

  But now the Eternal shook his sable shield
  That shaded Ide and all the subject field
  Beneath its ample verge A rolling cloud
  Involved the mount the thunder roard aloud
  The affrighted hills from their foundations nod
  And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god
  At one regard of his allseeing eye
  The vanquishd triumph and the victors fly

  Then trembled Greece the flight Peneleus led
  For as the brave Boeotian turnd his head
  To face the foe Polydamas drew near
  And razed his shoulder with a shortend spear
  By Hector wounded Leitus quits the plain
  Pierced through the wrist and raging with the pain
  Grasps his once formidable lance in vain

  As Hector followd Idomen addressd
  The flaming javelin to his manly breast
  The brittle point before his corslet yields
  Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields
  High on his chariots the Cretan stood
  The son of Priam whirld the massive wood
  But erring from its aim the impetuous spear
  Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer
  Of martial Merion Coeranus his name
  Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame
  On foot bold Merion fought and now laid low
  Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe
  But the brave squire the ready coursers brought
  And with his life his masters safety bought
  Between his cheek and ear the weapon went
  The teeth it shatterd and the tongue it rent
  Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain
  His dying hand forgets the falling rein
  This Merion reaches bending from the car
  And urges to desert the hopeless war
  Idomeneus consents the lash applies
  And the swift chariot to the navy flies

  Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried
  And conquest shifting to the Trojan side
  Turnd by the hand of Jove Then thus begun
  To Atreuss seed the godlike Telamon

  Alas who sees not Joves almighty hand
  Transfers the glory to the Trojan band
  Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart
  He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart
  Not so our spears incessant though they rain
  He suffers every lance to fall in vain
  Deserted of the god yet let us try
  What human strength and prudence can supply
  If yet this honourd corse in triumph borne
  May glad the fleets that hope not our return
  Who tremble yet scarce rescued from their fates
  And still hear Hector thundering at their gates
  Some hero too must be despatchd to bear
  The mournful message to Pelides ear
  For sure he knows not distant on the shore
  His friend his loved Patroclus is no more
  But such a chief I spy not through the host
  The men the steeds the armies all are lost
  In general darknessLord of earth and air
  Oh king Oh father hear my humble prayer
  Dispel this cloud the light of heaven restore
  Give me to see and Ajax asks no more
  If Greece must perish we thy will obey
  But let us perish in the face of day

  With tears the hero spoke and at his prayer
  The god relenting cleard the clouded air
  Forth burst the sun with allenlightening ray
  The blaze of armour flashd against the day
  Now now Atrides cast around thy sight
  If yet Antilochus survives the fight
  Let him to great Achilles ear convey
  The fatal newsAtrides hastes away

  So turns the lion from the nightly fold
  Though high in courage and with hunger bold
  Long galld by herdsmen and long vexd by hounds
  Stiff with fatigue and fretted sore with wounds
  The darts fly round him from a hundred hands
  And the red terrors of the blazing brands
  Till late reluctant at the dawn of day
  Sour he departs and quits the untasted prey
  So moved Atrides from his dangerous place
  With weary limbs but with unwilling pace
  The foe he feard might yet Patroclus gain
  And much admonishd much adjured his train

  O guard these relics to your charge consignd
  And bear the merits of the dead in mind
  How skilld he was in each obliging art
  The mildest manners and the gentlest heart
  He was alas but fate decreed his end
  In death a hero as in life a friend

  So parts the chief from rank to rank he flew
  And round on all sides sent his piercing view
  As the bold bird endued with sharpest eye
  Of all that wings the mid aerial sky
  The sacred eagle from his walks above
  Looks down and sees the distant thicket move
  Then stoops and sousing on the quivering hare
  Snatches his life amid the clouds of air
  Not with less quickness his exerted sight
  Passd this and that way through the ranks of fight
  Till on the left the chief he sought he found
  Cheering his men and spreading deaths around

  To him the king Beloved of Jove draw near
  For sadder tidings never touchd thy ear
  Thy eyes have witnessd what a fatal turn
  How Ilion triumphs and the Achaians mourn
  This is not all Patroclus on the shore
  Now pale and dead shall succour Greece no more
  Fly to the fleet this instant fly and tell
  The sad Achilles how his lovedone fell
  He too may haste the naked corse to gain
  The arms are Hectors who despoild the slain

  The youthful warrior heard with silent woe
  From his fair eyes the tears began to flow
  Big with the mighty grief he strove to say
  What sorrow dictates but no word found way
  To brave Laodocus his arms he flung
  Who near him wheeling drove his steeds along
  Then ran the mournful message to impart
  With tearful eyes and with dejected heart

  Swift fled the youth nor Menelaus stands
  Though sore distressd to aid the Pylian bands
  But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain
  Himself returns to his Patroclus slain
  Gone is Antilochus the hero said
  But hope not warriors for Achilles aid
  Though fierce his rage unbounded be his woe
  Unarmd he fights not with the Trojan foe
  Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain
  Tis our own vigour must the dead regain
  And save ourselves while with impetuous hate
  Troy pours along and this way rolls our fate

  Tis well said Ajax be it then thy care
  With Merions aid the weighty corse to rear
  Myself and my bold brother will sustain
  The shock of Hector and his charging train
  Nor fear we armies fighting side by side
  What Troy can dare we have already tried
  Have tried it and have stood The hero said
  High from the ground the warriors heave the dead
  A general clamour rises at the sight
  Loud shout the Trojans and renew the fight
  Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood
  With rage insatiate and with thirst of blood
  Voracious hounds that many a length before
  Their furious hunters drive the wounded boar
  But if the savage turns his glaring eye
  They howl aloof and round the forest fly
  Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour
  Wave their thick falchions and their javelins shower
  But Ajax turning to their fears they yield
  All pale they tremble and forsake the field

  While thus aloft the heros corse they bear
  Behind them rages all the storm of war
  Confusion tumult horror oer the throng
  Of men steeds chariots urged the rout along
  Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire
  To whelm some city under waves of fire
  Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes
  Now crack the blazing temples of the gods
  The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls
  And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles
  The heroes sweat beneath their honourd load
  As when two mules along the rugged road
  From the steep mountain with exerted strength
  Drag some vast beam or masts unwieldy length
  Inly they groan big drops of sweat distil
  The enormous timber lumbering down the hill
  So theseBehind the bulk of Ajax stands
  And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands
  Thus when a river swelld with sudden rains
  Spreads his broad waters oer the level plains
  Some interposing hill the stream divides
  And breaks its force and turns the winding tides
  Still close they follow close the rear engage
  Aeneas storms and Hector foams with rage
  While Greece a heavy thick retreat maintains
  Wedged in one body like a flight of cranes
  That shriek incessant while the falcon hung
  High on poised pinions threats their callow young
  So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly
  Such the wild terror and the mingled cry
  Within without the trench and all the way
  Strowd in bright heaps their arms and armour lay
  Such horror Jove impressd yet still proceeds
  The work of death and still the battle bleeds

ARGUMENT

THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN

The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by Antilochus
Thetis hearing his lamentations comes with all her sea nymphs to
comfort him The speeches of the mother and son on this occasion Iris
appears to Achilles by the command of Juno and orders him to show himself
at the head of the intrenchments The sight of him turns the fortunes of
the day and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks The
Trojans call a council where Hector and Polydamas disagree in their
opinions but the advice of the former prevails to remain encamped in the
field The grief of Achilles over the body of Patroclus

Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son The
description of the wonderful works of Vulcan and lastly that noble one
of the shield of Achilles

The latter part of the nineandtwentieth day and the night ensuing take
up this book the scene is at Achilles tent on the seashore from whence
it changes to the palace of Vulcan

  Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns250
  And now it rises now it sinks by turns
  Meanwhile where Hellesponts broad waters flow
  Stood Nestors son the messenger of woe
  There sat Achilles shaded by his sails
  On hoisted yards extended to the gales
  Pensive he sat for all that fate designd
  Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind
  Thus to his soul he said Ah what constrains
  The Greeks late victors now to quit the plains
  Is this the day which heaven so long ago
  Ordaind to sink me with the weight of woe
  So Thetis warnd when by a Trojan hand
  The bravest of the Myrmidonian band
  Should lose the light Fulfilled is that decree
  Fallen is the warrior and Patroclus he
  In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain
  And warnd to shun Hectorean force in vain

  Thus while he thinks Antilochus appears
  And tells the melancholy tale with tears
  Sad tidings son of Peleus thou must hear
  And wretched I the unwilling messenger
  Dead is Patroclus For his corse they fight
  His naked corse his arms are Hectors right

  A sudden horror shot through all the chief
  And wrappd his senses in the cloud of grief
  Cast on the ground with furious hands he spread
  The scorching ashes oer his graceful head
  His purple garments and his golden hairs
  Those he deforms with dust and these he tears
  On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw
  And rolld and grovelld as to earth he grew
  The virgin captives with disorderd charms
  Won by his own or by Patroclus arms
  Rushd from their tents with cries and gathering round
  Beat their white breasts and fainted on the ground
  While Nestors son sustains a manlier part
  And mourns the warrior with a warriors heart
  Hangs on his arms amidst his frantic woe
  And oft prevents the meditated blow

  Far in the deep abysses of the main251
  With hoary Nereus and the watery train
  The mothergoddess from her crystal throne
  Heard his loud cries and answerd groan for groan
  The circling Nereids with their mistress weep
  And all the seagreen sisters of the deep
  Thalia Glauce every watery name
  Nesaea mild and silver Spio came
  Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh
  And the blue languish of soft Alias eye
  Their locks Actaea and Limnoria rear
  Then Proto Doris Panope appear

  Their sister looks Dexamene the slow
  And swift Dynamene now cut the tides

  Bright Galatea quits her pearly bed
  These Orythia Clymene attend
  Maera Amphinome the train extend
  And black Janira and Janassa fair
  And Amatheia with her amber hair
  All these and all that deep in ocean held
  Their sacred seats the glimmering grotto filld
  Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe
  Till Thetis sorrows thus began to flow

  Hear me and judge ye sisters of the main
  How just a cause has Thetis to complain
  How wretched were I mortal were my fate
  How more than wretched in the immortal state
  Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came
  The bravest far that ever bore the name
  Like some fair olive by my careful hand
  He grew he flourishd and adornd the land
  To Troy I sent him but the fates ordain
  He never never must return again
  So short a space the light of heaven to view
  So short alas and filld with anguish too
  Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore
  I cannot ease them but I must deplore
  I go at least to bear a tender part
  And mourn my lovedone with a mothers heart

  She said and left the caverns of the main
  All bathed in tears the melancholy train
  Attend her way Wideopening part the tides
  While the long pomp the silver wave divides
  Approaching now they touchd the Trojan land
  Then two by two ascended up the strand
  The immortal mother standing close beside
  Her mournful offspring to his sighs replied
  Along the coast their mingled clamours ran
  And thus the silverfooted dame began

  Why mourns my son thy late preferrd request
  The god has granted and the Greeks distressd
  Why mourns my son thy anguish let me share
  Reveal the cause and trust a parents care

  He deeply groaningTo this cureless grief
  Not even the Thunderers favour brings relief
  PatroclusAhsay goddess can I boast
  A pleasure now revenge itself is lost
  Patroclus loved of all my martial train
  Beyond mankind beyond myself is slain
  Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestowd
  On Peleus Hector bears the glorious load
  Cursed be that day when all the powers above
  Thy charms submitted to a mortal love
  O hadst thou still a sister of the main
  Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign
  And happier Peleus less ambitious led
  A mortal beauty to his equal bed
  Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb
  Had caused such sorrows past and woes to come
  For soon alas that wretched offspring slain
  New woes new sorrows shall create again
  Tis not in fate the alternate now to give
  Patroclus dead Achilles hates to live
  Let me revenge it on proud Hectors heart
  Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart
  On these conditions will I breathe till then
  I blush to walk among the race of men

  A flood of tears at this the goddess shed
  Ah then I see thee dying see thee dead
  When Hector falls thou diestLet Hector die
  And let me fall Achilles made reply
  Far lies Patroclus from his native plain
  He fell and falling wishd my aid in vain
  Ah then since from this miserable day
  I cast all hope of my return away
  Since unrevenged a hundred ghosts demand
  The fate of Hector from Achilles hand
  Since here for brutal courage far renownd
  I live an idle burden to the ground
  Others in council famed for nobler skill
  More useful to preserve than I to kill
  Let meBut oh ye gracious powers above
  Wrath and revenge from men and gods remove
  Far far too dear to every mortal breast
  Sweet to the soul as honey to the taste
  Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind
  From fiery blood and darkening all the mind
  Me Agamemnon urged to deadly hate
  Tis pastI quell it I resign to fate
  YesI will meet the murderer of my friend
  Or if the gods ordain it meet my end
  The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun
  The great Alcides Joves unequalld son
  To Junos hate at length resignd his breath
  And sunk the victim of allconquering death
  So shall Achilles fall stretchd pale and dead
  No more the Grecian hope or Trojan dread
  Let me this instant rush into the fields
  And reap what glory lifes short harvest yields
  Shall I not force some widowd dame to tear
  With frantic hands her long dishevelld hair
  Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs
  And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes
  Yes I shall give the fair those mournful charms
  In vain you hold meHence my arms my arms
  Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide
  That all shall know Achilles swells the tide

  My son coerulean Thetis made reply
  To fate submitting with a secret sigh
  The host to succour and thy friends to save
  Is worthy thee the duty of the brave
  But canst thou naked issue to the plains
  Thy radiant arms the Trojan foe detains
  Insulting Hector bears the spoils on high
  But vainly glories for his fate is nigh
  Yet yet awhile thy generous ardour stay
  Assured I meet thee at the dawn of day
  Charged with refulgent arms a glorious load
  Vulcanian arms the labour of a god

  Then turning to the daughters of the main
  The goddess thus dismissd her azure train

  Ye sister Nereids to your deeps descend
  Haste and our fathers sacred seat attend
  I go to find the architect divine
  Where vast Olympus starry summits shine
  So tell our hoary sireThis charge she gave
  The seagreen sisters plunge beneath the wave
  Thetis once more ascends the blessd abodes
  And treads the brazen threshold of the gods

  And now the Greeks from furious Hectors force
  Urge to broad Hellespont their headlong course
  Nor yet their chiefs Patroclus body bore
  Safe through the tempest to the tented shore
  The horse the foot with equal fury joind
  Pourd on the rear and thunderd close behind
  And like a flame through fields of ripend corn
  The rage of Hector oer the ranks was borne
  Thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew
  Thrice to the skies the Trojan clamours flew
  As oft the Ajaces his assault sustain
  But checkd he turns repulsd attacks again
  With fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires
  Nor yields a step nor from his post retires
  So watchful shepherds strive to force in vain
  The hungry lion from a carcase slain
  Even yet Patroclus had he borne away
  And all the glories of the extended day
  Had not high Juno from the realms of air
  Secret despatchd her trusty messenger
  The various goddess of the showery bow
  Shot in a whirlwind to the shore below
  To great Achilles at his ships she came
  And thus began the manycolourd dame

  Rise son of Peleus rise divinely brave
  Assist the combat and Patroclus save
  For him the slaughter to the fleet they spread
  And fall by mutual wounds around the dead
  To drag him back to Troy the foe contends
  Nor with his death the rage of Hector ends
  A prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lie
  And marks the place to fix his head on high
  Rise and prevent if yet you think of fame
  Thy friends disgrace thy own eternal shame

  Who sends thee goddess from the ethereal skies
  Achilles thus And Iris thus replies

  I come Pelides from the queen of Jove
  The immortal empress of the realms above
  Unknown to him who sits remote on high
  Unknown to all the synod of the sky
  Thou comest in vain he cries with fury warmd
  Arms I have none and can I fight unarmd
  Unwilling as I am of force I stay
  Till Thetis bring me at the dawn of day
  Vulcanian arms what other can I wield
  Except the mighty Telamonian shield
  That in my friends defence has Ajax spread
  While his strong lance around him heaps the dead
  The gallant chief defends Menoetius son
  And does what his Achilles should have done

  Thy want of arms said Iris well we know
  But though unarmd yet clad in terrors go
  Let but Achilles oer yon trench appear
  Proud Troy shall tremble and consent to fear
  Greece from one glance of that tremendous eye
  Shall take new courage and disdain to fly

  She spoke and passd in air The hero rose
  Her aegis Pallas oer his shoulder throws
  Around his brows a golden cloud she spread
  A stream of glory flamed above his head
  As when from some beleaguerd town arise
  The smokes high curling to the shaded skies
  Seen from some island oer the main afar
  When men distressd hang out the sign of war
  Soon as the sun in ocean hides his rays
  Thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze
  With longprojected beams the seas are bright
  And heavens high arch reflects the ruddy light
  So from Achilles head the splendours rise
  Reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies
  Forth marchd the chief and distant from the crowd
  High on the rampart raised his voice aloud
  With her own shout Minerva swells the sound
  Troy starts astonishd and the shores rebound
  As the loud trumpets brazen mouth from far
  With shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war
  Struck from the walls the echoes float on high
  And the round bulwarks and thick towers reply
  So high his brazen voice the hero reard
  Hosts droppd their arms and trembled as they heard
  And back the chariots roll and coursers bound
  And steeds and men lie mingled on the ground
  Aghast they see the living lightnings play
  And turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray
  Thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised
  And thrice they fled confounded and amazed
  Twelve in the tumult wedged untimely rushd
  On their own spears by their own chariots crushd
  While shielded from the darts the Greeks obtain
  The longcontended carcase of the slain

  A lofty bier the breathless warrior bears
  Around his sad companions melt in tears
  But chief Achilles bending down his head
  Pours unavailing sorrows oer the dead
  Whom late triumphant with his steeds and car
  He sent refulgent to the field of war
  Unhappy change now senseless pale he found
  Stretchd forth and gashd with many a gaping wound

  Meantime unwearied with his heavenly way
  In oceans waves the unwilling light of day
  Quenchd his red orb at Junos high command
  And from their labours eased the Achaian band
  The frighted Trojans panting from the war
  Their steeds unharnessd from the weary car
  A sudden council calld each chief appeard
  In haste and standing for to sit they feard
  Twas now no season for prolongd debate
  They saw Achilles and in him their fate
  Silent they stood Polydamas at last
  Skilld to discern the future by the past
  The son of Panthus thus expressd his fears
  The friend of Hector and of equal years
  The selfsame night to both a being gave

  In free debate my friends your sentence speak
  For me I move before the morning break
  To raise our camp too dangerous here our post
  Far from Troy walls and on a naked coast
  I deemd not Greece so dreadful while engaged
  In mutual feuds her king and hero raged
  Then while we hoped our armies might prevail
  We boldly campd beside a thousand sail
  I dread Pelides now his rage of mind
  Not long continues to the shores confined
  Nor to the fields where long in equal fray
  Contending nations won and lost the day
  For Troy for Troy shall henceforth be the strife
  And the hard contest not for fame but life
  Haste then to Ilion while the favouring night
  Detains these terrors keeps that arm from fight
  If but the morrows sun behold us here
  That arm those terrors we shall feel not fear
  And hearts that now disdain shall leap with joy
  If heaven permit them then to enter Troy
  Let not my fatal prophecy be true
  Nor what I tremble but to think ensue
  Whatever be our fate yet let us try
  What force of thought and reason can supply
  Let us on counsel for our guard depend
  The town her gates and bulwarks shall defend
  When morning dawns our wellappointed powers
  Arrayd in arms shall line the lofty towers
  Let the fierce hero then when fury calls
  Vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls
  Or fetch a thousand circles round the plain
  Till his spent coursers seek the fleet again
  So may his rage be tired and labourd down
  And dogs shall tear him ere he sack the town

  Return said Hector fired with stern disdain
  What coop whole armies in our walls again
  Wast not enough ye valiant warriors say
  Nine years imprisond in those towers ye lay
  Wide oer the world was Ilion famed of old
  For brass exhaustless and for mines of gold
  But while inglorious in her walls we stayd
  Sunk were her treasures and her stores decayd
  The Phrygians now her scatterd spoils enjoy
  And proud Maeonia wastes the fruits of Troy
  Great Jove at length my arms to conquest calls
  And shuts the Grecians in their wooden walls
  Darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite
  Flies any Trojan I shall stop his flight
  To better counsel then attention lend
  Take due refreshment and the watch attend
  If there be one whose riches cost him care
  Forth let him bring them for the troops to share
  Tis better generously bestowd on those
  Than left the plunder of our countrys foes
  Soon as the morn the purple orient warms
  Fierce on yon navy will we pour our arms
  If great Achilles rise in all his might
  His be the danger I shall stand the fight
  Honour ye gods or let me gain or give
  And live he glorious whosoeer shall live
  Mars is our common lord alike to all
  And oft the victor triumphs but to fall

  The shouting host in loud applauses joind
  So Pallas robbd the many of their mind
  To their own sense condemnd and left to choose
  The worst advice the better to refuse

  While the long night extends her sable reign
  Around Patroclus mournd the Grecian train
  Stern in superior grief Pelides stood
  Those slaughtering arms so used to bathe in blood
  Now clasp his claycold limbs then gushing start
  The tears and sighs burst from his swelling heart
  The lion thus with dreadful anguish stung
  Roars through the desert and demands his young
  When the grim savage to his rifled den
  Too late returning snuffs the track of men
  And oer the vales and oer the forest bounds
  His clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds
  So grieves Achilles and impetuous vents
  To all his Myrmidons his loud laments

  In what vain promise gods did I engage
  When to console Menoetius feeble age
  I vowed his muchloved offspring to restore
  Charged with rich spoils to fair Opuntias shore252
  But mighty Jove cuts short with just disdain
  The long long views of poor designing man
  One fate the warrior and the friend shall strike
  And Troys black sands must drink our blood alike
  Me too a wretched mother shall deplore
  An aged father never see me more
  Yet my Patroclus yet a space I stay
  Then swift pursue thee on the darksome way
  Ere thy dear relics in the grave are laid
  Shall Hectors head be offerd to thy shade
  That with his arms shall hang before thy shrine
  And twelve the noblest of the Trojan line
  Sacred to vengeance by this hand expire
  Their lives effused around thy flaming pyre
  Thus let me lie till then thus closely pressd
  Bathe thy cold face and sob upon thy breast
  While Trojan captives here thy mourners stay
  Weep all the night and murmur all the day
  Spoils of my arms and thine when wasting wide
  Our swords kept time and conquerd side by side

  He spoke and bade the sad attendants round
  Cleanse the pale corse and wash each honourd wound
  A massy caldron of stupendous frame
  They brought and placed it oer the rising flame
  Then heapd the lighted wood the flame divides
  Beneath the vase and climbs around the sides
  In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream
  The boiling water bubbles to the brim
  The body then they bathe with pious toil
  Embalm the wounds anoint the limbs with oil
  High on a bed of state extended laid
  And decent coverd with a linen shade
  Last oer the dead the milkwhite veil they threw
  That done their sorrows and their sighs renew

  Meanwhile to Juno in the realms above
  His wife and sister spoke almighty Jove
  At last thy will prevails great Peleus son
  Rises in arms such grace thy Greeks have won
  Say for I know not is their race divine
  And thou the mother of that martial line

  What words are these the imperial dame replies
  While anger flashd from her majestic eyes
  Succour like this a mortal arm might lend
  And such success mere human wit attend
  And shall not I the second power above
  Heavens queen and consort of the thundering Jove
  Say shall not I one nations fate command
  Not wreak my vengeance on one guilty land

  Thetis replied the god our powers may claim
  An everdear an everhonourd name
  When my proud mother hurld me from the sky
  My awkward form it seems displeased her eye
  She and Eurynome my griefs redressd
  And soft received me on their silver breast
  Even then these arts employd my infant thought
  Chains bracelets pendants all their toys I wrought
  Nine years kept secret in the dark abode
  Secure I lay conceald from man and god
  Deep in a cavernd rock my days were led

  I only I of all the watery race
  By force subjected to a mans embrace
  Who sinking now with age and sorrow pays

  Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came
  The bravest sure that ever bore the name
  Like some fair plant beneath my careful hand
  He grew he flourishd and he graced the land
  To Troy I sent him but his native shore
  Never ah never shall receive him more
  Even while he lives he wastes with secret woe
  Nor I a goddess can retard the blow

  The king of nations forced his royal slave
  For this he grieved and till the Greeks oppressd
  Required his arm he sorrowd unredressd

  He marches combats almost conquers Troy
  Then slain by Phoebus Hector had the name

  And to the field in martial pomp restore
  To shine with glory till he shines no more

  Secure what Vulcan can is ever thine
  O could I hide him from the Fates as well
  Or with these hands the cruel stroke repel
  As I shall forge most envied arms the gaze
  Of wondering ages and the worlds amaze

  Thus having said the father of the fires
  To the black labours of his forge retires
  Soon as he bade them blow the bellows turnd
  Their iron mouths and where the furnace burnd
  Resounding breathed at once the blast expires
  And twenty forges catch at once the fires

  And great Orions more refulgent beam

  Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain
  Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main

  Two cities radiant on the shield appear

  And solemn dance and hymeneal rite

  And form a ring with sceptres in their hands
  On seats of stone within the sacred place254

  And all amidst them dead the shepherd swains

  They fight they fall beside the silver flood
  The waving silver seemd to blush with blood
  There Tumult there Contention stood confessd
  One reard a dagger at a captives breast
  One held a living foe that freshly bled
  With newmade wounds another draggd a dead
  Now here now there the carcases they tore
  Fate stalkd amidst them grim with human gore
  And the whole war came out and met the eye
  And each bold figure seemd to live or die

  Sheaves heapd on sheaves here thicken up the ground

  The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare
  The reapers due repast the womans care

  Next ripe in yellow gold a vineyard shines
  Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines
  A deeper dye the dangling clusters show
  And curld on silver props in order glow
  A darker metal mixd intrenchd the place
  And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace
  To this one pathway gently winding leads
  Where march a train with baskets on their heads
  Fair maids and blooming youths that smiling bear
  The purple product of the autumnal year
  To these a youth awakes the warbling strings
  Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings
  In measured dance behind him move the train
  Tune soft the voice and answer to the strain

  Here herds of oxen march erect and bold
  Rear high their horns and seem to low in gold
  And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores
  A rapid torrent through the rushes roars
  Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand
  And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band
  Two lions rushing from the wood appeard
  And seized a bull the master of the herd
  He roard in vain the dogs the men withstood
  They tore his flesh and drank his sable blood
  The dogs oft cheerd in vain desert the prey
  Dread the grim terrors and at distance bay

  Next this the eye the art of Vulcan leads
  Deep through fair forests and a length of meads
  And stalls and folds and scatterd cots between
  And fleecy flocks that whiten all the scene

  A figured dance succeeds such once was seen
  In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen
  Formd by Daedalean art a comely band
  Of youths and maidens bounding hand in hand
  The maids in soft simars of linen dressd
  The youths all graceful in the glossy vest
  Of those the locks with flowery wreath inrolld
  Of these the sides adornd with swords of gold
  That glittering gay from silver belts depend
  Now all at once they rise at once descend
  With welltaught feet now shape in oblique ways
  Confusedly regular the moving maze
  Now forth at once too swift for sight they spring
  And undistinguishd blend the flying ring
  So whirls a wheel in giddy circle tossd
  And rapid as it runs the single spokes are lost
  The gazing multitudes admire around
  Two active tumblers in the centre bound
  Now high now low their pliant limbs they bend
  And general songs the sprightly revel end

  Thus the broad shield complete the artist crownd
  With his last hand and pourd the ocean round
  In living silver seemd the waves to roll
  And beat the bucklers verge and bound the whole

  This done whateer a warriors use requires
  He forged the cuirass that outshone the fires
  The greaves of ductile tin the helm impressd
  With various sculpture and the golden crest
  At Thetis feet the finished labour lay
  She as a falcon cuts the aerial way
  Swift from Olympus snowy summit flies
  And bears the blazing present through the skies257

ARGUMENT

THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON

Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan She preserves the body
of his friend from corruption and commands him to assemble the army to
declare his resentment at an end Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly
reconciled the speeches presents and ceremonies on that occasion
Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle
till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of Ulysses The
presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles where Briseis laments over
the body of Patroclus The hero obstinately refuses all repast and gives
himself up to lamentations for his friend Minerva descends to strengthen
him by the order of Jupiter He arms for the fight his appearance
described He addresses himself to his horses and reproaches them with
the death of Patroclus One of them is miraculously endued with voice and
inspired to prophesy his fate but the hero not astonished by that
prodigy rushes with fury to the combat

The thirteenth day The scene is on the seashore

  Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head
  Above the waves that blushd with early red
  With newborn day to gladden mortal sight
  And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light
  The immortal arms the goddessmother bears
  Swift to her son her son she finds in tears
  Stretchd oer Patroclus corse while all the rest
  Their sovereigns sorrows in their own expressd
  A ray divine her heavenly presence shed
  And thus his hand soft touching Thetis said

  Suppress my son this rage of grief and know
  It was not man but heaven that gave the blow
  Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestowd
  Arms worthy thee or fit to grace a god

  Then drops the radiant burden on the ground
  Clang the strong arms and ring the shores around
  Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise
  And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes
  Unmoved the hero kindles at the show
  And feels with rage divine his bosom glow
  From his fierce eyeballs living flames expire
  And flash incessant like a stream of fire
  He turns the radiant gift and feeds his mind
  On all the immortal artist had designd

  Goddess he cried these glorious arms that shine
  With matchless art confess the hand divine
  Now to the bloody battle let me bend
  But ah the relics of my slaughterd friend
  In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled
  Shall flies and worms obscene pollute the dead

  That unavailing care be laid aside
  The azure goddess to her son replied
  Whole years untouchd uninjured shall remain
  Fresh as in life the carcase of the slain
  But go Achilles as affairs require
  Before the Grecian peers renounce thine ire
  Then uncontrolld in boundless war engage
  And heaven with strength supply the mighty rage

                 THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES


  Then in the nostrils of the slain she pourd
  Nectareous drops and rich ambrosia showerd
  Oer all the corse The flies forbid their prey
  Untouchd it rests and sacred from decay
  Achilles to the strand obedient went
  The shores resounded with the voice he sent
  The heroes heard and all the naval train
  That tend the ships or guide them oer the main
  Alarmd transported at the wellknown sound
  Frequent and full the great assembly crownd
  Studious to see the terror of the plain
  Long lost to battle shine in arms again
  Tydides and Ulysses first appear
  Lame with their wounds and leaning on the spear
  These on the sacred seats of council placed
  The king of men Atrides came the last
  He too sore wounded by Agenors son
  Achilles rising in the midst begun

  O monarch better far had been the fate
  Of thee of me of all the Grecian state
  If ere the day when by mad passion swayd
  Rash we contended for the blackeyed maid
  Preventing Dian had despatchd her dart
  And shot the shining mischief to the heart
  Then many a hero had not pressd the shore
  Nor Troys glad fields been fattend with our gore
  Long long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail
  And sad posterity repeat the tale
  But this no more the subject of debate
  Is past forgotten and resignd to fate
  Why should alas a mortal man as I
  Burn with a fury that can never die
  Here then my anger ends let war succeed
  And even as Greece has bled let Ilion bleed
  Now call the hosts and try if in our sight
  Troy yet shall dare to camp a second night
  I deem their mightiest when this arm he knows
  Shall scape with transport and with joy repose

  He said his finishd wrath with loud acclaim
  The Greeks accept and shout Pelides name
  When thus not rising from his lofty throne
  In state unmoved the king of men begun

  Hear me ye sons of Greece with silence hear
  And grant your monarch an impartial ear
  Awhile your loud untimely joy suspend
  And let your rash injurious clamours end
  Unruly murmurs or illtimed applause
  Wrong the best speaker and the justest cause
  Nor charge on me ye Greeks the dire debate
  Know angry Jove and allcompelling Fate
  With fell Erinnys urged my wrath that day
  When from Achilles arms I forced the prey
  What then could I against the will of heaven
  Not by myself but vengeful Ate driven
  She Joves dread daughter fated to infest
  The race of mortals enterd in my breast
  Not on the ground that haughty fury treads
  But prints her lofty footsteps on the heads
  Of mighty men inflicting as she goes
  Longfestering wounds inextricable woes
  Of old she stalkd amid the bright abodes
  And Jove himself the sire of men and gods
  The worlds great ruler felt her venomd dart
  Deceived by Junos wiles and female art
  For when Alcmenas nine long months were run
  And Jove expected his immortal son
  To gods and goddesses the unruly joy
  He showd and vaunted of his matchless boy
  From us he said this day an infant springs
  Fated to rule and born a king of kings
  Saturnia askd an oath to vouch the truth
  And fix dominion on the favourd youth
  The Thunderer unsuspicious of the fraud
  Pronounced those solemn words that bind a god
  The joyful goddess from Olympus height
  Swift to Achaian Argos bent her flight
  Scarce seven moons gone lay Stheneluss wife
  She pushd her lingering infant into life
  Her charms Alcmenas coming labours stay
  And stop the babe just issuing to the day
  Then bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind
  A youth said she of Joves immortal kind
  Is this day born from Sthenelus he springs
  And claims thy promise to be king of kings
  Grief seized the Thunderer by his oath engaged
  Stung to the soul he sorrowd and he raged
  From his ambrosial head where perchd she sate
  He snatchd the furygoddess of debate
  The dread the irrevocable oath he swore
  The immortal seats should neer behold her more
  And whirld her headlong down for ever driven
  From bright Olympus and the starry heaven
  Thence on the nether world the fury fell
  Ordaind with mans contentious race to dwell
  Full oft the god his sons hard toils bemoand
  Cursed the dire fury and in secret groand258
  Even thus like Jove himself was I misled
  While raging Hector heapd our camps with dead
  What can the errors of my rage atone
  My martial troops my treasures are thy own
  This instant from the navy shall be sent
  Whateer Ulysses promised at thy tent
  But thou appeased propitious to our prayer
  Resume thy arms and shine again in war

   O king of nations whose superior sway
  Returns Achilles all our hosts obey
  To keep or send the presents be thy care
  To us tis equal all we ask is war
  While yet we talk or but an instant shun
  The fight our glorious work remains undone
  Let every Greek who sees my spear confound
  The Trojan ranks and deal destruction round
  With emulation what I act survey
  And learn from thence the business of the day

  The son of Peleus thus and thus replies
  The great in councils Ithacus the wise
  Though godlike thou art by no toils oppressd
  At least our armies claim repast and rest
  Long and laborious must the combat be
  When by the gods inspired and led by thee
  Strength is derived from spirits and from blood
  And those augment by generous wine and food
  What boastful son of war without that stay
  Can last a hero through a single day
  Courage may prompt but ebbing out his strength
  Mere unsupported man must yield at length
  Shrunk with dry famine and with toils declined
  The drooping body will desert the mind
  But built anew with strengthconferring fare
  With limbs and soul untamed he tires a war
  Dismiss the people then and give command
  With strong repast to hearten every band
  But let the presents to Achilles made
  In full assembly of all Greece be laid
  The king of men shall rise in public sight
  And solemn swear observant of the rite
  That spotless as she came the maid removes
  Pure from his arms and guiltless of his loves
  That done a sumptuous banquet shall be made
  And the full price of injured honour paid
  Stretch not henceforth O prince thy sovereign might
  Beyond the bounds of reason and of right
  Tis the chief praise that eer to kings belongd
  To right with justice whom with power they wrongd

  To him the monarch Just is thy decree
  Thy words give joy and wisdom breathes in thee
  Each due atonement gladly I prepare
  And heaven regard me as I justly swear
  Here then awhile let Greece assembled stay
  Nor great Achilles grudge this short delay
  Till from the fleet our presents be conveyd
  And Jove attesting the firm compact made
  A train of noble youths the charge shall bear
  These to select Ulysses be thy care
  In order rankd let all our gifts appear
  And the fair train of captives close the rear
  Talthybius shall the victim boar convey
  Sacred to Jove and yon bright orb of day

  For this the stern Ćacides replies
  Some less important season may suffice
  When the stern fury of the war is oer
  And wrath extinguishd burns my breast no more
  By Hector slain their faces to the sky
  All grim with gaping wounds our heroes lie
  Those call to war and might my voice incite
  Now now this instant shall commence the fight
  Then when the days complete let generous bowls
  And copious banquets glad your weary souls
  Let not my palate know the taste of food
  Till my insatiate rage be cloyd with blood
  Pale lies my friend with wounds disfigured oer
  And his cold feet are pointed to the door
  Revenge is all my soul no meaner care
  Interest or thought has room to harbour there
  Destruction be my feast and mortal wounds
  And scenes of blood and agonizing sounds

  O first of Greeks Ulysses thus rejoind
  The best and bravest of the warrior kind
  Thy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine
  But old experience and calm wisdom mine
  Then hear my counsel and to reason yield
  The bravest soon are satiate of the field
  Though vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain
  The bloody harvest brings but little gain
  The scale of conquest ever wavering lies
  Great Jove but turns it and the victor dies
  The great the bold by thousands daily fall
  And endless were the grief to weep for all
  Eternal sorrows what avails to shed
  Greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead
  Enough when death demands the brave to pay
  The tribute of a melancholy day
  One chief with patience to the grave resignd
  Our care devolves on others left behind
  Let generous food supplies of strength produce
  Let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice
  Let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow
  And pour new furies on the feebler foe
  Yet a short interval and none shall dare
  Expect a second summons to the war
  Who waits for that the dire effects shall find
  If trembling in the ships he lags behind
  Embodied to the battle let us bend
  And all at once on haughty Troy descend

  And now the delegates Ulysses sent
  To bear the presents from the royal tent
  The sons of Nestor Phyleus valiant heir
  Thias and Merion thunderbolts of war
  With Lycomedes of Creiontian strain
  And Melanippus formd the chosen train
  Swift as the word was given the youths obeyd
  Twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid
  A row of six fair tripods then succeeds
  And twice the number of highbounding steeds
  Seven captives next a lovely line compose
  The eighth Briseis like the blooming rose
  Closed the bright band great Ithacus before
  First of the train the golden talents bore
  The rest in public view the chiefs dispose
  A splendid scene then Agamemnon rose
  The boar Talthybius held the Grecian lord
  Drew the broad cutlass sheathd beside his sword
  The stubborn bristles from the victims brow
  He crops and offering meditates his vow
  His hands uplifted to the attesting skies
  On heavens broad marble roof were fixed his eyes
  The solemn words a deep attention draw
  And Greece around sat thrilld with sacred awe

  Witness thou first thou greatest power above
  Allgood allwise and allsurveying Jove
  And motherearth and heavens revolving light
  And ye fell furies of the realms of night
  Who rule the dead and horrid woes prepare
  For perjured kings and all who falsely swear
  The blackeyed maid inviolate removes
  Pure and unconscious of my manly loves
  If this be false heaven all its vengeance shed
  And levelld thunder strike my guilty head

  With that his weapon deep inflicts the wound
  The bleeding savage tumbles to the ground
  The sacred herald rolls the victim slain
  A feast for fish into the foaming main

  Then thus Achilles Hear ye Greeks and know
  Whateer we feel tis Jove inflicts the woe
  Not else Atrides could our rage inflame
  Nor from my arms unwilling force the dame
  Twas Joves high will alone oerruling all
  That doomd our strife and doomd the Greeks to fall
  Go then ye chiefs indulge the genial rite
  Achilles waits ye and expects the fight

  The speedy council at his word adjournd
  To their black vessels all the Greeks returnd
  Achilles sought his tent His train before
  Marchd onward bending with the gifts they bore
  Those in the tents the squires industrious spread
  The foaming coursers to the stalls they led
  To their new seats the female captives move
  Briseis radiant as the queen of love
  Slow as she passd beheld with sad survey
  Where gashd with cruel wounds Patroclus lay
  Prone on the body fell the heavenly fair
  Beat her sad breast and tore her golden hair
  All beautiful in grief her humid eyes
  Shining with tears she lifts and thus she cries

  Ah youth for ever dear for ever kind
  Once tender friend of my distracted mind
  I left thee fresh in life in beauty gay
  Now find thee cold inanimated clay
  What woes my wretched race of life attend
  Sorrows on sorrows never doomd to end
  The first loved consort of my virgin bed
  Before these eyes in fatal battle bled
  My three brave brothers in one mournful day
  All trod the dark irremeable way
  Thy friendly hand upreard me from the plain
  And dried my sorrows for a husband slain
  Achilles care you promised I should prove
  The first the dearest partner of his love
  That rites divine should ratify the band
  And make me empress in his native land
  Accept these grateful tears for thee they flow
  For thee that ever felt anothers woe

  Her sister captives echoed groan for groan
  Nor mournd Patroclus fortunes but their own
  The leaders pressd the chief on every side
  Unmoved he heard them and with sighs denied

  If yet Achilles have a friend whose care
  Is bent to please him this request forbear
  Till yonder sun descend ah let me pay
  To grief and anguish one abstemious day

  He spoke and from the warriors turnd his face
  Yet still the brotherkings of Atreus race
  Nestor Idomeneus Ulysses sage
  And Phoenix strive to calm his grief and rage
  His rage they calm not nor his grief control
  He groans he raves he sorrows from his soul

  Thou too Patroclus thus his heart he vents
  Once spread the inviting banquet in our tents
  Thy sweet society thy winning care
  Once stayd Achilles rushing to the war
  But now alas to deaths cold arms resignd
  What banquet but revenge can glad my mind
  What greater sorrow could afflict my breast
  What more if hoary Peleus were deceased
  Who now perhaps in Phthia dreads to hear
  His sons sad fate and drops a tender tear
  What more should Neoptolemus the brave
  My only offspring sink into the grave
  If yet that offspring lives I distant far
  Of all neglectful wage a hateful war
  I could not this this cruel stroke attend
  Fate claimd Achilles but might spare his friend
  I hoped Patroclus might survive to rear
  My tender orphan with a parents care
  From Scyros isle conduct him oer the main
  And glad his eyes with his paternal reign
  The lofty palace and the large domain
  For Peleus breathes no more the vital air
  Or drags a wretched life of age and care
  But till the news of my sad fate invades
  His hastening soul and sinks him to the shades

  Sighing he said his grief the heroes joind
  Each stole a tear for what he left behind
  Their mingled grief the sire of heaven surveyd
  And thus with pity to his blueeyed maid

  Is then Achilles now no more thy care
  And dost thou thus desert the great in war
  Lo where yon sails their canvas wings extend
  All comfortless he sits and wails his friend
  Ere thirst and want his forces have oppressd
  Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast

  He spoke and sudden at the word of Jove
  Shot the descending goddess from above
  So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs
  The wide air floating to her ample wings
  To great Achilles she her flight addressd
  And pourd divine ambrosia in his breast259
  With nectar sweet refection of the gods
  Then swift ascending sought the bright abodes

  Now issued from the ships the warriortrain
  And like a deluge pourd upon the plain
  As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow
  And scatter oer the fields the driving snow
  From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies
  Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies
  So helms succeeding helms so shields from shields
  Catch the quick beams and brighten all the fields
  Broad glittering breastplates spears with pointed rays
  Mix in one stream reflecting blaze on blaze
  Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound
  With splendour flame the skies and laugh the fields around

  Full in the midst hightowering oer the rest
  His limbs in arms divine Achilles dressd
  Arms which the father of the fire bestowd
  Forged on the eternal anvils of the god
  Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire
  His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire
  He grinds his teeth and furious with delay
  Oerlooks the embattled host and hopes the bloody day

  The silver cuishes first his thighs infold
  Then oer his breast was braced the hollow gold
  The brazen sword a various baldric tied
  That starrd with gems hung glittering at his side
  And like the moon the broad refulgent shield
  Blazed with long rays and gleamd athwart the field

  So to nightwandering sailors pale with fears
  Wide oer the watery waste a light appears
  Which on the farseen mountain blazing high
  Streams from some lonely watchtower to the sky
  With mournful eyes they gaze and gaze again
  Loud howls the storm and drives them oer the main

  Next his high head the helmet graced behind
  The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind
  Like the red star that from his flaming hair
  Shakes down diseases pestilence and war
  So streamd the golden honours from his head
  Trembled the sparkling plumes and the loose glories shed
  The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes
  His arms he poises and his motions tries
  Buoyd by some inward force he seems to swim
  And feels a pinion lifting every limb

  And now he shakes his great paternal spear
  Ponderous and huge which not a Greek could rear
  From Pelions cloudy top an ash entire
  Old Chiron felld and shaped it for his sire
  A spear which stern Achilles only wields
  The death of heroes and the dread of fields

  Automedon and Alcimus prepare
  The immortal coursers and the radiant car
  The silver traces sweeping at their side
  Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied
  The ivorystudded reins returnd behind
  Waved oer their backs and to the chariot joind
  The charioteer then whirld the lash around
  And swift ascended at one active bound
  All bright in heavenly arms above his squire
  Achilles mounts and sets the field on fire
  Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way
  Flames from his chariot and restores the day
  High oer the host all terrible he stands
  And thunders to his steeds these dread commands

  Xanthus and Balius of Podarges strain
  Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain
  Be swift be mindful of the load ye bear
  And learn to make your master more your care
  Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword
  Nor as ye left Patroclus leave your lord

  The generous Xanthus as the words he said
  Seemd sensible of woe and droopd his head
  Trembling he stood before the golden wain
  And bowd to dust the honours of his mane
  When strange to tell so Juno willd he broke
  Eternal silence and portentous spoke
  Achilles yes this day at least we bear
  Thy rage in safety through the files of war
  But come it will the fatal time must come
  Not ours the fault but God decrees thy doom
  Not through our crime or slowness in the course
  Fell thy Patroclus but by heavenly force
  The bright farshooting god who gilds the day
  Confessd we saw him tore his arms way
  Nocould our swiftness oer the winds prevail
  Or beat the pinions of the western gale
  All were in vainthe Fates thy death demand
  Due to a mortal and immortal hand

  Then ceased for ever by the Furies tied
  His fateful voice The intrepid chief replied
  With unabated rageSo let it be
  Portents and prodigies are lost on me
  I know my fate to die to see no more
  My muchloved parents and my native shore
  Enoughwhen heaven ordains I sink in night
  Now perish Troy He said and rushd to fight

ARGUMENT

THE BATTLE OF THE GODS AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES

Jupiter upon Achilles return to the battle calls a council of the gods
and permits them to assist either party The terrors of the combat
described when the deities are engaged Apollo encourages Ćneas to meet
Achilles After a long conversation these two heroes encounter but Ćneas
is preserved by the assistance of Neptune Achilles falls upon the rest of
the Trojans and is upon the point of killing Hector but Apollo conveys
him away in a cloud Achilles pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter

The same day continues The scene is in the field before Troy

  Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood
  Greece sheathed in arms beside her vessels stood
  While near impending from a neighbouring height
  Troys black battalions wait the shock of fight
  Then Jove to Themis gives command to call
  The gods to council in the starry hall
  Swift oer Olympus hundred hills she flies
  And summons all the senate of the skies
  These shining on in long procession come
  To Joves eternal adamantine dome
  Not one was absent not a rural power
  That haunts the verdant gloom or rosy bower
  Each fairhaird dryad of the shady wood
  Each azure sister of the silver flood
  All but old Ocean hoary sire who keeps
  His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps
  On marble thrones with lucid columns crownd
  The work of Vulcan sat the powers around
  Even he whose trident sways the watery reign
  Heard the loud summons and forsook the main
  Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes
  And questiond thus the sire of men and gods

  What moves the god who heaven and earth commands
  And grasps the thunder in his awful hands
  Thus to convene the whole ethereal state
  Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate
  Already met the louring hosts appear
  And death stands ardent on the edge of war

  Tis true the cloudcompelling power replies
  This day we call the council of the skies
  In care of human race even Joves own eye
  Sees with regret unhappy mortals die
  Far on Olympus top in secret state
  Ourself will sit and see the hand of fate
  Work out our will Celestial powers descend
  And as your minds direct your succour lend
  To either host Troy soon must lie oerthrown
  If uncontrolld Achilles fights alone
  Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes
  What can they now if in his rage he rise
  Assist them gods or Ilions sacred wall
  May fall this day though fate forbids the fall

  He said and fired their heavenly breasts with rage
  On adverse parts the warring gods engage
  Heavens awful queen and he whose azure round
  Girds the vast globe the maid in arms renownd
  Hermes of profitable arts the sire
  And Vulcan the black sovereign of the fire
  These to the fleet repair with instant flight
  The vessels tremble as the gods alight
  In aid of Troy Latona Phoebus came
  Mars fieryhelmd the laughterloving dame
  Xanthus whose streams in golden currents flow
  And the chaste huntress of the silver bow
  Ere yet the gods their various aid employ
  Each Argive bosom swelld with manly joy
  While great Achilles terror of the plain
  Long lost to battle shone in arms again
  Dreadful he stood in front of all his host
  Pale Troy beheld and seemd already lost
  Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear
  And trembling see another god of war

  But when the powers descending swelld the fight
  Then tumult rose fierce rage and pale affright
  Varied each face then Discord sounds alarms
  Earth echoes and the nations rush to arms
  Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls
  And now she thunders from the Grecian walls
  Mars hovering oer his Troy his terror shrouds
  In gloomy tempests and a night of clouds
  Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours
  With voice divine from Ilions topmost towers
  Now shouts to Simois from her beauteous hill
  The mountain shook the rapid stream stood still

  Above the sire of gods his thunder rolls
  And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles
  Beneath stern Neptune shakes the solid ground
  The forests wave the mountains nod around
  Through all their summits tremble Idas woods
  And from their sources boil her hundred floods
  Troys turrets totter on the rocking plain
  And the tossd navies beat the heaving main
  Deep in the dismal regions of the dead260
  The infernal monarch reard his horrid head
  Leapd from his throne lest Neptunes arm should lay
  His dark dominions open to the day
  And pour in light on Plutos drear abodes
  Abhorrd by men and dreadful even to gods261

                      THE GODS DESCENDING TO BATTLE


  Such war the immortals wage such horrors rend
  The worlds vast concave when the gods contend
  First silvershafted Phoebus took the plain
  Against blue Neptune monarch of the main
  The god of arms his giant bulk displayd
  Opposed to Pallas wars triumphant maid
  Against Latona marchd the son of May
  The quiverd Dian sister of the day
  Her golden arrows sounding at her side
  Saturnia majesty of heaven defied
  With fiery Vulcan last in battle stands
  The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands
  Xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth
  But called Scamander by the sons of earth

  While thus the gods in various league engage
  Achilles glowd with more than mortal rage
  Hector he sought in search of Hector turnd
  His eyes around for Hector only burnd
  And burst like lightning through the ranks and vowd
  To glut the god of battles with his blood

  Ćneas was the first who dared to stay
  Apollo wedged him in the warriors way
  But swelld his bosom with undaunted might
  Halfforced and halfpersuaded to the fight
  Like young Lycaon of the royal line
  In voice and aspect seemd the power divine
  And bade the chief reflect how late with scorn
  In distant threats he braved the goddessborn

  Then thus the hero of Anchises strain
  To meet Pelides you persuade in vain
  Already have I met nor void of fear
  Observed the fury of his flying spear
  From Idas woods he chased us to the field
  Our force he scattered and our herds he killd
  Lyrnessus Pedasus in ashes lay
  But Jove assisting I survived the day
  Else had I sunk oppressd in fatal fight
  By fierce Achilles and Minervas might
  Whereer he moved the goddess shone before
  And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore
  What mortal man Achilles can sustain
  The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain
  And suffer not his dart to fall in vain
  Were God my aid this arm should check his power
  Though strong in battle as a brazen tower

  To whom the son of Jove That god implore
  And be what great Achilles was before
  From heavenly Venus thou derivst thy strain
  And he but from a sister of the main
  An aged seagod father of his line
  But Jove himself the sacred source of thine
  Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow
  Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe

  This said and spirit breathed into his breast
  Through the thick troops the emboldend hero pressd
  His venturous act the whitearmd queen surveyd
  And thus assembling all the powers she said

  Behold an action gods that claims your care
  Lo great Ćneas rushing to the war
  Against Pelides he directs his course
  Phoebus impels and Phoebus gives him force
  Restrain his bold career at least to attend
  Our favourd hero let some power descend
  To guard his life and add to his renown
  We the great armament of heaven came down
  Hereafter let him fall as Fates design
  That spun so short his lifes illustrious line262
  But lest some adverse god now cross his way
  Give him to know what powers assist this day
  For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms
  When heavens refulgent host appear in arms263

  Thus she and thus the god whose force can make
  The solid globes eternal basis shake
  Against the might of man so feeble known
  Why should celestial powers exert their own
  Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene
  And leave to war the fates of mortal men
  But if the armipotent or god of light
  Obstruct Achilles or commence the fight
  Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend
  Full soon I doubt not shall the conflict end
  And these in ruin and confusion hurld
  Yield to our conquering arms the lower world

  Thus having said the tyrant of the sea
  Coerulean Neptune rose and led the way
  Advanced upon the field there stood a mound
  Of earth congested walld and trenchd around
  In elder times to guard Alcides made
  The work of Trojans with Minervas aid
  What time a vengeful monster of the main
  Swept the wide shore and drove him to the plain

  Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair
  With clouds encompassd and a veil of air
  The adverse powers around Apollo laid
  Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade
  In circle close each heavenly party sat
  Intent to form the future scheme of fate
  But mix not yet in fight though Jove on high
  Gives the loud signal and the heavens reply

  Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground
  The trampled centre yields a hollow sound
  Steeds cased in mail and chiefs in armour bright
  The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light
  Amid both hosts a dreadful space appear
  There great Achilles bold Ćneas here
  With towering strides Aeneas first advanced
  The nodding plumage on his helmet danced
  Spread oer his breast the fencing shield he bore
  And so he moved his javelin flamed before
  Not so Pelides furious to engage
  He rushd impetuous Such the lions rage
  Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes
  Though all in arms the peopled city rise
  Stalks careless on with unregarding pride
  Till at the length by some brave youth defied
  To his bold spear the savage turns alone
  He murmurs fury with a hollow groan
  He grins he foams he rolls his eyes around
  Lashd by his tail his heaving sides resound
  He calls up all his rage he grinds his teeth
  Resolved on vengeance or resolved on death
  So fierce Achilles on Ćneas flies
  So stands Ćneas and his force defies
  Ere yet the stern encounter joind begun
  The seed of Thetis thus to Venus son

  Why comes Ćneas through the ranks so far
  Seeks he to meet Achilles arm in war
  In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy
  And prove his merits to the throne of Troy
  Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies
  The partial monarch may refuse the prize
  Sons he has many those thy pride may quell
  And tis his fault to love those sons too well
  Or in reward of thy victorious hand
  Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land
  An ample forest or a fair domain
  Of hills for vines and arable for grain
  Even this perhaps will hardly prove thy lot
  But can Achilles be so soon forgot
  Once as I think you saw this brandishd spear
  And then the great Ćneas seemd to fear
  With hearty haste from Idas mount he fled
  Nor till he reachd Lyrnessus turnd his head
  Her lofty walls not long our progress stayd
  Those Pallas Jove and we in ruins laid
  In Grecian chains her captive race were cast
  Tis true the great Aeneas fled too fast
  Defrauded of my conquest once before
  What then I lost the gods this day restore
  Go while thou mayst avoid the threatend fate
  Fools stay to feel it and are wise too late

  To this Anchises son Such words employ
  To one that fears thee some unwarlike boy
  Such we disdain the best may be defied
  With mean reproaches and unmanly pride
  Unworthy the high race from which we came
  Proclaimd so loudly by the voice of fame
  Each from illustrious fathers draws his line
  Each goddessborn half human half divine
  Thetis this day or Venus offspring dies
  And tears shall trickle from celestial eyes
  For when two heroes thus derived contend
  Tis not in words the glorious strife can end
  If yet thou further seek to learn my birth
  A tale resounded through the spacious earth
  Hear how the glorious origin we prove
  From ancient Dardanus the first from Jove
  Dardanias walls he raised for Ilion then
  The city since of manylanguaged men
  Was not The natives were content to till
  The shady foot of Idas fountful hill264
  From Dardanus great Erichthonius springs
  The richest once of Asias wealthy kings
  Three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred
  Three thousand foals beside their mothers fed
  Boreas enamourd of the sprightly train
  Conceald his godhead in a flowing mane
  With voice dissembled to his loves he neighd
  And coursed the dappled beauties oer the mead
  Hence sprung twelve others of unrivalld kind
  Swift as their mother mares and father wind
  These lightly skimming when they swept the plain
  Nor plied the grass nor bent the tender grain
  And when along the level seas they flew265
  Scarce on the surface curld the briny dew
  Such Erichthonius was from him there came
  The sacred Tros of whom the Trojan name
  Three sons renownd adornd his nuptial bed
  Ilus Assaracus and Ganymed
  The matchless Ganymed divinely fair
  Whom heaven enamourd snatchd to upper air
  To bear the cup of Jove ethereal guest
  The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast
  The two remaining sons the line divide
  First rose Laomedon from Ilus side
  From him Tithonus now in cares grown old
  And Priam blessd with Hector brave and bold
  Clytius and Lampus everhonourd pair
  And Hicetaon thunderbolt of war
  From great Assaracus sprang Capys he
  Begat Anchises and Anchises me
  Such is our race tis fortune gives us birth
  But Jove alone endues the soul with worth
  He source of power and might with boundless sway
  All human courage gives or takes away
  Long in the field of words we may contend
  Reproach is infinite and knows no end
  Armd or with truth or falsehood right or wrong
  So voluble a weapon is the tongue
  Wounded we wound and neither side can fail
  For every man has equal strength to rail
  Women alone when in the streets they jar
  Perhaps excel us in this wordy war
  Like us they stand encompassd with the crowd
  And vent their anger impotent and loud
  Cease thenOur business in the field of fight
  Is not to question but to prove our might
  To all those insults thou hast offerd here
  Receive this answer tis my flying spear

  He spoke With all his force the javelin flung
  Fixd deep and loudly in the buckler rung
  Far on his outstretchd arm Pelides held
  To meet the thundering lance his dreadful shield
  That trembled as it stuck nor void of fear
  Saw ere it fell the immeasurable spear
  His fears were vain impenetrable charms
  Secured the temper of the ethereal arms
  Through two strong plates the point its passage held
  But stoppd and rested by the third repelld
  Five plates of various metal various mould
  Composed the shield of brass each outward fold
  Of tin each inward and the middle gold
  There stuck the lance Then rising ere he threw
  The forceful spear of great Achilles flew
  And pierced the Dardan shields extremest bound
  Where the shrill brass returnd a sharper sound
  Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides
  And the slight covering of expanded hides
  Ćneas his contracted body bends
  And oer him high the riven targe extends
  Sees through its parting plates the upper air
  And at his back perceives the quivering spear
  A fate so near him chills his soul with fright
  And swims before his eyes the manycolourd light
  Achilles rushing in with dreadful cries
  Draws his broad blade and at Ćneas flies
  Ćneas rousing as the foe came on
  With force collected heaves a mighty stone
  A mass enormous which in modern days
  No two of earths degenerate sons could raise
  But oceans god whose earthquakes rock the ground
  Saw the distress and moved the powers around

  Lo on the brink of fate Ćneas stands
  An instant victim to Achilles hands
  By Phoebus urged but Phoebus has bestowd
  His aid in vain the man oerpowers the god
  And can ye see this righteous chief atone
  With guiltless blood for vices not his own
  To all the gods his constant vows were paid
  Sure though he wars for Troy he claims our aid
  Fate wills not this nor thus can Jove resign
  The future father of the Dardan line266
  The first great ancestor obtaind his grace
  And still his love descends on all the race
  For Priam now and Priams faithless kind
  At length are odious to the allseeing mind
  On great Ćneas shall devolve the reign
  And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain

  The great earthshaker thus to whom replies
  The imperial goddess with the radiant eyes
  Good as he is to immolate or spare
  The Dardan prince O Neptune be thy care
  Pallas and I by all that gods can bind
  Have sworn destruction to the Trojan kind
  Not even an instant to protract their fate
  Or save one member of the sinking state
  Till her last flame be quenchd with her last gore
  And even her crumbling ruins are no more

  The king of ocean to the fight descends
  Through all the whistling darts his course he bends
  Swift interposed between the warrior flies
  And casts thick darkness oer Achilles eyes267
  From great Ćneas shield the spear he drew
  And at his masters feet the weapon threw
  That done with force divine he snatchd on high
  The Dardan prince and bore him through the sky
  Smoothgliding without step above the heads
  Of warring heroes and of bounding steeds
  Till at the battles utmost verge they light
  Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight
  The godhead there his heavenly form confessd
  With words like these the panting chief addressd

  What power O prince with force inferior far
  Urged thee to meet Achilles arm in war
  Henceforth beware nor antedate thy doom
  Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come
  But when the day decreed for come it must
  Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust
  Let then the furies of that arm be known
  Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own

  With that he left him wondering as he lay
  Then from Achilles chased the mist away
  Sudden returning with a stream of light
  The scene of war came rushing on his sight
  Then thus amazed What wonders strike my mind
  My spear that parted on the wings of wind
  Laid here before me and the Dardan lord
  That fell this instant vanishd from my sword
  I thought alone with mortals to contend
  But powers celestial sure this foe defend
  Great as he is our arms he scarce will try
  Content for once with all his gods to fly
  Now then let others bleed This said aloud
  He vents his fury and inflames the crowd
  O Greeks he cries and every rank alarms
  Join battle man to man and arms to arms
  Tis not in me though favourd by the sky
  To mow whole troops and make whole armies fly
  No god can singly such a host engage
  Not Mars himself nor great Minervas rage
  But whatsoeer Achilles can inspire
  Whateer of active force or acting fire
  Whateer this heart can prompt or hand obey
  All all Achilles Greeks is yours today
  Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear
  And thin the squadrons with my single spear

  He said nor less elate with martial joy
  The godlike Hector warmd the troops of Troy
  Trojans to war Think Hector leads you on
  Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus haughty son
  Deeds must decide our fate Een these with words
  Insult the brave who tremble at their swords
  The weakest atheistwretch all heaven defies
  But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies
  Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire
  Not though his heart were steel his hands were fire
  That fire that steel your Hector should withstand
  And brave that vengeful heart that dreadful hand

  Thus breathing rage through all the hero said
  A wood of lances rises round his head
  Clamours on clamours tempest all the air
  They join they throng they thicken to the war
  But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun
  The single fight with Thetis godlike son
  More safe to combat in the mingled band
  Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand
  He hears obedient to the god of light
  And plunged within the ranks awaits the fight

  Then fierce Achilles shouting to the skies
  On Troys whole force with boundless fury flies
  First falls Iphytion at his armys head
  Brave was the chief and brave the host he led
  From great Otrynteus he derived his blood
  His mother was a Nais of the flood
  Beneath the shades of Tmolus crownd with snow
  From Hydes walls he ruled the lands below
  Fierce as he springs the sword his head divides
  The parted visage falls on equal sides
  With loudresounding arms he strikes the plain
  While thus Achilles glories oer the slain

  Lie there Otryntides the Trojan earth
  Receives thee dead though Gygae boast thy birth
  Those beauteous fields where Hyllus waves are rolld
  And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold
  Are thine no moreThe insulting hero said
  And left him sleeping in eternal shade
  The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore
  And dashd their axles with no vulgar gore

  Demoleon next Antenors offspring laid
  Breathless in dust the price of rashness paid
  The impatient steel with fulldescending sway
  Forced through his brazen helm its furious way
  Resistless drove the batterd skull before
  And dashd and mingled all the brains with gore
  This sees Hippodamas and seized with fright
  Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight
  The lance arrests him an ignoble wound
  The panting Trojan rivets to the ground
  He groans away his soul not louder roars
  At Neptunes shrine on Helices high shores
  The victim bull the rocks rebellow round
  And ocean listens to the grateful sound
  Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage268
  The youngest hope of Priams stooping age
  Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpassd
  Of all his sons the dearest and the last
  To the forbidden field he takes his flight
  In the first folly of a youthful knight
  To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain
  But vaunts not long with all his swiftness slain
  Struck where the crossing belts unite behind
  And golden rings the double backplate joind
  Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel
  And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell
  The rushing entrails pourd upon the ground
  His hands collect and darkness wraps him round
  When Hector viewd all ghastly in his gore
  Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore
  A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight
  His soul no longer brookd the distant fight
  Full in Achilles dreadful front he came
  And shook his javelin like a waving flame
  The son of Peleus sees with joy possessd
  His heart highbounding in his rising breast
  And lo the man on whom black fates attend
  The man that slew Achilles is his friend
  No more shall Hectors and Pelides spear
  Turn from each other in the walks of war
  Then with revengeful eyes he scannd him oer
  Come and receive thy fate He spake no more

  Hector undaunted thus Such words employ
  To one that dreads thee some unwarlike boy
  Such we could give defying and defied
  Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride
  I know thy force to mine superior far
  But heaven alone confers success in war
  Mean as I am the gods may guide my dart
  And give it entrance in a braver heart

  Then parts the lance but Pallas heavenly breath
  Far from Achilles wafts the winged death
  The bidden dart again to Hector flies
  And at the feet of its great master lies
  Achilles closes with his hated foe
  His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow
  But present to his aid Apollo shrouds
  The favourd hero in a veil of clouds
  Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart
  Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart
  The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud
  He foams with fury and exclaims aloud

  Wretch thou hast scaped again once more thy flight
  Has saved thee and the partial god of light
  But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand
  If any power assist Achilles hand
  Fly then inglorious but thy flight this day
  Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay

  With that he gluts his rage on numbers slain
  Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain
  Pierced through the neck he left him panting there
  And stoppd Demuchus great Philetors heir
  Gigantic chief deep gashd the enormous blade
  And for the soul an ample passage made
  Laoganus and Dardanus expire
  The valiant sons of an unhappy sire
  Both in one instant from the chariot hurld
  Sunk in one instant to the nether world
  This difference only their sad fates afford
  That one the spear destroyd and one the sword

  Nor less unpitied young Alastor bleeds
  In vain his youth in vain his beauty pleads
  In vain he begs thee with a suppliants moan
  To spare a form an age so like thy own
  Unhappy boy no prayer no moving art
  Eer bent that fierce inexorable heart
  While yet he trembled at his knees and cried
  The ruthless falchion oped his tender side
  The panting liver pours a flood of gore
  That drowns his bosom till he pants no more

  Through Mulius head then drove the impetuous spear
  The warrior falls transfixd from ear to ear
  Thy life Echeclus next the sword bereaves
  Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves
  Warmd in the brain the smoking weapon lies
  The purple death comes floating oer his eyes
  Then brave Deucalion died the dart was flung
  Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung
  He droppd his arm an unassisting weight
  And stood all impotent expecting fate
  Full on his neck the falling falchion sped
  From his broad shoulders hewd his crested head
  Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies
  And sunk in dust the corpse extended lies
  Rhigmas whose race from fruitful Thracia came
  The son of Pierus an illustrious name
  Succeeds to fate the spear his belly rends
  Prone from his car the thundering chief descends
  The squire who saw expiring on the ground
  His prostrate master reind the steeds around
  His back scarce turnd the Pelian javelin gored
  And stretchd the servant oer his dying lord
  As when a flame the winding valley fills
  And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills
  Then oer the stubble up the mountain flies
  Fires the high woods and blazes to the skies
  This way and that the spreading torrent roars
  So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores
  Around him wide immense destruction pours
  And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers
  As with autumnal harvests coverd oer
  And thick bestrewn lies Ceres sacred floor
  When round and round with neverwearied pain
  The trampling steers beat out the unnumberd grain
  So the fierce coursers as the chariot rolls
  Tread down whole ranks and crush out heroes souls
  Dashd from their hoofs while oer the dead they fly
  Black bloody drops the smoking chariot dye
  The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore
  And thick the groaning axles droppd with gore
  High oer the scene of death Achilles stood
  All grim with dust all horrible in blood
  Yet still insatiate still with rage on flame
  Such is the lust of neverdying fame

ARGUMENT

THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER269

The Trojans fly before Achilles some towards the town others to the
river Scamander he falls upon the latter with great slaughter takes
twelve captives alive to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus and kills
Lycaon and Asteropeus Scamander attacks him with all his waves Neptune
and Pallas assist the hero Simois joins Scamander at length Vulcan by
the instigation of Juno almost dries up the river This Combat ended the
other gods engage each other Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter
drives the rest into Troy Agenor only makes a stand and is conveyed away
in a cloud by Apollo who to delude Achilles takes upon him Agenors
shape and while he pursues him in that disguise gives the Trojans an
opportunity of retiring into their city

The same day continues The scene is on the banks and in the stream of
Scamander

  And now to Xanthus gliding stream they drove
  Xanthus immortal progeny of Jove
  The river here divides the flying train
  Part to the town fly diverse oer the plain
  Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight
  Now chased and trembling in ignoble flight
  These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds
  And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds
  Part plunge into the stream old Xanthus roars
  The flashing billows beat the whitend shores
  With cries promiscuous all the banks resound
  And here and there in eddies whirling round
  The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drownd
  As the scorchd locusts from their fields retire
  While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire
  Driven from the land before the smoky cloud
  The clustering legions rush into the flood
  So plunged in Xanthus by Achilles force
  Roars the resounding surge with men and horse
  His bloody lance the hero casts aside
  Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide
  Then like a god the rapid billows braves
  Armd with his sword high brandishd oer the waves
  Now down he plunges now he whirls it round
  Deep groand the waters with the dying sound
  Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed
  And the warm purple circled on the tide
  Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly
  And close in rocks or winding caverns lie
  So the huge dolphin tempesting the main
  In shoals before him fly the scaly train
  Confusedly heapd they seek their inmost caves
  Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves
  Now tired with slaughter from the Trojan band
  Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land
  With their rich belts their captive arms restrains
  Late their proud ornaments but now their chains
  These his attendants to the ships conveyd
  Sad victims destined to Patroclus shade

  Then as once more he plunged amid the flood
  The young Lycaon in his passage stood
  The son of Priam whom the heros hand
  But late made captive in his fathers land
  As from a sycamore his sounding steel
  Loppd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel
  To Lemnos isle he sold the royal slave
  Where Jasons son the price demanded gave
  But kind Eetion touching on the shore
  The ransomd prince to fair Arisbe bore
  Ten days were past since in his fathers reign
  He felt the sweets of liberty again
  The next that god whom men in vain withstand
  Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand
  Now never to return and doomd to go
  A sadder journey to the shades below
  His wellknown face when great Achilles eyed
  The helm and visor he had cast aside
  With wild affright and droppd upon the field
  His useless lance and unavailing shield
  As trembling panting from the stream he fled
  And knockd his faltering knees the hero said
  Ye mighty gods what wonders strike my view
  Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue
  Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans killd
  Rise from the shades and brave me on the field
  As now the captive whom so late I bound
  And sold to Lemnos stalks on Trojan ground
  Not him the seas unmeasured deeps detain
  That bar such numbers from their native plain
  Lo he returns Try then my flying spear
  Try if the grave can hold the wanderer
  If earth at length this active prince can seize
  Earth whose strong grasp has held down Hercules

  Thus while he spoke the Trojan pale with fears
  Approachd and sought his knees with suppliant tears
  Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath
  And his soul shivering at the approach of death
  Achilles raised the spear prepared to wound
  He kissd his feet extended on the ground
  And while above the spear suspended stood
  Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood
  One hand embraced them close one stoppd the dart
  While thus these melting words attempt his heart

  Thy wellknown captive great Achilles see
  Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee
  Some pity to a suppliants name afford
  Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board
  Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore
  Far from his father friends and native shore
  A hundred oxen were his price that day
  Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay
  Scarce respited from woes I yet appear
  And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here
  Lo Jove again submits me to thy hands
  Again her victim cruel Fate demands
  I sprang from Priam and Laothoe fair
  Old Altes daughter and Lelegias heir
  Who held in Pedasus his famed abode
  And ruled the fields where silver Satnio flowd
  Two sons alas unhappy sons she bore
  For ah one spear shall drink each brothers gore
  And I succeed to slaughterd Polydore
  How from that arm of terror shall I fly
  Some demon urges tis my doom to die
  If ever yet soft pity touchd thy mind
  Ah think not me too much of Hectors kind
  Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath
  With his who wrought thy loved Patroclus death

  These words attended with a shower of tears
  The youth addressd to unrelenting ears
  Talk not of life or ransom he replies
  Patroclus dead whoever meets me dies
  In vain a single Trojan sues for grace
  But least the sons of Priams hateful race
  Die then my friend what boots it to deplore
  The great the good Patroclus is no more
  He far thy better was foredoomd to die
  And thou dost thou bewail mortality
  Seest thou not me whom natures gifts adorn
  Sprung from a hero from a goddess born
  The day shall come which nothing can avert
  When by the spear the arrow or the dart
  By night or day by force or by design
  Impending death and certain fate are mine
  Die thenHe said and as the word he spoke
  The fainting stripling sank before the stroke
  His hand forgot its grasp and left the spear
  While all his trembling frame confessd his fear
  Sudden Achilles his broad sword displayd
  And buried in his neck the reeking blade
  Prone fell the youth and panting on the land
  The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand
  The victor to the stream the carcase gave
  And thus insults him floating on the wave

  Lie there Lycaon let the fish surround
  Thy bloated corpse and suck thy gory wound
  There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep
  But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep
  Whose every wave some watery monster brings
  To feast unpunishd on the fat of kings
  So perish Troy and all the Trojan line
  Such ruin theirs and such compassion mine
  What boots ye now Scamanders worshippd stream
  His earthly honours and immortal name
  In vain your immolated bulls are slain
  Your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain
  Thus he rewards you with this bitter fate
  Thus till the Grecian vengeance is complete
  Thus is atoned Patroclus honourd shade
  And the short absence of Achilles paid

  These boastful words provoked the raging god
  With fury swells the violated flood
  What means divine may yet the power employ
  To check Achilles and to rescue Troy
  Meanwhile the hero springs in arms to dare
  The great Asteropeus to mortal war
  The son of Pelagon whose lofty line
  Flows from the source of Axius stream divine
  Fair Peribaeas love the god had crownd
  With all his refluent waters circled round
  On him Achilles rushd he fearless stood
  And shook two spears advancing from the flood
  The flood impelld him on Pelides head
  To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead
  Near as they drew Achilles thus began

  What art thou boldest of the race of man
  Who or from whence Unhappy is the sire
  Whose son encounters our resistless ire

  O son of Peleus what avails to trace
  Replied the warrior our illustrious race
  From rich Paeonias valleys I command
  Armd with protended spears my native band
  Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came
  In aid of Ilion to the fields of fame
  Axius who swells with all the neighbouring rills
  And wide around the floated region fills
  Begot my sire whose spear much glory won
  Now lift thy arm and try that heros son

  Threatening he said the hostile chiefs advance
  At once Asteropeus discharged each lance
  For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield
  One struck but pierced not the Vulcanian shield
  One razed Achilles hand the spouting blood
  Spun forth in earth the fastend weapon stood
  Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies
  Its erring fury hissd along the skies
  Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear
  Even to the middle earth and quiverd there
  Then from his side the sword Pelides drew
  And on his foe with double fury flew
  The foe thrice tuggd and shook the rooted wood
  Repulsive of his might the weapon stood
  The fourth he tries to break the spear in vain
  Bent as he stands he tumbles to the plain
  His belly opend with a ghastly wound
  The reeking entrails pour upon the ground
  Beneath the heros feet he panting lies
  And his eye darkens and his spirit flies
  While the proud victor thus triumphing said
  His radiant armour tearing from the dead

  So ends thy glory Such the fate they prove
  Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove
  Sprung from a river didst thou boast thy line
  But great Saturnius is the source of mine
  How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny
  Of Peleus Ćacus and Jove am I
  The race of these superior far to those
  As he that thunders to the stream that flows
  What rivers can Scamander might have shown
  But Jove he dreads nor wars against his son
  Even Achelous might contend in vain
  And all the roaring billows of the main
  The eternal ocean from whose fountains flow
  The seas the rivers and the springs below
  The thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear
  And in his deep abysses shakes with fear

  He said then from the bank his javelin tore
  And left the breathless warrior in his gore
  The floating tides the bloody carcase lave
  And beat against it wave succeeding wave
  Till rolld between the banks it lies the food
  Of curling eels and fishes of the flood
  All scatterd round the stream their mightiest slain
  The amazed Paeonians scour along the plain
  He vents his fury on the flying crew
  Thrasius Astyplus and Mnesus slew
  Mydon Thersilochus with Ćnius fell
  And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell
  But from the bottom of his gulfs profound
  Scamander spoke the shores returnd the sound

  O first of mortals for the gods are thine
  In valour matchless and in force divine
  If Jove have given thee every Trojan head
  Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead
  See my choked streams no more their course can keep
  Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep
  Turn then impetuous from our injured flood
  Content thy slaughters could amaze a god

  In human form confessd before his eyes
  The river thus and thus the chief replies
  O sacred stream thy word we shall obey
  But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay
  Not till within her towers the perjured train
  Shall pant and tremble at our arms again
  Not till proud Hector guardian of her wall
  Or stain this lance or see Achilles fall

  He said and drove with fury on the foe
  Then to the godhead of the silver bow
  The yellow flood began O son of Jove
  Was not the mandate of the sire above
  Full and express that Phoebus should employ
  His sacred arrows in defence of Troy
  And make her conquer till Hyperions fall
  In awful darkness hide the face of all

  He spoke in vainThe chief without dismay
  Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way
  Then rising in his rage above the shores
  From all his deep the bellowing river roars
  Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast
  And round the banks the ghastly dead are tossd
  While all before the billows ranged on high
  A watery bulwark screen the bands who fly
  Now bursting on his head with thundering sound
  The falling deluge whelms the hero round
  His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide
  His feet upborne scarce the strong flood divide
  Sliddering and staggering On the border stood
  A spreading elm that overhung the flood
  He seized a bending bough his steps to stay
  The plant uprooted to his weight gave way270
  Heaving the bank and undermining all
  Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall
  Of the thick foliage The large trunk displayd
  Bridged the rough flood across the hero stayd
  On this his weight and raised upon his hand
  Leapd from the channel and regaind the land
  Then blackend the wild waves the murmur rose
  The god pursues a huger billow throws
  And bursts the bank ambitious to destroy
  The man whose fury is the fate of Troy
  He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace
  Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race
  Far as a spear can fly Achilles springs
  At every bound his clanging armour rings
  Now here now there he turns on every side
  And winds his course before the following tide
  The waves flow after wheresoeer he wheels
  And gather fast and murmur at his heels
  So when a peasant to his garden brings
  Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs
  And calls the floods from high to bless his bowers
  And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers
  Soon as he clears whateer their passage stayd
  And marks the future current with his spade
  Swift oer the rolling pebbles down the hills
  Louder and louder purl the falling rills
  Before him scattering they prevent his pains
  And shine in mazy wanderings oer the plains

  Still flies Achilles but before his eyes
  Still swift Scamander rolls whereer he flies
  Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods
  The first of men but not a match for gods
  Oft as he turnd the torrent to oppose
  And bravely try if all the powers were foes
  So oft the surge in watery mountains spread
  Beats on his back or bursts upon his head
  Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves
  And still indignant bounds above the waves
  Tired by the tides his knees relax with toil
  Washd from beneath him slides the slimy soil
  When thus his eyes on heavens expansion thrown
  Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan

  Is there no god Achilles to befriend
  No power to avert his miserable end
  Prevent O Jove this ignominious date271
  And make my future life the sport of fate
  Of all heavens oracles believed in vain
  But most of Thetis must her son complain
  By Phoebus darts she prophesied my fall
  In glorious arms before the Trojan wall
  Oh had I died in fields of battle warm
  Stretchd like a hero by a heros arm
  Might Hectors spear this dauntless bosom rend
  And my swift soul oertake my slaughterd friend
  Ah no Achilles meets a shameful fate
  Oh how unworthy of the brave and great
  Like some vile swain whom on a rainy day
  Crossing a ford the torrent sweeps away
  An unregarded carcase to the sea

  Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief
  And thus in human form addressd the chief
  The power of ocean first Forbear thy fear
  O son of Peleus Lo thy gods appear
  Behold from Jove descending to thy aid
  Propitious Neptune and the blueeyed maid
  Stay and the furious flood shall cease to rave
  Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave
  But thou the counsel heaven suggests attend
  Nor breathe from combat nor thy sword suspend
  Till Troy receive her flying sons till all
  Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall
  Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance
  And Hectors blood shall smoke upon thy lance
  Thine is the glory doomd Thus spake the gods
  Then swift ascended to the bright abodes

  Stung with new ardour thus by heaven impelld
  He springs impetuous and invades the field
  Oer all the expanded plain the waters spread
  Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead
  Floating midst scatterd arms while casques of gold
  And turndup bucklers glitterd as they rolld
  High oer the surging tide by leaps and bounds
  He wades and mounts the parted wave resounds
  Not a whole river stops the heros course
  While Pallas fills him with immortal force
  With equal rage indignant Xanthus roars
  And lifts his billows and oerwhelms his shores

  Then thus to Simois Haste my brother flood
  And check this mortal that controls a god
  Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight
  And Ilion tumble from her towery height
  Call then thy subject streams and bid them roar
  From all thy fountains swell thy watery store
  With broken rocks and with a load of dead
  Charge the black surge and pour it on his head
  Mark how resistless through the floods he goes
  And boldly bids the warring gods be foes
  But nor that force nor form divine to sight
  Shall aught avail him if our rage unite
  Whelmd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie
  That blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye
  And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurld
  Immersed remain this terror of the world
  Such ponderous ruin shall confound the place
  No Greeks shall eer his perishd relics grace
  No hand his bones shall gather or inhume
  These his cold rites and this his watery tomb

           Illustration ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS

                   ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS


  He said and on the chief descends amain
  Increased with gore and swelling with the slain
  Then murmuring from his beds he boils he raves
  And a foam whitens on the purple waves
  At every step before Achilles stood
  The crimson surge and deluged him with blood
  Fear touchd the queen of heaven she saw dismayd
  She calld aloud and summond Vulcans aid

  Rise to the war the insulting flood requires
  Thy wasteful arm assemble all thy fires
  While to their aid by our command enjoind
  Rush the swift eastern and the western wind
  These from old ocean at my word shall blow
  Pour the red torrent on the watery foe
  Corses and arms to one bright ruin turn
  And hissing rivers to their bottoms burn
  Go mighty in thy rage display thy power
  Drink the whole flood the crackling trees devour
  Scorch all the banks and till our voice reclaim
  Exert the unwearied furies of the flame

  The power ignipotent her word obeys
  Wide oer the plain he pours the boundless blaze
  At once consumes the dead and dries the soil
  And the shrunk waters in their channel boil
  As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky
  And instant blows the waterd gardens dry
  So lookd the field so whitend was the ground
  While Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around
  Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys
  Along the margin winds the running blaze
  The trees in flaming rows to ashes turn
  The flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn
  Broad elm and cypress rising in a spire
  The watery willows hiss before the fire
  Now glow the waves the fishes pant for breath
  The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death
  Now flounce aloft now dive the scaly fry
  Or gasping turn their bellies to the sky
  At length the river reard his languid head
  And thus shortpanting to the god he said

  Oh Vulcan oh what power resists thy might
  I faint I sink unequal to the fight
  I yieldLet Ilion fall if fate decree
  Ahbend no more thy fiery arms on me

  He ceased wide conflagration blazing round
  The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound
  As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise272
  To melt the fat of some rich sacrifice
  Amid the fierce embrace of circling fires
  The waters foam the heavy smoke aspires
  So boils the imprisond flood forbid to flow
  And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow
  To Juno then imperial queen of air
  The burning river sends his earnest prayer

  Ah why Saturnia must thy son engage
  Me only me with all his wasteful rage
  On other gods his dreadful arm employ
  For mightier gods assert the cause of Troy
  Submissive I desist if thou command
  But ah withdraw this alldestroying hand
  Hear then my solemn oath to yield to fate
  Unaided Ilion and her destined state
  Till Greece shall gird her with destructive flame
  And in one ruin sink the Trojan name

  His warm entreaty touchd Saturnias ear
  She bade the ignipotent his rage forbear
  Recall the flame nor in a mortal cause
  Infest a god the obedient flame withdraws
  Again the branching streams begin to spread
  And soft remurmur in their wonted bed

  While these by Junos will the strife resign
  The warring gods in fierce contention join
  Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms
  With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms
  Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound
  And wide beneath them groans the rending ground
  Jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries
  And views contending gods with careless eyes
  The power of battles lifts his brazen spear
  And first assaults the radiant queen of war

  What moved thy madness thus to disunite
  Ethereal minds and mix all heaven in fight
  What wonder this when in thy frantic mood
  Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god
  Thy impious hand Tydides javelin bore
  And madly bathed it in celestial gore

  He spoke and smote the longresounding shield
  Which bears Joves thunder on its dreadful field
  The adamantine aegis of her sire
  That turns the glancing bolt and forked fire

  Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand
  A stone the limit of the neighbouring land
  There fixd from eldest times black craggy vast
  This at the heavenly homicide she cast
  Thundering he falls a mass of monstrous size
  And seven broad acres covers as he lies
  The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound
  Loud oer the fields his ringing arms resound
  The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles
  And glorying thus the prostrate god reviles

  Hast thou not yet insatiate fury known
  How far Minervas force transcends thy own
  Juno whom thou rebellious darest withstand
  Corrects thy folly thus by Pallas hand
  Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace
  And partial aid to Troys perfidious race

  The goddess spoke and turnd her eyes away
  That beaming round diffused celestial day
  Joves Cyprian daughter stooping on the land
  Lent to the wounded god her tender hand
  Slowly he rises scarcely breathes with pain
  And proppd on her fair arm forsakes the plain
  This the bright empress of the heavens surveyd
  And scoffing thus to wars victorious maid

  Lo what an aid on Marss side is seen
  The smiles and loves unconquerable queen
  Mark with what insolence in open view
  She moves let Pallas if she dares pursue

  Minerva smiling heard the pair oertook
  And slightly on her breast the wanton strook
  She unresisting fell her spirits fled
  On earth together lay the lovers spread
  And like these heroes be the fate of all
  Minerva cries who guard the Trojan wall
  To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be
  So dread so fierce as Venus is to me
  Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved
  Thus she and Juno with a smile approved

  Meantime to mix in more than mortal fight
  The god of ocean dares the god of light
  What sloth has seized us when the fields around
  Ring with conflicting powers and heaven returns the sound
  Shall ignominious we with shame retire
  No deed performd to our Olympian sire
  Come prove thy arm for first the war to wage
  Suits not my greatness or superior age
  Rash as thou art to prop the Trojan throne
  Forgetful of my wrongs and of thy own
  And guard the race of proud Laomedon
  Hast thou forgot how at the monarchs prayer
  We shared the lengthend labours of a year
  Troy walls I raised for such were Joves commands
  And yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands
  Thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves
  Along fair Idas vales and pendant groves
  But when the circling seasons in their train
  Brought back the grateful day that crownd our pain
  With menace stern the fraudful king defied
  Our latent godhead and the prize denied
  Mad as he was he threatend servile bands
  And doomd us exiles far in barbarous lands273
  Incensed we heavenward fled with swiftest wing
  And destined vengeance on the perjured king
  Dost thou for this afford proud Ilion grace
  And not like us infest the faithless race
  Like us their present future sons destroy
  And from its deep foundations heave their Troy

  Apollo thus To combat for mankind
  Ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind
  For what is man Calamitous by birth
  They owe their life and nourishment to earth
  Like yearly leaves that now with beauty crownd
  Smile on the sun now wither on the ground
  To their own hands commit the frantic scene
  Nor mix immortals in a cause so mean

  Then turns his face farbeaming heavenly fires
  And from the senior power submiss retires
  Him thus retreating Artemis upbraids
  The quiverd huntress of the sylvan shades

  And is it thus the youthful Phoebus flies
  And yields to oceans hoary sire the prize
  How vain that martial pomp and dreadful show
  Of pointed arrows and the silver bow
  Now boast no more in yon celestial bower
  Thy force can match the great earthshaking power

  Silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid
  Not so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid
  But furious thus What insolence has driven
  Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven
  What though by Jove the female plague designd
  Fierce to the feeble race of womankind
  The wretched matron feels thy piercing dart
  Thy sexs tyrant with a tigers heart
  What though tremendous in the woodland chase
  Thy certain arrows pierce the savage race
  How dares thy rashness on the powers divine
  Employ those arms or match thy force with mine
  Learn hence no more unequal war to wage
  She said and seized her wrists with eager rage
  These in her left hand lockd her right untied
  The bow the quiver and its plumy pride
  About her temples flies the busy bow
  Now here now there she winds her from the blow
  The scattering arrows rattling from the case
  Drop round and idly mark the dusty place
  Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies
  And scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes
  So when the falcon wings her way above
  To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove
  Not fated yet to die there safe retreats
  Yet still her heart against the marble beats

  To her Latona hastes with tender care
  Whom Hermes viewing thus declines the war
  How shall I face the dame who gives delight
  To him whose thunders blacken heaven with night
  Go matchless goddess triumph in the skies
  And boast my conquest while I yield the prize

  He spoke and passd Latona stooping low
  Collects the scatterd shafts and fallen bow
  That glittering on the dust lay here and there
  Dishonourd relics of Dianas war
  Then swift pursued her to her blest abode
  Where all confused she sought the sovereign god
  Weeping she graspd his knees the ambrosial vest
  Shook with her sighs and panted on her breast

  The sire superior smiled and bade her show
  What heavenly hand had caused his daughters woe
  Abashd she names his own imperial spouse
  And the pale crescent fades upon her brows

  Thus they above while swiftly gliding down
  Apollo enters Ilions sacred town
  The guardiangod now trembled for her wall
  And feard the Greeks though fate forbade her fall
  Back to Olympus from the wars alarms
  Return the shining bands of gods in arms
  Some proud in triumph some with rage on fire
  And take their thrones around the ethereal sire

  Through blood through death Achilles still proceeds
  Oer slaughterd heroes and oer rolling steeds
  As when avenging flames with fury driven
  On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven
  The pale inhabitants some fall some fly
  And the red vapours purple all the sky
  So raged Achilles death and dire dismay
  And toils and terrors filld the dreadful day

  High on a turret hoary Priam stands
  And marks the waste of his destructive hands
  Views from his arm the Trojans scatterd flight
  And the near hero rising on his sight
  No stop no check no aid With feeble pace
  And settled sorrow on his aged face
  Fast as he could he sighing quits the walls
  And thus descending on the guards he calls

  You to whose care our citygates belong
  Set wide your portals to the flying throng
  For lo he comes with unresisted sway
  He comes and desolation marks his way
  But when within the walls our troops take breath
  Lock fast the brazen bars and shut out death
  Thus charged the reverend monarch wide were flung
  The opening folds the sounding hinges rung
  Phoebus rushd forth the flying bands to meet
  Struck slaughter back and coverd the retreat
  On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate
  And gladsome see their last escape from fate
  Thither all parchd with thirst a heartless train
  Hoary with dust they beat the hollow plain
  And gasping panting fainting labour on
  With heavier strides that lengthen toward the town
  Enraged Achilles follows with his spear
  Wild with revenge insatiable of war

  Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired
  And Troy inglorious to her walls retired
  But he the god who darts ethereal flame
  Shot down to save her and redeem her fame
  To young Agenor force divine he gave
  Antenors offspring haughty bold and brave
  In aid of him beside the beech he sate
  And wrapt in clouds restraind the hand of fate
  When now the generous youth Achilles spies
  Thick beats his heart the troubled motions rise
  So ere a storm the waters heave and roll
  He stops and questions thus his mighty soul

  What shall I fly this terror of the plain
  Like others fly and be like others slain
  Vain hope to shun him by the selfsame road
  Yon line of slaughterd Trojans lately trod
  No with the common heap I scorn to fall
  What if they passd me to the Trojan wall
  While I decline to yonder path that leads
  To Idas forests and surrounding shades
  So may I reach conceald the cooling flood
  From my tired body wash the dirt and blood
  As soon as night her dusky veil extends
  Return in safety to my Trojan friends
  What ifBut wherefore all this vain debate
  Stand I to doubt within the reach of fate
  Even now perhaps ere yet I turn the wall
  The fierce Achilles sees me and I fall
  Such is his swiftness tis in vain to fly
  And such his valour that who stands must die
  Howeer tis better fighting for the state
  Here and in public view to meet my fate
  Yet sure he too is mortal he may feel
  Like all the sons of earth the force of steel
  One only soul informs that dreadful frame
  And Joves sole favour gives him all his fame

  He said and stood collected in his might
  And all his beating bosom claimd the fight
  So from some deepgrown wood a panther starts
  Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts
  Untaught to fear or fly he hears the sounds
  Of shouting hunters and of clamorous hounds
  Though struck though wounded scarce perceives the pain
  And the barbd javelin stings his breast in vain
  On their whole war untamed the savage flies
  And tears his hunter or beneath him dies
  Not less resolved Antenors valiant heir
  Confronts Achilles and awaits the war
  Disdainful of retreat high held before
  His shield a broad circumference he bore
  Then graceful as he stood in act to throw
  The lifted javelin thus bespoke the foe

  How proud Achilles glories in his fame
  And hopes this day to sink the Trojan name
  Beneath her ruins Know that hope is vain
  A thousand woes a thousand toils remain
  Parents and children our just arms employ
  And strong and many are the sons of Troy
  Great as thou art even thou mayst stain with gore
  These Phrygian fields and press a foreign shore

  He said with matchless force the javelin flung
  Smote on his knee the hollow cuishes rung
  Beneath the pointed steel but safe from harms
  He stands impassive in the ethereal arms
  Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe
  His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow
  But jealous of his fame Apollo shrouds
  The godlike Trojan in a veil of clouds
  Safe from pursuit and shut from mortal view
  Dismissd with fame the favoured youth withdrew
  Meanwhile the god to cover their escape
  Assumes Agenors habit voice and shape
  Flies from the furious chief in this disguise
  The furious chief still follows where he flies
  Now oer the fields they stretch with lengthend strides
  Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides
  The god now distant scarce a stride before
  Tempts his pursuit and wheels about the shore
  While all the flying troops their speed employ
  And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy
  No stop no stay no thought to ask or tell
  Who scaped by flight or who by battle fell
  Twas tumult all and violence of flight
  And sudden joy confused and mixd affright
  Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate
  And nations breathe deliverd from their fate

ARGUMENT

THE DEATH OF HECTOR

The Trojans being safe within the walls Hector only stays to oppose
Achilles Priam is struck at his approach and tries to persuade his son
to reenter the town Hecuba joins her entreaties but in vain Hector
consults within himself what measures to take but at the advance of
Achilles his resolution fails him and he flies Achilles pursues him
thrice round the walls of Troy The gods debate concerning the fate of
Hector at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles She deludes
Hector in the shape of Deiphobus he stands the combat and is slain
Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of Priam and
Hecuba Their lamentations tears and despair Their cries reach the ears
of Andromache who ignorant of this was retired into the inner part of
the palace she mounts up to the walls and beholds her dead husband She
swoons at the spectacle Her excess of grief and lamentation

The thirtieth day still continues The scene lies under the walls and on
the battlements of Troy

  Thus to their bulwarks smit with panic fear
  The herded Ilians rush like driven deer
  There safe they wipe the briny drops away
  And drown in bowls the labours of the day
  Close to the walls advancing oer the fields
  Beneath one roof of wellcompacted shields
  March bending on the Greeks embodied powers
  Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers
  Great Hector singly stayd chaind down by fate
  There fixd he stood before the Scaean gate
  Still his bold arms determined to employ
  The guardian still of longdefended Troy

  Apollo now to tired Achilles turns
  The power confessd in all his glory burns
  And what he cries has Peleus son in view
  With mortal speed a godhead to pursue
  For not to thee to know the gods is given
  Unskilld to trace the latent marks of heaven
  What boots thee now that Troy forsook the plain
  Vain thy past labour and thy present vain
  Safe in their walls are now her troops bestowd
  While here thy frantic rage attacks a god

  The chief incensedToo partial god of day
  To check my conquests in the middle way
  How few in Ilion else had refuge found
  What gasping numbers now had bit the ground
  Thou robbst me of a glory justly mine
  Powerful of godhead and of fraud divine
  Mean fame alas for one of heavenly strain
  To cheat a mortal who repines in vain

  Then to the city terrible and strong
  With high and haughty steps he towerd along
  So the proud courser victor of the prize
  To the near goal with double ardour flies
  Him as he blazing shot across the field
  The careful eyes of Priam first beheld
  Not half so dreadful rises to the sight274
  Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night
  Orions dog the year when autumn weighs
  And oer the feebler stars exerts his rays
  Terrific glory for his burning breath
  Taints the red air with fevers plagues and death
  So flamed his fiery mail Then wept the sage
  He strikes his reverend head now white with age
  He lifts his witherd arms obtests the skies
  He calls his muchloved son with feeble cries
  The son resolved Achilles force to dare
  Full at the Scaean gates expects the war
  While the sad father on the rampart stands
  And thus adjures him with extended hands

  Ah stay not stay not guardless and alone
  Hector my loved my dearest bravest son
  Methinks already I behold thee slain
  And stretchd beneath that fury of the plain
  Implacable Achilles mightst thou be
  To all the gods no dearer than to me
  Thee vultures wild should scatter round the shore
  And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore
  How many valiant sons I late enjoyd
  Valiant in vain by thy cursed arm destroyd
  Or worse than slaughtered sold in distant isles
  To shameful bondage and unworthy toils
  Two while I speak my eyes in vain explore
  Two from one mother sprung my Polydore
  And loved Lycaon now perhaps no more
  Oh if in yonder hostile camp they live
  What heaps of gold what treasures would I give
  Their grandsires wealth by right of birth their own
  Consignd his daughter with Lelegias throne
  But if which Heaven forbid already lost
  All pale they wander on the Stygian coast
  What sorrows then must their sad mother know
  What anguish I unutterable woe
  Yet less that anguish less to her to me
  Less to all Troy if not deprived of thee
  Yet shun Achilles enter yet the wall
  And spare thyself thy father spare us all
  Save thy dear life or if a soul so brave
  Neglect that thought thy dearer glory save
  Pity while yet I live these silver hairs
  While yet thy father feels the woes he bears
  Yet cursed with sense a wretch whom in his rage
  All trembling on the verge of helpless age
  Great Jove has placed sad spectacle of pain
  The bitter dregs of fortunes cup to drain
  To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes
  And number all his days by miseries
  My heroes slain my bridal bed oerturnd
  My daughters ravishd and my city burnd
  My bleeding infants dashd against the floor
  These I have yet to see perhaps yet more
  Perhaps even I reserved by angry fate
  The last sad relic of my ruind state
  Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness must fall
  And stain the pavement of my regal hall
  Where famishd dogs late guardians of my door
  Shall lick their mangled masters spatterd gore
  Yet for my sons I thank ye gods tis well
  Well have they perishd for in fight they fell
  Who dies in youth and vigour dies the best
  Struck through with wounds all honest on the breast
  But when the fates in fulness of their rage
  Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age
  In dust the reverend lineaments deform
  And pour to dogs the lifeblood scarcely warm
  This this is misery the last the worse
  That man can feel man fated to be cursed

  He said and acting what no words could say
  Rent from his head the silver locks away
  With him the mournful mother bears a part
  Yet all her sorrows turn not Hectors heart
  The zone unbraced her bosom she displayd
  And thus fastfalling the salt tears she said

  Have mercy on me O my son revere
  The words of age attend a parents prayer
  If ever thee in these fond arms I pressd
  Or stilld thy infant clamours at this breast
  Ah do not thus our helpless years forego
  But by our walls secured repel the foe
  Against his rage if singly thou proceed
  Shouldst thou but Heaven avert it shouldst thou bleed
  Nor must thy corse lie honourd on the bier
  Nor spouse nor mother grace thee with a tear
  Far from our pious rites those dear remains
  Must feast the vultures on the naked plains

  So they while down their cheeks the torrents roll
  But fixd remains the purpose of his soul
  Resolved he stands and with a fiery glance
  Expects the heros terrible advance
  So rolld up in his den the swelling snake
  Beholds the traveller approach the brake
  When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins
  Have gatherd half the poisons of the plains
  He burns he stiffens with collected ire
  And his red eyeballs glare with living fire
  Beneath a turret on his shield reclined
  He stood and questiond thus his mighty mind275

  Where lies my way to enter in the wall
  Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall
  Shall proud Polydamas before the gate
  Proclaim his counsels are obeyd too late
  Which timely followd but the former night
  What numbers had been saved by Hectors flight
  That wise advice rejected with disdain
  I feel my folly in my people slain
  Methinks my suffering countrys voice I hear
  But most her worthless sons insult my ear
  On my rash courage charge the chance of war
  And blame those virtues which they cannot share
  Noif I eer return return I must
  Glorious my countrys terror laid in dust
  Or if I perish let her see me fall
  In field at least and fighting for her wall
  And yet suppose these measures I forego
  Approach unarmd and parley with the foe
  The warriorshield the helm and lance lay down
  And treat on terms of peace to save the town
  The wife withheld the treasure illdetaind
  Cause of the war and grievance of the land
  With honourable justice to restore
  And add half Ilions yet remaining store
  Which Troy shall sworn produce that injured Greece
  May share our wealth and leave our walls in peace
  But why this thought Unarmd if I should go
  What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe
  But womanlike to fall and fall without a blow
  We greet not here as man conversing man
  Met at an oak or journeying oer a plain
  No season now for calm familiar talk
  Like youths and maidens in an evening walk
  War is our business but to whom is given
  To die or triumph that determine Heaven

  Thus pondering like a god the Greek drew nigh
  His dreadful plumage nodded from on high
  The Pelian javelin in his better hand
  Shot trembling rays that glitterd oer the land
  And on his breast the beamy splendour shone
  Like Joves own lightning or the rising sun
  As Hector sees unusual terrors rise
  Struck by some god he fears recedes and flies
  He leaves the gates he leaves the wall behind
  Achilles follows like the winged wind
  Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies
  The swiftest racer of the liquid skies
  Just when he holds or thinks he holds his prey
  Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way
  With open beak and shrilling cries he springs
  And aims his claws and shoots upon his wings
  No less foreright the rapid chase they held
  One urged by fury one by fear impelld
  Now circling round the walls their course maintain
  Where the high watchtower overlooks the plain
  Now where the figtrees spread their umbrage broad
  A wider compass smoke along the road
  Next by Scamanders double source they bound
  Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground
  This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise
  With exhalations steaming to the skies
  That the green banks in summers heat oerflows
  Like crystal clear and cold as winter snows
  Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills
  Whose polishd bed receives the falling rills
  Where Trojan dames ere yet alarmd by Greece
  Washd their fair garments in the days of peace276
  By these they passd one chasing one in flight
  The mighty fled pursued by stronger might
  Swift was the course no vulgar prize they play
  No vulgar victim must reward the day
  Such as in races crown the speedy strife
  The prize contended was great Hectors life
  As when some heros funerals are decreed
  In grateful honour of the mighty dead
  Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame
  Some golden tripod or some lovely dame
  The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal
  And with them turns the raised spectators soul
  Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly
  The gazing gods lean forward from the sky
  To whom while eager on the chase they look
  The sire of mortals and immortals spoke

  Unworthy sight the man beloved of heaven
  Behold inglorious round yon city driven
  My heart partakes the generous Hectors pain
  Hector whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain
  Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy
  From Idas summits and the towers of Troy
  Now see him flying to his fears resignd
  And fate and fierce Achilles close behind
  Consult ye powers tis worthy your debate
  Whether to snatch him from impending fate
  Or let him bear by stern Pelides slain
  Good as he is the lot imposed on man

  Then Pallas thus Shall he whose vengeance forms
  The forky bolt and blackens heaven with storms
  Shall he prolong one Trojans forfeit breath
  A man a mortal preordaind to death
  And will no murmurs fill the courts above
  No gods indignant blame their partial Jove

  Go then returnd the sire without delay
  Exert thy will I give the Fates their way
  Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies
  And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies

  As through the forest oer the vale and lawn
  The wellbreathd beagle drives the flying fawn
  In vain he tries the covert of the brakes
  Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes
  Sure of the vapour in the tainted dews
  The certain hound his various maze pursues
  Thus step by step whereer the Trojan wheeld
  There swift Achilles compassd round the field
  Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends
  And hopes the assistance of his pitying friends
  Whose showering arrows as he coursed below
  From the high turrets might oppress the foe
  So oft Achilles turns him to the plain
  He eyes the city but he eyes in vain
  As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace
  One to pursue and one to lead the chase
  Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake
  Nor this can fly nor that can overtake
  No less the labouring heroes pant and strain
  While that but flies and this pursues in vain

  What god O muse assisted Hectors force
  With fate itself so long to hold the course
  Phoebus it was who in his latest hour
  Endued his knees with strength his nerves with power
  And great Achilles lest some Greeks advance
  Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance
  Signd to the troops to yield his foe the way
  And leave untouchd the honours of the day

  Jove lifts the golden balances that show
  The fates of mortal men and things below
  Here each contending heros lot he tries
  And weighs with equal hand their destinies
  Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hectors fate
  Heavy with death it sinks and hell receives the weight

  Then Phoebus left him Fierce Minerva flies
  To stern Pelides and triumphing cries
  O loved of Jove this day our labours cease
  And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece
  Great Hector falls that Hector famed so far
  Drunk with renown insatiable of war
  Falls by thy hand and mine nor force nor flight
  Shall more avail him nor his god of light
  See where in vain he supplicates above
  Rolld at the feet of unrelenting Jove
  Rest here myself will lead the Trojan on
  And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun

  Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind
  Obeyd and rested on his lance reclined
  While like Deiphobus the martial dame
  Her face her gesture and her arms the same
  In show an aid by hapless Hectors side
  Approachd and greets him thus with voice belied

  Too long O Hector have I borne the sight
  Of this distress and sorrowd in thy flight
  It fits us now a noble stand to make
  And here as brothers equal fates partake

  Then he O prince allied in blood and fame
  Dearer than all that own a brothers name
  Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore
  Long tried long loved much loved but honoured more
  Since you of all our numerous race alone
  Defend my life regardless of your own

  Again the goddess Much my fathers prayer
  And much my mothers pressd me to forbear
  My friends embraced my knees adjured my stay
  But stronger love impelld and I obey
  Come then the glorious conflict let us try
  Let the steel sparkle and the javelin fly
  Or let us stretch Achilles on the field
  Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield

  Fraudful she said then swiftly marchd before
  The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more
  Sternly they met The silence Hector broke
  His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke

  Enough O son of Peleus Troy has viewd
  Her walls thrice circled and her chief pursued
  But now some god within me bids me try
  Thine or my fate I kill thee or I die
  Yet on the verge of battle let us stay
  And for a moments space suspend the day
  Let Heavens high powers be calld to arbitrate
  The just conditions of this stern debate
  Eternal witnesses of all below
  And faithful guardians of the treasured vow
  To them I swear if victor in the strife
  Jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life
  No vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue
  Strippd of its arms alone the conquerors due
  The rest to Greece uninjured Ill restore
  Now plight thy mutual oath I ask no more

  Talk not of oaths the dreadful chief replies
  While anger flashd from his disdainful eyes
  Detested as thou art and ought to be
  Nor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee
  Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine
  Such leagues as men and furious lions join
  To such I call the gods one constant state
  Of lasting rancour and eternal hate
  No thought but rage and neverceasing strife
  Till death extinguish rage and thought and life
  Rouse then thy forces this important hour
  Collect thy soul and call forth all thy power
  No further subterfuge no further chance
  Tis Pallas Pallas gives thee to my lance
  Each Grecian ghost by thee deprived of breath
  Now hovers round and calls thee to thy death

  He spoke and launchd his javelin at the foe
  But Hector shunnd the meditated blow
  He stoopd while oer his head the flying spear
  Sang innocent and spent its force in air
  Minerva watchd it falling on the land
  Then drew and gave to great Achilles hand
  Unseen of Hector who elate with joy
  Now shakes his lance and braves the dread of Troy

  The life you boasted to that javelin given
  Prince you have missd My fate depends on Heaven
  To thee presumptuous as thou art unknown
  Or what must prove my fortune or thy own
  Boasting is but an art our fears to blind
  And with false terrors sink anothers mind
  But know whatever fate I am to try
  By no dishonest wound shall Hector die
  I shall not fall a fugitive at least
  My soul shall bravely issue from my breast
  But first try thou my arm and may this dart
  End all my countrys woes deep buried in thy heart

  The weapon flew its course unerring held
  Unerring but the heavenly shield repelld
  The mortal dart resulting with a bound
  From off the ringing orb it struck the ground
  Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain
  Nor other lance nor other hope remain
  He calls Deiphobus demands a spear
  In vain for no Deiphobus was there
  All comfortless he stands then with a sigh
  Tis soHeaven wills it and my hour is nigh
  I deemd Deiphobus had heard my call
  But he secure lies guarded in the wall
  A god deceived me Pallas twas thy deed
  Death and black fate approach tis I must bleed
  No refuge now no succour from above
  Great Jove deserts me and the son of Jove
  Propitious once and kind Then welcome fate
  Tis true I perish yet I perish great
  Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire
  Let future ages hear it and admire

  Fierce at the word his weighty sword he drew
  And all collected on Achilles flew
  So Joves bold bird high balanced in the air
  Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare
  Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares
  Before his breast the flaming shield he bears
  Refulgent orb above his fourfold cone
  The gilded horsehair sparkled in the sun
  Nodding at every step Vulcanian frame
  And as he moved his figure seemd on flame
  As radiant Hesper shines with keener light277
  Farbeaming oer the silver host of night
  When all the starry train emblaze the sphere
  So shone the point of great Achilles spear
  In his right hand he waves the weapon round
  Eyes the whole man and meditates the wound
  But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore
  Securely cased the warriors body oer
  One space at length he spies to let in fate
  Where twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate
  Gave entrance through that penetrable part
  Furious he drove the welldirected dart
  Nor pierced the windpipe yet nor took the power
  Of speech unhappy from thy dying hour
  Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies
  While thus triumphing stern Achilles cries

  At last is Hector stretchd upon the plain
  Who feard no vengeance for Patroclus slain
  Then prince you should have feard what now you feel
  Achilles absent was Achilles still
  Yet a short space the great avenger stayed
  Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid
  Peaceful he sleeps with all our rites adornd
  For ever honourd and for ever mournd
  While cast to all the rage of hostile power
  Thee birds shall mangle and the gods devour

  Then Hector fainting at the approach of death
  By thy own soul by those who gave thee breath
  By all the sacred prevalence of prayer
  Ah leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear
  The common rites of sepulture bestow
  To soothe a fathers and a mothers woe
  Let their large gifts procure an urn at least
  And Hectors ashes in his country rest

  No wretch accursed relentless he replies
  Flames as he spoke shot flashing from his eyes
  Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare
  Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer
  Could I myself the bloody banquet join
  Noto the dogs that carcase I resign
  Should Troy to bribe me bring forth all her store
  And giving thousands offer thousands more
  Should Dardan Priam and his weeping dame
  Drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame
  Their Hector on the pile they should not see
  Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee

  Then thus the chief his dying accents drew
  Thy rage implacable too well I knew
  The Furies that relentless breast have steeld
  And cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield
  Yet think a day will come when fates decree
  And angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee
  Phoebus and Paris shall avenge my fate
  And stretch thee here before the Scaean gate278

  He ceased The Fates suppressd his labouring breath
  And his eyes stiffend at the hand of death
  To the dark realm the spirit wings its way
  The manly body left a load of clay
  And plaintive glides along the dreary coast
  A naked wandering melancholy ghost

  Achilles musing as he rolld his eyes
  Oer the dead hero thus unheard replies
  Die thou the first When Jove and heaven ordain
  I follow theeHe said and strippd the slain
  Then forcing backward from the gaping wound
  The reeking javelin cast it on the ground
  The thronging Greeks behold with wondering eyes
  His manly beauty and superior size
  While some ignobler the great dead deface
  With wounds ungenerous or with taunts disgrace

  How changed that Hector who like Jove of late
  Sent lightning on our fleets and scatterd fate

  High oer the slain the great Achilles stands
  Begirt with heroes and surrounding bands
  And thus aloud while all the host attends
  Princes and leaders countrymen and friends
  Since now at length the powerful will of heaven
  The dire destroyer to our arm has given
  Is not Troy fallen already Haste ye powers
  See if already their deserted towers
  Are left unmannd or if they yet retain
  The souls of heroes their great Hector slain
  But what is Troy or glory what to me
  Or why reflects my mind on aught but thee
  Divine Patroclus Death hath seald his eyes
  Unwept unhonourd uninterrd he lies
  Can his dear image from my soul depart
  Long as the vital spirit moves my heart
  If in the melancholy shades below
  The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow
  Yet mine shall sacred last mine undecayd
  Burn on through death and animate my shade
  Meanwhile ye sons of Greece in triumph bring
  The corpse of Hector and your paeans sing
  Be this the song slowmoving toward the shore
  Hector is dead and Ilion is no more

  Then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred
  Unworthy of himself and of the dead
  The nervous ancles bored his feet he bound
  With thongs inserted through the double wound
  These fixd up high behind the rolling wain
  His graceful head was traild along the plain
  Proud on his car the insulting victor stood
  And bore aloft his arms distilling blood
  He smites the steeds the rapid chariot flies
  The sudden clouds of circling dust arise
  Now lost is all that formidable air
  The face divine and longdescending hair
  Purple the ground and streak the sable sand
  Deformd dishonourd in his native land
  Given to the rage of an insulting throng
  And in his parents sight now draggd along

  The mother first beheld with sad survey
  She rent her tresses venerable grey
  And cast far off the regal veils away
  With piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans
  While the sad father answers groans with groans
  Tears after tears his mournful cheeks oerflow
  And the whole city wears one face of woe
  No less than if the rage of hostile fires
  From her foundations curling to her spires
  Oer the proud citadel at length should rise
  And the last blaze send Ilion to the skies
  The wretched monarch of the falling state
  Distracted presses to the Dardan gate
  Scarce the whole people stop his desperate course
  While strong affliction gives the feeble force
  Grief tears his heart and drives him to and fro
  In all the raging impotence of woe
  At length he rolld in dust and thus begun
  Imploring all and naming one by one
  Ah let me let me go where sorrow calls
  I only I will issue from your walls
  Guide or companion friends I ask ye none
  And bow before the murderer of my son
  My grief perhaps his pity may engage
  Perhaps at least he may respect my age
  He has a father too a man like me
  One not exempt from age and misery
  Vigorous no more as when his young embrace
  Begot this pest of me and all my race
  How many valiant sons in early bloom
  Has that cursed hand send headlong to the tomb
  Thee Hector last thy loss divinely brave
  Sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave
  O had thy gentle spirit passd in peace
  The son expiring in the sires embrace
  While both thy parents wept the fatal hour
  And bending oer thee mixd the tender shower
  Some comfort that had been some sad relief
  To melt in full satiety of grief

  Thus waild the father grovelling on the ground
  And all the eyes of Ilion streamd around

  Amidst her matrons Hecuba appears
  A mourning princess and a train in tears
  Ah why has Heaven prolongd this hated breath
  Patient of horrors to behold thy death
  O Hector late thy parents pride and joy
  The boast of nations the defence of Troy
  To whom her safety and her fame she owed
  Her chief her hero and almost her god
  O fatal change become in one sad day
  A senseless corse inanimated clay

  But not as yet the fatal news had spread
  To fair Andromache of Hector dead
  As yet no messenger had told his fate
  Not een his stay without the Scaean gate
  Far in the close recesses of the dome
  Pensive she plied the melancholy loom
  A growing work employd her secret hours
  Confusedly gay with intermingled flowers
  Her fairhaired handmaids heat the brazen urn
  The bath preparing for her lords return
  In vain alas her lord returns no more
  Unbathed he lies and bleeds along the shore
  Now from the walls the clamours reach her ear
  And all her members shake with sudden fear
  Forth from her ivory hand the shuttle falls
  And thus astonishd to her maids she calls

                        Illustration THE BATH

                                THE BATH


  Ah follow me she cried what plaintive noise
  Invades my ear Tis sure my mothers voice
  My faltering knees their trembling frame desert
  A pulse unusual flutters at my heart
  Some strange disaster some reverse of fate
  Ye gods avert it threats the Trojan state
  Far be the omen which my thoughts suggest
  But much I fear my Hectors dauntless breast
  Confronts Achilles chased along the plain
  Shut from our walls I fear I fear him slain
  Safe in the crowd he ever scornd to wait
  And sought for glory in the jaws of fate
  Perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath
  Now quenchd for ever in the arms of death

  She spoke and furious with distracted pace
  Fears in her heart and anguish in her face
  Flies through the dome the maids her steps pursue
  And mounts the walls and sends around her view
  Too soon her eyes the killing object found
  The godlike Hector draggd along the ground
  A sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes
  She faints she falls her breath her colour flies
  Her hairs fair ornaments the braids that bound
  The net that held them and the wreath that crownd
  The veil and diadem flew far away
  The gift of Venus on her bridal day
  Around a train of weeping sisters stands

  O wretched husband of a wretched wife
  Born with one fate to one unhappy life
  For sure one star its baneful beam displayd
  On Priams roof and Hippoplacias shade
  From different parents different climes we came
  At different periods yet our fate the same
  Why was my birth to great Aetion owed
  And why was all that tender care bestowd
  Would I had never beenO thou the ghost
  Of my dead husband miserably lost
  Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone
  And I abandond desolate alone
  An only child once comfort of my pains
  Sad product now of hapless love remains
  No more to smile upon his sire no friend
  To help him now no father to defend
  For should he scape the sword the common doom
  What wrongs attend him and what griefs to come
  Even from his own paternal roof expelld
  Some stranger ploughs his patrimonial field
  The day that to the shades the father sends
  Robs the sad orphan of his fathers friends
  He wretched outcast of mankind appears
  For ever sad for ever bathed in tears
  Amongst the happy unregarded he
  Hangs on the robe or trembles at the knee
  While those his fathers former bounty fed
  Nor reach the goblet nor divide the bread
  The kindest but his present wants allay
  To leave him wretched the succeeding day
  Frugal compassion Heedless they who boast
  Both parents still nor feel what he has lost
  Shall cry Begone thy father feasts not here
  The wretch obeys retiring with a tear
  Thus wretched thus retiring all in tears
  To my sad soul Astyanax appears
  Forced by repeated insults to return
  And to his widowd mother vainly mourn
  He who with tender delicacy bred
  With princes sported and on dainties fed
  And when still evening gave him up to rest
  Sunk soft in down upon the nurses breast
  Mustah what must he not Whom Ilion calls
  Astyanax from her wellguarded walls279
  Is now that name no more unhappy boy
  Since now no more thy father guards his Troy
  But thou my Hector liest exposed in air
  Far from thy parents and thy consorts care
  Whose hand in vain directed by her love
  The martial scarf and robe of triumph wove
  Now to devouring flames be these a prey
  Useless to thee from this accursed day
  Yet let the sacrifice at least be paid
  An honour to the living not the dead

  So spake the mournful dame her matrons hear
  Sigh back her sighs and answer tear with tear

ARGUMENT

FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS280

Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus After the
funeral feast he retires to the seashore where falling asleep the
ghost of his friend appears to him and demands the rites of burial the
next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood
for the pyre The funeral procession and the offering their hair to the
dead Achilles sacrifices several animals and lastly twelve Trojan
captives at the pile then sets fire to it He pays libations to the
Winds which at the instance of Iris rise and raise the flames When
the pile has burned all night they gather the bones place them in an urn
of gold and raise the tomb Achilles institutes the funeral games the
chariotrace the fight of the caestus the wrestling the footrace the
single combat the discus the shooting with arrows the darting the
javelin the various descriptions of which and the various success of the
several antagonists make the greatest part of the book

In this book ends the thirtieth day The night following the ghost of
Patroclus appears to Achilles the oneandthirtieth day is employed in
felling the timber for the pile the twoandthirtieth in burning it and
the threeandthirtieth in the games The scene is generally on the
seashore

  Thus humbled in the dust the pensive train
  Through the sad city mournd her hero slain
  The body soild with dust and black with gore
  Lies on broad Hellesponts resounding shore
  The Grecians seek their ships and clear the strand
  All but the martial Myrmidonian band
  These yet assembled great Achilles holds
  And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds

  Not yet my brave companions of the war
  Release your smoking coursers from the car
  But with his chariot each in order led
  Perform due honours to Patroclus dead
  Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief
  Some rites remain to glut our rage of grief

  The troops obeyd and thrice in order led281
  Achilles first their coursers round the dead
  And thrice their sorrows and laments renew
  Tears bathe their arms and tears the sands bedew
  For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe
  Melts their strong hearts and bids their eyes to flow
  But chief Pelides thicksucceeding sighs
  Burst from his heart and torrents from his eyes
  His slaughtering hands yet red with blood he laid
  On his dead friends cold breast and thus he said

  All hail Patroclus let thy honourd ghost
  Hear and rejoice on Plutos dreary coast
  Behold Achilles promise is complete
  The bloody Hector stretchd before thy feet
  Lo to the dogs his carcase I resign
  And twelve sad victims of the Trojan line
  Sacred to vengeance instant shall expire
  Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre

  Gloomy he said and horrible to view
  Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw
  Prone on the dust The Myrmidons around
  Unbraced their armour and the steeds unbound
  All to Achilles sable ship repair
  Frequent and full the genial feast to share
  Now from the wellfed swine black smokes aspire
  The bristly victims hissing oer the fire
  The huge ox bellowing falls with feebler cries
  Expires the goat the sheep in silence dies
  Around the heros prostrate body flowd
  In one promiscuous stream the reeking blood
  And now a band of Argive monarchs brings
  The glorious victor to the king of kings
  From his dead friend the pensive warrior went
  With steps unwilling to the regal tent
  The attending heralds as by office bound
  With kindled flames the tripodvase surround
  To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore
  They urged in vain the chief refused and swore282

  No drop shall touch me by almighty Jove
  The first and greatest of the gods above
  Till on the pyre I place thee till I rear
  The grassy mound and clip thy sacred hair
  Some ease at least those pious rites may give
  And soothe my sorrows while I bear to live
  Howeer reluctant as I am I stay
  And share your feast but with the dawn of day
  O king of men it claims thy royal care
  That Greece the warriors funeral pile prepare
  And bid the forests fall such rites are paid
  To heroes slumbering in eternal shade
  Then when his earthly part shall mount in fire
  Let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire

  He spoke they hear him and the word obey
  The rage of hunger and of thirst allay
  Then ease in sleep the labours of the day
  But great Pelides stretchd along the shore
  Where dashd on rocks the broken billows roar
  Lies inly groaning while on either hand
  The martial Myrmidons confusedly stand
  Along the grass his languid members fall
  Tired with his chase around the Trojan wall
  Hushd by the murmurs of the rolling deep
  At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep
  When lo the shade before his closing eyes
  Of sad Patroclus rose or seemd to rise
  In the same robe he living wore he came
  In stature voice and pleasing look the same
  The form familiar hoverd oer his head
  And sleeps Achilles thus the phantom said
  Sleeps my Achilles his Patroclus dead
  Living I seemd his dearest tenderest care
  But now forgot I wander in the air
  Let my pale corse the rites of burial know
  And give me entrance in the realms below
  Till then the spirit finds no restingplace
  But here and there the unbodied spectres chase
  The vagrant dead around the dark abode
  Forbid to cross the irremeable flood
  Now give thy hand for to the farther shore
  When once we pass the soul returns no more
  When once the last funereal flames ascend
  No more shall meet Achilles and his friend
  No more our thoughts to those we loved make known
  Or quit the dearest to converse alone
  Me fate has severd from the sons of earth
  The fate foredoomd that waited from my birth
  Thee too it waits before the Trojan wall
  Even great and godlike thou art doomd to fall
  Hear then and as in fate and love we join
  Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine
  Together have we lived together bred
  One house received us and one table fed
  That golden urn thy goddessmother gave
  May mix our ashes in one common grave

  And is it thou he answers To my sight283
  Once more returnst thou from the realms of night
  O more than brother Think each office paid
  Whateer can rest a discontented shade
  But grant one last embrace unhappy boy
  Afford at least that melancholy joy

  He said and with his longing arms essayd
  In vain to grasp the visionary shade
  Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly284
  And hears a feeble lamentable cry
  Confused he wakes amazement breaks the bands
  Of golden sleep and starting from the sands
  Pensive he muses with uplifted hands

  Tis true tis certain man though dead retains
  Part of himself the immortal mind remains
  The form subsists without the bodys aid
  Aerial semblance and an empty shade
  This night my friend so late in battle lost
  Stood at my side a pensive plaintive ghost
  Even now familiar as in life he came
  Alas how different yet how like the same

  Thus while he spoke each eye grew big with tears
  And now the rosyfingerd morn appears
  Shows every mournful face with tears oerspread
  And glares on the pale visage of the dead
  But Agamemnon as the rites demand
  With mules and waggons sends a chosen band
  To load the timber and the pile to rear
  A charge consignd to Merions faithful care
  With proper instruments they take the road
  Axes to cut and ropes to sling the load
  First march the heavy mules securely slow
  Oer hills oer dales oer crags oer rocks they go285
  Jumping high oer the shrubs of the rough ground
  Rattle the clattering cars and the shockd axles bound
  But when arrived at Idas spreading woods286
  Fair Ida waterd with descending floods
  Loud sounds the axe redoubling strokes on strokes
  On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks
  Headlong Deep echoing groan the thickets brown
  Then rustling crackling crashing thunder down
  The wood the Grecians cleave prepared to burn
  And the slow mules the same rough road return
  The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore
  Such charge was given them to the sandy shore
  There on the spot which great Achilles showd
  They eased their shoulders and disposed the load
  Circling around the place where times to come
  Shall view Patroclus and Achilles tomb
  The hero bids his martial troops appear
  High on their cars in all the pomp of war
  Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires
  All mount their chariots combatants and squires
  The chariots first proceed a shining train
  Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain
  Next these the melancholy band appear
  Amidst lay dead Patroclus on the bier
  Oer all the corse their scattered locks they throw
  Achilles next oppressd with mighty woe
  Supporting with his hands the heros head
  Bends oer the extended body of the dead
  Patroclus decent on the appointed ground
  They place and heap the sylvan pile around
  But great Achilles stands apart in prayer
  And from his head divides the yellow hair
  Those curling locks which from his youth he vowd287
  And sacred grew to Sperchius honourd flood
  Then sighing to the deep his locks he cast
  And rolld his eyes around the watery waste

  Sperchius whose waves in mazy errors lost
  Delightful roll along my native coast
  To whom we vainly vowd at our return
  These locks to fall and hecatombs to burn
  Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice
  Where to the day thy silver fountains rise
  And where in shade of consecrated bowers
  Thy altars stand perfumed with native flowers
  So vowd my father but he vowd in vain
  No more Achilles sees his native plain
  In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow
  Patroclus bears them to the shades below

  Thus oer Patroclus while the hero prayd
  On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid
  Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow
  And now the sun had set upon their woe
  But to the king of men thus spoke the chief
  Enough Atrides give the troops relief
  Permit the mourning legions to retire
  And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre
  The pious care be ours the dead to burn
  He said the people to their ships return
  While those deputed to inter the slain
  Heap with a rising pyramid the plain288
  A hundred foot in length a hundred wide
  The growing structure spreads on every side
  High on the top the manly corse they lay
  And wellfed sheep and sable oxen slay
  Achilles covered with their fat the dead
  And the piled victims round the body spread
  Then jars of honey and of fragrant oil
  Suspends around lowbending oer the pile
  Four sprightly coursers with a deadly groan
  Pour forth their lives and on the pyre are thrown
  Of nine large dogs domestic at his board
  Fall two selected to attend their lord
  Then last of all and horrible to tell
  Sad sacrifice twelve Trojan captives fell289
  On these the rage of fire victorious preys
  Involves and joins them in one common blaze
  Smeard with the bloody rites he stands on high
  And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry290

  All hail Patroclus let thy vengeful ghost
  Hear and exult on Plutos dreary coast
  Behold Achilles promise fully paid
  Twelve Trojan heroes offerd to thy shade
  But heavier fates on Hectors corse attend
  Saved from the flames for hungry dogs to rend

  So spake he threatening but the gods made vain
  His threat and guard inviolate the slain
  Celestial Venus hoverd oer his head
  And roseate unguents heavenly fragrance shed
  She watchd him all the night and all the day
  And drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey
  Nor sacred Phoebus less employd his care
  He pourd around a veil of gatherd air
  And kept the nerves undried the flesh entire
  Against the solar beam and Sirian fire

                      THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS


  Nor yet the pile where dead Patroclus lies
  Smokes nor as yet the sullen flames arise
  But fast beside Achilles stood in prayer
  Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air
  And victims promised and libations cast
  To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast
  He calld the aerial powers along the skies
  To breathe and whisper to the fires to rise
  The winged Iris heard the heros call
  And instant hastend to their airy hall
  Where in old Zephyrs open courts on high
  Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky
  She shone amidst them on her painted bow
  The rocky pavement glitterd with the show
  All from the banquet rise and each invites
  The various goddess to partake the rites
  Not so the dame replied I haste to go
  To sacred Ocean and the floods below
  Even now our solemn hecatombs attend
  And heaven is feasting on the worlds green end
  With righteous Ethiops uncorrupted train
  Far on the extremest limits of the main
  But Peleus son entreats with sacrifice
  The western spirit and the north to rise
  Let on Patroclus pile your blast be driven
  And bear the blazing honours high to heaven

  Swift as the word she vanishd from their view
  Swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew
  Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar
  And heaps on heaps the clouds are tossd before
  To the wide main then stooping from the skies
  The heaving deeps in watery mountains rise
  Troy feels the blast along her shaking walls
  Till on the pile the gatherd tempest falls
  The structure crackles in the roaring fires
  And all the night the plenteous flame aspires
  All night Achilles hails Patroclus soul
  With large libations from the golden bowl
  As a poor father helpless and undone
  Mourns oer the ashes of an only son
  Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn
  And pours in tears ere yet they close the urn
  So stayd Achilles circling round the shore
  So watchd the flames till now they flame no more
  Twas when emerging through the shades of night
  The morning planet told the approach of light
  And fast behind Auroras warmer ray
  Oer the broad ocean pourd the golden day
  Then sank the blaze the pile no longer burnd
  And to their caves the whistling winds returnd
  Across the Thracian seas their course they bore
  The ruffled seas beneath their passage roar

  Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep
  And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep
  Exhausted with his grief meanwhile the crowd
  Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood
  The tumult waked him from his eyes he shook
  Unwilling slumber and the chiefs bespoke

  Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name
  First let us quench the yet remaining flame
  With sable wine then as the rites direct
  The heros bones with careful view select
  Apart and easy to be known they lie
  Amidst the heap and obvious to the eye
  The rest around the margin will be seen
  Promiscuous steeds and immolated men
  These wrappd in double cauls of fat prepare
  And in the golden vase dispose with care
  There let them rest with decent honour laid
  Till I shall follow to the infernal shade
  Meantime erect the tomb with pious hands
  A common structure on the humble sands
  Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raise
  And late posterity record our praise

  The Greeks obey where yet the embers glow
  Wide oer the pile the sable wine they throw
  And deep subsides the ashy heap below
  Next the white bones his sad companions place
  With tears collected in the golden vase
  The sacred relics to the tent they bore
  The urn a veil of linen covered oer
  That done they bid the sepulchre aspire
  And cast the deep foundations round the pyre
  High in the midst they heap the swelling bed
  Of rising earth memorial of the dead

  The swarming populace the chief detains
  And leads amidst a wide extent of plains
  There placed them round then from the ships proceeds
  A train of oxen mules and stately steeds
  Vases and tripods for the funeral games
  Resplendent brass and more resplendent dames
  First stood the prizes to reward the force
  Of rapid racers in the dusty course
  A woman for the first in beautys bloom
  Skilld in the needle and the labouring loom
  And a large vase where two bright handles rise
  Of twenty measures its capacious size
  The second victor claims a mare unbroke
  Big with a mule unknowing of the yoke
  The third a charger yet untouchd by flame
  Four ample measures held the shining frame
  Two golden talents for the fourth were placed
  An ample double bowl contents the last
  These in fair order ranged upon the plain
  The hero rising thus addressd the train

  Behold the prizes valiant Greeks decreed
  To the brave rulers of the racing steed
  Prizes which none beside ourself could gain
  Should our immortal coursers take the plain
  A race unrivalld which from oceans god
  Peleus received and on his son bestowd
  But this no time our vigour to display
  Nor suit with them the games of this sad day
  Lost is Patroclus now that wont to deck
  Their flowing manes and sleek their glossy neck
  Sad as they shared in human grief they stand
  And trail those graceful honours on the sand
  Let others for the noble task prepare
  Who trust the courser and the flying car

  Fired at his word the rival racers rise
  But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize
  Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed
  And skilld to manage the highbounding steed
  With equal ardour bold Tydides swelld
  The steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compelld
  Which late obeyd the Dardan chiefs command
  When scarce a god redeemd him from his hand
  Then Menelaus his Podargus brings
  And the famed courser of the king of kings
  Whom rich Echepolus more rich than brave
  To scape the wars to Agamemnon gave
  Ćthe her name at home to end his days
  Base wealth preferring to eternal praise
  Next him Antilochus demands the course
  With beating heart and cheers his Pylian horse
  Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins
  Directs his judgment and his heat restrains
  Nor idly warns the hoary sire nor hears
  The prudent son with unattending ears

  My son though youthful ardour fire thy breast
  The gods have loved thee and with arts have blessd
  Neptune and Jove on thee conferrd the skill
  Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel
  To guide thy conduct little precept needs
  But slow and past their vigour are my steeds
  Fear not thy rivals though for swiftness known
  Compare those rivals judgment and thy own
  It is not strength but art obtains the prize
  And to be swift is less than to be wise
  Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes
  The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks
  By art the pilot through the boiling deep
  And howling tempest steers the fearless ship
  And tis the artist wins the glorious course
  Not those who trust in chariots and in horse
  In vain unskilful to the goal they strive
  And short or wide the ungovernd courser drive
  While with sure skill though with inferior steeds
  The knowing racer to his end proceeds
  Fixd on the goal his eye foreruns the course
  His hand unerring steers the steady horse
  And now contracts or now extends the rein
  Observing still the foremost on the plain
  Mark then the goal tis easy to be found
  Yon aged trunk a cubit from the ground
  Of some once stately oak the last remains
  Or hardy fir unperishd with the rains
  Inclosed with stones conspicuous from afar
  And round a circle for the wheeling car
  Some tomb perhaps of old the dead to grace
  Or then as now the limit of a race
  Bear close to this and warily proceed
  A little bending to the lefthand steed
  But urge the right and give him all the reins
  While thy strict hand his fellows head restrains
  And turns him short till doubling as they roll
  The wheels round naves appear to brush the goal
  Yet not to break the car or lame the horse
  Clear of the stony heap direct the course
  Lest through incaution failing thou mayst be
  A joy to others a reproach to me
  So shalt thou pass the goal secure of mind
  And leave unskilful swiftness far behind
  Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed
  Which bore Adrastus of celestial breed
  Or the famed race through all the regions known
  That whirld the car of proud Laomedon

  Thus nought unsaid the muchadvising sage
  Concludes then sat stiff with unwieldy age
  Next bold Meriones was seen to rise
  The last but not least ardent for the prize
  They mount their seats the lots their place dispose
  Rolld in his helmet these Achilles throws
  Young Nestor leads the race Eumelus then
  And next the brother of the king of men
  Thy lot Meriones the fourth was cast
  And far the bravest Diomed was last
  They stand in order an impatient train
  Pelides points the barrier on the plain
  And sends before old Phoenix to the place
  To mark the racers and to judge the race
  At once the coursers from the barrier bound
  The lifted scourges all at once resound
  Their heart their eyes their voice they send before
  And up the champaign thunder from the shore
  Thick where they drive the dusty clouds arise
  And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies
  Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined
  Float in their speed and dance upon the wind
  The smoking chariots rapid as they bound
  Now seem to touch the sky and now the ground
  While hot for fame and conquest all their care
  Each oer his flying courser hung in air
  Erect with ardour poised upon the rein
  They pant they stretch they shout along the plain
  Now the last compass fetchd around the goal
  At the near prize each gathers all his soul
  Each burns with double hope with double pain
  Tears up the shore and thunders toward the main
  First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds
  With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds
  Close on Eumelus back they puff the wind
  And seem just mounting on his car behind
  Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze
  And hovering oer their stretching shadows sees
  Then had he lost or left a doubtful prize
  But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies
  Strikes from his hand the scourge and renders vain
  His matchless horses labour on the plain
  Rage fills his eye with anguish to survey
  Snatchd from his hope the glories of the day
  The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain
  Springs to her knight and gives the scourge again
  And fills his steeds with vigour At a stroke
  She breaks his rivals chariot from the yoke
  No more their way the startled horses held
  The car reversed came rattling on the field
  Shot headlong from his seat beside the wheel
  Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell
  His batterd face and elbows strike the ground
  Nose mouth and front one undistinguishd wound
  Grief stops his voice a torrent drowns his eyes
  Before him far the glad Tydides flies
  Minervas spirit drives his matchless pace
  And crowns him victor of the labourd race

  The next though distant Menelaus succeeds
  While thus young Nestor animates his steeds
  Now now my generous pair exert your force
  Not that we hope to match Tydides horse
  Since great Minerva wings their rapid way
  And gives their lord the honours of the day
  But reach Atrides shall his mare outgo
  Your swiftness vanquishd by a female foe
  Through your neglect if lagging on the plain
  The last ignoble gift be all we gain
  No more shall Nestors hand your food supply
  The old mans fury rises and ye die
  Haste then yon narrow road before our sight
  Presents the occasion could we use it right

  Thus he The coursers at their masters threat
  With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat
  And now Antilochus with nice survey
  Observes the compass of the hollow way
  Twas where by force of wintry torrents torn
  Fast by the road a precipice was worn
  Here where but one could pass to shun the throng
  The Spartan heros chariot smoked along
  Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep
  Still edging near and bears him toward the steep
  Atrides trembling casts his eye below
  And wonders at the rashness of his foe
  Hold stay your steedsWhat madness thus to ride
  This narrow way take larger field he cried
  Or both must fallAtrides cried in vain
  He flies more fast and throws up all the rein
  Far as an able arm the disk can send
  When youthful rivals their full force extend
  So far Antilochus thy chariot flew
  Before the king he cautious backward drew
  His horse compelld foreboding in his fears
  The rattling ruin of the clashing cars
  The floundering coursers rolling on the plain
  And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain
  But thus upbraids his rival as he flies
  Go furious youth ungenerous and unwise
  Go but expect not Ill the prize resign
  Add perjury to fraud and make it thine
  Then to his steeds with all his force he cries
  Be swift be vigorous and regain the prize
  Your rivals destitute of youthful force
  With fainting knees shall labour in the course
  And yield the glory yoursThe steeds obey
  Already at their heels they wing their way
  And seem already to retrieve the day

  Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld
  The coursers bounding oer the dusty field
  The first who markd them was the Cretan king
  High on a rising ground above the ring
  The monarch sat from whence with sure survey
  He well observed the chief who led the way
  And heard from far his animating cries
  And saw the foremost steed with sharpend eyes
  On whose broad front a blaze of shining white
  Like the full moon stood obvious to the sight
  He saw and rising to the Greeks begun
  Are yonder horse discernd by me alone
  Or can ye all another chief survey
  And other steeds than lately led the way
  Those though the swiftest by some god withheld
  Lie sure disabled in the middle field
  For since the goal they doubled round the plain
  I search to find them but I search in vain
  Perchance the reins forsook the drivers hand
  And turnd too short he tumbled on the strand
  Shot from the chariot while his coursers stray
  With frantic fury from the destined way
  Rise then some other and inform my sight
  For these dim eyes perhaps discern not right
  Yet sure he seems to judge by shape and air
  The great Ćtolian chief renownd in war

  Old man Oileus rashly thus replies
  Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize
  Of those who view the course nor sharpest eyed
  Nor youngest yet the readiest to decide
  Eumelus steeds high bounding in the chase
  Still as at first unrivalld lead the race
  I well discern him as he shakes the rein
  And hear his shouts victorious oer the plain

  Thus he Idomeneus incensed rejoind
  Barbarous of words and arrogant of mind
  Contentious prince of all the Greeks beside
  The last in merit as the first in pride
  To vile reproach what answer can we make
  A goblet or a tripod let us stake
  And be the king the judge The most unwise
  Will learn their rashness when they pay the price

  He said and Ajax by mad passion borne
  Stern had replied fierce scorn enhancing scorn
  To fell extremes But Thetis godlike son
  Awful amidst them rose and thus begun

  Forbear ye chiefs reproachful to contend
  Much would ye blame should others thus offend
  And lo the approaching steeds your contest end
  No sooner had he spoke but thundering near
  Drives through a stream of dust the charioteer
  High oer his head the circling lash he wields
  His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields
  His car amidst the dusty whirlwind rolld
  Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold
  Refulgent through the cloud no eye could find
  The track his flying wheels had left behind
  And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace
  So swift it seemd a flight and not a race
  Now victor at the goal Tydides stands
  Quits his bright car and springs upon the sands
  From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream
  The wellplied whip is hung athwart the beam
  With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize
  The tripodvase and dame with radiant eyes
  These to the ships his train triumphant leads
  The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds

  Young Nestor follows who by art not force
  Oerpassd Atrides second in the course
  Behind Atrides urged the race more near
  Than to the courser in his swift career
  The following car just touching with his heel
  And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel
  Such and so narrow now the space between
  The rivals late so distant on the green
  So soon swift Ćthe her lost ground regaind
  One length one moment had the race obtaind

  Merion pursued at greater distance still
  With tardier coursers and inferior skill
  Last came Admetus thy unhappy son
  Slow dragged the steeds his batterd chariot on
  Achilles saw and pitying thus begun

  Behold the man whose matchless art surpassd
  The sons of Greece the ablest yet the last
  Fortune denies but justice bids us pay
  Since great Tydides bears the first away
  To him the second honours of the day

  The Greeks consent with loudapplauding cries
  And then Eumelus had received the prize
  But youthful Nestor jealous of his fame
  The award opposes and asserts his claim
  Think not he cries I tamely will resign
  O Peleus son the mare so justly mine
  What if the gods the skilful to confound
  Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground
  Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice
  And vows omitted forfeited the prize
  If yet distinction to thy friend to show
  And please a soul desirous to bestow
  Some gift must grace Eumelus view thy store
  Of beauteous handmaids steeds and shining ore
  An ample present let him thence receive
  And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give
  But this my prize I never shall forego
  This who but touches warriors is my foe

  Thus spake the youth nor did his words offend
  Pleased with the wellturnd flattery of a friend
  Achilles smiled The gift proposed he cried
  Antilochus we shall ourself provide
  With plates of brass the corslet coverd oer
  The same renownd Asteropaeus wore
  Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine
  No vulgar gift Eumelus shall be thine

  He said Automedon at his command
  The corslet brought and gave it to his hand
  Distinguishd by his friend his bosom glows
  With generous joy then Menelaus rose
  The herald placed the sceptre in his hands
  And stilld the clamour of the shouting bands
  Not without cause incensed at Nestors son
  And inly grieving thus the king begun

  The praise of wisdom in thy youth obtaind
  An act so rash Antilochus has staind
  Robbd of my glory and my just reward
  To you O Grecians be my wrong declared
  So not a leader shall our conduct blame
  Or judge me envious of a rivals fame
  But shall not we ourselves the truth maintain
  What needs appealing in a fact so plain
  What Greek shall blame me if I bid thee rise
  And vindicate by oath th illgotten prize
  Rise if thou darest before thy chariot stand
  The driving scourge highlifted in thy hand
  And touch thy steeds and swear thy whole intent
  Was but to conquer not to circumvent
  Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround
  The globe and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground

  The prudent chief with calm attention heard
  Then mildly thus Excuse if youth have errd
  Superior as thou art forgive the offence
  Nor I thy equal or in years or sense
  Thou knowst the errors of unripend age
  Weak are its counsels headlong is its rage
  The prize I quit if thou thy wrath resign
  The mare or aught thou askst be freely thine
  Ere I become from thy dear friendship torn
  Hateful to thee and to the gods forsworn

  So spoke Antilochus and at the word
  The mare contested to the king restored
  Joy swells his soul as when the vernal grain
  Lifts the green ear above the springing plain
  The fields their vegetable life renew
  And laugh and glitter with the morning dew
  Such joy the Spartans shining face oerspread
  And lifted his gay heart while thus he said

  Still may our souls O generous youth agree
  Tis now Atrides turn to yield to thee
  Rash heat perhaps a moment might control
  Not break the settled temper of thy soul
  Not but my friend tis still the wiser way
  To waive contention with superior sway
  For ah how few who should like thee offend
  Like thee have talents to regain the friend
  To plead indulgence and thy fault atone
  Suffice thy fathers merit and thy own
  Generous alike for me the sire and son
  Have greatly sufferd and have greatly done
  I yield that all may know my soul can bend
  Nor is my pride preferrd before my friend

  He said and pleased his passion to command
  Resignd the courser to Noemons hand
  Friend of the youthful chief himself content
  The shining charger to his vessel sent
  The golden talents Merion next obtaind
  The fifth reward the double bowl remaind
  Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears
  And thus the purpose of his gift declares
  Accept thou this O sacred sire he said
  In dear memorial of Patroclus dead
  Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies
  For ever snatchd from our desiring eyes
  Take thou this token of a grateful heart
  Though tis not thine to hurl the distant dart
  The quoit to toss the ponderous mace to wield
  Or urge the race or wrestle on the field
  Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown
  But left the glory of the past thy own

  He said and placed the goblet at his side
  With joy the venerable king replied

  Wisely and well my son thy words have proved
  A senior honourd and a friend beloved
  Too true it is deserted of my strength
  These witherd arms and limbs have faild at length
  Oh had I now that force I felt of yore
  Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore
  Victorious then in every solemn game
  Ordaind to Amarynces mighty name
  The brave Epeians gave my glory way
  Ćtolians Pylians all resignd the day
  I quelld Clytomedes in fights of hand
  And backward hurld Ancaeus on the sand
  Surpassd Iphyclus in the swift career
  Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear
  The sons of Actor won the prize of horse
  But won by numbers not by art or force
  For the famed twins impatient to survey
  Prize after prize by Nestor borne away
  Sprung to their car and with united pains
  One lashd the coursers while one ruled the reins
  Such once I was Now to these tasks succeeds
  A younger race that emulate our deeds
  I yield alas to age who must not yield
  Though once the foremost hero of the field
  Go thou my son by generous friendship led
  With martial honours decorate the dead
  While pleased I take the gift thy hands present
  Pledge of benevolence and kind intent
  Rejoiced of all the numerous Greeks to see
  Not one but honours sacred age and me
  Those due distinctions thou so well canst pay
  May the just gods return another day

  Proud of the gift thus spake the full of days
  Achilles heard him prouder of the praise

  The prizes next are orderd to the field
  For the bold champions who the caestus wield
  A stately mule as yet by toils unbroke
  Of six years age unconscious of the yoke
  Is to the circus led and firmly bound
  Next stands a goblet massy large and round
  Achilles rising thus Let Greece excite
  Two heroes equal to this hardy fight
  Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke
  And rush beneath the longdescending stroke
  On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow
  And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know
  This mule his dauntless labours shall repay
  The vanquishd bear the massy bowl away

  This dreadful combat great Epeus chose291
  High oer the crowd enormous bulk he rose
  And seized the beast and thus began to say
  Stand forth some man to bear the bowl away
  Price of his ruin for who dares deny
  This mule my right the undoubted victor I
  Others tis ownd in fields of battle shine
  But the first honours of this fight are mine
  For who excels in all Then let my foe
  Draw near but first his certain fortune know
  Secure this hand shall his whole frame confound
  Mash all his bones and all his body pound
  So let his friends be nigh a needful train
  To heave the batterd carcase off the plain

  The giant spoke and in a stupid gaze
  The host beheld him silent with amaze
  Twas thou Euryalus who durst aspire
  To meet his might and emulate thy sire
  The great Mecistheus who in days of yore
  In Theban games the noblest trophy bore
  The games ordaind dead OEdipus to grace
  And singly vanquish the Cadmean race
  Him great Tydides urges to contend
  Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend
  Officious with the cincture girds him round
  And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound
  Amid the circle now each champion stands
  And poises high in air his iron hands
  With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close
  Their crackling jaws reecho to the blows
  And painful sweat from all their members flows
  At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow
  Full on the cheek of his unwary foe
  Beneath that ponderous arms resistless sway
  Down droppd he nerveless and extended lay
  As a large fish when winds and waters roar
  By some huge billow dashd against the shore
  Lies panting not less batterd with his wound
  The bleeding hero pants upon the ground
  To rear his fallen foe the victor lends
  Scornful his hand and gives him to his friends
  Whose arms support him reeling through the throng
  And dragging his disabled legs along
  Nodding his head hangs down his shoulder oer
  His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore292
  Wrappd round in mists he lies and lost to thought
  His friends receive the bowl too dearly bought

  The third bold game Achilles next demands
  And calls the wrestlers to the level sands
  A massy tripod for the victor lies
  Of twice six oxen its reputed price
  And next the losers spirits to restore
  A female captive valued but at four
  Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop
  When towerlike Ajax and Ulysses rose
  Amid the ring each nervous rival stands
  Embracing rigid with implicit hands
  Close lockd above their heads and arms are mixd
  Below their planted feet at distance fixd
  Like two strong rafters which the builder forms
  Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms
  Their tops connected but at wider space
  Fixd on the centre stands their solid base
  Now to the grasp each manly body bends
  The humid sweat from every pore descends
  Their bones resound with blows sides shoulders thighs
  Swell to each gripe and bloody tumours rise
  Nor could Ulysses for his art renownd
  Oerturn the strength of Ajax on the ground
  Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow
  The watchful caution of his artful foe
  While the long strife even tired the lookers on
  Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon
  Or let me lift thee chief or lift thou me
  Prove we our force and Jove the rest decree

  He said and straining heaved him off the ground
  With matchless strength that time Ulysses found
  The strength to evade and where the nerves combine
  His ankle struck the giant fell supine
  Ulysses following on his bosom lies
  Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies
  Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays
  He barely stirrd him but he could not raise
  His knee lockd fast the foes attempt denied
  And grappling close they tumbled side by side
  Defiled with honourable dust they roll
  Still breathing strife and unsubdued of soul
  Again they rage again to combat rise
  When great Achilles thus divides the prize

  Your noble vigour O my friends restrain
  Nor weary out your generous strength in vain
  Ye both have won let others who excel
  Now prove that prowess you have proved so well

  The heros words the willing chiefs obey
  From their tired bodies wipe the dust away
  And clothed anew the following games survey

  And now succeed the gifts ordaind to grace
  The youths contending in the rapid race
  A silver urn that full six measures held
  By none in weight or workmanship excelld
  Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine
  Elaborate with artifice divine
  Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport
  And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port
  From him descended good Eunaeus heird
  The glorious gift and for Lycaon spared
  To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward
  Now the same heros funeral rites to grace
  It stands the prize of swiftness in the race
  A wellfed ox was for the second placed
  And half a talent must content the last
  Achilles rising then bespoke the train
  Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain
  Stand forth and bear these prizes from the plain

  The hero said and starting from his place
  Oilean Ajax rises to the race
  Ulysses next and he whose speed surpassd
  His youthful equals Nestors son the last
  Ranged in a line the ready racers stand
  Pelides points the barrier with his hand
  All start at once Oileus led the race
  The next Ulysses measuring pace with pace
  Behind him diligently close he sped
  As closely following as the running thread
  The spindle follows and displays the charms
  Of the fair spinsters breast and moving arms
  Graceful in motion thus his foe he plies
  And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise
  His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays
  The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise
  To him they give their wishes hearts and eyes
  And send their souls before him as he flies
  Now three times turnd in prospect of the goal
  The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul
  Assist O goddess thus in thought he prayd
  And present at his thought descends the maid
  Buoyd by her heavenly force he seems to swim
  And feels a pinion lifting every limb
  All fierce and ready now the prize to gain
  Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain
  Oerturnd by Pallas where the slippery shore
  Was cloggd with slimy dung and mingled gore
  The selfsame place beside Patroclus pyre
  Where late the slaughterd victims fed the fire
  Besmeard with filth and blotted oer with clay
  Obscene to sight the rueful racer lay
  The wellfed bull the second prize he shared
  And left the urn Ulysses rich reward
  Then grasping by the horn the mighty beast
  The baffled hero thus the Greeks addressd

  Accursed fate the conquest I forego
  A mortal I a goddess was my foe
  She urged her favourite on the rapid way
  And Pallas not Ulysses won the day

  Thus sourly waild he sputtering dirt and gore
  A burst of laughter echoed through the shore
  Antilochus more humorous than the rest
  Takes the last prize and takes it with a jest

  Why with our wiser elders should we strive
  The gods still love them and they always thrive
  Ye see to Ajax I must yield the prize
  He to Ulysses still more aged and wise
  A green old age unconscious of decays
  That proves the hero born in better days
  Behold his vigour in this active race
  Achilles only boasts a swifter pace
  For who can match Achilles He who can
  Must yet be more than hero more than man

  The effect succeeds the speech Pelides cries
  Thy artful praise deserves a better prize
  Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extolld
  Receive a talent of the purest gold
  The youth departs content The host admire
  The son of Nestor worthy of his sire

  Next these a buckler spear and helm he brings
  Cast on the plain the brazen burden rings
  Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore
  And great Patroclus in short triumph bore
  Stand forth the bravest of our host he cries
  Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize
  Now grace the lists before our armys sight
  And sheathed in steel provoke his foe to fight
  Who first the jointed armour shall explore
  And stain his rivals mail with issuing gore
  The sword Asteropaeus possessd of old
  A Thracian blade distinct with studs of gold
  Shall pay the stroke and grace the strikers side
  These arms in common let the chiefs divide
  For each brave champion when the combat ends
  A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends

  Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus son
  And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon
  Clad in refulgent steel on either hand
  The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand
  Louring they meet tremendous to the sight
  Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight
  Opposed in arms not long they idly stood
  But thrice they closed and thrice the charge renewd
  A furious pass the spear of Ajax made
  Through the broad shield but at the corslet stayd
  Not thus the foe his javelin aimd above
  The bucklers margin at the neck he drove
  But Greece now trembling for her heros life
  Bade share the honours and surcease the strife
  Yet still the victors due Tydides gains
  With him the sword and studded belt remains

  Then hurld the hero thundering on the ground
  A mass of iron an enormous round
  Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire
  Rude from the furnace and but shaped by fire
  This mighty quoit Aetion wont to rear
  And from his whirling arm dismiss in air
  The giant by Achilles slain he stowd
  Among his spoils this memorable load
  For this he bids those nervous artists vie
  That teach the disk to sound along the sky
  Let him whose might can hurl this bowl arise
  Who farthest hurls it take it as his prize
  If he be one enrichd with large domain
  Of downs for flocks and arable for grain
  Small stock of iron needs that man provide
  His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied
  From hence nor ask the neighbouring citys aid
  For ploughshares wheels and all the rural trade

  Stern Polypoetes steppd before the throng
  And great Leonteus more than mortal strong
  Whose force with rival forces to oppose
  Uprose great Ajax up Epeus rose
  Each stood in order first Epeus threw
  High oer the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew
  Leonteus next a little space surpassd
  And third the strength of godlike Ajax cast
  Oer both their marks it flew till fiercely flung
  From Polypoetes arm the discus sung
  Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws
  That distant falls among the grazing cows
  So past them all the rapid circle flies
  His friends while loud applauses shake the skies
  With force conjoind heave off the weighty prize

  Those who in skilful archery contend
  He next invites the twanging bow to bend
  And twice ten axes casts amidst the round
  Ten doubleedged and ten that singly wound
  The mast which late a firstrate galley bore
  The hero fixes in the sandy shore
  To the tall top a milkwhite dove they tie
  The trembling mark at which their arrows fly

  Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird shall bear
  These twoedged axes terrible in war
  The single he whose shaft divides the cord
  He said experienced Merion took the word
  And skilful Teucer in the helm they threw
  Their lots inscribed and forth the latter flew
  Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies
  But flies unblessd No grateful sacrifice
  No firstling lambs unheedful didst thou vow
  To Phoebus patron of the shaft and bow
  For this thy wellaimd arrow turnd aside
  Errd from the dove yet cut the cord that tied
  Adown the mainmast fell the parted string
  And the free bird to heaven displays her wing
  Sea shores and skies with loud applause resound
  And Merion eager meditates the wound
  He takes the bow directs the shaft above
  And following with his eye the soaring dove
  Implores the god to speed it through the skies
  With vows of firstling lambs and grateful sacrific
  The dove in airy circles as she wheels
  Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels
  Quite through and through the point its passage found
  And at his feet fell bloody to the ground
  The wounded bird ere yet she breathed her last
  With flagging wings alighted on the mast
  A moment hung and spread her pinions there
  Then sudden droppd and left her life in air
  From the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise
  And to the ships brave Merion bears the prize

  To close the funeral games Achilles last
  A massy spear amid the circle placed
  And ample charger of unsullied frame
  With flowers highwrought not blackend yet by flame
  For these he bids the heroes prove their art
  Whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart
  Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize
  Nor here disdaind the king of men to rise
  With joy Pelides saw the honour paid
  Rose to the monarch and respectful said

  Thee first in virtue as in power supreme
  O king of nations all thy Greeks proclaim
  In every martial game thy worth attest
  And know thee both their greatest and their best
  Take then the prize but let brave Merion bear
  This beamy javelin in thy brothers war

  Pleased from the heros lips his praise to hear
  The king to Merion gives the brazen spear
  But set apart for sacred use commands
  The glittering charger to Talthybius hands

BOOK XXIV


ARGUMENT

THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR

The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hectors body Jupiter sends
Thetis to Achilles to dispose him for the restoring it and Iris to
Priam to encourage him to go in person and treat for it The old king
notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen makes ready for the
journey to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter He sets forth
in his chariot with a waggon loaded with presents under the charge of
Idaeus the herald Mercury descends in the shape of a young man and
conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles Their conversation on the way
Priam finds Achilles at his table casts himself at his feet and begs for
the body of his son Achilles moved with compassion grants his request
detains him one night in his tent and the next morning sends him home
with the body the Trojans run out to meet him The lamentations of
Andromache Hecuba and Helen with the solemnities of the funeral

The time of twelve days is employed in this book while the body of Hector
lies in the tent of Achilles and as many more are spent in the truce
allowed for his interment The scene is partly in Achilles camp and
partly in Troy

  Now from the finishd games the Grecian band
  Seek their black ships and clear the crowded strand
  All stretchd at ease the genial banquet share
  And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care
  Not so Achilles he to grief resignd
  His friends dear image present to his mind
  Takes his sad couch more unobserved to weep
  Nor tastes the gifts of allcomposing sleep
  Restless he rolld around his weary bed
  And all his soul on his Patroclus fed
  The form so pleasing and the heart so kind
  That youthful vigour and that manly mind
  What toils they shared what martial works they wrought
  What seas they measured and what fields they fought
  All passd before him in remembrance dear
  Thought follows thought and tear succeeds to tear
  And now supine now prone the hero lay
  Now shifts his side impatient for the day
  Then starting up disconsolate he goes
  Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes
  There as the solitary mourner raves
  The ruddy morning rises oer the waves
  Soon as it rose his furious steeds he joind
  The chariot flies and Hector trails behind
  And thrice Patroclus round thy monument
  Was Hector draggd then hurried to the tent
  There sleep at last oercomes the heros eyes
  While foul in dust the unhonourd carcase lies
  But not deserted by the pitying skies
  For Phoebus watchd it with superior care
  Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air
  And ignominious as it swept the field
  Spread oer the sacred corse his golden shield
  All heaven was moved and Hermes willd to go
  By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe
  But Neptune this and Pallas this denies
  And th unrelenting empress of the skies
  Eer since that day implacable to Troy
  What time young Paris simple shepherd boy
  Won by destructive lust reward obscene
  Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen
  But when the tenth celestial morning broke
  To heaven assembled thus Apollo spoke

                  HECTORS BODY AT THE CAR OF ACHILLES


  Unpitying powers how oft each holy fane
  Has Hector tinged with blood of victims slain
  And can ye still his cold remains pursue
  Still grudge his body to the Trojans view
  Deny to consort mother son and sire
  The last sad honours of a funeral fire
  Is then the dire Achilles all your care
  That iron heart inflexibly severe
  A lion not a man who slaughters wide
  In strength of rage and impotence of pride
  Who hastes to murder with a savage joy
  Invades around and breathes but to destroy
  Shame is not of his soul nor understood
  The greatest evil and the greatest good
  Still for one loss he rages unresignd
  Repugnant to the lot of all mankind
  To lose a friend a brother or a son
  Heaven dooms each mortal and its will is done
  Awhile they sorrow then dismiss their care
  Fate gives the wound and man is born to bear
  But this insatiate the commission given
  By fate exceeds and tempts the wrath of heaven
  Lo how his rage dishonest drags along
  Hectors dead earth insensible of wrong
  Brave though he be yet by no reason awed
  He violates the laws of man and god

                          THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS


  If equal honours by the partial skies
  Are doomd both heroes Juno thus replies
  If Thetis son must no distinction know
  Then hear ye gods the patron of the bow
  But Hector only boasts a mortal claim
  His birth deriving from a mortal dame
  Achilles of your own ethereal race
  Springs from a goddess by a mans embrace
  A goddess by ourself to Peleus given
  A man divine and chosen friend of heaven
  To grace those nuptials from the bright abode
  Yourselves were present where this minstrelgod
  Well pleased to share the feast amid the quire
  Stood proud to hymn and tune his youthful lyre

  Then thus the Thunderer checks the imperial dame
  Let not thy wrath the court of heaven inflame
  Their merits nor their honours are the same
  But mine and every gods peculiar grace
  Hector deserves of all the Trojan race
  Still on our shrines his grateful offerings lay
  The only honours men to gods can pay
  Nor ever from our smoking altar ceased
  The pure libation and the holy feast
  Howeer by stealth to snatch the corse away
  We will not Thetis guards it night and day
  But haste and summon to our courts above
  The azure queen let her persuasion move
  Her furious son from Priam to receive
  The profferd ransom and the corse to leave

  He added not and Iris from the skies
  Swift as a whirlwind on the message flies
  Meteorous the face of ocean sweeps
  Refulgent gliding oer the sable deeps
  Between where Samos wide his forests spreads
  And rocky Imbrus lifts its pointed heads
  Down plunged the maid the parted waves resound
  She plunged and instant shot the dark profound
  As bearing death in the fallacious bait
  From the bent angle sinks the leaden weight
  So passd the goddess through the closing wave
  Where Thetis sorrowd in her secret cave
  There placed amidst her melancholy train
  The bluehaird sisters of the sacred main
  Pensive she sat revolving fates to come
  And wept her godlike sons approaching doom
  Then thus the goddess of the painted bow
  Arise O Thetis from thy seats below
  Tis Jove that callsAnd why the dame replies
  Calls Jove his Thetis to the hated skies
  Sad object as I am for heavenly sight
  Ah may my sorrows ever shun the light
  Howeer be heavens almighty sire obeyd
  She spake and veild her head in sable shade
  Which flowing long her graceful person clad
  And forth she paced majestically sad

  Then through the world of waters they repair
  The way fair Iris led to upper air
  The deeps dividing oer the coast they rise
  And touch with momentary flight the skies
  There in the lightnings blaze the sire they found
  And all the gods in shining synod round
  Thetis approachd with anguish in her face
  Minerva rising gave the mourner place
  Even Juno sought her sorrows to console
  And offerd from her hand the nectarbowl
  She tasted and resignd it then began
  The sacred sire of gods and mortal man

  Thou comest fair Thetis but with grief oercast
  Maternal sorrows long ah long to last
  Suffice we know and we partake thy cares
  But yield to fate and hear what Jove declares
  Nine days are past since all the court above
  In Hectors cause have moved the ear of Jove
  Twas voted Hermes from his godlike foe
  By stealth should bear him but we willd not so
  We will thy son himself the corse restore
  And to his conquest add this glory more
  Then hie thee to him and our mandate bear
  Tell him he tempts the wrath of heaven too far
  Nor let him more our anger if he dread
  Vent his mad vengeance on the sacred dead
  But yield to ransom and the fathers prayer
  The mournful father Iris shall prepare
  With gifts to sue and offer to his hands
  Whateer his honour asks or heart demands

  His word the silverfooted queen attends
  And from Olympus snowy tops descends
  Arrived she heard the voice of loud lament
  And echoing groans that shook the lofty tent
  His friends prepare the victim and dispose
  Repast unheeded while he vents his woes
  The goddess seats her by her pensive son
  She pressd his hand and tender thus begun

  How long unhappy shall thy sorrows flow
  And thy heart waste with lifeconsuming woe
  Mindless of food or love whose pleasing reign
  Soothes weary life and softens human pain
  O snatch the moments yet within thy power
  Not long to live indulge the amorous hour
  Lo Jove himself for Joves command I bear
  Forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far
  No longer then his fury if thou dread
  Detain the relics of great Hector dead
  Nor vent on senseless earth thy vengeance vain
  But yield to ransom and restore the slain

  To whom Achilles Be the ransom given
  And we submit since such the will of heaven

  While thus they communed from the Olympian bowers
  Jove orders Iris to the Trojan towers
  Haste winged goddess to the sacred town
  And urge her monarch to redeem his son
  Alone the Ilian ramparts let him leave
  And bear what stern Achilles may receive
  Alone for so we will no Trojan near
  Except to place the dead with decent care
  Some aged herald who with gentle hand
  May the slow mules and funeral car command
  Nor let him death nor let him danger dread
  Safe through the foe by our protection led
  Him Hermes to Achilles shall convey
  Guard of his life and partner of his way
  Fierce as he is Achilles self shall spare
  His age nor touch one venerable hair
  Some thought there must be in a soul so brave
  Some sense of duty some desire to save

     Illustration IRIS ADVISES PRIAM TO OBTAIN THE BODY OF HECTOR

             IRIS ADVISES PRIAM TO OBTAIN THE BODY OF HECTOR


  Then down her bow the winged Iris drives
  And swift at Priams mournful court arrives
  Where the sad sons beside their fathers throne
  Sat bathed in tears and answerd groan with groan
  And all amidst them lay the hoary sire
  Sad scene of woe his face his wrappd attire
  Conceald from sight with frantic hands he spread
  A shower of ashes oer his neck and head
  From room to room his pensive daughters roam
  Whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome
  Mindful of those who late their pride and joy
  Lie pale and breathless round the fields of Troy
  Before the king Joves messenger appears
  And thus in whispers greets his trembling ears

  Fear not O father no ill news I bear
  From Jove I come Jove makes thee still his care
  For Hectors sake these walls he bids thee leave
  And bear what stern Achilles may receive
  Alone for so he wills no Trojan near
  Except to place the dead with decent care
  Some aged herald who with gentle hand
  May the slow mules and funeral car command
  Nor shalt thou death nor shall thou danger dread
  Safe through the foe by his protection led
  Thee Hermes to Pelides shall convey
  Guard of thy life and partner of thy way
  Fierce as he is Achilles self shall spare
  Thy age nor touch one venerable hair
  Some thought there must be in a soul so brave
  Some sense of duty some desire to save

  She spoke and vanishd Priam bids prepare
  His gentle mules and harness to the car
  There for the gifts a polishd casket lay
  His pious sons the kings command obey
  Then passd the monarch to his bridalroom
  Where cedarbeams the lofty roofs perfume
  And where the treasures of his empire lay
  Then calld his queen and thus began to say

  Unhappy consort of a king distressd
  Partake the troubles of thy husbands breast
  I saw descend the messenger of Jove
  Who bids me try Achilles mind to move
  Forsake these ramparts and with gifts obtain
  The corse of Hector at yon navy slain
  Tell me thy thought my heart impels to go
  Through hostile camps and bears me to the foe

  The hoary monarch thus Her piercing cries
  Sad Hecuba renews and then replies
  Ah whither wanders thy distemperd mind
  And where the prudence now that awed mankind
  Through Phrygia once and foreign regions known
  Now all confused distracted overthrown
  Singly to pass through hosts of foes to face
  O heart of steel the murderer of thy race
  To view that deathful eye and wander oer
  Those hands yet red with Hectors noble gore
  Alas my lord he knows not how to spare
  And what his mercy thy slain sons declare
  So brave so many fallen To claim his rage
  Vain were thy dignity and vain thy age
  Nopent in this sad palace let us give
  To grief the wretched days we have to live
  Still still for Hector let our sorrows flow
  Born to his own and to his parents woe
  Doomd from the hour his luckless life begun
  To dogs to vultures and to Peleus son
  Oh in his dearest blood might I allay
  My rage and these barbarities repay
  For ah could Hector merit thus whose breath
  Expired not meanly in unactive death
  He poured his latest blood in manly fight
  And fell a hero in his countrys right

  Seek not to stay me nor my soul affright
  With words of omen like a bird of night
  Replied unmoved the venerable man
  Tis heaven commands me and you urge in vain
  Had any mortal voice the injunction laid
  Nor augur priest nor seer had been obeyd
  A present goddess brought the high command
  I saw I heard her and the word shall stand
  I go ye gods obedient to your call
  If in yon camp your powers have doomd my fall
  ContentBy the same hand let me expire
  Add to the slaughterd son the wretched sire
  One cold embrace at least may be allowd
  And my last tears flow mingled with his blood

  From forth his opend stores this said he drew
  Twelve costly carpets of refulgent hue
  As many vests as many mantles told
  And twelve fair veils and garments stiff with gold
  Two tripods next and twice two chargers shine
  With ten pure talents from the richest mine
  And last a large welllabourd bowl had place
  The pledge of treaties once with friendly Thrace
  Seemd all too mean the stores he could employ
  For one last look to buy him back to Troy

  Lo the sad father frantic with his pain
  Around him furious drives his menial train
  In vain each slave with duteous care attends
  Each office hurts him and each face offends
  What make ye here officious crowds he cries
  Hence nor obtrude your anguish on my eyes
  Have ye no griefs at home to fix ye there
  Am I the only object of despair
  Am I become my peoples common show
  Set up by Jove your spectacle of woe
  No you must feel him too yourselves must fall
  The same stern god to ruin gives you all
  Nor is great Hector lost by me alone
  Your sole defence your guardian power is gone
  I see your blood the fields of Phrygia drown
  I see the ruins of your smoking town
  O send me gods ere that sad day shall come
  A willing ghost to Plutos dreary dome

  He said and feebly drives his friends away
  The sorrowing friends his frantic rage obey
  Next on his sons his erring fury falls
  Polites Paris Agathon he calls
  His threats Deiphobus and Dius hear
  Hippothous Pammon Helenes the seer
  And generous Antiphon for yet these nine
  Survived sad relics of his numerous line

  Inglorious sons of an unhappy sire
  Why did not all in Hectors cause expire
  Wretch that I am my bravest offspring slain
  You the disgrace of Priams house remain
  Mestor the brave renownd in ranks of war
  With Troilus dreadful on his rushing car293
  And last great Hector more than man divine
  For sure he seemd not of terrestrial line
  All those relentless Mars untimely slew
  And left me these a soft and servile crew
  Whose days the feast and wanton dance employ
  Gluttons and flatterers the contempt of Troy
  Why teach ye not my rapid wheels to run
  And speed my journey to redeem my son

  The sons their fathers wretched age revere
  Forgive his anger and produce the car
  High on the seat the cabinet they bind
  The newmade car with solid beauty shined
  Box was the yoke embossd with costly pains
  And hung with ringlets to receive the reins
  Nine cubits long the traces swept the ground
  These to the chariots polishd pole they bound
  Then fixd a ring the running reins to guide
  And close beneath the gatherd ends were tied
  Next with the gifts the price of Hector slain
  The sad attendants load the groaning wain
  Last to the yoke the wellmatched mules they bring
  The gift of Mysia to the Trojan king
  But the fair horses long his darling care
  Himself received and harnessd to his car
  Grieved as he was he not this task denied
  The hoary herald helpd him at his side
  While careful these the gentle coursers joind
  Sad Hecuba approachd with anxious mind
  A golden bowl that foamd with fragrant wine
  Libation destined to the power divine
  Held in her right before the steed she stands
  And thus consigns it to the monarchs hands

  Take this and pour to Jove that safe from harms
  His grace restore thee to our roof and arms
  Since victor of thy fears and slighting mine
  Heaven or thy soul inspires this bold design
  Pray to that god who high on Idas brow
  Surveys thy desolated realms below
  His winged messenger to send from high
  And lead thy way with heavenly augury
  Let the strong sovereign of the plumy race
  Tower on the right of yon ethereal space
  That sign beheld and strengthend from above
  Boldly pursue the journey markd by Jove
  But if the god his augury denies
  Suppress thy impulse nor reject advice

  Tis just said Priam to the sire above
  To raise our hands for who so good as Jove
  He spoke and bade the attendant handmaid bring
  The purest water of the living spring
  Her ready hands the ewer and bason held
  Then took the golden cup his queen had filld
  On the mid pavement pours the rosy wine
  Uplifts his eyes and calls the power divine

  O first and greatest heavens imperial lord
  On lofty Idas holy hill adored
  To stern Achilles now direct my ways
  And teach him mercy when a father prays
  If such thy will despatch from yonder sky
  Thy sacred bird celestial augury
  Let the strong sovereign of the plumy race
  Tower on the right of yon ethereal space
  So shall thy suppliant strengthend from above
  Fearless pursue the journey markd by Jove

  Jove heard his prayer and from the throne on high
  Despatchd his bird celestial augury
  The swiftwingd chaser of the featherd game
  And known to gods by Percnos lofty name
  Wide as appears some palacegate displayd
  So broad his pinions stretchd their ample shade
  As stooping dexter with resounding wings
  The imperial bird descends in airy rings
  A dawn of joy in every face appears
  The mourning matron dries her timorous tears
  Swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung
  The brazen portal in his passage rung
  The mules preceding draw the loaded wain
  Charged with the gifts Idaeus holds the rein
  The king himself his gentle steeds controls
  And through surrounding friends the chariot rolls
  On his slow wheels the following people wait
  Mourn at each step and give him up to fate
  With hands uplifted eye him as he passd
  And gaze upon him as they gazed their last
  Now forward fares the father on his way
  Through the lone fields and back to Ilion they
  Great Jove beheld him as he crossd the plain
  And felt the woes of miserable man
  Then thus to Hermes Thou whose constant cares
  Still succour mortals and attend their prayers
  Behold an object to thy charge consignd
  If ever pity touchd thee for mankind
  Go guard the sire the observing foe prevent
  And safe conduct him to Achilles tent

  The god obeys his golden pinions binds294
  And mounts incumbent on the wings of winds
  That high through fields of air his flight sustain
  Oer the wide earth and oer the boundless main
  Then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly
  Or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye
  Thus armd swift Hermes steers his airy way
  And stoops on Hellesponts resounding sea
  A beauteous youth majestic and divine
  He seemd fair offspring of some princely line
  Now twilight veild the glaring face of day
  And clad the dusky fields in sober grey
  What time the herald and the hoary king
  Their chariots stopping at the silver spring
  That circling Ilus ancient marble flows
  Allowd their mules and steeds a short repose
  Through the dim shade the herald first espies
  A mans approach and thus to Priam cries
  I mark some foes advance O king beware
  This hard adventure claims thy utmost care
  For much I fear destruction hovers nigh
  Our state asks counsel is it best to fly
  Or old and helpless at his feet to fall
  Two wretched suppliants and for mercy call

  The afflicted monarch shiverd with despair
  Pale grew his face and upright stood his hair
  Sunk was his heart his colour went and came
  A sudden trembling shook his aged frame
  When Hermes greeting touchd his royal hand
  And gentle thus accosts with kind demand

  Say whither father when each mortal sight
  Is seald in sleep thou wanderest through the night
  Why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along
  Through Grecian foes so numerous and so strong
  What couldst thou hope should these thy treasures view
  These who with endless hate thy race pursue
  For what defence alas couldst thou provide
  Thyself not young a weak old man thy guide
  Yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread
  From me no harm shall touch thy reverend head
  From Greece Ill guard thee too for in those lines
  The living image of my father shines

  Thy words that speak benevolence of mind
  Are true my son the godlike sire rejoind
  Great are my hazards but the gods survey
  My steps and send thee guardian of my way
  Hail and be blessd For scarce of mortal kind
  Appear thy form thy feature and thy mind

  Nor true are all thy words nor erring wide
  The sacred messenger of heaven replied
  But say conveyst thou through the lonely plains
  What yet most precious of thy store remains
  To lodge in safety with some friendly hand
  Prepared perchance to leave thy native land
  Or fliest thou nowWhat hopes can Troy retain
  Thy matchless son her guard and glory slain

  The king alarmd Say what and whence thou art
  Who search the sorrows of a parents heart
  And know so well how godlike Hector died
  Thus Priam spoke and Hermes thus replied

  You tempt me father and with pity touch
  On this sad subject you inquire too much
  Oft have these eyes that godlike Hector viewd
  In glorious fight with Grecian blood embrued
  I saw him when like Jove his flames he tossd
  On thousand ships and witherd half a host
  I saw but helpd not stern Achilles ire
  Forbade assistance and enjoyd the fire
  For him I serve of Myrmidonian race
  One ship conveyd us from our native place
  Polyctor is my sire an honourd name
  Old like thyself and not unknown to fame
  Of seven his sons by whom the lot was cast
  To serve our prince it fell on me the last
  To watch this quarter my adventure falls
  For with the morn the Greeks attack your walls
  Sleepless they sit impatient to engage
  And scarce their rulers check their martial rage

  If then thou art of stern Pelides train
  The mournful monarch thus rejoind again
  Ah tell me truly where oh where are laid
  My sons dear relics what befals him dead
  Have dogs dismemberd on the naked plains
  Or yet unmangled rest his cold remains

  O favourd of the skies thus answered then
  The power that mediates between god and men
  Nor dogs nor vultures have thy Hector rent
  But whole he lies neglected in the tent
  This the twelfth evening since he rested there
  Untouchd by worms untainted by the air
  Still as Auroras ruddy beam is spread
  Round his friends tomb Achilles drags the dead
  Yet undisfigured or in limb or face
  All fresh he lies with every living grace
  Majestical in death No stains are found
  Oer all the corse and closed is every wound
  Though many a wound they gave Some heavenly care
  Some hand divine preserves him ever fair
  Or all the host of heaven to whom he led
  A life so grateful still regard him dead

  Thus spoke to Priam the celestial guide
  And joyful thus the royal sire replied
  Blest is the man who pays the gods above
  The constant tribute of respect and love
  Those who inhabit the Olympian bower
  My son forgot not in exalted power
  And heaven that every virtue bears in mind
  Even to the ashes of the just is kind
  But thou O generous youth this goblet take
  A pledge of gratitude for Hectors sake
  And while the favouring gods our steps survey
  Safe to Pelides tent conduct my way

  To whom the latent god O king forbear
  To tempt my youth for apt is youth to err
  But can I absent from my princes sight
  Take gifts in secret that must shun the light
  What from our masters interest thus we draw
  Is but a licensed theft that scapes the law
  Respecting him my soul abjures the offence
  And as the crime I dread the consequence
  Thee far as Argos pleased I could convey
  Guard of thy life and partner of thy way
  On thee attend thy safety to maintain
  Oer pathless forests or the roaring main

  He said then took the chariot at a bound
  And snatchd the reins and whirld the lash around
  Before the inspiring god that urged them on
  The coursers fly with spirit not their own
  And now they reachd the naval walls and found
  The guards repasting while the bowls go round
  On these the virtue of his wand he tries
  And pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes
  Then heaved the massy gates removed the bars
  And oer the trenches led the rolling cars
  Unseen through all the hostile camp they went
  And now approachd Pelides lofty tent
  On firs the roof was raised and coverd oer
  With reeds collected from the marshy shore
  And fenced with palisades a hall of state
  The work of soldiers where the hero sat
  Large was the door whose wellcompacted strength
  A solid pinetree barrd of wondrous length
  Scarce three strong Greeks could lift its mighty weight
  But great Achilles singly closed the gate
  This Hermes such the power of gods set wide
  Then swift alighted the celestial guide
  And thus revealdHear prince and understand
  Thou owst thy guidance to no mortal hand
  Hermes I am descended from above
  The king of arts the messenger of Jove
  Farewell to shun Achilles sight I fly
  Uncommon are such favours of the sky
  Nor stand confessd to frail mortality
  Now fearless enter and prefer thy prayers
  Adjure him by his fathers silver hairs
  His son his mother urge him to bestow
  Whatever pity that stern heart can know

  Thus having said he vanishd from his eyes
  And in a moment shot into the skies
  The king confirmd from heaven alighted there
  And left his aged herald on the car
  With solemn pace through various rooms he went
  And found Achilles in his inner tent
  There sat the hero Alcimus the brave
  And great Automedon attendance gave
  These served his person at the royal feast
  Around at awful distance stood the rest

  Unseen by these the king his entry made
  And prostrate now before Achilles laid
  Sudden a venerable sight appears
  Embraced his knees and bathed his hands in tears
  Those direful hands his kisses pressd embrued
  Even with the best the dearest of his blood

  As when a wretch who conscious of his crime
  Pursued for murder flies his native clime
  Just gains some frontier breathless pale amazed
  All gaze all wonder thus Achilles gazed
  Thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise
  All mute yet seemd to question with their eyes
  Each lookd on other none the silence broke
  Till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke

  Ah think thou favourd of the powers divine295
  Think of thy fathers age and pity mine
  In me that fathers reverend image trace
  Those silver hairs that venerable face
  His trembling limbs his helpless person see
  In all my equal but in misery
  Yet now perhaps some turn of human fate
  Expels him helpless from his peaceful state
  Think from some powerful foe thou seest him fly
  And beg protection with a feeble cry
  Yet still one comfort in his soul may rise
  He hears his son still lives to glad his eyes
  And hearing still may hope a better day
  May send him thee to chase that foe away
  No comfort to my griefs no hopes remain
  The best the bravest of my sons are slain
  Yet what a race ere Greece to Ilion came
  The pledge of many a loved and loving dame
  Nineteen one mother boreDead all are dead
  How oft alas has wretched Priam bled
  Still one was left their loss to recompense
  His fathers hope his countrys last defence
  Him too thy rage has slain beneath thy steel
  Unhappy in his countrys cause he fell

  For him through hostile camps I bent my way
  For him thus prostrate at thy feet I lay
  Large gifts proportiond to thy wrath I bear
  O hear the wretched and the gods revere

  Think of thy father and this face behold
  See him in me as helpless and as old
  Though not so wretched there he yields to me
  The first of men in sovereign misery
  Thus forced to kneel thus grovelling to embrace
  The scourge and ruin of my realm and race
  Suppliant my childrens murderer to implore
  And kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore

  These words soft pity in the chief inspire
  Touchd with the dear remembrance of his sire
  Then with his hand as prostrate still he lay
  The old mans cheek he gently turnd away
  Now each by turns indulged the gush of woe
  And now the mingled tides together flow
  This low on earth that gently bending oer
  A father one and one a son deplore
  But great Achilles different passions rend
  And now his sire he mourns and now his friend
  The infectious softness through the heroes ran
  One universal solemn shower began
  They bore as heroes but they felt as man

  Satiate at length with unavailing woes
  From the high throne divine Achilles rose
  The reverend monarch by the hand he raised
  On his white beard and form majestic gazed
  Not unrelenting then serene began
  With words to soothe the miserable man

  Alas what weight of anguish hast thou known
  Unhappy prince thus guardless and alone
  Two pass through foes and thus undaunted face
  The man whose fury has destroyd thy race
  Heaven sure has armd thee with a heart of steel
  A strength proportiond to the woes you feel
  Rise then let reason mitigate your care
  To mourn avails not man is born to bear
  Such is alas the gods severe decree
  They only they are blest and only free
  Two urns by Joves high throne have ever stood
  The source of evil one and one of good
  From thence the cup of mortal man he fills
  Blessings to these to those distributes ill
  To most he mingles both the wretch decreed
  To taste the bad unmixd is cursed indeed
  Pursued by wrongs by meagre famine driven
  He wanders outcast both of earth and heaven
  The happiest taste not happiness sincere
  But find the cordial draught is dashd with care
  Who more than Peleus shone in wealth and power
  What stars concurring blessd his natal hour
  A realm a goddess to his wishes given
  Graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven
  One evil yet oertakes his latest day
  No race succeeding to imperial sway
  An only son and he alas ordaind
  To fall untimely in a foreign land
  See him in Troy the pious care decline
  Of his weak age to live the curse of thine
  Thou too old man hast happier days beheld
  In riches once in children once excelld
  Extended Phrygia ownd thy ample reign
  And all fair Lesbos blissful seats contain
  And all wide Hellesponts unmeasured main
  But since the god his hand has pleased to turn
  And fill thy measure from his bitter urn
  What sees the sun but hapless heroes falls
  War and the blood of men surround thy walls
  What must be must be Bear thy lot nor shed
  These unavailing sorrows oer the dead
  Thou canst not call him from the Stygian shore
  But thou alas mayst live to suffer more

  To whom the king O favourd of the skies
  Here let me grow to earth since Hector lies
  On the bare beach deprived of obsequies
  O give me Hector to my eyes restore
  His corse and take the gifts I ask no more
  Thou as thou mayst these boundless stores enjoy
  Safe mayst thou sail and turn thy wrath from Troy
  So shall thy pity and forbearance give
  A weak old man to see the light and live

  Move me no more Achilles thus replies
  While kindling anger sparkled in his eyes
  Nor seek by tears my steady soul to bend
  To yield thy Hector I myself intend
  For know from Jove my goddessmother came
  Old Oceans daughter silverfooted dame
  Nor comest thou but by heaven nor comest alone
  Some god impels with courage not thy own
  No human hand the weighty gates unbarrd
  Nor could the boldest of our youth have dared
  To pass our outworks or elude the guard
  Cease lest neglectful of high Joves command
  I show thee king thou treadst on hostile land
  Release my knees thy suppliant arts give oer
  And shake the purpose of my soul no more

  The sire obeyd him trembling and oerawd
  Achilles like a lion rushd abroad
  Automedon and Alcimus attend
  Whom most he honourd since he lost his friend
  These to unyoke the mules and horses went
  And led the hoary herald to the tent
  Next heapd on high the numerous presents bear
  Great Hectors ransom from the polishd car
  Two splendid mantles and a carpet spread
  They leave to cover and enwrap the dead
  Then call the handmaids with assistant toil
  To wash the body and anoint with oil
  Apart from Priam lest the unhappy sire
  Provoked to passion once more rouse to ire
  The stern Pelides and nor sacred age
  Nor Joves command should check the rising rage
  This done the garments oer the corse they spread
  Achilles lifts it to the funeral bed
  Then while the body on the car they laid
  He groans and calls on loved Patroclus shade

  If in that gloom which never light must know
  The deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below
  O friend forgive me that I thus fulfil
  Restoring Hector heavens unquestiond will
  The gifts the father gave be ever thine
  To grace thy manes and adorn thy shrine296

  He said and entering took his seat of state
  Where full before him reverend Priam sate
  To whom composed the godlike chief begun
  Lo to thy prayer restored thy breathless son
  Extended on the funeral couch he lies
  And soon as morning paints the eastern skies
  The sight is granted to thy longing eyes
  But now the peaceful hours of sacred night
  Demand reflection and to rest invite
  Nor thou O father thus consumed with woe
  The common cares that nourish life forego
  Not thus did Niobe of form divine
  A parent once whose sorrows equalld thine
  Six youthful sons as many blooming maids
  In one sad day beheld the Stygian shades
  Those by Apollos silver bow were slain
  These Cynthias arrows stretchd upon the plain
  So was her pride chastised by wrath divine
  Who matchd her own with bright Latonas line
  But two the goddess twelve the queen enjoyd
  Those boasted twelve the avenging two destroyd
  Steepd in their blood and in the dust outspread
  Nine days neglected lay exposed the dead
  None by to weep them to inhume them none
  For Jove had turnd the nation all to stone
  The gods themselves at length relenting gave
  The unhappy race the honours of a grave
  Herself a rock for such was heavens high will
  Through deserts wild now pours a weeping rill
  Where round the bed whence Achelous springs
  The watery fairies dance in mazy rings
  There high on Sipyluss shaggy brow
  She stands her own sad monument of woe
  The rock for ever lasts the tears for ever flow

  Such griefs O king have other parents known
  Remember theirs and mitigate thy own
  The care of heaven thy Hector has appeard
  Nor shall he lie unwept and uninterrd
  Soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drownd
  And all the eyes of Ilion stream around

  He said and rising chose the victim ewe
  With silver fleece which his attendants slew
  The limbs they sever from the reeking hide
  With skill prepare them and in parts divide
  Each on the coals the separate morsels lays
  And hasty snatches from the rising blaze
  With bread the glittering canisters they load
  Which round the board Automedon bestowd
  The chief himself to each his portion placed
  And each indulging shared in sweet repast
  When now the rage of hunger was repressd
  The wondering hero eyes his royal guest
  No less the royal guest the hero eyes
  His godlike aspect and majestic size
  Here youthful grace and noble fire engage
  And there the mild benevolence of age
  Thus gazing long the silence neither broke
  A solemn scene at length the father spoke

  Permit me now beloved of Jove to steep
  My careful temples in the dew of sleep
  For since the day that numberd with the dead
  My hapless son the dust has been my bed
  Soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes
  My only food my sorrows and my sighs
  Till now encouraged by the grace you give
  I share thy banquet and consent to live

  With that Achilles bade prepare the bed
  With purple soft and shaggy carpets spread
  Forth by the flaming lights they bend their way
  And place the couches and the coverings lay
  Then he Now father sleep but sleep not here
  Consult thy safety and forgive my fear
  Lest any Argive at this hour awake
  To ask our counsel or our orders take
  Approaching sudden to our opend tent
  Perchance behold thee and our grace prevent
  Should such report thy honourd person here
  The king of men the ransom might defer
  But say with speed if aught of thy desire
  Remains unaskd what time the rites require
  To inter thy Hector For so long we stay
  Our slaughtering arm and bid the hosts obey

  If then thy will permit the monarch said
  To finish all due honours to the dead
  This of thy grace accord to thee are known
  The fears of Ilion closed within her town
  And at what distance from our walls aspire
  The hills of Ide and forests for the fire
  Nine days to vent our sorrows I request
  The tenth shall see the funeral and the feast
  The next to raise his monument be given
  The twelfth we war if war be doomd by heaven

  This thy request replied the chief enjoy
  Till then our arms suspend the fall of Troy

  Then gave his hand at parting to prevent
  The old mans fears and turnd within the tent
  Where fair Briseis bright in blooming charms
  Expects her hero with desiring arms
  But in the porch the king and herald rest
  Sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast
  Now gods and men the gifts of sleep partake
  Industrious Hermes only was awake
  The kings return revolving in his mind
  To pass the ramparts and the watch to blind
  The power descending hoverd oer his head
  And sleepst thou father thus the vision said
  Now dost thou sleep when Hector is restored
  Nor fear the Grecian foes or Grecian lord
  Thy presence here should stern Atrides see
  Thy still surviving sons may sue for thee
  May offer all thy treasures yet contain
  To spare thy age and offer all in vain

  Waked with the word the trembling sire arose
  And raised his friend the god before him goes
  He joins the mules directs them with his hand
  And moves in silence through the hostile land
  When now to Xanthus yellow stream they drove
  Xanthus immortal progeny of Jove
  The winged deity forsook their view
  And in a moment to Olympus flew
  Now shed Aurora round her saffron ray
  Sprang through the gates of light and gave the day
  Charged with the mournful load to Ilion go
  The sage and king majestically slow
  Cassandra first beholds from Ilions spire
  The sad procession of her hoary sire
  Then as the pensive pomp advanced more near
  Her breathless brother stretched upon the bier
  A shower of tears oerflows her beauteous eyes
  Alarming thus all Ilion with her cries

  Turn here your steps and here your eyes employ
  Ye wretched daughters and ye sons of Troy
  If eer ye rushd in crowds with vast delight
  To hail your hero glorious from the fight
  Now meet him dead and let your sorrows flow
  Your common triumph and your common woe

  In thronging crowds they issue to the plains
  Nor man nor woman in the walls remains
  In every face the selfsame grief is shown
  And Troy sends forth one universal groan
  At Scaeas gates they meet the mourning wain
  Hang on the wheels and grovel round the slain
  The wife and mother frantic with despair
  Kiss his pale cheek and rend their scatterd hair
  Thus wildly wailing at the gates they lay
  And there had sighd and sorrowd out the day
  But godlike Priam from the chariot rose
  Forbear he cried this violence of woes
  First to the palace let the car proceed
  Then pour your boundless sorrows oer the dead

  The waves of people at his word divide
  Slow rolls the chariot through the following tide
  Even to the palace the sad pomp they wait
  They weep and place him on the bed of state
  A melancholy choir attend around
  With plaintive sighs and musics solemn sound
  Alternately they sing alternate flow
  The obedient tears melodious in their woe
  While deeper sorrows groan from each full heart
  And nature speaks at every pause of art

  First to the corse the weeping consort flew
  Around his neck her milkwhite arms she threw
  And oh my Hector Oh my lord she cries
  Snatchd in thy bloom from these desiring eyes
  Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone
  And I abandond desolate alone
  An only son once comfort of our pains
  Sad product now of hapless love remains
  Never to manly age that son shall rise
  Or with increasing graces glad my eyes
  For Ilion now her great defender slain
  Shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain
  Who now protects her wives with guardian care
  Who saves her infants from the rage of war
  Now hostile fleets must waft those infants oer
  Those wives must wait them to a foreign shore
  Thou too my son to barbarous climes shall go
  The sad companion of thy mothers woe
  Driven hence a slave before the victors sword
  Condemnd to toil for some inhuman lord
  Or else some Greek whose father pressd the plain
  Or son or brother by great Hector slain
  In Hectors blood his vengeance shall enjoy
  And hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy297
  For thy stern father never spared a foe
  Thence all these tears and all this scene of woe
  Thence many evils his sad parents bore
  His parents many but his consort more
  Why gavst thou not to me thy dying hand
  And why received not I thy last command
  Some word thou wouldst have spoke which sadly dear
  My soul might keep or utter with a tear
  Which never never could be lost in air
  Fixd in my heart and oft repeated there

  Thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan
  Her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan

  The mournful mother next sustains her part
  O thou the best the dearest to my heart
  Of all my race thou most by heaven approved
  And by the immortals even in death beloved
  While all my other sons in barbarous bands
  Achilles bound and sold to foreign lands
  This felt no chains but went a glorious ghost
  Free and a hero to the Stygian coast
  Sentenced tis true by his inhuman doom
  Thy noble corse was draggd around the tomb
  The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain
  Ungenerous insult impotent and vain
  Yet glowst thou fresh with every living grace
  No mark of pain or violence of face
  Rosy and fair as Phoebus silver bow
  Dismissd thee gently to the shades below

  Thus spoke the dame and melted into tears
  Sad Helen next in pomp of grief appears
  Fast from the shining sluices of her eyes
  Fall the round crystal drops while thus she cries

  Ah dearest friend in whom the gods had joind298
  Tne mildest manners with the bravest mind
  Now twice ten years unhappy years are oer
  Since Paris brought me to the Trojan shore
  O had I perishd ere that form divine
  Seduced this soft this easy heart of mine
  Yet was it neer my fate from thee to find
  A deed ungentle or a word unkind
  When others cursed the authoress of their woe
  Thy pity checkd my sorrows in their flow
  If some proud brother eyed me with disdain
  Or scornful sister with her sweeping train
  Thy gentle accents softend all my pain
  For thee I mourn and mourn myself in thee
  The wretched source of all this misery
  The fate I caused for ever I bemoan
  Sad Helen has no friend now thou art gone
  Through Troys wide streets abandond shall I roam
  In Troy deserted as abhorrd at home

  So spoke the fair with sorrowstreaming eye
  Distressful beauty melts each standerby
  On all around the infectious sorrow grows
  But Priam checkd the torrent as it rose
  Perform ye Trojans what the rites require
  And fell the forests for a funeral pyre
  Twelve days nor foes nor secret ambush dread
  Achilles grants these honours to the dead299

                    Illustration FUNERAL OF HECTOR

                            FUNERAL OF HECTOR


  He spoke and at his word the Trojan train
  Their mules and oxen harness to the wain
  Pour through the gates and felld from Idas crown
  Roll back the gatherd forests to the town
  These toils continue nine succeeding days
  And high in air a sylvan structure raise
  But when the tenth fair morn began to shine
  Forth to the pile was borne the man divine
  And placed aloft while all with streaming eyes
  Beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise
  Soon as Aurora daughter of the dawn
  With rosy lustre streakd the dewy lawn
  Again the mournful crowds surround the pyre
  And quench with wine the yet remaining fire
  The snowy bones his friends and brothers place
  With tears collected in a golden vase
  The golden vase in purple palls they rolld
  Of softest texture and inwrought with gold
  Last oer the urn the sacred earth they spread
  And raised the tomb memorial of the dead
  Strong guards and spies till all the rites were done
  Watchd from the rising to the setting sun
  All Troy then moves to Priams court again
  A solemn silent melancholy train
  Assembled there from pious toil they rest
  And sadly shared the last sepulchral feast
  Such honours Ilion to her hero paid
  And peaceful slept the mighty Hectors shade300





CONCLUDING NOTE


We have now passed through the Iliad and seen the anger of Achilles and
the terrible effects of it at an end as that only was the subject of the
poem and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed
to the event of the war it perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader
to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the chief actors in
this poem after the conclusion of it

I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector by
the stratagem of the wooden horse the particulars of which are described
by Virgil in the second book of the Ćneid

Achilles fell before Troy by the hand of Paris by the shot of an arrow
in his heel as Hector had prophesied at his death lib xxii

The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus the son of Achilles

Ajax after the death of Achilles had a contest with Ulysses for the
armour of Vulcan but being defeated in his aim he slew himself through
indignation

Helen after the death of Paris married Deiphobus his brother and at the
taking of Troy betrayed him in order to reconcile herself to Menelaus her
first husband who received her again into favour

Agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by Ćgysthus at the
instigation of Clytemnestra his wife who in his absence had dishonoured
his bed with Ćgysthus

Diomed after the fall of Troy was expelled his own country and scarce
escaped with his life from his adulterous wife Ćgiale but at last was
received by Daunus in Apulia and shared his kingdom it is uncertain how
he died

Nestor lived in peace with his children in Pylos his native country

Ulysses also after innumerable troubles by sea and land at last returned
in safety to Ithaca which is the subject of Homers Odyssey

For what remains I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking leave
at the end of my work and from embarrassing myself or others with any
defences or apologies about it But instead of endeavouring to raise a
vain monument to myself of the merits or difficulties of it which must
be left to the world to truth and to posterity let me leave behind me
a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable of men as well
as finest writers of my age and country one who has tried and knows by
his own experience how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to Homer
and one whom I am sure sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my
labours To him therefore having brought this long work to a conclusion
I desire to dedicate it and to have the honour and satisfaction of
placing together in this manner the names of Mr CONGREVE and of

FOOTNOTES


    1 What says Archdeacon Wilberforce is the natural root of loyalty
      as distinguished from such mere selfish desire of personal security
      as is apt to take its place in civilized times but that
      consciousness of a natural bond among the families of men which
      gives a fellowfeeling to whole clans and nations and thus enlists
      their affections in behalf of those timehonoured representatives of
      their ancient blood in whose success they feel a personal interest
      Hence the delight when we recognize an act of nobility or justice in
      our hereditary princes

        Tuque prior tu parce genus qui ducis Olympo
        Projice tela manu sanguis meus

      So strong is this feeling that it regains an engrafted influence
      even when history witnesses that vast convulsions have rent and
      weakened it and the Celtic feeling towards the Stuarts has been
      rekindled in our own days towards the grand daughter of George the
      Third of Hanover

      Somewhat similar may be seen in the disposition to idolize those
      great lawgivers of mans race who have given expression in the
      immortal language of song to the deeper inspirations of our nature
      The thoughts of Homer or of Shakespere are the universal inheritance
      of the human race In this mutual ground every man meets his
      brother they have been bet forth by the providence of God to
      vindicate for all of us what nature could effect and that in these
      representatives of our race we might recognize our common
      benefactorsDoctrine of the Incarnation pp 9 10

      of use to the reader for the biographical value of the treatise is

      The voice observes Heeren was always accompanied by some
      instrument The bard was provided with a harp on which he played a
      prelude to elevate and inspire his mind and with which he
      accompanied the song when begun His voice probably preserved a
      medium between singing and recitation the words and not the melody
      were regarded by the listeners hence it was necessary for him to
      remain intelligible to all In countries where nothing similar is
      found it is difficult to represent such scenes to the mind but

      Italy can easily form an idea of Demodocus and PhemiusAncient

    4 Should it not be since my arrival asks Mackenzie observing
      that poplars can hardly live so long  But setting aside the fact
      that we must not expect consistency in a mere romance the ancients
      had a superstitious belief in the great age of trees which grew near
      places consecrated by the presence of gods and great men See Cicero
      de Legg II I sub init where he speaks of the plane tree under
      which Socrates used to walk and of the tree at Delos where Latona
      gave birth to Apollo This passage is referred to by Stephanus of
      Byzantium s v N T p 490 ed de Pinedo I omit quoting any
      of the dull epigrams ascribed to Homer for as Mr Justice Talfourd
      rightly observes The authenticity of these fragments depends upon
      that of the pseudo Herodotean Life of Homer from which they are
      taken Lit of Greece pp 38 in Encycl Metrop Cf Coleridge

    9 This is so pretty a picture of early manners and hospitality that
      it is almost a pity to find that it is obviously a copy from the
      Odyssey See the fourteenth book In fact whoever was the author of
      this fictitious biography he showed some tact in identifying Homer
      with certain events described in his poems and in eliciting from
      them the germs of something like a personal narrative

      has given three brief but elaborate papers on the different writers
      on the subject which deserve to be consulted See Notes and
      Queries vol v pp 99 171 and 221 His own views are moderate
      and perhaps as satisfactory on the whole as any of the hypotheses
      hitherto put forth In fact they consist in an attempt to blend
      those hypotheses into something like consistency rather than in
      advocating any individual theory

   25 It is indeed not easy to calculate the height to which the memory
      may be cultivated To take an ordinary case we might refer to that
      of any first rate actor who must be prepared at a very short
      warning to rhapsodize night after night parts which when laid
      together would amount to an immense number of lines But all this
      is nothing to two instances of our own day Visiting at Naples a
      gentleman of the highest intellectual attainments and who held a
      distinguished rank among the men of letters in the last century he
      informed us that the day before he had passed much time in examining
      a man not highly educated who had learned to repeat the whole
      Gierusalemme of Tasso not only to recite it consecutively but also
      to repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense either
      forwards or backwards or from the eighth line to the first
      alternately the odd and even linesin short whatever the passage
      required the memory which seemed to cling to the words much more
      than to the sense had it at such perfect command that it could
      produce it under any form Our informant went on to state that this
      singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando Furioso in the
      same manner But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to
      which we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty
      years ago to visit the town of Stirling in Scotland No such person
      can have forgotten the poor uneducated man Blind Jamie who could
      actually repeat after a few minutes consideration any verse
      required from any part of the Bibleeven the obscurest and most
      unimportant enumeration of mere proper names not excepted We do not
      mention these facts as touching the more difficult part of the
      question before us but facts they are and if we find so much
      difficulty in calculating the extent to which the mere memory may be
      cultivated are we in these days of multifarious reading and of
      countless distracting affairs fair judges of the perfection to
      which the invention and the memory combined may attain in a simpler
      age and among a more single minded peopleQuarterly Review l

      Heeren steers between the two opinions observing that The
      Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer
      in length as much as it stands beneath them in merit and yet it
      exists only in the memory of a people which is not unacquainted with
      writing But the songs of a nation are probably the last things
      which are committed to writing for the very reason that they are
      remembered Ancient Greece p 100

   40 The following argument of the Iliad corrected in a few particulars
      is translated from Bitaube and is perhaps the neatest summary
      that has ever been drawn upA hero injured by his general and
      animated with a noble resentment retires to his tent and for a
      season withdraws himself and his troops from the war During this
      interval victory abandons the army which for nine years has been
      occupied in a great enterprise upon the successful termination of
      which the honour of their country depends The general at length
      opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed deputes the
      principal officers of his army to the incensed hero with commission
      to make compensation for the injury and to tender magnificent
      presents The hero according to the proud obstinacy of his
      character persists in his animosity the army is again defeated
      and is on the verge of entire destruction This inexorable man has a
      friend this friend weeps before him and asks for the heros arms
      and for permission to go to the war in his stead The eloquence of
      friendship prevails more than the intercession of the ambassadors or
      the gifts of the general He lends his armour to his friend but
      commands him not to engage with the chief of the enemys army
      because he reserves to himself the honour of that combat and
      because he also fears for his friends life The prohibition is
      forgotten the friend listens to nothing but his courage his corpse
      is brought back to the hero and the heros arms become the prize of
      the conqueror Then the hero given up to the most lively despair
      prepares to fight he receives from a divinity new armour is
      reconciled with his general and thirsting for glory and revenge
      enacts prodigies of valour recovers the victory slays the enemys
      chief honours his friend with superb funeral rites and exercises a
      cruel vengeance on the body of his destroyer but finally appeased
      by the tears and prayers of the father of the slain warrior
      restores to the old man the corpse of his son which he buries with
      due solemnitiesColeridge p 177 sqq

      when the Teucri were migrating from Crete they were told by an

      the original inhabitants of the land and that having halted for
      the night a number of fieldmice came and gnawed away the leathern
      straps of their baggage and thongs of their armour In fulfilment
      of the oracle they settled on the spot and raised a temple to
      Sminthean Apollo Grote History of Greece i p 68 remarks that

   50 Bent was his bow The Apollo of Homer it must be borne in mind
      is a different character from the deity of the same name in the
      later classical pantheon Throughout both poems all deaths from
      unforeseen or invisible causes the ravages of pestilence the fate
      of the young child or promising adult cut off in the germ of
      infancy or flower of youth of the old man dropping peacefully into
      the grave or of the reckless sinner suddenly checked in his career
      of crime are ascribed to the arrows of Apollo or Diana The
      oracular functions of the god rose naturally out of the above
      fundamental attributes for who could more appropriately impart to
      mortals what little foreknowledge Fate permitted of her decrees than
      the agent of her most awful dispensations The close union of the
      arts of prophecy and song explains his additional office of god of
      music while the arrows with which he and his sister were armed
      symbols of sudden death in every age no less naturally procured him
      that of god of archery Of any connection between Apollo and the
      Sun whatever may have existed in the more esoteric doctrine of the
      Greek sanctuaries there is no trace in either Iliad or
      OdysseyMure History of Greek Literature vol i p 478 sq

      ant because they imitated the diligence of the ants and like
      them were indefatigable continually employed in cultivating the
      earth the change from ants to men is founded merely on the
      equivocation of their name which resembles that of the ant they
      bore a further resemblance to these little animals in that instead
      of inhabiting towns or villages at first they commonly resided in
      the open fields having no other retreats but dens and the cavities

   57 Eustathius after Heraclides Ponticus and others allegorizes this

      restrain his anger and only gratify it by withdrawing his services

   66 It has been observed that the annual procession of the sacred ship
      so often represented on Egyptian monuments and the return of the

      think says Heeren after quoting a passage from Diodorus about the
      holy ship that this procession is represented in one of the great
      sculptured reliefs on the temple of Karnak The sacred ship of Ammon
      is on the shore with its whole equipment and is towed along by
      another boat It is therefore on its voyage This must have been one
      of the most celebrated festivals since even according to the
      interpretation of antiquity Homer alludes to it when he speaks of
      Jupiters visit to the Ethiopians and his twelve days

      thisAfter Hercules had taken and pillaged Troy Juno raised a

      fastened iron anvils to her feet and hung her from the sky and
      Vulcan attempting to relieve her was kicked down from Olympus in
      the manner described The allegorists have gone mad in finding deep
      explanations for this amusing fiction See Heraclides Ponticus
      p 463 sq ed Gale The story is told by Homer himself in Book xv

   75 It is ingeniously observed by Grote vol i p 463 that The gods
      formed a sort of political community of their own which had its
      hierarchy its distribution of ranks and duties its contentions for

      of Olympus and its multitudinous banquets or festivals

   86 This sentiment used to be a popular one with some of the greatest
      tyrants who abused it into a pretext for unlimited usurpation of
      power Dion Caligula and Domitian were particularly fond of it
      and in an extended form we find the maxim propounded by Creon in
      the Antigone of Sophocles See some important remarks of Heeren
      Ancient Greece ch vi p 105

   87 It may be remarked that the character of Thersites revolting and
      contemptible as it is serves admirably to develop the disposition
      of Ulysses in a new light in which mere cunning is less prominent
      Of the gradual and individual development of Homers heroes
      Schlegel well observes In basrelief the figures are usually in
      profile and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest
      manner in relief they are not grouped together but follow one
      another so Homers heroes advance one by one in succession before
      us It has been remarked that the Iliad is not definitively
      closed but that we are left to suppose something both to precede
      and to follow it The basrelief is equally without limit and may
      be continued ad infinitum either from before or behind on which
      account the ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of
      an indefinite extension sacrificial processions dances and lines
      of combatants and hence they also exhibit basreliefs on curved
      surfaces such as vases or the frieze of a rotunda where by the
      curvature the two ends are withdrawn from our sight and where
      while we advance one object appears as another disappears Reading
      Homer is very much like such a circuit the present object alone
      arresting our attention we lose sight of what precedes and do not
      concern ourselves about what is to followDramatic Literature

   88 There cannot be a clearer indication than this description so
      graphic in the original poemof the true character of the Homeric
      agora The multitude who compose it are listening and acquiescent
      not often hesitating and never refractory to the chief The fate
      which awaits a presumptuous critic even where his virulent
      reproaches are substantially wellfounded is plainly set forth in
      the treatment of Thersites while the unpopularity of such a
      character is attested even more by the excessive pains which Homer
      takes to heap upon him repulsive personal deformities than by the
      chastisement of Odysseus he is lame bald crookbacked of
      misshapen head and squinting visionGrote vol i p 97

   89 According to Pausanias both the sprig and the remains of the tree
      were exhibited in his time The tragedians Lucretius and others

      the subject of a tragedy Compare Drydens Ćneid vol iii sqq

   92 The following observation will be useful to Homeric readers
      Particular animals were at a later time consecrated to particular
      deities To Jupiter Ceres Juno Apollo and Bacchus victims of
      advanced age might be offered An ox of five years old was
      considered especially acceptable to Jupiter A black bull a ram or
      a boar pig were offerings for Neptune A heifer or a sheep for
      Minerva To Ceres a sow was sacrificed as an enemy to corn The
      goat to Bacchus because he fed on vines Diana was propitiated with
      a stag and to Venus the dove was consecrated The infernal and evil
      deities were to be appeased with black victims The most acceptable
      of all sacrifices was the heifer of a year old which had never

      have arisen from the springs of Bounabarshy and traces the source

      according to Homer was called Xanthus by the gods Scamander by
      men The waters of the Scamander had the singular property of giving
      a beautiful colour to the hair or wool of such animals as bathed in
      them hence the three goddesses Minerva Juno and Venus bathed
      there before they appeared before Paris to obtain the golden apple
      the name Xanthus yellow was given to the Scamander from the
      peculiar colour of its waters still applicable to the Mendere the

  101 The Catalogue is perhaps the portion of the poem in favour of
      which a claim to separate authorship has been most plausibly urged
      Although the example of Homer has since rendered some such formal
      enumeration of the forces engaged a common practice in epic poems
      descriptive of great warlike adventures still so minute a
      statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively
      required nor perhaps such as would in ordinary cases suggest
      itself to the mind of a poet Yet there is scarcely any portion of
      the Iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more
      clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period with the
      remainder of the work The composition of the Catalogue whensoever
      it may have taken place necessarily presumes its authors
      acquaintance with a previously existing Iliad It were impossible
      otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of
      so vast a number of proper names most of them historically
      unimportant and not a few altogether fictitious or of so many
      geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few
      hundred lines and incidentally scattered over the thousands which
      follow equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in
      this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text
      several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety but
      through the medium of the IliadMure Language and Literature of

  102 Twice Sixty Thucydides observes that the Boeotian vessels
      which carried one hundred and twenty men each were probably meant
      to be the largest in the fleet and those of Philoctetes carrying
      fifty each the smallest The average would be eightyfive and
      Thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated
      themselves and that very few besides the chiefs went as mere
      passengers or landsmen In short we have in the Homeric
      descriptions the complete picture of an Indian or African war canoe
      many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale
      assigned to those of the Greeks If the total number of the Greek
      ships be taken at twelve hundred according to Thucydides although
      in point of fact there are only eleven hundred and eightysix in the
      Catalogue the amount of the army upon the foregoing average will
      be about a hundred and two thousand men The historian considers
      this a small force as representing all Greece Bryant comparing it
      with the allied army at Platae thinks it so large as to prove the
      entire falsehood of the whole story and his reasonings and

      the purpose of renovating their numbers burning out their right
      breast with a view of enabling themselves to draw the bow freely
      this was at once a general type stimulating to the fancy of the
      poet and a theme eminently popular with his hearers We find these
      warlike females constantly reappearing in the ancient poems and
      universally accepted as past realities in the Iliad When Priam
      wishes to illustrate emphatically the most numerous host in which he
      ever found himself included he tells us that it was assembled in

  167 The manner in which this episode is introduced is well illustrated
      by the following remarks of Mure vol i p298 The poets method
      of introducing his episode also illustrates in a curious manner
      his tact in the dramatic department of his art Where for example
      one or more heroes are despatched on some commission to be executed
      at a certain distance of time or place the fulfilment of this task
      is not as a general rule immediately described A certain interval
      is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene of action which
      interval is dramatised as it were either by a temporary
      continuation of the previous narrative or by fixing attention for a
      while on some new transaction at the close of which the further
      account of the mission is resumed

  174 O would kind earth c It is apparently a sudden irregular
      burst of popular indignation to which Hector alludes when he
      regrets that the Trojans had not spirit enough to cover Paris with a
      mantle of stones This however was also one of the ordinary formal
      modes of punishment for great public offences It may have been
      originally connected with the same feelingthe desire of avoiding
      the pollution of bloodshedwhich seems to have suggested the
      practice of burying prisoners alive with a scantling of food by
      their side Though Homer makes no mention of this horrible usage
      the example of the Roman Vestals affords reasons for believing that
      in ascribing it to the heroic ages Sophocles followed an authentic

  175 Paris lofty dome With respect to the private dwellings which

      on the eye It seems indeed probable from the manner in which he
      dwells on their metallic ornaments that the higher beauty of
      proportion was but little required or understood and it is
      perhaps strength and convenience rather than elegance that he
      means to commend in speaking of the fair house which Paris had
      built for himself with the aid of the most skilful masons of

  186 Embattled walls Another essential basis of mechanical unity in
      the poem is the construction of the rampart This takes place in the
      seventh book The reason ascribed for the glaring improbability that
      the Greeks should have left their camp and fleet unfortified during
      nine years in the midst of a hostile country is a purely poetical
      one So long as Achilles fought the terror of his name sufficed to
      keep every foe at a distance The disasters consequent on his
      secession first led to the necessity of other means of protection
      Accordingly in the battles previous to the eighth book no allusion
      occurs to a rampart in all those which follow it forms a prominent
      feature Here then in the anomaly as in the propriety of the
      Iliad the destiny of Achilles or rather this peculiar crisis of
      it forms the pervading bond of connexion to the whole poemMure

      withdrawn During the twelve intermediate books it is kept steadily
      in view No interposition takes place but on the part of the
      specially authorised agents of Jove or on that of one or two
      contumacious deities described as boldly setting his commands at
      defiance but checked and reprimanded for their disobedience while
      the other divine warriors who in the previous and subsequent cantos
      are so active in support of their favourite heroes repeatedly

      Some of the epithets which Homer applies to the heavens seem to
      imply that he considered it as a solid vault of metal But it is not
      necessary to construe these epithets so literally nor to draw any
      such inference from his description of Atlas who holds the lofty
      pillars which keep earth and heaven asunder Yet it would seem from
      the manner in which the height of heaven is compared with the depth
      of Tartarus that the region of light was thought to have certain
      bounds The summit of the Thessalian Olympus was regarded as the
      highest point on the earth and it is not always carefully
      distinguished from the aerian regions above The idea of a seat of
      the godsperhaps derived from a more ancient tradition in which it
      was not attached to any geographical siteseems to be indistinctly

  200 Grote vol ii p 91 after noticing the modest calmness and
      respect with which Nestor addresses Agamemnon observes The
      Homeric Council is a purely consultative body assembled not with
      any power of peremptorily arresting mischievous resolves of the
      king but solely for his information and guidance

  201 In the heroic times it is not unfrequent for the king to receive
      presents to purchase freedom from his wrath or immunity from his
      exactions Such gifts gradually became regular and formed the
      income of the German Tacit Germ Section 15 Persian Herodot
      iii89 and other kings So too in the middle ages The feudal
      aids are the beginning of taxation of which they for a long time
      answered the purpose Hallam Middle Ages ch x pt 1 p 189
      This fact frees Achilles from the apparent charge of sordidness
      Plato however De Rep vi 4 says We cannot commend Phoenix
      the tutor of Achilles as if he spoke correctly when counselling
      him to accept of presents and assist the Greeks but without
      presents not to desist from his wrath nor again should we commend
      Achilles himself or approve of his being so covetous as to receive
      presents from Agamemnon c

  202 It may be observed that brief as is the mention of Briseis in the
      Iliad and small the part she playswhat little is said is
      preeminently calculated to enhance her fitness to be the bride of
      Achilles Purity and retiring delicacy are features well
      contrasted with the rough but tender disposition of the hero

  204 Agamemnon when he offers to transfer to Achilles seven towns
      inhabited by wealthy husbandmen who would enrich their lord by
      presents and tribute seems likewise to assume rather a property in
      them than an authority over them And the same thing may be
      intimated when it is said that Peleus bestowed a great people the

  207 It must be recollected that the war at Troy was not a settled
      siege and that many of the chieftains busied themselves in
      piratical expeditions about its neighborhood Such a one was that of
      which Achilles now speaks From the following verses it is evident
      that fruits of these maraudings went to the common support of the
      expedition and not to the successful plunderer

      vol p 181 was a sufficient reason for its prosperity and decay
      As long as the channels of these waters were diligently watched and
      kept clear a large portion of the lake was in the condition of
      alluvial land preeminently rich and fertile But when the channels
      came to be either neglected or designedly choked up by an enemy
      the water accumulated in such a degree as to occupy the soil of more
      than one ancient islet and to occasion the change of the site of
      Orchomenus itself from the plain to the declivity of Mount

      passage has occasioned much discussion It may mean according as
      we read it either longlived or bowless the latter epithet
      indicating that they did not depend upon archery for subsistence

  236 And Minos By Homer Minos is described as the son of Jupiter
      and of the daughter of Phoenix whom all succeeding authors name
      Europa and he is thus carried back into the remotest period of
      Cretan antiquity known to the poet apparently as a native hero
      Illustrious enough for a divine parentage and too ancient to allow
      his descent to be traced to any other source But in a genealogy
      recorded by later writers he is likewise the adopted son of
      Asterius as descendant of Dorus the son of Helen and is thus
      connected with a colony said to have been led into Creta by
      Tentamus or Tectamus son of Dorus who is related either to have
      crossed over from Thessaly or to have embarked at Malea after

      the Preface to the Heroica of Philostratus

  243 His best beloved The following elegant remarks of Thirlwall
      Greece vol i p 176 seq well illustrate the character of the
      friendship subsisting between these two heroes

      One of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character
      is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and
      durable friendships and this is a feature no less prominent in the
      earliest than in later times It was indeed connected with the
      comparatively low estimation in which female society was held but
      the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were
      maintained was not the less admirable and engaging The heroic
      companions whom we find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in
      traditions which if not of equal antiquity were grounded on the
      same feeling seem to have but one heart and soul with scarcely a
      wish or object apart and only to live as they are always ready to
      die for one another It is true that the relation between them is
      not always one of perfect equality but this is a circumstance
      which while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical
      description detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it
      presents Such were the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus of
      Theseus and Pirithous of Orestes and Pylades and though These may
      owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even
      dramatic poetry the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the
      period to which the traditions are referred The argument of the
      Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus whose
      love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his
      higher birth and his unequalled prowess But the mutual regard which
      united Idomeneus and Meriones Diomedes and Sthenelus though as
      the persons themselves are less important it is kept more in the
      background is manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light The
      idea of a Greek hero seems not to have been thought complete
      without such a brother in arms by his sideThirlwall Greece vol
      i p 176 seq

        So rushd we forth at once

  245 The destinies ordainIn the mythology also of the Iliad
      purely Pagan as it is we discover one important truth unconsciously
      involved which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly
      equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages Zeus or Jupiter
      is popularly to be taken as omnipotent No distinct empire is
      assigned to fate or fortune the will of the father of gods and men
      is absolute and uncontrollable This seems to be the true character
      of the Homeric deity and it is very necessary that the student of
      Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind A strong
      instance in the Iliad itself to illustrate this position is the
      passage where Jupiter laments to Juno the approaching death of
      Sarpedon Alas me says he since it is fated moira that
      Sarpedon dearest to me of men should be slain by Patroclus the
      son of Menoetius Indeed my heart is divided within me while I
      ruminate it in my mind whether having snatched him up from out of
      the lamentable battle I should not at once place him alive in the
      fertile land of his own Lycia or whether I should now destroy him
      by the hands of the son of Menoetius To which Juno answersDost
      thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man long since destined by
      fate palai pepromenon You may do itbut we the rest of the gods
      do not sanction it Here it is clear from both speakers that
      although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die Jupiter might still
      if he pleased save him and place him entirely out of the reach of
      any such event and further in the alternative that Jupiter
      himself would destroy him by the hands of anotherColeridge p

      The chiefs fight in advance and enact almost as much as the knights
      of romance The siege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a
      captain in the guards is like Achilles There is no mention of a
      ditch or any other line or work round the town and the wall itself
      was accessible without a ladder It was probably a vast mound of
      earth with a declivity outwards Patroclus thrice mounts it in
      armour The Trojans are in no respects blockaded and receive
      assistance from their allies to the very endColeridge p 212

        In the wide circle of the shield were seen

        In different stations and you there might view
        The stars that gem the stillrevolving heaven
        And under them the vast expanse of air
        In which with outstretchd wings the longbeakd bird
        Winnowd the gale as if instinct with life
        Around the shield the waves of ocean flowd

        Inciting men and Furies breathing flames

        Their limbs distilling plenteous blood and sweat
        And Gorgons whose long locks were twisting snakes

        The steers were moving sturdy bullocks here

  257 Coleridge Greek Classic Poets p 182 seq has diligently
      compared this with the description of the shield of Hercules by
      Hesiod He remarks that with two or three exceptions the imagery
      differs in little more than the names and arrangements and the
      difference of arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether
      for the worse The natural consecution of the Homeric images needs
      no exposition it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the
      work The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or
      congruity Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the
      Centaurs and Lapithae but the gap is wide indeed between them and
      Apollo with the Muses waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial
      harmonies whence however we are hurried back to Perseus the
      Gorgons and other images of war over an arm of the sea in which
      the sporting dolphins the fugitive fishes and the fisherman on the
      shore with his casting net are minutely represented As to the
      Hesiodic images themselves the leading remark is that they catch
      at beauty by ornament and at sublimity by exaggeration and upon
      the untenable supposition of the genuineness of this poem there is
      this curious peculiarity that in the description of scenes of
      rustic peace the superiority of Homer is decisivewhile in those of
      war and tumult it may be thought perhaps that the Hesiodic poet
      has more than once the advantage

  258 This legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in the
      Grecian Mythology it explains according to the religious ideas
      familiar to the old epic poets both the distinguishing attributes
      and the endless toil and endurances of Heracles the most renowned
      subjugator of all the semidivine personages worshipped by the
      Hellenesa being of irresistible force and especially beloved by
      Zeus yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey the
      commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor His recompense is
      reserved to the close of his career when his afflicting trials are
      brought to a close he is then admitted to the godhead and receives
      in marriage HebeGrote vol i p 128

      murdered by his host for the sake of the treasure sent with him

  269 Perhaps the boldest excursion of Homer into this region of poetical
      fancy is the collision into which in the twentyfirst of the Iliad
      he has brought the river god Scamander first with Achilles and
      afterwards with Vulcan when summoned by Juno to the heros aid The
      overwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural interpretation in
      the character of the mountain torrents of Greece and Asia Minor
      Their wide shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry so as to
      be easily forded by the foot passenger But a thundershower in the
      mountains unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain may
      suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river The rescue of
      Achilles by the fiery arms of Vulcan scarcely admits of the same
      ready explanation from physical causes Yet the subsiding of the
      flood at the critical moment when the heros destruction appeared
      imminent might by a slight extension of the figurative parallel
      be ascribed to a god symbolic of the influences opposed to all
      atmospheric moistureMure vol i p 480 sq

  278 Such was his fate After chasing the Trojans into the town he was
      slain by an arrow from the quiver of Paris directed under the
      unerring auspices of Apollo The greatest efforts were made by the
      Trojans to possess themselves of the body which was however rescued
      and borne off to the Grecian camp by the valour of Ajax and Ulysses
      Thetis stole away the body just as the Greeks were about to burn it
      with funeral honours and conveyed it away to a renewed life of
      immortality in the isle of Leuke in the Euxine

      Plato who often finds fault with Homer without reason should have
      copied this twaddling etymology into his Cratylus

      it is almost useless to attempt a selection of passages for

      Romans had the same custom which they called decursio Plutarch

        Art thou so late returnd for our defence
        Do we behold thee wearied as we are
        With length of labours and with toils of war
        After so many funerals of thy own
        Art thou restored to thy declining town

  291 Virgil by making the boaster vanquished has drawn a better moral
      from this episode than Homer The following lines deserve
      comparison

        The haughty Dares in the lists appears
        Walking he strides his head erected bears
        His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield
        And loud applauses echo through the field
                                      
        Such Dares was and such he strode along
        And drew the wonder of the gazing throng
        His brawny breast and ample chest he shows
        His lifted arms around his head he throws
        And deals in whistling air his empty blows
        His match is sought but through the trembling band
        No one dares answer to the proud demand
        Presuming of his force with sparkling eyes
        Already he devours the promised prize
                                      
        If none my matchless valour dares oppose
        How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes

                                             Drydens Virgil v 486 seq

          292 The gauntletfight thus ended from the shore
        His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore
        His mouth and nostrils pourd a purple flood
        And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood

                                                  Drydens Virgil v 623

  293 Troilus is only once named in the Iliad he was mentioned also in
      the Cypriad but his youth beauty and untimely end made him an
      object of great interest with the subsequent poetsGrote i p
      399

  294 Milton has rivalled this passage describing the descent of Gabriel
      Paradise Lost bk v 266 seq

          Down thither prone in flight
        He speeds and through the vast ethereal sky
        Sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
        Now on the polar winds then with quick fan
        Winnows the buxom air    
                                               
        At once on th eastern cliff of Paradise
        He lights and to his proper shape returns
        A seraph wingd    
          Like Maias son he stood
        And shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filld
        The circuit wide

      Virgil Ćn iv 350

        Hermes obeys with golden pinions binds
        His flying feet and mounts the western winds
        And whether oer the seas or earth he flies
        With rapid force they bear him down the skies
        But first he grasps within his awful hand
        The mark of sovereign power his magic wand
        With this he draws the ghost from hollow graves
        With this he drives them from the Stygian waves
                                               
        Thus armd the god begins his airy race
        And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space

                                                                   Dryden

  295 In reference to the whole scene that follows the remarks of
      Coleridge are well worth reading

      By a close study of life and by a true and natural mode of
      expressing everything Homer was enabled to venture upon the most
      peculiar and difficult situations and to extricate himself from
      them with the completest success The whole scene between Achilles
      and Priam when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose
      of redeeming the body of Hector is at once the most profoundly
      skilful and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the
      Iliad Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of
      Priam the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent that if
      genius did not often especially in oratory unconsciously fulfil
      the most subtle precepts of criticism we might be induced on this
      account alone to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is
      called spurious in other words of later date than the rest of the
      poem Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of
      Achilles from the outset with the image of his father in
      gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation and
      lastly mentioning Hectors name when he perceives that the hero is
      softened and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of
      the conqueror The ego deleeinoteros per and the apusato aecha
      geronta are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the
      Iliad They are almost too fine and pathetic The whole passage
      defies translation for there is that about the Greek which has no
      name but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can
      only be felt in the original and is lost in an attempt to transfuse
      it into another languageColeridge p 195

  296 Achilles ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot but
      offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity The heroic
      age however must be judged by its own moral laws Retributive
      vengeance on the dead as well as the living was a duty inculcated
      by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that
      evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured
      man but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the
      fate of the body from which it had separated Hence a denial of the
      rites essential to the souls admission into the more favoured
      regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on
      the dreary shores of the infernal river The complaint of the ghost
      of Patroclus to Achilles of but a brief postponement of his own
      obsequies shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his
      destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge which
      even after death was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades
      Hence before yielding up the body of Hector to Priam Achilles asks
      pardon of Patroclus for even this partial cession of his just rights
      of retributionMure vol i 289

  297 Such was the fate of Astyanax when Troy was taken

        Here from the towr by stern Ulysses thrown
        Andromache bewaild her infant son

                                           Merricks Tryphiodorus v 675

  298 The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant and
      interesting view of Helens character

      Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand
      that has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles gives us
      also the consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen She is through
      the Iliad a genuine lady graceful in motion and speech noble in
      her associations full of remorse for a fault for which higher
      powers seem responsible yet grateful and affectionate towards those
      with whom that fault had committed her I have always thought the
      following speech in which Helen laments Hector and hints at her own
      invidious and unprotected situation in Troy as almost the sweetest
      passage in the poem It is another striking instance of that
      refinement of feeling and softness of tone which so generally
      distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the restClassic
      Poets p 198 seq

  299 And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to
      exalt and purify our impression of his character We had accompanied
      him through the effervescence undulations and final subsidence of
      his stormy passions We now leave him in repose and under the full
      influence of the more amiable affections while our admiration of
      his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that within a
      few short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself
      to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise

      The frequent and touching allusions interspersed throughout the
      Iliad to the speedy termination of its heros course and the moral
      on the vanity of human life which they indicate are among the
      finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole
      framework of the poem is unitedMure vol i p 201

  300 Cowper saysI cannot take my leave of this noble poem without
      expressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it It
      is like the exit of a great man out of company whom he has
      entertained magnificently neither pompous nor familiar not
      contemptuous yet without much ceremony Coleridge p 227
      considers the termination of Paradise Lost somewhat similar
