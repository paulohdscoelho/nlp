accord to these gentlemen by far the most thickli settl portion of the countri a circumst which must make it an uncomfort resid for individu of a poetic tempera if love of solitud be as immemori tradit assert a necessari part of their idiosyncrasi mr poe ha two of the prime qualiti of geniu a faculti of vigor yet minut analysi and a wonder fecund of imagin the first of these faculti is as need to the artist in word as a knowledg of anatomi is to the artist in color or in stone thi enabl him to conceiv truli to maintain a proper relat of part and to draw a correct outlin while the second group fill up and color both of these mr poe ha displai with singular distinct in hi prose work the last predomin in hi earlier tale and the first in hi later on in judg of the merit of an author and assign him hi nich among our household god we have a right to regard him from our own point of view and to measur him by our own standard but in estim the amount of power displai in hi work we must be govern by hi own design and place them by the side of hi own ideal find how much is want we differ from mr poe in hi opinion of the object of art he esteem that object to be the creation of beauti and perhap it is onli in the definit of that word that we disagre with him but in what we shall sai of hi write we shall take hi own standard as our guid the templ of the god of song is equal access from everi side and there is room enough in it for all who bring offer or seek in oracl in hi tale mr poe ha chosen to exhibit hi power chiefli in that dim region which stretch from the veri utmost limit of the probabl into the weird confin of superstit and unreal he combin in a veri remark manner two faculti which ar seldom found unit a power of influenc the mind of the reader by the impalp shadow of mysteri and a minut of detail which doe not leav a pin or a button unnot both ar in truth the natur result of the predomin qualiti of hi mind to which we have befor allud analysi it is thi which distinguish the artist hi mind at onc reach forward to the effect to be produc have resolv to bring about certain emot in the reader he make all subordin part tend strictli to the common centr even hi mysteri is mathemat to hi own mind to him x is a known quantiti all along in ani pictur that he paint he understand the chemic properti of all hi color howev vagu some of hi figur mai seem howev formless the shadow to him the outlin is as clear and distinct as that of a geometr diagram for thi reason mr poe ha no sympathi with mystic the mystic dwell in the mysteri is envelop with it it color all hi thought it affect hi optic nerv especi and the commonest thing get a rainbow edg from it mr poe on the other hand is a spectat ab extra he analyz he dissect he watch with an ey seren the veri puls of the machin for such it practic is to him with wheel and cog and pistonrod all work to produc a certain end thi analyz tendenc of hi mind balanc the poetic and by give him the patienc to be minut enabl him to throw a wonder realiti into hi most unreal fanci a monomania he paint with great power he love to dissect on of these cancer of the mind and to trace all the subtl ramif of it root in rais imag of horror also he ha strang success convei to us sometim by a duski hint some terribl doubt which is the secret of all horror he leav to imagin the task of finish the pictur a task to which onli she is compet for much imaginari work wa there conceit deceit so compact so kind that for achil imag stood hi spear grasp in an arm hand himself behind wa left unseen save to the ey of mind besid the merit of concept mr poe s write have also that of form hi style is highli finish grace and truli classic it would be hard to find a live author who had displai such vari

read it without be strongli move by it seren and sombr beauti had it author written noth els it would alon have been enough to stamp him as a man of geniu and the master of a classic style in thi tale

qualiti as mean of subjug the fanci of their reader the loftiest muse ha ever a household and firesid charm about her mr poe s secret li mainli in the skill with which he ha emploi the strang fascin of mysteri and terror in thi hi success is so great and strike as to deserv the name of art not artific we cannot call hi materi the noblest or purest but we must conced to him the highest merit of construct as a critic mr poe wa aesthet defici uner in hi analysi of diction metr and plot he seem want in the faculti of perceiv the profound ethic of art hi critic ar howev distinguish for scientif

in warmth thei ar also without the heat of partisanship thei ar especi valuabl as illustr the great truth too gener overlook that analyt power is a subordin qualiti of the critic on the whole it mai be consid certain that mr poe ha attain an individu emin in our literatur which he will keep he ha given proof of power and origin he ha done that which could onli be done onc with success or safeti

conscious of my situat began to glimmer through my mind but strang to sai i wa neither astonish nor horrorstricken if i felt ani emot at all it wa a kind of chuckl satisfact at the clever i wa about to displai in extric myself from thi dilemma and i never for a moment look upon my ultim safeti as a question suscept of doubt for a few minut i remain wrap in the profoundest medit i have a distinct recollect of frequent compress my lip put my forefing to the side of my nose and make us of other gesticul and grimac common to men who at eas in their armchair medit upon matter of intricaci or import have as i thought suffici collect my idea i now with great caution and deliber put my hand behind my back and unfasten the larg iron buckl which belong to the waistband of my inexpress thi buckl had three teeth which be somewhat rusti turn with great difficulti on their axi i brought them howev after some troubl at right angl to the bodi of the buckl and wa glad to find them remain firm in that posit hold the instrument thu obtain within my teeth i now proceed to unti the knot of my cravat i had to rest sever time befor i could accomplish thi manoeuvr but it wa at length accomplish to on end of the cravat i then made fast the buckl and the other end i ti for greater secur tightli around my wrist draw now my bodi upward with a prodigi exert of muscular forc i succeed at the veri first trial in throw the buckl over the car and entangl it as i had anticip in the circular rim of the wickerwork my bodi wa now inclin toward the side of the car at an angl of about fortyf degre but it must not be understood that i wa therefor onli fortyf degre below the perpendicular so far from it i still lai nearli level with the plane of the horizon for the chang of situat which i had acquir had forc the bottom of the car consider outward from my posit which wa accordingli on of the most immin and deadli peril it should be rememb howev that when i fell in the first instanc from the car if i had fallen with my face turn toward the balloon instead of turn outwardli from it as it actual wa or if in the second place the cord by which i wa suspend had chanc to hang over the upper edg instead of through a crevic near the bottom of the cari sai it mai be readili conceiv that in either of these suppos case i should have been unabl to accomplish even as much as i had now accomplish and the wonder adventur of han pfaall would have been utterli lost to poster i had therefor everi reason to be grate although in point of fact i wa still too stupid to be anyth at all and hung for perhap a quarter of an hour in that extraordinari manner without make the slightest farther exert whatsoev and in a singularli tranquil state of idiot enjoy but thi feel did not fail to die rapidli awai and thereunto succeed horror and dismai and a chill sens of utter helpless and ruin in fact the blood so long accumul in the vessel of my head and throat and which had hitherto buoi up my spirit with mad and delirium had now begun to retir within their proper channel and the distinct which wa thu ad to my percept of the danger mere serv to depriv me of the selfpossess and courag to encount it but thi weak wa luckili for me of no veri long durat in good time came to my rescu the spirit of despair and with frantic cri and struggl i jerk my wai bodili upward till at length clutch with a viselik grip the longdesir rim i writh my person over it and fell headlong and shudder within the car it wa not until some time afterward that i recov myself suffici to attend to the ordinari care of the balloon i then howev examin it with attent and found it to my great relief uninjur my implement were all safe and fortun i had lost neither ballast nor provis inde i had so well secur them in their place that such an accid wa entir out of the question look at my watch i found it six o clock i wa still rapidli ascend and my baromet gave a present altitud of three and threequart mile immedi beneath me in the ocean lai a small black object slightli oblong in shape seemingli about the size and in everi wai bear a great resembl to on of those childish toi call a domino bring my telescop to bear upon it i plainli discern it to be a british nineti fourgun ship closehaul and pitch heavili in the sea with her head to the wsw besid thi ship i saw noth but the ocean and the sky and the sun which had long arisen it is now high time that i should explain to your excel the object of my peril voyag your excel will bear in mind that distress circumst in rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolut of commit suicid it wa not howev that to life itself i had ani posit disgust but that i wa harass beyond endur by the adventiti miseri attend my situat in thi state of mind wish to live yet weari with life the treatis at the stall of the booksel open a resourc to my imagin i then final made up my mind i determin to depart yet liveto leav the world yet continu to existin short to drop enigma i resolv let what would ensu to forc a passag if i could to the moon now lest i should be suppos more of a madman than i actual am i will detail as well as i am abl the consider which led me to believ that an achiev of thi natur although without doubt difficult and incontest full of danger wa not absolut to a bold spirit beyond the confin of the possibl the moon s actual distanc from the earth wa the first thing to be attend to now the mean or averag interv between the centr of the two planet is of the earth s equatori radii or onli about mile i sai the mean or averag interv but it must be born in mind that the form of the moon s orbit be an ellips of eccentr amount to no less than of the major semiaxi of the ellips itself and the earth s centr be situat in it focu if i could in ani manner contriv to meet the moon as it were in it perige the abov mention distanc would be materi diminish but to sai noth at present of thi possibl it wa veri certain that at all event from the mile i would have to deduct the radiu of the earth sai and the radiu of the moon sai in all leav an actual interv to be travers under averag circumst of mile now thi i reflect wa no veri extraordinari distanc travel on land ha been repeatedli accomplish at the rate of thirti mile per hour and inde a much greater speed mai be anticip but even at thi veloc it would take me no more than dai to reach the surfac of the moon there were howev mani particular induc me to believ that my averag rate of travel might possibl veri much exce that of thirti mile per hour and as these consider did not fail to make a deep impress upon my mind i will mention them more fulli hereaft the next point to be regard wa a matter of far greater import from indic afford by the baromet we find that in ascens from the surfac of the earth we have at the height of feet left below us about onethirtieth of the entir mass of atmospher air that at we have ascend through nearli onethird and that at which is not far from the elev of cotopaxi we have surmount onehalf the materi or at all event onehalf the ponder bodi of air incumb upon our globe it is also calcul that at an altitud not exceed the hundredth part of the earth s diameterthat is not exceed eighti milesth rarefact would be so excess that anim life could in no manner be sustain and moreov that the most delic mean we possess of ascertain the presenc of the atmospher would be inadequ to assur us of it exist but i did not fail to perceiv that these latter calcul ar found altogeth on our experiment knowledg of the properti of air and the mechan law regul it dilat and compress in what mai be call compar speak the immedi vicin of the earth itself and at the same time it is taken for grant that anim life is and must be essenti incap of modif at ani given unattain distanc from the surfac now all such reason and from such data must of cours be simpli analog the greatest height ever reach by man wa that of feet attain in the aeronaut expedit of messieur gaylussac and biot thi is a moder altitud even when compar with the eighti mile in question and i could not help think that the subject admit room for doubt and great latitud for specul but in point of fact an ascens be made to ani given altitud the ponder quantiti of air surmount in ani farther ascens is by no mean in proport to the addit height ascend as mai be plainli seen from what ha been state befor but in a ratio constantli decreas it is therefor evid that ascend as high as we mai we cannot liter speak arriv at a limit beyond which no atmospher is to be found it must exist i argu although it mai exist in a state of infinit rarefact on the other hand i wa awar that argument have not been want to prove the exist of a real and definit limit to the atmospher beyond which there is absolut no air whatsoev but a circumst which ha been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seem to me although no posit refut of their creed still a point worthi veri seriou investig on compar the interv between the success arriv of enck s comet at it perihelion after give credit in the most exact manner for all the disturb due to the attract of the planet it appear that the period ar gradual diminish that is to sai the major axi of the comet s ellips is grow shorter in a slow but perfectli regular decreas now thi is precis what ought to be the case if we suppos a resist experienc from the comet from an extrem rare ether medium pervad the region of it orbit for it is evid that such a medium must in retard the comet s veloc increas it centripet by weaken it centrifug forc in other word the sun s attract would be constantli attain greater power and the comet would be drawn nearer at everi revolut inde there is no other wai of account for the variat in question but again the real diamet of the same comet s nebulos is observ to contract rapidli as it approach the sun and dilat with equal rapid in it departur toward it aphelion wa i not justifi in suppos with m valz that thi appar condens of volum ha it origin in the compress of the same ether medium i have spoken of befor and which is onli denser in proport to it solar vicin the lenticularshap phenomenon also call the zodiac light wa a matter worthi of attent thi radianc so appar in the tropic and which cannot be mistaken for ani meteor lustr extend from the horizon obliqu upward and follow gener the direct of the sun s equat it appear to me evid in the natur of a rare atmospher extend from the sun outward beyond the orbit of venu at least and i believ indefinit farther inde thi medium i could not suppos confin to the path of the comet s ellips or to the immedi neighborhood of the sun it wa easi on the contrari to imagin it pervad the entir region of our planetari system condens into what we call atmospher at the planet themselv and perhap at some of them modifi by consider so to speak pure geolog have adopt thi view of the subject i had littl further hesit grant that on my passag i should meet with atmospher essenti the same as at the surfac of the earth i conceiv that by mean of the veri ingeni apparatu of m grimm i should readili be enabl to condens it in suffici quantiti for the purpos of respir thi would remov the chief obstacl in a journei to the moon i had inde spent some monei and great labor in adapt the apparatu to the object intend and confid look forward to it success applic if i could manag to complet the voyag within ani reason period thi bring me back to the rate at which it might be possibl to travel it is true that balloon in the first stage of their ascens from the earth ar known to rise with a veloc compar moder now the power of elev li altogeth in the superior light of the ga in the balloon compar with the atmospher air and at first sight it doe not appear probabl that as the balloon acquir altitud and consequ arriv success in atmospher strata of densiti rapidli diminishingi sai it doe not appear at all reason that in thi it progress upward the origin veloc should be acceler on the other hand i wa not awar that in ani record ascens a diminut wa appar in the absolut rate of ascent although such should have been the case if on account of noth els on account of the escap of ga through balloon illconstruct and varnish with no better materi than the ordinari varnish it seem therefor that the effect of such escap wa onli suffici to counterbal the effect of some acceler power i now consid that provid in my passag i found the medium i had imagin and provid that it should prove to be actual and essenti what we denomin atmospher air it could make compar littl differ at what extrem state of rarefact i should discov itthat is to sai in regard to my power of ascendingfor the ga in the balloon would not onli be itself subject to rarefact partial similar in proport to the occurr of which i could suffer an escap of so much as would be requisit to prevent explos but be what it wa would at all event continu specif lighter than ani compound whatev of mere nitrogen and oxygen in the meantim the forc of gravit would be constantli diminish in proport to the squar of the distanc and thu with a veloc prodigi acceler i should at length arriv in those distant region where the forc of the earth s attract would be supersed by that of the moon in accord with these idea i did not think it worth while to encumb myself with more provis than would be suffici for a period of forti dai there wa still howev anoth difficulti which occas me some littl disquietud it ha been observ that in balloon ascens to ani consider height besid the pain attend respir great uneasi is experienc about the head and bodi often accompani with bleed at the nose and other symptom of an alarm kind and grow more and more inconveni in proport to the altitud attain thi wa a reflect of a natur somewhat startl wa it not probabl that these symptom would increas indefinit or at least until termin by death itself i final thought not their origin wa to be look for in the progress remov of the customari atmospher pressur upon the surfac of the bodi and consequ distent of the superfici bloodvesselsnot in ani posit disorgan of the anim system as in the case of difficulti in breath where the atmospher densiti is chemic insuffici for the due renov of blood in a ventricl of the heart unless for default of thi renov i could see no reason therefor why life could not be sustain even in a vacuum for the expans and compress of chest commonli call breath is action pure muscular and the caus not the effect of respir in a word i conceiv that as the bodi should becom habitu to the want of atmospher pressur the sensat of pain would gradual diminishand to endur them while thei continu i reli with confid upon the iron hardihood of my constitut thu mai it pleas your excel i have detail some though by no mean all the consider which led me to form the project of a lunar voyag i shall now proce to lai befor you the result of an attempt so appar audaci in concept and at all event so utterli unparallel in the annal of mankind have attain the altitud befor mention that is to sai three mile and threequart i threw out from the car a quantiti of feather and found that i still ascend with suffici rapid there wa therefor no necess for discharg ani ballast i wa glad of thi for i wish to retain with me as much weight as i could carri for reason which will be explain in the sequel i as yet suffer no bodili inconveni breath with great freedom and feel no pain whatev in the head the cat wa ly veri demur upon my coat which i had taken off and ey the pigeon with an air of nonchal these latter be ti by the leg to prevent their escap were busili emploi in pick up some grain of rice scatter for them in the bottom of the car at twenti minut past six o clock the baromet show an elev of feet or five mile to a fraction the prospect seem unbound inde it is veri easili calcul by mean of spheric geometri what a great extent of the earth s area i beheld the convex surfac of ani segment of a sphere is to the entir surfac of the sphere itself as the vers sine of the segment to the diamet of the sphere now in my case the vers sinethat is to sai the thick of the segment beneath mewa about equal to my elev or the elev of the point of sight abov the surfac as five mile then to eight thousand would express the proport of the earth s area seen by me in other word i beheld as much as a sixteenhundredth part of the whole surfac of the globe the sea appear unruffl as a mirror although by mean of the spyglass i could perceiv it to be in a state of violent agit the ship wa no longer visibl have drift awai appar to the eastward i now began to experi at interv sever pain in the head especi about the earsstil howev breath with toler freedom the cat and pigeon seem to suffer no inconveni whatsoev at twenti minut befor seven the balloon enter a long seri of dens cloud which put me to great troubl by damag my condens apparatu and wet me to the skin thi wa to be sure a singular recontr for i had not believ it possibl that a cloud of thi natur could be sustain at so great an elev i thought it best howev to throw out two fivepound piec of ballast reserv still a weight of on hundr and sixtyf pound upon so do i soon rose abov the difficulti and perceiv immedi that i had obtain a great increas in my rate of ascent in a few second after my leav the cloud a flash of vivid lightn shot from on end of it to the other and caus it to kindl up throughout it vast extent like a mass of ignit and glow charcoal thi it must be rememb wa in the broad light of dai no fanci mai pictur the sublim which might have been exhibit by a similar phenomenon take place amid the dark of the night hell itself might have been found a fit imag even as it wa my hair stood on end while i gaze afar down within the yawn abyss let imagin descend as it were and stalk about in the strang vault hall and ruddi gulf and red ghastli chasm of the hideou and unfathom fire i had inde made a narrow escap had the balloon remain a veri short while longer within the cloudthat is to sayhad not the inconveni of get wet determin me to discharg the ballast inevit ruin would have been the consequ such peril although littl consid ar perhap the greatest which must be encount in balloon i had by thi time howev attain too great an elev to be ani longer uneasi on thi head i wa now rise rapidli and by seven o clock the baromet indic an altitud of no less than nine mile and a half i began to find great difficulti in draw my breath my head too wa excess pain and have felt for some time a moistur about my cheek i at length discov it to be blood which wa ooz quit fast from the drum of my ear my ey also gave me great uneasi upon pass the hand over them thei seem to have protrud from their socket in no inconsider degre and all object in the car and even the balloon itself appear distort to my vision these symptom were more than i had expect and occas me some alarm at thi junctur veri imprud and without consider i threw out from the car three fivepound piec of ballast the acceler rate of ascent thu obtain carri me too rapidli and without suffici gradat into a highli rarefi stratum of the atmospher and the result had nearli prove fatal to my expedit and to myself i wa suddenli seiz with a spasm which last for more than five minut and even when thi in a measur ceas i could catch my breath onli at long interv and in a gasp mannerbleed all the while copious at the nose and ear and even slightli at the ey the pigeon appear distress in the extrem and struggl to escap while the cat mew piteous and with her tongu hang out of her mouth stagger to and fro in the car as if under the influenc of poison i now too late discov the great rash of which i had been guilti in discharg the ballast and my agit wa excess i anticip noth less than death and death in a few minut the physic suffer i underw contribut also to render me nearli incap of make ani exert for the preserv of my life i had inde littl power of reflect left and the violenc of the pain in my head seem to be greatli on the increas thu i found that my sens would shortli give wai altogeth and i had alreadi clutch on of the valv rope with the view of attempt a descent when the recollect of the trick i had plai the three creditor and the possibl consequ to myself should i return oper to deter me for the moment i lai down in the bottom of the car and endeavor to collect my faculti in thi i so far succeed as to determin upon the experi of lose blood have no lancet howev i wa constrain to perform the oper in the best manner i wa abl and final succeed in open a vein in my right arm with the blade of my penknif the blood had hardli commenc flow when i experienc a sensibl relief and by the time i had lost about half a moder basin full most of the worst symptom had abandon me entir i nevertheless did not think it expedi to attempt get on my feet immedi but have ti up my arm as well as i could i lai still for about a quarter of an hour at the end of thi time i aros and found myself freer from absolut pain of ani kind than i had been dure the last hour and a quarter of my ascens the difficulti of breath howev wa diminish in a veri slight degre and i found that it would soon be posit necessari to make us of my condens in the meantim look toward the cat who wa again snugli stow awai upon my coat i discov to my infinit surpris that she had taken the opportun of my indisposit to bring into light a litter of three littl kitten thi wa an addit to the number of passeng on my part altogeth unexpect but i wa pleas at the occurr it would afford me a chanc of bring to a kind of test the truth of a surmis which more than anyth els had influenc me in attempt thi ascens i had imagin that the habitu endur of the atmospher pressur at the surfac of the earth wa the caus or nearli so of the pain attend anim exist at a distanc abov the surfac should the kitten be found to suffer uneasi in an equal degre with their mother i must consid my theori in fault but a failur to do so i should look upon as a strong confirm of my idea by eight o clock i had actual attain an elev of seventeen mile abov the surfac of the earth thu it seem to me evid that my rate of ascent wa not onli on the increas but that the progress would have been appar in a slight degre even had i not discharg the ballast which i did the pain in my head and ear return at interv with violenc and i still continu to bleed occasion at the nose but upon the whole i suffer much less than might have been expect i breath howev at everi moment with more and more difficulti and each inhal wa attend with a troublesom spasmod action of the chest i now unpack the condens apparatu and got it readi for immedi us the view of the earth at thi period of my ascens wa beauti inde to the westward the northward and the southward as far as i could see lai a boundless sheet of appar unruffl ocean which everi moment gain a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began alreadi to assum a slight appear of convex at a vast distanc to the eastward although perfectli discern extend the island of great

cataract overhead the sky wa of a jetti black and the star were brilliantli visibl the pigeon about thi time seem to undergo much suffer i determin upon give them their liberti i first unti on of them a beauti graymottl pigeon and place him upon the rim of the wickerwork he appear extrem uneasi look anxious around him flutter hi wing and make a loud coo nois but could not be persuad to trust himself from off the car i took him up at last and threw him to about half a dozen yard from the balloon he made howev no attempt to descend as i had expect but struggl with great vehem to get back utter at the same time veri shrill and pierc cri he at length succeed in regain hi former station on the rim but had hardli done so when hi head drop upon hi breast and he fell dead within the car the

now made a hearti meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much appar satisfact her kitten were quit live and so far evinc not the slightest sign of ani uneasi whatev at a quarterpast eight be no longer abl to draw breath without the most intoler pain i proceed forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatu belong to the condens thi apparatu will requir some littl explan and your excel will pleas to bear in mind that my object in the first place wa to surround myself and cat entir with a barricad against the highli rarefi atmospher in which i wa exist with the intent of introduc within thi barricad by mean of my condens a quantiti of thi same atmospher suffici condens for the purpos of respir with thi object in view i had prepar a veri strong perfectli airtight but flexibl gumelast bag in thi bag which wa of suffici dimens the entir car wa in a manner place that is to sai it the bag wa drawn over the whole bottom of the car up it side and so on along the outsid of the rope to the upper rim or hoop where the network is attach have pull the bag up in thi wai and form a complet enclosur on all side and at bottom it wa now necessari to fasten up it top or mouth by pass it materi over the hoop of the networkin other word between the network and the hoop but if the network were separ from the hoop to admit thi passag what wa to sustain the car in the meantim now the network wa not perman fasten to the hoop but attach by a seri of run loop or noos i therefor undid onli a few of these loop at on time leav the car suspend by the remaind have thu insert a portion of the cloth form the upper part of the bag i refasten the loopsnot to the hoop for that would have been imposs sinc the cloth now intervenedbut to a seri of larg button affix to the cloth itself about three feet below the mouth of the bag the interv between the button have been made to correspond to the interv between the loop thi done a few more of the loop were unfasten from the rim a farther portion of the cloth introduc and the disengag loop then connect with their proper button in thi wai it wa possibl to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the network and the hoop it is evid that the hoop would now drop down within the car while the whole weight of the car itself with all it content would be held up mere by the strength of the button thi at first sight would seem an

three light pole prepar for the occas thi wa done of cours to keep the bag distend at the top and to preserv the lower part of the network in it proper situat all that now remain wa to fasten up the mouth of the enclosur and thi wa readili accomplish by gather the fold of the materi togeth and twist them up veri tightli on the insid by mean of a kind of stationari tourniquet in the side of the cover thu adjust round the car had been insert three circular pane of thick but clear glass through which i could see without difficulti around me in everi horizont direct in that portion of the cloth form the bottom wa likewis a fourth window of the same kind and correspond with a small apertur in the floor of the car itself thi enabl me to see perpendicularli down but have found it imposs to place ani similar contriv overhead on account of the peculiar manner of close up the open there and the consequ wrinkl in the cloth i could expect to see no object situat directli in my zenith thi of cours wa a matter of littl consequ for had i even been abl to place a window at top the balloon itself would have prevent my make ani us of it about a foot below on of the side window wa a circular

now to complain thu it seem evid that a greater part of the uneasi attend the remov of atmospher pressur had actual worn off as i had expect and that much of the pain endur for the last two hour should have been attribut altogeth to the effect of a defici respir at twenti minut befor nine o clockthat is to sai a short time prior to my close up the mouth of the chamber the mercuri attain it

balloon wa drift rapidli to the n n w the convex of the ocean beneath me wa veri evid inde although my view wa often interrupt by the mass of cloud which float to and fro i observ now that even the lightest vapor never rose to more than ten mile abov the level of the sea at half past nine i tri the experi of throw out a hand of feather through the valv thei did not float as i had expect but drop down perpendicularli like a bullet en mass and with the greatest velocityb out of sight in a veri few second i did not at first know what to make of thi extraordinari phenomenon not be abl to believ that my rate of ascent had of a sudden met with so prodigi an acceler but it soon occur to me that the atmospher wa now far too rare to sustain even the feather that thei actual fell as thei appear to do with great rapid and that i had been surpris by the unit veloc of their descent and my own elev by ten o clock i found that i had veri littl to occupi my immedi attent affair went swimmingli and i believ the balloon to be go upward with a speed increas moment although i had no longer ani mean of ascertain the progress of the increas i suffer no pain or uneasi of ani kind and enjoi better spirit

said thoughtfulli is the veri reason why the water of thi lake grow blacker with ag and more melancholi as the hour run on but fanci such as these were not the sole possessor of my brain horror of a natur most stern and most appal would too frequent obtrud themselv upon my mind and shake the innermost depth of my soul with the bare supposit of their possibl yet i would not suffer my thought for ani length of time to dwell upon these latter specul rightli judg the real and palpabl danger of the voyag suffici for my undivid attent at five o clock pm be engag in regener the atmospher within the chamber i took that opportun of observ the cat and kitten through the valv the cat herself appear to suffer again veri much and i had no hesit in attribut her uneasi chiefli to a difficulti in breath but my experi with the kitten had result veri strang i had expect of cours to see them betrai a sens of pain although in a less degre than their mother and thi would have been suffici to confirm my opinion concern the habitu endur of atmospher pressur but i wa not prepar to find them upon close examin evid enjoi a high degre of health breath with the greatest eas and perfect regular and evinc not the slightest sign of ani uneasi whatev i could onli account for all thi by extend my theori and suppos that the highli rarefi atmospher around might perhap not be as i had taken for grant chemic insuffici for the purpos of life and that a person born in such a medium might possibl be unawar of ani inconveni attend it inhal while upon remov to the denser strata near the earth he might endur tortur of a similar natur to those i had so late experienc it ha sinc been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accid at thi time occas me the loss of my littl famili of cat and depriv me of the insight into thi matter which a continu experi might have afford in pass my hand through the valv with a cup of water for the old puss the sleev of my shirt becam entangl in the loop which sustain the basket and thu in a moment loosen it from the bottom had the whole actual vanish into air it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantan manner posit there could not have interven the tenth part of a second between the disengag of the basket and it absolut and total disappear with all that it contain my good wish follow it to the earth but of cours i had no hope that either cat or kitten would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortun at six o clock i perceiv a great portion of the earth s visibl area to the eastward involv in thick shadow which continu to advanc with great rapid until at five minut befor seven the whole surfac in view wa envelop in the dark of night it wa not howev until long after thi time that the rai of the set sun ceas to illumin the balloon and thi circumst although of cours fulli anticip did not fail to give me an infinit deal of pleasur it wa evid that in the morn i should behold the rise luminari mani hour at least befor the citizen of rotterdam in spite of their situat so much farther to the eastward and thu dai after dai in proport to the height ascend would i enjoi the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period i now determin to keep a journal of my passag reckon the dai from on to twentyfour hour continu without take into consider the interv of dark at ten o clock feel sleepi i determin to lie down for the rest of the night but here a difficulti present itself which obviou as it mai appear had escap my attent up to the veri moment of which i am now speak if i went to sleep as i propos how could the atmospher in the chamber be regener in the interim to breath it for more than an hour at the farthest would be a matter of imposs or if even thi term could be extend to an hour and a quarter the most ruinou consequ might ensu the consider of thi dilemma gave me no littl disquietud and it will hardli be believ that after the danger i had undergon i should look upon thi busi in so seriou a light as to give up all hope of accomplish my ultim design and final make up my mind to the necess of a descent but thi hesit wa onli momentari i reflect that man is the veriest slave of custom and that mani point in the routin of hi exist ar deem essenti import which ar onli so at all by hi have render them habitu it wa veri certain that i could not do without sleep but i might easili bring myself to feel no inconveni from be awaken at interv of an hour dure the whole period of my repos it would requir but five minut at most to regener the atmospher in the fullest manner and the onli real difficulti wa to contriv a method of arous myself at the proper moment for so do but thi wa a question which i am will to confess occas me no littl troubl in it solut to be sure i had heard of the student who to prevent hi fall asleep over hi book held in on hand a ball of copper the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor besid hi chair serv effectu to startl him up if at ani moment he should be overcom with drowsi my own case howev wa veri differ inde and left me no room for ani similar idea for i did not wish to keep awak but to be arous from slumber at regular interv of time i at length hit upon the follow expedi which simpl as it mai seem wa hail by me at the moment of discoveri as an invent fulli equal to that of the telescop the steamengin or the art of print itself it is necessari to premis that the balloon at the elev now attain continu it cours upward with an even and undevi ascent and the car consequ follow with a steadi so perfect that it would have been imposs to detect in it the slightest vacil whatev thi circumst favor me greatli in the project i now determin to adopt my suppli of water had been put on board in keg contain five gallon each and rang veri secur around the interior of the car i unfasten on of these and take two rope ti them tightli across the rim of the wickerwork from on side to the other place them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf upon which i place the keg and steadi it in a horizont posit about eight inch immedi below these rope and four feet from the bottom of the car i fasten anoth shelfbut made of thin plank be the onli similar piec of wood i had upon thi latter shelf and exactli beneath on of the rim of the keg a small earthern pitcher wa deposit i now bore a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher and fit in a plug of soft wood cut in a taper or conic shape thi plug i push in or pull out as might happen until after a few experi it arriv at that exact degre of tight at which the water ooz from the hole and fall into the pitcher below would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixti minut thi of cours wa a matter briefli and easili ascertain by notic the proport of the pitcher fill in ani given time have arrang all thi the rest of the plan is obviou my bed wa so contriv upon the floor of the car as to bring my head in ly down immedi below the mouth of the pitcher it wa evid that at the expir of an hour the pitcher get full would be forc to run over and to run over at the mouth which wa somewhat lower than the rim it wa also evid that the water thu fall from a height of more than four feet could not do otherwis than fall upon my face and that the sure consequ would be to waken me up instantan even from the soundest slumber in the world it wa fulli eleven by the time i had complet these arrang and i immedi betook myself to bed with full confid in the effici of my invent nor in thi matter wa i disappoint punctual everi sixti minut wa i arous by my trusti chronomet when have empti the pitcher into the bunghol of the keg and perform the duti of the condens i retir again to bed these regular interrupt to my slumber caus me even less discomfort than i had anticip and when i final aros for the dai it wa seven o clock and the sun had attain mani degre abov the line of my horizon april d i found the balloon at an immens height inde and the earth s appar convex increas in a materi degre below me in the ocean lai a cluster of black speck which undoubtedli were island far awai to the northward i perceiv a thin white and exceedingli brilliant line or streak on the edg of the horizon and i had no hesit in suppos it to be the southern disk of the ic of the polar sea my curios wa greatli excit for i had hope of pass on much farther to the north and might possibl at some period find myself place directli abov the pole itself i now lament that my great elev would in thi case prevent my take as accur a survei as i could wish much howev might be ascertain noth els of an extraordinari natur occur dure the dai my apparatu all continu in good order and the balloon still ascend without ani percept vacil the cold wa intens and oblig me to wrap up close in an overcoat when dark came over the earth i betook myself to bed although it wa for mani hour afterward broad daylight all around my immedi situat the waterclock wa punctual in it duti and i slept until next morn soundli with the except of the period interrupt april th aros in good health and spirit and wa astonish at the singular chang which had taken place in the appear of the sea it had lost in a great measur the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn be now of a grayishwhit and of a lustr dazzl to the ey the island were no longer visibl whether thei had pass down the horizon to the southeast or whether my increas elev had left them out of sight it is imposs to sai i wa inclin howev to the latter opinion the rim of ic to the northward wa grow more and more appar cold by no mean so intens noth of import occur and i pass the dai in read have taken care to suppli myself with book april th beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rise while nearli the whole visibl surfac of the earth continu to be involv in dark in time howev the light spread itself over all and i again saw the line of ic to the northward it wa now veri distinct and appear of a much darker hue than the water of the ocean i wa evid approach it and with great rapid fanci i could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward and on also to the westward but could not be certain weather moder noth of ani consequ happen dure the dai went earli to bed april th wa surpris at find the rim of ic at a veri moder distanc and an immens field of the same materi stretch awai off to the horizon in the north it wa evid that if the balloon held it present cours it would soon arriv abov the frozen ocean and i had now littl doubt of ultim see the pole dure the whole of the dai i continu to near the ic toward night the limit of my horizon veri suddenli and materi increas ow undoubtedli to the earth s form be that of an oblat spheroid and my arriv abov the flatten region in the vicin of the arctic circl when dark at length overtook me i went to bed in great anxieti fear to pass over the object of so much curios when i should have no opportun of observ it april th aros earli and to my great joi at length beheld what there could be no hesit in suppos the northern pole itself it wa there beyond a doubt and immedi beneath my feet but ala i had now ascend to so vast a distanc that noth could with accuraci be discern inde to judg from the progress of the number indic my variou altitud respect at differ period between six am on the second of april and twenti minut befor nine am of the same dai at which time the baromet ran down it might be fairli infer that the balloon had now at four o clock in the morn of april the seventh reach a height of not less certainli than mile abov the surfac of the sea thi elev mai appear immens but the estim upon which it is calcul gave a result in all probabl far inferior to the truth at all event i undoubtedli beheld the whole of the earth s major diamet the entir northern hemispher lai beneath me like a chart orthograph project and the great circl of the equat itself form the boundari line of my horizon your excel mai howev readili imagin that the confin region hitherto unexplor within the limit of the arctic circl although situat directli beneath me and therefor seen without ani appear of

deepen into the most absolut and impenetr black farther than thi littl could be ascertain by twelv o clock the circular centr had materi decreas in circumfer and by seven pm i lost sight of it entir the balloon pass over the western limb of the ic and float awai rapidli in the direct of the equat april th found a sensibl diminut in the earth s appar diamet besid a materi alter in it gener color and appear the whole visibl area partook in differ degre of a tint of pale yellow and in some portion had acquir a brillianc even pain to the ey my view downward wa also consider imped by the dens atmospher in the vicin of the surfac be load with cloud between whose mass i could onli now and then obtain a glimps of the earth itself thi difficulti of direct vision had troubl me more or less for the last fortyeight hour but my present enorm elev brought closer togeth as it were the float bodi of vapor and the inconveni becam of cours more and more palpabl in proport to my ascent nevertheless i could easili perceiv that the balloon now hover abov the rang of great lake in the contin of north america and wa hold a cours due south which would bring me to the tropic thi circumst did not fail to give me the most heart satisfact and i hail it as a happi omen of ultim success inde the direct i had hitherto taken had fill me with uneasi for it wa evid that had i continu it much longer there would have been no possibl of my arriv at the moon at all whose orbit is inclin to the eclipt at onli the small angl of degre april th todai the earth s diamet wa greatli diminish and the color of the surfac assum hourli a deeper tint of yellow the balloon kept steadili on her cours to the southward and arriv at nine pm over the northern edg of the mexican gulf april th i wa suddenli arous from slumber about five o clock thi morn by a loud crackl and terrif sound for which i could in no manner account it wa of veri brief durat but while it last resembl noth in the world of which i had ani previou experi it is needless to sai that i becam excess alarm have in the first instanc attribut the nois to the burst of the balloon i examin all my apparatu howev with great attent and could discov noth out of order spent a great part of the dai in medit upon an occurr so extraordinari but could find no mean whatev of account for it went to bed dissatisfi and in a state of great anxieti and agit april th found a startl diminut in the appar diamet of the earth and a consider increas now observ for the first time in that of the moon itself which want onli a few dai of be full it now requir long and excess labor to condens within the chamber suffici atmospher air for the susten of life april th a singular alter took place in regard to the direct of the balloon and although fulli anticip afford me the most unequivoc delight have reach in it former cours about the twentieth parallel of southern latitud it turn off suddenli at an acut angl to the eastward and thu proceed throughout the dai keep nearli if not altogeth in the exact plane of the lunar elips what wa worthi of remark a veri percept vacil in the car wa a consequ of thi chang of routea vacil which prevail in a more or less

actual run up the line of apsid to the point of perigeein other word hold the direct cours which would bring it immedi to the moon in that part of it orbit the nearest to the earth the moon itself wa directli overhead and consequ hidden from my view great and longcontinu labor necessari for the condens of the atmospher april th not even the outlin of contin and sea could now be trace upon the earth with anyth approach distinct about twelv o clock i becam awar for the third time of that appal sound which had so astonish me befor it now howev continu for some moment and gather intens as it continu at length while stupefi and terrorstricken i stood in expect of i knew not what hideou destruct the car vibrat with excess violenc and a gigant and flame mass of some materi which i could not distinguish came with a voic of a thousand thunder roar and boom by the balloon when my fear and astonish had in some degre subsid i had littl difficulti in suppos it to be some mighti volcan fragment eject from that world to which i wa so rapidli approach and in all probabl on of that singular class of substanc occasion pick up on the earth and term meteor stone for want of a better appel april th todai look upward as well as i could through each of the side window altern i beheld to my great delight a veri small portion of the moon s disk protrud as it were on all side beyond the huge circumfer of the balloon my agit wa extrem for i had now littl doubt of soon reach the end of my peril voyag inde the labor now requir by the condens had increas to a most oppress degre and allow me

be rememb that on the thirteenth the earth subtend an angular breadth of twentyf degre on the fourteenth thi had greatli diminish on the fifteenth a still more remark decreas wa observ and on retir on the night of the sixteenth i had notic an angl of no more than about seven degre and fifteen minut what therefor must have been my amaz on awaken from a brief and disturb slumber on the morn of thi

ani adequ idea of the extrem the absolut horror and astonish with which i wa seiz possess and altogeth overwhelm my knee totter beneath memi teeth chatteredmi hair start up on end the balloon then had actual burst these were the first tumultu idea that hurri through my mind the balloon had posit bursti wa fallingfal with the most impetu the most unparallel veloc to judg by the immens distanc alreadi so quickli pass over it could not be more than ten minut at the farthest befor i should meet the surfac of the earth and be hurl into annihil but at length reflect came to my relief i paus i consid and i began to doubt the matter wa imposs i could not in ani reason have so rapidli come down besid although i wa evid approach the surfac below me it wa with a speed by no mean commensur with the veloc i had at first so horribl conceiv thi consider serv to calm the perturb of my mind and i final succeed in regard the phenomenon in it proper point of view in fact amaz must have fairli depriv me of my sens when i could not see the vast differ in appear between the surfac below me and the surfac of my mother earth the latter wa inde over my head and complet hidden by the balloon while the moonth moon itself in all it glorylai beneath me and at my feet the stupor and surpris produc in my mind by thi extraordinari chang in the postur of affair wa perhap after all that part of the adventur least suscept of explan for the boulevers in itself wa not onli natur and inevit but had been long actual anticip as a circumst to be expect whenev i should arriv at that exact point of my voyag where the attract of the planet should be supersed by the attract of the satelliteor more precis where the gravit of the balloon toward the earth should be less power than it gravit toward the moon to be sure i aros from a sound slumber with all my sens in confus to the contempl of a veri startl phenomenon and on which although expect wa not expect at the moment the revolut itself must of cours have taken place in an easi and gradual manner and it is by no mean clear that had i even been awak at the time of the occurr i should have been made awar of it by ani intern evid of an inversionthat is to sai by ani inconveni or disarrang either about my person or about my apparatu it is almost needless to sai that upon come to a due sens of my situat and emerg from the terror which had absorb everi faculti of my soul my attent wa in the first place wholli direct to the contempl of the gener physic appear of the moon it lai beneath me like a chartand although i judg it to be still at no inconsider distanc the indentur of it surfac were defin to my vision with a most strike and altogeth unaccount distinct the entir absenc of ocean or sea and inde of ani lake or river or bodi of water whatsoev struck me at first glanc as the most extraordinari featur in it geolog condit yet strang to sai i beheld vast level region of a charact decidedli alluvi although by far the greater portion of the hemispher in sight wa cover with innumer volcan mountain conic in shape and have more the appear of artifici than of natur protuber the highest among them doe not exce three and threequart mile in perpendicular elev but a map of the volcan district of the campi phlegraei would afford to your excel a better idea of their gener surfac than ani unworthi descript i might think proper to attempt the greater part of them were in a state of evid erupt and gave me fearfulli to understand their furi and their power by the repeat thunder of the miscal meteor stone which now rush upward by the balloon with a frequenc more and more appal april th todai i found an enorm increas in the moon s appar bulkand the evid acceler veloc of my descent began to fill me with alarm it will be rememb that in the earliest stage of my specul upon the possibl of a passag to the moon the exist in it vicin of an atmospher dens in proport to the bulk of the planet had enter larg into my calcul thi too in spite of mani theori to the contrari and it mai be ad in spite of a gener disbelief in the exist of ani lunar atmospher at all but in addit to what i have alreadi urg in regard to enck s comet and the zodiac light i had been strengthen in my opinion by certain observ of mr schroeter of lilienth he observ the moon when two dai and a half old in the even soon after sunset befor the dark part wa visibl and continu to watch it until it becam visibl the two cusp appear taper in a veri sharp faint prolong each exhibit it farthest extrem faintli illumin by the solar rai befor ani part of the dark hemispher wa visibl soon afterward the whole dark limb becam illumin thi prolong of the cusp beyond the semicircl i thought must have arisen from the refract of the sun s rai by the moon s atmospher i comput also the height of the atmospher which could refract light enough into it dark hemispher to produc a twilight more lumin than the light reflect from the earth when the moon is about degre from the new to be pari feet in thi view i suppos the greatest height capabl of refract the solar rai to be feet my idea on thi topic had also receiv confirm by a passag in the eightysecond volum of the philosoph transact in which it is state that at an occult of jupit s satellit the third disappear after have been about or of time indistinct and the fourth becam indiscern near the limb cassini frequent observ saturn jupit and the fix star when approach the moon to occult to have their circular figur chang into an oval on and in other occult he found no alter of figur at all henc it might be suppos that at some time and not at other there is a dens matter encompass the moon wherein the rai of the star ar refract upon the resist or more properli upon the support of an atmospher exist in the state of densiti imagin i had of cours entir depend for the safeti of my ultim descent should i then after all prove to have been mistaken i had in consequ noth better to expect as a final to my adventur than be dash into atom against the rug surfac of the satellit and inde i had now everi reason to be terrifi my distanc from the moon wa compar trifl while the labor requir by the condens wa diminish not at all and i could discov no indic whatev of a decreas rariti in the air april th thi morn to my great joi about nine o clock the surfac of the moon be frightfulli near and my

around the car as might have been expect spasm and violent headach were the immedi consequ of an experi so precipit and full of danger but these and other difficulti attend respir as thei were by no mean so great as to put me in peril of my life i determin to endur as i best could in consider of my leav them behind me moment in my approach to the denser strata near the moon thi approach howev wa still impetu in the extrem and it soon becam alarmingli certain that although i had probabl not been deceiv in the expect of an atmospher dens in proport to the mass of the satellit still i had been wrong in suppos thi densiti even at the surfac at all adequ to the support of the great weight contain in the car of my balloon yet thi should have been the case and in an equal degre as at the surfac of the earth the actual graviti of bodi at either planet suppos in the ratio of the atmospher condens that it wa not the case howev my precipit downfal gave testimoni enough why it wa not so can onli

is in round number mile if we desir to ascertain how near appar a len would bring the satellit or ani distant object we of cours have but to divid the distanc by the magnifi or more strictli by the

or in the ey of the spectat but must be look for in someth an atmospher exist about the moon the goldbug what ho what ho thi fellow is danc mad he hath been bitten by the tarantula all in the wrong mani year ago i contract an intimaci with a mr william legrand he wa of an ancient huguenot famili and had onc been wealthi but a seri of misfortun had reduc him to want to avoid the mortif consequ upon hi disast he left new orlean the citi of hi forefath and took up hi resid at sullivan s island near charleston south carolina thi island is a veri singular on it consist of littl els than the sea sand and is about three mile long it breadth at no point exce a quarter of a mile it is separ from the main land by a scarc percept creek ooz it wai through a wilder of reed and slime a favorit resort of the marsh hen the veget as might be suppos is scant or at least dwarfish no tree of ani magnitud ar to be seen near the western extrem where fort moultri stand and where ar some miser frame build tenant dure summer by the fugit from charleston dust and fever mai be found inde the bristli palmetto but the whole island with the except of thi western point and a line of hard white beach on the

coppic burthen the air with it fragranc in the inmost recess of thi coppic not far from the eastern or more remot end of the island legrand had built himself a small hut which he occupi when i first by mere accid made hi acquaint thi soon ripen into friendshipfor there wa much in the reclus to excit interest and esteem i found him well educ with unusu power of mind but infect with misanthropi and subject to pervers mood of altern enthusiasm and melancholi he had with him mani book but rare emploi them hi chief amus were gun and fish or saunter along the beach and through the myrtl in quest of shell or entomolog specimenshi collect of the latter might have been envi by a swammerdamm in these excurs he wa usual accompani by an old negro call jupit who had been manumit befor the revers of the famili but who could be induc neither by threat nor by promis to abandon what he consid hi right of attend upon the footstep of hi young massa will it is not improb that the rel of legrand conceiv him to be somewhat unsettl in intellect had contriv to instil thi obstinaci into jupit with a view to the supervis and guardianship of the wander the winter in the latitud of sullivan s island ar seldom veri sever and in the fall of the year it is a rare event inde when a fire is consid necessari about the middl of octob there occur howev a dai of remark chilli just befor sunset i scrambl my wai through the evergreen to the hut of my friend whom i had not visit for sever weeksmi resid be at that time in charleston a distanc of nine mile from the island while the facil of passag and repassag were veri far behind those of the present dai upon reach the hut i rap as wa my custom and get no repli sought for the kei where i knew it wa secret unlock the door and went in a fine fire wa blaze upon the hearth it wa a novelti and by no mean an ungrat on i threw off an overcoat took an armchair by the crackl log and await patient the arriv of my host soon after dark thei arriv and gave me a most cordial welcom jupit grin from ear to ear bustl about to prepar some marshhen for supper legrand wa in on of hi fitshow els shall i term themof enthusiasm he had found an unknown bivalv form a new genu and more than thi he had hunt down and secur with jupit s assist a scarab us which he believ to be total new but in respect to which he wish to have my opinion on the morrow and why not tonight i ask rub my hand over the blaze and wish the whole tribe of scarab i at the devil ah if i had onli known you were here said legrand but it s so long sinc i saw you and how could i forese that you would pai me a visit thi veri night of all other as i wa come home i met lieuten g from the fort and veri foolishli i lent him the bug so it will be imposs for you to see it until the morn stai here tonight and i will send jup down for it at sunris it is the loveliest thing in creation whatsunris nonsens noth bug it is of a brilliant gold colorabout the size of a larg hickorynutwith two jet black spot near on extrem of the back and anoth somewhat longer at the other the antenn ar dei aint no tin in him massa will i keep a tellin on you here interrupt jupit de bug is a gool bug solid eberi bit of him insid and all sep him wingneb feel half so hebbi a bug in my life well suppos it is jup repli legrand somewhat more earnestli it seem to me than the case demand is that ani reason for your let the bird burn the color here he turn to me is realli almost enough to warrant jupit s idea you never saw a more brilliant metal lustr than the scale emitbut of thi you cannot judg till tomorrow in the mean time i can give you some idea of the shape sai thi he seat himself at a small tabl on which were a pen and ink but no paper he look for some in a drawer but found none never mind said he at length thi will answer and he drew from hi waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took to be veri dirti foolscap and made upon it a rough draw with the pen while he did thi i retain my seat by the fire for i wa still chilli when the design wa complet he hand it to me without rise as i receiv it a loud growl wa heard succeed by a scratch at the door jupit open it and a larg newfoundland belong to legrand rush in leap upon my shoulder and load me with caress for i had shown him much attent dure previou visit when hi gambol were over i look at the paper and to speak the truth found myself not a littl puzzl at what my friend had depict well i said after contempl it for some minut thi is a strang scarab us i must confess new to me never saw anyth like it beforeunless it wa a skull or a death sheadwhich it more nearli resembl than anyth els that ha come under my observ a death shead echo legrand ohyeswel it ha someth of that appear upon paper no doubt the two upper black spot look like ey eh and the longer on at the bottom like a mouthand then the shape of the whole is oval perhap so said i but legrand i fear you ar no artist i must wait until i see the beetl itself if i am to form ani idea of it person appear well i don t know said he a littl nettl i draw tolerablyshould do it at leasthav had good master and flatter myself that i am not quit a blockhead but my dear fellow you ar joke then said i thi is a veri passabl skullinde i mai sai that it is a veri excel skull accord to the vulgar notion about such specimen of physiologyand your scarab us must be the queerest scarab us in the world if it resembl it why we mai get up a veri thrill bit of superstit upon thi hint i presum you will call the bug scarab us caput homini or someth of that kindther ar mani similar titl in the natur histori but where ar the antenn you spoke of the antenn said legrand who seem to be get unaccount warm upon the subject i am sure you must see the antenn i made them as distinct as thei ar in the origin insect and i presum that is suffici well well i said perhap you havestil i don t see them and i hand him the paper without addit remark not wish to ruffl hi temper but i wa much surpris at the turn affair had taken hi ill humor puzzl meand as for the draw of the beetl there were posit no antenn visibl and the whole did bear a veri close resembl to the ordinari cut of a death shead he receiv the paper veri peevishli and wa about to crumpl it appar to throw it in the fire when a casual glanc at the design seem suddenli to rivet hi attent in an instant hi face grew violent redin anoth as excess pale for some minut he continu to scrutin the draw minut where he sat at length he aros took a candl from the tabl and proceed to seat himself upon a seachest in the farthest corner of the room here again he made an anxiou examin of the paper turn it in all direct he said noth howev and hi conduct greatli astonish me yet i thought it prudent not to exacerb the grow moodi of hi temper by ani comment present he took from hi coat pocket a wallet place the paper carefulli in it and deposit both in a writingdesk which he lock he now grew more compos in hi demeanor but hi origin air of enthusiasm had quit disappear yet he seem not so much sulki as abstract as the even wore awai he becam more and more absorb in reveri from which no salli of mine could arous him it had been my intent to pass the night at the hut as i had frequent done befor but see my host in thi mood i deem it proper to take leav he did not press me to remain but as i depart he shook my hand with even more than hi usual cordial it wa about a month after thi and dure the interv i had seen noth of legrand when i receiv a visit at charleston from hi man jupit i had never seen

length we had conclud our examin and the intens excit of the time had in some measur subsid legrand who saw that i wa dy with impati for a solut of thi most extraordinari riddl enter into a full detail of all the circumst connect with it you rememb said he the night when i hand you the rough sketch i had made of the scarab us you recollect also that i becam quit vex at you for insist that my draw resembl a death shead when you first made thi assert i thought you were jest but afterward i call to mind the peculiar spot on the back of the insect and admit to myself that your remark had some littl foundat in fact still the sneer at my graphic power irrit mefor i am consid a good artistand therefor when you hand me the scrap of parchment i wa about to crumpl it up and throw it angrili into the fire the scrap of paper you mean said i no it had much of the appear of paper and at first i suppos it to be such but when i came to draw upon it i discov it at onc to be a piec of veri thin parchment it wa quit dirti you rememb well as i wa in the veri act of crumpl it up my glanc fell upon the sketch at which you had been look and you mai imagin my astonish when i perceiv in fact the figur of a death shead just where it seem to me i had made the draw of the beetl for a moment i wa too much amaz to think with accuraci i knew that my design wa veri differ in detail from thisalthough there wa a certain similar in gener outlin present i took a candl and seat myself at the other end of the room proceed to scrutin the parchment more close upon turn it over i saw my own sketch upon the revers just as i had made it my first idea now wa mere surpris at the realli remark similar of outlineat the singular coincid involv in the fact that unknown to me there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment immedi beneath my figur of the scarab us and that thi skull not onli in outlin but in size should so close resembl my draw i sai the singular of thi coincid absolut stupifi me for a time thi is the usual effect of such coincid the mind struggl to establish a connexiona sequenc of caus and effectand be unabl to do so suffer a speci of temporari paralysi but when i recov from thi stupor there dawn upon me gradual a convict which startl me even far more than the coincid i began distinctli posit to rememb that there had been no draw upon the parchment when i made my sketch of the scarab us i becam perfectli certain of thi for i recollect turn up first on side and then the other in search of the cleanest spot had the skull been then there of cours i could not have fail to notic it here wa inde a mysteri which i felt it imposs to explain but even at that earli moment there seem to glimmer faintli within the most remot and secret chamber of my intellect a glowwormlik concept of that truth which last night s adventur brought to so magnific a demonstr i aros at onc and put the parchment secur awai dismiss all farther reflect until i should be alon when you had gone and when jupit wa fast asleep i betook myself to a more method investig of the affair in the first place i consid the manner in which the parchment had come into my possess the spot where we discov the scarabaeu wa on the coast of the main land about a mile eastward of the island and but a short distanc abov high water mark upon my take hold of it it gave me a sharp bite which caus me to let it drop jupit with hi accustom caution befor seiz the insect which had flown toward him look about him for a leaf or someth of that natur by which to take hold of it it wa at thi moment that hi ey and mine also fell upon the scrap of parchment which i then suppos to be paper it wa ly half buri in the sand a corner stick up near the spot where we found it i observ the remnant of the hull of what appear to have been a ship s long boat the wreck seem to have been there for a veri great while for the resembl to boat timber could scarc be trace well jupit pick up the parchment wrap the beetl in it and gave it to me soon afterward we turn to go home and on the wai met lieuten g i show him the insect and he beg me to let him take it to the fort upon my consent he thrust it forthwith into hi waistcoat pocket without the parchment in which it had been wrap and which i had continu to hold in my hand dure hi inspect perhap he dread my chang my mind and thought it best to make sure of the prize at oncey know how enthusiast he is on all subject connect with natur histori at the same time without be consciou of it i must have deposit the parchment in my own pocket you rememb that when i went to the tabl for the purpos of make a sketch of the beetl i found no paper where it wa usual kept i look in the drawer and found none there i search my pocket hope to find an old letter when my hand fell upon the parchment i thu detail the precis mode in which it came into my possess for the circumst impress me with peculiar forc no doubt you will think me fancifulbut i had alreadi establish a kind of connexion i had put togeth two link of a great chain there wa a boat ly upon a seacoast and not far from the boat wa a parchmentnot a paperwith a skull depict upon it you will of cours ask where is the connexion i repli that the skull or death shead is the wellknown emblem of the pirat the flag of the death s head is hoist in all engag i have said that the scrap wa parchment and not paper parchment is durablealmost imperish matter of littl moment ar rare consign to parchment sinc for the mere ordinari purpos of draw or write it is not nearli so well adapt as paper thi reflect suggest some meaningsom relevancyin the death shead i did not fail to observ also the form of the parchment although on of it corner had been by some accid destroi it could be seen that the origin form wa oblong it wa just such a slip inde as might have been chosen for a memorandumfor a record of someth to be long rememb and carefulli preserv but i interpos you sai that the skull wa not upon the parchment when you made the draw of the beetl how then do you trace ani connexion between the boat and the skullsinc thi latter accord to your own admiss must have been design god onli know how or by whom at some period subsequ to your sketch the scarab us ah hereupon turn the whole mysteri although the secret at thi point i had compar littl difficulti in solv my step were sure and could afford but a singl result i reason for exampl thu when i drew the scarab us there wa no skull appar upon the parchment when i had complet the draw i gave it to you and observ you narrowli until you return it you therefor did not design the skull and no on els wa present to do it then it wa not done by human agenc and nevertheless it wa done at thi stage of my reflect i endeavor to rememb and did rememb with entir distinct everi incid which occur about the period in question the weather wa chilli oh rare and happi accid and a fire wa blaze upon the hearth i wa heat with exercis and sat near the tabl you howev had drawn a chair close to the chimnei just as i place the parchment in your hand and as you were in the act of inspect it wolf the newfoundland enter and leap upon your shoulder with your left hand you caress him and kept him off while your right hold the parchment wa permit to fall listlessli between your knee and in close proxim to the fire at on moment i thought the blaze had caught it and wa about to caution you but befor i could speak you had withdrawn it and were engag in it examin when i consid all these particular i doubt not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bring to light upon the parchment the skull which i saw design upon it you ar well awar that chemic prepar exist and have exist time out of mind by mean of which it is possibl to write upon either paper or vellum so that the charact shall becom visibl onli when subject to the action of fire zaffr digest in aqua regia and dilut with four time it weight of water is sometim emploi a green tint result the regulu of cobalt dissolv in spirit of nitr give a red these color disappear at longer or shorter interv after the materi written upon cool but again becom appar upon the reapplic of heat i now scrutin the death shead with care it outer edgesth edg of the draw nearest the edg of the vellumwer far more distinct than the other it wa clear that the action of the calor had been imperfect or unequ i immedi kindl a fire and subject everi portion of the parchment to a glow heat at first the onli effect wa the strengthen of the faint line in the skull but upon persev in the experi there becam visibl at the corner of the slip diagon opposit to the spot in which the death shead wa delin the figur of what i at first suppos to be a goat a closer scrutini howev satisfi me that it wa intend for a kid ha ha said i to be sure i have no right to laugh at youa million and a half of monei is too seriou a matter for mirthbut you ar not about to establish a third link in your chainyou will not find ani especi connexion between your pirat and a goatpir you know have noth to do with goat thei appertain to the farm interest but i have just said that the figur wa not that of a goat well a kid thenpretti much the same thing pretti much but not altogeth said legrand you mai have heard of on captain kidd i at onc look upon the figur of the anim as a kind of pun or hieroglyph signatur i sai signatur becaus it posit upon the vellum suggest thi idea the death shead at the corner diagon opposit had in the same manner the air of a stamp or seal but i wa sore put out by the absenc of all elseof the bodi to my imagin instrumentof the text for my context i presum you expect to find a letter between the stamp and the signatur someth of that kind the fact is i felt irresist impress with a presenti of some vast good fortun impend i can scarc sai why perhap after all it wa rather a desir than an actual beliefbut do you know that jupit s silli word about the bug be of solid gold had a remark effect upon my fanci and then the seri of accid and coincidencesthes were so veri extraordinari do you observ how mere an accid it wa that these event should have occur upon the sole dai of all the year in which it ha been or mai be suffici cool for fire and that without the fire or without the intervent of the dog at the precis moment in which he appear i should never have becom awar of the death shead and so never the possessor of the treasur but proceedi am all impati well you have heard of cours the mani stori currentth thousand vagu rumor afloat about monei buri somewher upon the atlant coast by kidd and hi associ these rumor must have had some foundat in fact and that the rumor have exist so long and so continu could have result it appear to me onli from the circumst of the buri treasur still remain entomb had kidd conceal hi plunder for a time and afterward reclaim it the rumor would scarc have reach us in their present unvari form you will observ that the stori told ar all about moneyseek not about moneyfind had the pirat recov hi monei there the affair would have drop it seem to me that some accidentsai the loss of a memorandum indic it localityhad depriv him of the mean of recov it and that thi accid had becom known to hi follow who otherwis might never have heard that treasur had been conceal at all and who busi themselv in vain becaus unguid attempt to regain it had given first birth and then univers currenc to the report which ar now so common have you ever heard of ani import treasur be unearth along the coast never but that kidd s accumul were immens is well known i took it for grant therefor that the earth still held them and you will scarc be surpris when i tell you that i felt a hope nearli amount to certainti that the parchment so strang found involv a lost record of the place of deposit but how did you proce i held the vellum again to the fire after increas the heat but noth appear i now thought it possibl that the coat of dirt might have someth to do with the failur so i carefulli rins the parchment by pour warm water over it and have done thi i place it in a tin pan with the skull downward and put the pan upon a furnac of light charcoal in a few minut the pan have becom thoroughli heat i remov the slip and to my inexpress joi found it spot in sever place with what appear to be figur arrang in line again i place it in the pan and suffer it to remain anoth minut upon take it off the whole wa just as you see it now here legrand have reheat the parchment submit it to my inspect the follow charact were rude trace in a red tint between the death shead and the goat but said i return him the slip i am as much in the dark as ever were all the jewel of golconda await me upon my solut of thi enigma i am quit sure that i should be unabl to earn them and yet said legrand the solut is by no mean so difficult as you might be lead to imagin from the first hasti inspect of the charact these charact as ani on might readili guess form a cipherthat is to sai thei convei a mean but then from what is known of kidd i could not suppos him capabl of construct ani of the more abstrus cryptograph i made up my mind at onc that thi wa of a simpl speciessuch howev as would appear to the crude intellect of the sailor absolut insolubl without the kei and you realli solv it readili i have solv other of an abstrus ten thousand time greater circumst and a certain bia of mind have led me to take interest in such riddl and it mai well be doubt whether human ingenu can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenu mai not by proper applic resolv in fact have onc establish connect and legibl charact i scarc gave a thought to the mere difficulti of develop their import in the present caseinde in all case of secret writingth first question regard the languag of the cipher for the principl of solut so far especi as the more simpl cipher ar concern depend upon and ar vari by the geniu of the particular idiom in gener there is no altern but experi direct by probabl of everi tongu known to him who attempt the solut until the true on be attain but with the cipher now befor us all difficulti wa remov by the signatur the pun upon the word kidd is appreci in no other languag than the english but for thi consider i should have begun my attempt with the spanish and french as the tongu in which a secret of thi kind would most natur have been written by a pirat of the spanish main as it wa i assum the cryptograph to be english you observ there ar no divis between the word had there been divis the task would have been compar easi in such case i should have commenc with a collat and analysi of the shorter word and had a word of a singl letter occur as is most like a or i for exampl i should have consid the solut as assur but there be no divis my first step wa to ascertain the predomin letter as well as the least frequent count all i construct a tabl thu of the charact there ar now in english the letter which most frequent occur is e afterward success run thu a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z e predomin so remark that an individu sentenc of ani length is rare seen in which it is not the prevail charact here then we leav in the veri begin the groundwork for someth more than a mere guess the gener us which mai be made of the tabl is obviousbut in thi particular cipher we shall onli veri partial requir it aid as our predomin charact is we will commenc by assum it as the e of the natur alphabet to verifi the supposit let us observ if the be seen often in couplesfor e is doubl with great frequenc in englishin such word for exampl as meet fleet speed seen been agre c in the present instanc we see it doubl no less than five time although the cryptograph is brief let us assum then as e now of all word in the languag the is most usual let us see therefor whether there ar not repetit of ani three charact in the same order of colloc the last of them be if we discov repetit of such letter so arrang thei will most probabl repres the word the upon inspect we find no less than seven such arrang the charact be we mai therefor assum that repres t repres h and repres eth last be now well confirm thu a great step ha been taken but have establish a singl word we ar enabl to establish a vastli import point that is to sai sever commenc and termin of other word let us refer for exampl to the last instanc but on in which the combin occursnot far from the end of the cipher we know that the immedi ensu is the commenc of a word and of the six charact succeed thi the we ar cogniz of no less than five let us set these charact down thu by the letter we know them to repres leav a space for the unknown t eeth here we ar enabl at onc to discard the th as form no portion of the word commenc with the first t sinc by experi of the entir alphabet for a letter adapt to the vacanc we perceiv that no word can be form of which thi th can be a part we ar thu narrow into t ee and go through the alphabet if necessari as befor we arriv at the word tree as the sole possibl read we thu gain anoth letter r repres by with the word the tree in juxtaposit look beyond these word for a short distanc we again see the combin and emploi it by wai of termin to what immedi preced we have thu thi arrang the tree the or substitut the natur letter where known it read thu the tree thr h the now if in place of the unknown charact we leav blank space or substitut dot we read thu the tree thrh the when the word through make itself evid at onc but thi discoveri give us three new letter o u and g repres by and look now narrowli through the cipher for combin of known charact we find not veri far from the begin thi arrang or egre which plainli is the conclus of the word degre and give us anoth letter d repres by four letter beyond the word degre we perceiv the combin translat the known charact and repres the unknown by dot as befor we read thu th rtee an arrang immedi suggest of the word thirteen and again furnish us with two new charact i and n repres by and refer now to the begin of the cryptograph we find the combin translat as befor we obtain good which assur us that the first letter is a and that the first two word ar a good it is now time that we arrang our kei as far as discov in a tabular form to avoid confus it will stand thu repres a d e g h i n o r t we have therefor no less than ten of the most import letter repres and it will be unnecessari to proce with the detail of the solut i have said enough to convinc you that cipher of thi natur ar readili solubl and to give you some insight into the rational of their develop but be assur that the specimen befor us appertain to the veri simplest speci of cryptograph it now onli remain to give you the full translat of the charact upon the parchment as unriddl here it is a good glass in the bishop s hostel in the devil s seat fortyon degre and thirteen minut northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left ey of the death shead a bee line from the tree through the shot fifti feet out but said i the enigma seem still in as bad a condit as ever how is it possibl to extort a mean from all thi jargon about devil s seat death s head and bishop s hotel i confess repli legrand that the matter still wear a seriou aspect when regard with a casual glanc my first endeavor wa to divid the sentenc into the natur divis intend by the cryptographist you mean to punctuat it someth of that kind but how wa it possibl to effect thi i reflect that it had been a point with the writer to run hi word togeth without divis so as to increas the difficulti of solut now a not overacut man in pursu such an object would be nearli certain to overdo the matter when in the cours of hi composit he arriv at a break in hi subject which would natur requir a paus or a point he would be exceedingli apt to run hi charact at thi place more than usual close togeth if you will observ the ms in the present instanc you will easili detect five such case of unusu crowd act upon thi hint i made the divis thu a good glass in the bishop s hostel in the devil s seatfortyon degre and thirteen minutesnortheast and by northmain branch seventh limb east sideshoot from the left ey of the death sheada beelin from the tree through the shot fifti feet out even thi divis said i leav me still in the dark it left me also in the dark repli legrand for a few dai dure which i made dilig inquiri in the neighborhood of sullivan s island for ani build which went by the name of the bishop s hotel for of cours i drop the obsolet word hostel gain no inform on the subject i wa on the point of extend my sphere of search and proceed in a more systemat manner when on morn it enter into my head quit suddenli that thi bishop s hostel might have some refer to an old famili of the name of bessop which time out of mind had held possess of an ancient manorhous about four mile to the northward of the island i accordingli went over to the plantat and reinstitut my inquiri among the older negro of the place at length on of the most ag of the women said that she had heard of such a place as bessop s castl and thought that she could guid me to it but that it wa not a castl nor a tavern but a high rock i offer to pai her well for her troubl and after some demur she consent to accompani me to the spot we found it without much difficulti when dismiss her i proceed to examin the place the castl consist of an irregular assemblag of cliff and rockson of the latter be quit remark for it height as well as for it insul and artifici appear i clamber to it apex and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done while i wa busi in reflect my ey fell upon a narrow ledg in the eastern face of the rock perhap a yard below the summit upon which i stood thi ledg project about eighteen inch and wa not more than a foot wide while a nich in the cliff just abov it gave it a rude resembl to on of the hollowback chair us by our ancestor i made no doubt that here wa the devil s seat allud to in the ms and now i seem to grasp the full secret of the riddl the good glass i knew could have refer to noth but a telescop for the word glass is rare emploi in ani other sens by seamen now here i at onc saw wa a telescop to be us and a definit point of view admit no variat from which to us it nor did i hesit to believ that the phrase fortyon degre and thirteen minut and northeast and by north were intend as direct for the level of the glass greatli excit by these discoveri i hurri home procur a telescop and return to the rock i let myself down to the ledg and found that it wa imposs to retain a seat upon it except in on particular posit thi fact confirm my preconceiv idea i proceed to us the glass of cours the fortyon degre and thirteen minut could allud to noth but elev abov the visibl horizon sinc the horizont direct wa clearli indic by the word northeast and by north thi latter direct i at onc establish by mean of a pocketcompass then point the glass as nearli at an angl of fortyon degre of elev as i could do it by guess i move it cautious up or down until my attent wa arrest by a circular rift or open in the foliag of a larg tree that overtop it fellow in the distanc in the centr of thi rift i perceiv a white spot but could not at first distinguish what it wa adjust the focu of the telescop i again look and now made it out to be a human skull upon thi discoveri i wa so sanguin as to consid the enigma solv for the phrase main branch seventh limb east side could refer onli to the posit of the skull upon the tree while shoot from the left ey of the death s head admit also of but on interpret in regard to a search for buri treasur i perceiv that the design wa to drop a bullet from the left ey of the skull and that a beelin or in other word a straight line drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through the shot or the spot where the bullet fell and thenc extend to a distanc of fifti feet would indic a definit pointand beneath thi point i thought it at least possibl that a deposit of valu lai conceal all thi i said is exceedingli clear and although ingeni still simpl and explicit when you left the bishop s hotel what then why have carefulli taken the bear of the tree i turn homeward the instant that i left the devil s seat howev the circular rift vanish nor could i get a glimps of it afterward turn as i would what seem to me the chief ingenu in thi whole busi is the fact for repeat experi ha convinc me it is a fact that the circular open in question is visibl from no other attain point of view than that afford by the narrow ledg upon the face of the rock in thi expedit to the bishop s hotel i had been attend by jupit who had no doubt observ for some week past the abstract of my demeanor and took especi care not to leav me alon but on the next dai get up veri earli i contriv to give him the slip and went into the hill in search of the tree after much toil i found it when i came home at night my valet propos to give me a flog with the rest of the adventur i believ you ar as well acquaint as myself i suppos said i you miss the spot in the first attempt at dig through jupit s stupid in let the bug fall through the right instead of through the left ey of the skull precis thi mistak made a differ of about two inch and a half in the shot that is to sai in the posit of the peg nearest the tree and had the treasur been beneath the shot the error would have been of littl moment but the shot togeth with the nearest point of the tree were mere two point for the establish of a line of direct of cours the error howev trivial in the begin increas as we proceed with the line and by the time we had gone fifti feet threw us quit off the scent but for my deepseat impress that treasur wa here somewher actual buri we might have had all our labor in vain but your grandiloqu and your conduct in swing the beetlehow excess odd i wa sure you were mad and why did you insist upon let fall the bug instead of a bullet from the skull why to be frank i felt somewhat annoi by your evid suspicion touch my saniti and so resolv to punish you quietli in my own wai by a littl bit of sober mystif for thi reason i swung the beetl and for thi reason i let it fall it from the tree an observ of your about it

we took our departur on our wai home my companion step in for a moment at the offic of on of the daili paper i have said that the whim of my friend were manifold and that je le m nageaisfor thi phrase

gazett he repli ha not enter i fear into the unusu horror of the thing but dismiss the idl opinion of thi print it appear to me that thi mysteri is consid insolubl for the veri reason which should caus it to be regard as easi of solutioni mean for the outr charact of it featur the polic ar confound by the seem absenc of motivenot for the murder itselfbut for the atroc of the murder thei ar puzzl too by the seem imposs of reconcil the voic heard in content with the fact that no on wa discov up stair but the assassin mademoisel l espanay and that there were no mean of egress without the notic of the parti ascend the wild disord of the room the corps thrust with the head downward up the chimnei the fright mutil of the bodi of the old ladi these consider with those just mention and other which i need not mention have suffic to paralyz the power by put complet at fault the boast acumen of the govern agent thei have fallen into the gross but common error of confound the unusu with the abstrus but it is by these deviat from the plane of the ordinari that reason feel it wai if at all in it search for the true in investig such as we ar now pursu it should not be so much ask what ha occur as what ha occur that ha never occur befor in fact the facil with which i shall arriv or have arriv at the solut of thi mysteri is in the direct ratio of it appar insolubl in the ey of the

at such time hi discours wa address to myself but hi voic although by no mean loud had that inton which is commonli emploi in speak to some on at a great distanc hi ey vacant in express regard onli the wall that the voic heard in content he said by the parti upon the stair were not the voic of the women themselv wa fulli prove by the evid thi reliev us of all doubt upon the question whether the old ladi could have first destroi the daughter and afterward have commit suicid i speak of thi point chiefli for the sake of method for the strength of madam l espanay would have been utterli unequ to the task of thrust her daughter s corps up the chimnei as it wa found and the natur of the wound upon her own person entir preclud the idea of selfdestruct murder then ha been commit by some third parti and the voic of thi third parti were those heard in content let me now advertnot to the whole testimoni respect these voicesbut to what wa peculiar in that testimoni did you observ ani thing peculiar about it i remark that while all the wit agre in suppos the gruff voic to be that of a frenchman there wa much disagr in regard to the shrill or as on individu term it the harsh voic that wa the evid itself said dupin but it wa not the peculiar of the evid you have observ noth distinct yet there wa someth to be observ the wit as you remark agre about the gruff voic thei were here unanim but in regard to the shrill voic the peculiar isnot that thei disagreedbut that while an italian an englishman a spaniard a holland and a frenchman attempt to describ it each on spoke of it as that of a foreign each is sure that it wa not the voic of on of hi own countrymen each liken itnot to the voic of an individu of ani nation with whose languag he is conversantbut the convers the frenchman suppos it the voic of a spaniard and might have distinguish some word had he been acquaint with the spanish the dutchman maintain it to have been that of a frenchman but we find it state that not understand french thi wit wa examin through an interpret the englishman think it the voic of a german and doe not understand german the spaniard is sure that it wa that of an englishman but judg by the inton altogeth as he ha no knowledg of the english the italian believ it the voic of a russian but ha never convers with a nativ of russia a second frenchman differ moreov with the first and is posit that the voic wa that of an italian but not be cogniz of that tongu is like the spaniard convinc by the inton now how strang unusu must that voic have realli been about which such testimoni as thi could have been elicitedin whose tone even denizen of the five great divis of europ could recognis noth familiar you will sai that it might have been the voic of an asiaticof an african neither asiat nor african abound in pari but without deni the infer i will now mere call your attent to three point the voic is term by on wit harsh rather than shrill it is repres by two other to have been quick and unequ no wordsno sound resembl wordswer by ani wit mention as distinguish i know not continu dupin what impress i mai have made so far upon your own understand but i do not hesit to sai that legitim deduct even from thi portion of the testimonyth portion respect the gruff and shrill voicesar in themselv suffici to engend a suspicion which should give direct to all farther progress in the investig of the mysteri i said legitim deduct but my mean is not thu fulli express i design to impli that the deduct ar the sole proper on and that the suspicion aris inevit from them as the singl result what the suspicion is howev i will not sai just yet i mere wish you to bear in mind that with myself it wa suffici forcibl to give a definit forma certain tendencyto my inquiri in the chamber let us now transport ourselv in fanci to thi chamber what shall we first seek here the mean of egress emploi by the murder it is not too much to sai that neither of us believ in pr ternatur event madam and mademoisel l espanay were not destroi by spirit the doer of the deed were materi and escap materi then how fortun there is but on mode of reason upon the point and that mode must lead us to a definit decisionlet us examin each by each the possibl mean of egress it is clear that the assassin were in the room where mademoisel l espanay wa found or at least in the room adjoin when the parti ascend the stair it is then onli from these two apart that we have to seek issu the polic have laid bare the floor the ceil and the masonri of the wall in everi direct no secret issu could have escap their vigil but not trust to their ey i examin with my own there were then no secret issu both door lead from the room into the passag were secur lock with the kei insid let us turn to the chimnei these although of ordinari width for some eight or ten feet abov the hearth will not admit throughout their extent the bodi of a larg cat the imposs of egress by mean alreadi state be thu absolut we ar reduc to the window through those of the front room no on could have escap without notic from the crowd in the street the murder must have pass then through those of the back room now brought to thi conclus in so unequivoc a manner as we ar it is not our part as reason to reject it on account of appar imposs it is onli left for us to prove that these appar imposs ar in realiti not such there ar two window in the chamber on of them is unobstruct by furnitur and is wholli visibl the lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldi bedstead which is thrust close up against it the former wa found secur fasten from within it resist the utmost forc of those who endeavor to rais it a larg gimlethol had been pierc in it frame to the left and a veri stout nail wa found fit therein nearli to the head upon examin the other window a similar nail wa seen similarli fit in it and a vigor attempt to rais thi sash fail also the polic were now entir satisfi that egress had not been in these direct and therefor it wa thought a matter of supererog to withdraw the nail and open the window my own examin wa somewhat more particular and wa so for the reason i have just givenbecaus here it wa i knew that all appar imposs must be prove to be not such in realiti i proceed to think thusa posteriori the murder did escap from on of these window thi be so thei could not have refasten the sash from the insid as thei were found fastenedth consider which put a stop through it obvious to the scrutini of the polic in thi quarter yet the sash were fasten thei must then have the power of fasten themselv there wa no escap from thi conclus i step to the unobstruct casement withdrew the nail with some difficulti and attempt to rais the sash it resist all my effort as i had anticip a conceal spring must i now know exist and thi corrobor of my idea convinc me that my premis at least were correct howev mysteri still appear the circumst attend the nail a care search soon brought to light the hidden spring i press it and satisfi with the discoveri forbor to uprais the sash i now replac the nail and regard it attent a person pass out through thi window might have reclos it and the spring would have caughtbut the nail could not have been replac the conclus wa plain and again narrow in the field of my investig the assassin must have escap through the other window suppos then the spring upon each sash to be the same as wa probabl there must be found a differ between the nail or at least between the mode of their fixtur get upon the sack of the bedstead i look over the headboard minut at the second casement pass my hand down behind the board i readili discov and press the spring which wa as i had suppos ident in charact with it neighbor i now look at the nail it wa as stout as the other and appar fit in the same mannerdriven in nearli up to the head you will sai that i wa puzzl but if you think so you must have misunderstood the natur of the induct to us a sport phrase i had not been onc at fault the scent had never for an instant been lost there wa no flaw in ani link of the chain i had trace the secret to it ultim resultand that result wa the nail it had i sai in everi respect the appear of it fellow in the other window but thi fact wa an absolut nulliti conclus us it might seem to be when compar with the consider that here at thi point termin the clew there must be someth wrong i said about the nail i touch it and the head with about a quarter of an inch of the shank came off in my finger the rest of the shank wa in the gimlethol where it had been broken off the fractur wa an old on for it edg were incrust with rust and had appar been accomplish by the blow of a hammer which had partial imbed in the top of the bottom sash the head portion of the nail i now carefulli replac thi head portion in the indent whenc i had taken it and the resembl to a perfect nail wa completeth fissur wa invis press the spring i gentli rais the sash for a few inch the head went up with it remain firm in it bed i close the window and the semblanc of the whole nail wa again perfect the riddl so far wa now unriddl the assassin had escap through the window which look upon the bed drop of it own accord upon hi exit or perhap purpos close it had becom fasten by the spring and it wa the retent of thi spring which had been mistaken by the polic for that of the nailfarth inquiri be thu consid unnecessari the next question is that of the mode of descent upon thi point i had been satisfi in my walk with you around the build about five feet and a half from the casement in question there run a lightningrod from thi rod it would have been imposs for ani on to reach the window itself to sai noth of enter it i observ howev that the shutter of the fourth stori were of the peculiar kind call by parisian carpent ferradesa kind rare emploi at the present dai but frequent seen upon veri old mansion at lyon and bordeaux thei ar in the form of an ordinari door a singl not a fold door except that the lower half is lattic or work in open trellisthu afford an excel hold for the hand in the present instanc these shutter ar fulli three feet and a half broad when we saw them from the rear of the hous thei were both about half openthat is to sai thei stood off at right angl from the wall it is probabl that the polic as well as myself examin the back of the tenement but if so in look at these ferrad in the line of their breadth as thei must have done thei did not perceiv thi great breadth itself or at all event fail to take it into due consider in fact have onc satisfi themselv that no egress could have been made in thi quarter thei would natur bestow here a veri cursori examin it wa clear to me howev that the shutter belong to the window at the head of the bed would if swung fulli back to the wall reach to within two feet of the lightningrod it wa also evid that by exert of a veri unusu degre of activ and courag an entranc into the window from the rod might have been thu effectedbi reach to the distanc of two feet and a half we now suppos the shutter open to it whole extent a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trelliswork let go then hi hold upon the rod place hi feet secur against the wall and spring boldli from it he might have swung the shutter so as to close it and if we imagin the window open at the time might even have swung himself into the room i wish you to bear especi in mind that i have spoken of a veri unusu degre of activ as requisit to success in so hazard and so difficult a feat it is my design to show you first that the thing might possibl have been accomplishedbut secondli and chiefli i wish to impress upon your understand the veri extraordinaryth almost pr ternatur charact of that agil which could have accomplish it you will sai no doubt us the languag of the law that to make out my case i should rather undervalu than insist upon a full estim of the activ requir in thi matter thi mai be the practic in law but it is not the usag of reason my ultim object is onli the truth my immedi purpos is to lead you to place in juxtaposit that veri unusu activ of which i have just spoken with that veri peculiar shrill or harsh and unequ voic about whose nation no two person could be found to agre and in whose utter no syllabif could be detect at these word a vagu and halfform concept of the mean of dupin flit over my mind i seem to be upon the verg of comprehens without power to comprehendmen at time find themselv upon the brink of remembr without be abl in the end to rememb my friend went on with hi discours you will see he said that i have shift the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress it wa my design to convei the idea that both were effect in the same manner at the same point let us now revert to the interior of the room let us survei the appear here the drawer of the bureau it is said had been rifl although mani articl of apparel still remain within them the conclus here is absurd it is a mere guessa veri silli oneand no more how ar we to know that the articl found in the drawer were not all these drawer had origin contain madam l

these ladi if a thief had taken ani why did he not take the bestwhi did he not take all in a word why did he abandon four thousand franc in gold to encumb himself with a bundl of linen the gold wa abandon nearli the whole sum mention by monsieur mignaud the banker wa discov in bag upon the floor i wish you therefor to discard from your thought the blunder idea of motiv engend in the brain of the polic by that portion of the evid which speak of monei deliv at the door of the hous coincid ten time as remark as thi the deliveri of the monei and murder commit within three dai upon the parti receiv it happen to all of us everi hour of our live without attract even momentari notic coincid in gener ar great stumblingblock in the wai of that class of thinker who have been educ to know noth

deliveri three dai befor would have form someth more than a coincid it would have been corrobor of thi idea of motiv but under the real circumst of the case if we ar to suppos gold the motiv of thi outrag we must also imagin the perpetr so vacil an idiot as to have abandon hi gold and hi motiv togeth keep now steadili in mind the point to which i have drawn your attentionthat peculiar voic that unusu agil and that startl absenc of motiv in a murder so singularli atroci as thislet us glanc at the butcheri itself here is a woman strangl to death by manual strength and thrust up a chimnei head downward ordinari assassin emploi no such mode of murder as thi least of all do thei thu dispos of the murder in the manner of thrust the corps up the chimnei you will admit that there wa someth excess outr someth altogeth irreconcil with our common notion of human action even when we suppos the actor the most deprav of men think too how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the bodi up such an apertur so forcibl that the unit vigor of sever person wa found bare suffici to drag it down turn now to other indic of the employ of a vigor most marvel on the hearth were

for the same reason that the breadth of the shutter escap thembecaus by the affair of the nail their percept had been hermet seal against the possibl of the window have ever been open at all if now in addit to all these thing you have properli reflect upon the odd disord of the chamber we have gone so far as to combin the idea of an agil astound a strength superhuman a feroc brutal a butcheri without motiv a grotesqueri in horror absolut alien from human and a voic foreign in tone to the ear of men of mani nation and devoid of all distinct or intellig syllabif what result then ha ensu what

cylindr here is a billet of wood the circumfer of which is about that of the throat wrap the draw around it and try the experi again i did so but the difficulti wa even more obviou than befor thi i said is the mark of no human hand read now repli dupin thi passag from cuvier it wa a minut anatom and gener descript account of the larg fulvou ourangoutang of the east indian island the gigant

scarc of suffici depth to be appreci by my own intellect and sinc i could not pretend to make them intellig to the understand of anoth we will call them guess then and speak of them as such if the

peculiar to the maltes i pick the ribbon up at the foot of the lightningrod it could not have belong to either of the deceas now if after all i am wrong in my induct from thi ribbon that the frenchman wa a sailor belong to a maltes vessel still i can have done no harm in sai what i did in the advertis if i am in error he will mere suppos that i have been misl by some circumst into which he will not

thousand contradictori rumor were circul and journalist busi themselv in suggest among these the on which attract the most notic wa the idea that mari rog t still livedthat the corps found in the sein wa that of some other unfortun it will be proper that i submit to the reader some passag which embodi the suggest allud to these passag ar liter translat from l etoil a paper conduct in gener with much abil mademoisel rog t left her mother s hous on sundai morn june the twentysecond with the ostens purpos of go to see her aunt or some other connexion in the rue de dr me from that hour nobodi is prove to have seen her there is no trace or tide of her at all there ha no person whatev come forward so far who saw her at all on that dai after she left her mother s door now though we have no evid that mari rog t wa in the land of the live after nine o clock on sundai june the twentysecond we have proof that up to that hour she wa aliv on wednesdai noon at twelv a femal bodi wa discov afloat on the shore of the barri re de roul thi wa even if we presum that mari rog t wa thrown into the river within three hour after she left her mother s hous onli three dai from the time she left her homethre dai to an hour but it is folli to suppos that the murder if murder wa commit on her bodi could have been consumm soon enough to have enabl her murder to throw the bodi into the river befor midnight those who ar guilti of such horrid crime choos dark rather the light thu we see that if the bodi found in the river wa that of mari rog t it could onli have been in the water two and a half dai or three at the outsid all experi ha shown that drown bodi or bodi thrown into the water immedi after death by violenc requir from six to ten dai for decomposit to take place to bring them to the top of the water even where a cannon is fire over a corps and it rise befor at least five or six dai immers it sink again if let alon now we ask what wa there in thi case to caus a departur from the ordinari cours of natur if the bodi had been kept in it mangl state on shore until tuesdai night some trace would be found on shore of the murder it is a doubt point also whether the bodi would be so soon afloat even were it thrown in after have been dead two dai and furthermor it is exceedingli improb that ani villain who had commit such a murder as is here suppos would have thrown the bodi in without weight to sink it when such a precaut could have so easili been taken the editor here proce to argu that the bodi must have been in the water not three dai mere but at least five time three dai becaus it wa so far decompos that beauvai had great difficulti in recogn it thi latter point howev wa fulli disprov i continu the translat what then ar the fact on which m beauvai sai that he ha no doubt the bodi wa that of mari rog t he rip up the gown sleev and sai he found mark which satisfi him of the ident the public gener suppos those mark to have consist of some descript of scar he rub the arm and found hair upon itsometh as indefinit we think as can readili be imagineda littl conclus as find an arm in the sleev m beauvai did not return that night but sent word to madam rog t at seven o clock on wednesdai even that an investig wa still in progress respect her daughter if we allow that madam rog t from her ag and grief could not go over which is allow a great deal there certainli must have been some on who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investig if thei thought the bodi wa that of mari nobodi went over there wa noth said or heard about the matter in the rue pav e st andr e that reach even the occup of the same build m st eustach the lover and intend husband of mari who board in her mother s hous depos that he did not hear of the discoveri of the bodi of hi intend until the next morn when m beauvai came into hi chamber and told him of it for an item of new like thi it strike us it wa veri coolli receiv in thi wai the journal endeavor to creat the impress of an apathi on the part of the rel of mari inconsist with the supposit that these rel believ the corps to be her it insinu amount to thisthat mari with the conniv of her friend had absent herself from the citi for reason involv a charg against her chastiti and that these friend upon the discoveri of a corps in the sein somewhat resembl that of the girl had avail themselv of the opportun to impress the public with the belief of her death but l etoil wa again overhasti it wa distinctli prove that no apathi such as wa imagin exist that the old ladi wa exceedingli feebl and so agit as to be unabl to attend to ani duti that st eustach so far from receiv the new coolli wa distract with grief and bore himself so frantic that m beauvai prevail upon a friend and rel to take charg of him and prevent hi attend the examin at the disinter moreov although it wa state by l etoil that the corps wa reinter at the public expensethat an advantag offer of privat sculptur wa absolut declin by the familyand that no member of the famili attend the ceremonialalthough i sai all thi wa assert by l etoil in further of the impress it design to conveyyet all thi wa satisfactorili disprov in a subsequ number of the paper an attempt wa made to throw suspicion upon beauvai himself the editor sai now then a chang come over the matter we ar told that on on occas while a madam b wa at madam rog t s hous m beauvai who wa go out told her that a gendarm wa expect there and she madam b must not sai anyth to the gendarm until he return but let the matter be for him in the present postur of affair m beauvai appear to have the whole matter lock up in hi head a singl step cannot be taken without m beauvai for go which wai you will you run against him for some reason he determin that nobodi shall have ani thing to do with the proceed but himself and he ha elbow the male rel out of the wai accord to their represent in a veri singular manner he seem to have been veri much avers to permit the rel to see the bodi by the follow fact some color wa given to the suspicion thu thrown upon beauvai a visit at hi offic a few dai prior to the girl s disappear and dure the absenc of it occup had observ a rose in the keyhol of the door and the name mari inscrib upon a slate which hung near at hand the gener impress so far as we were enabl to glean it from the newspap seem to be that mari had been the victim of a gang of desperadoesthat by these she had been born across the river maltreat and murder le commerciel howev a print of extens influenc wa earnest in combat thi popular idea i quot a passag or two from it column we ar persuad that pursuit ha hitherto been on a fals scent so far as it ha been direct to the barri re du roul it is imposs that a person so well known to thousand as thi young woman wa should have pass three block without some on have seen her and ani on who saw her would have rememb it for she interest all who knew her it wa when the street were full of peopl when she went out it is imposs that she could have gone to the barri re du roul or to the rue de dr me without be recogn by a dozen person yet no on ha come forward who saw her outsid of her mother s door and there is no evid except the testimoni concern her express intent that she did go out at all her gown wa torn bound round her and ti and by that the bodi wa carri as a bundl if the murder had been commit at the barri re du roul there would have been no necess for ani such arrang the fact that the bodi wa found float near the barri re is no proof as to where it wa thrown into the water a piec of on of the unfortun girl s petticoat two feet long and on foot wide wa torn out and ti under her chin around the back of her head probabl to prevent scream thi wa done by fellow who had no pockethandkerchief a dai or two befor the prefect call upon us howev some import inform reach the polic which seem to overthrow at least the chief portion of le commerciel s argument two small boi son of a madam deluc while roam among the wood near the barri re du roul chanc to penetr a close thicket within which were three or four larg stone form a kind of seat with a back and footstool on the upper stone lai a white petticoat on the second a silk scarf a parasol glove and a pockethandkerchief were also here found the handkerchief bore the name mari rog t fragment of dress were discov on the brambl around the earth wa trampl the bush were broken and there wa everi evid of a struggl between the thicket and the river the fenc were found taken down and the ground bore evid of some heavi burthen have been drag along it a weekli paper le soleil had the follow comment upon thi discoverycom which mere echo the sentiment of the whole parisian press the thing had all evid been there at least three or four week thei were all mildew down hard with the action of the rain and stuck togeth from mildew the grass had grown around and over some of them the silk on the parasol wa strong but the thread of it were run togeth within the upper part where it had been doubl and fold wa all mildew and rotten and tore on it be open the piec of her frock torn out by the bush were about three inch wide and six inch long on part wa the hem of the frock and it had been mend the other piec wa part of the skirt not the hem thei look like strip torn off and were on the thorn bush about a foot from the ground there can be no doubt therefor that the spot of thi appal outrag ha been discov consequ upon thi discoveri new evid appear madam deluc testifi that she keep a roadsid inn not far from the bank of the river opposit the barri re du roul the neighborhood is secludedparticularli so it is the usual sundai resort of blackguard from the citi who cross the river in boat about three o clock in the afternoon of the sundai in question a young girl arriv at the inn accompani by a young man of dark complexion the two remain here for some time on their departur thei took the road to some thick wood in the vicin madam deluc s attent wa call to the dress worn by the girl on account of it resembl to on worn by a deceas rel a scarf wa particularli notic soon after the departur of the coupl a gang of miscreant made their appear behav boister at and drank without make payment follow in the rout of the young man and girl return to the inn about dusk and recross the river as if in great hast it wa soon after dark upon thi same even that madam deluc as well as her eldest son heard the scream of a femal in the vicin of the inn the scream were violent but brief madam d recogn not onli the scarf which wa found in the thicket but the dress which wa discov upon the corps an omnibu driver valenc now also testifi that he saw mari rog t cross a ferri on the sein on the sundai in question in compani with a young man of dark complexion he valenc knew mari and could not be mistaken in her ident the articl found in the thicket were fulli identifi by the rel of mari the item of evid and inform thu collect by myself from the newspap at the suggest of dupin embrac onli on more pointbut thi wa a point of seemingli vast consequ it appear that immedi after the discoveri of the cloth as abov describ the lifeless or nearli lifeless bodi of st eustach mari s betroth wa found in the vicin of what all now suppos the scene of the outrag a phial label laudanum and empti wa found near him hi breath gave evid of the poison he di without speak upon hi person wa found a letter briefli state hi love for mari with hi design of selfdestruct i need scarc tell you said dupin as he finish the perus of my note that thi is a far more intric case than that of the rue morgu from which it differ in on import respect thi is an ordinari although an atroci instanc of crime there is noth peculiarli outr about it you will observ that for thi reason the mysteri ha been consid easi when for thi reason it should have been consid difficult of solut thu at first it wa thought unnecessari to offer a reward the myrmidon of g were abl at onc to comprehend how and why such an atroc might have been commit thei could pictur to their imagin a modemani modesand a motivemani motiv and becaus it wa not imposs that either of these numer mode and motiv could have been the actual on thei have taken it for grant that on of them must but the case with which these variabl fanci were entertain and the veri plausibl which each assum should have been understood as indic rather of the difficulti than of the facil which must attend elucid i have befor observ that it is by promin abov the plane of the ordinari that reason feel her wai if at all in her search for the true and that the proper question in case such as thi is not so much what ha occur as what ha occur that ha never occur befor in the investig at the hous of madam l espanay the agent of g were discourag and confound by that veri unusu which to a properli regul intellect would have afford the surest omen of success while thi same intellect might have been plung in despair at the ordinari charact of all that met the ey in the case of the perfumerygirl and yet told of noth but easi triumph to the functionari of the prefectur in the case of madam l espanay and her daughter there wa even at the begin of our investig no doubt that murder had been commit the idea of suicid wa exclud at onc here too we ar freed at the commenc from all supposit of selfmurd the bodi found at the barri re du roul wa found under such circumst as to leav us no room for embarrass upon thi import point but it ha been suggest that the corps discov is not that of the mari rog t for the convict of whose assassin or assassin the reward is offer and respect whom sole our agreement ha been arrang with the prefect we both know thi gentleman well it will not do to trust him too far if date our inquiri from the bodi found and thenc trace a murder we yet discov thi bodi to be that of some other individu than mari or if start from the live mari we find her yet find her unassassinatedin either case we lose our labor sinc it is monsieur g with whom we have to deal for our own purpos therefor if not for the purpos of justic it is indispens that our first step should be the determin of the ident of the corps with the mari rog t who is miss with the public the argument of l etoil have had weight and that the journal itself is convinc of their import would appear from the manner in which it commenc on of it essai upon the subject sever of the morn paper of the dai it sai speak of the conclus articl in mondai s etoil to me thi articl appear conclus of littl beyond the zeal of it indit we should bear in mind that in gener it is the object of our newspap rather to creat a sensationto make a pointthan to further the caus of truth the latter end is onli pursu when it seem coincid with the former the print which mere fall in with ordinari opinion howev well found thi opinion mai be earn for itself no credit with the mob the mass of the peopl regard as profound onli him who suggest pungent contradict of the gener idea in ratiocin not less than in literatur it is the epigram which is the most immedi and the most univers appreci in both it is of the lowest order of merit what i mean to sai is that it is the mingl epigram and melodram of the idea that mari rog t still live rather than ani true plausibl in thi idea which have suggest it to l etoil and secur it a favor recept with the public let us examin the head of thi journal s argument endeavor to avoid the incoher with which it is origin set forth the first aim of the writer is to show from the breviti of the interv between mari s disappear and the find of the float corps that thi corps cannot be that of mari the reduct of thi interv to it smallest possibl dimens becom thu at onc an object with the reason in the rash pursuit of thi object he rush into mere assumpt at the outset it is folli to suppos he sai that the murder if murder wa commit on her bodi could have been consumm soon enough to have enabl her murder to throw the bodi into the river befor midnight we demand at onc and veri natur why why is it folli to suppos that the murder wa commit within five minut after the girl s quit her mother s hous why is it folli to suppos that the murder wa commit at ani given period of the dai there have been assassin at all hour but had the murder taken place at ani moment between nine o clock in the morn of sundai and a quarter befor midnight there would still have been time enough to throw the bodi into the river befor midnight thi assumpt then amount precis to thisthat the murder wa not commit on sundai at alland if we allow l etoil to assum thi we mai permit it ani liberti whatev the paragraph begin it is folli to suppos that the murder etc howev it appear as print in l etoil mai be imagin to have exist actual thu in the brain of it indit it is folli to suppos that the murder if murder wa commit on the bodi could have been commit soon enough to have enabl her murder to throw the bodi into the river befor midnight it is folli we sai to suppos all thi and to suppos at the same time as we ar resolv to suppos that the bodi wa not thrown in until after midnight a sentenc suffici inconsequenti in itself but not so utterli preposter as the on print were it my purpos continu dupin mere to make out a case against thi passag of l etoil s argument i might safe leav it where it is it is not howev with l etoil that we have to do but with the truth the sentenc in question ha but on mean as it stand and thi mean i have fairli state but it is materi that we go behind the mere word for an idea which these word have obvious intend and fail to convei it wa the design of the journalist to sai that at whatev period of the dai or night of sundai thi murder wa commit it wa improb that the assassin would have ventur to bear the corps to the river befor midnight and herein li realli the assumpt of which i complain it is assum that the murder wa commit at such a posit and under such circumst that the bear it to the river becam necessari now the assassin might have taken place upon the river s brink or on the river itself and thu the throw the corps in the water might have been resort to at ani period of the dai or night as the most obviou and most immedi mode of dispos you will understand that i suggest noth here as probabl or as c incid with my own opinion my design so far ha no refer to the fact of the case i wish mere to caution you against the whole tone of l etoil s suggest by call your attent to it ex part charact at the outset have prescrib thu a limit to suit it own preconceiv notion have assum that if thi were the bodi of mari it could have been in the water but a veri brief time the journal goe on to sai all experi ha shown that drown bodi or bodi thrown into the water immedi after death by violenc requir from six to ten dai for suffici decomposit to take place to bring them to the top of the water even when a cannon is fire over a corps and it rise befor at least five or six dai immers it sink again if let alon these assert have been tacitli receiv by everi paper in pari with the except of le moniteur thi latter print endeavor to combat that portion of the paragraph which ha refer to drown bodi onli by cite some five or six instanc in which the bodi of individu known to be drown were found float after the laps of less time than is insist upon by l etoil but there is someth excess unphilosoph in the attempt on the part of le moniteur to rebut the gener assert of l etoil by a citat of particular instanc milit against that assert had it been possibl to adduc fifti instead of five exampl of bodi found float at the end of two or three dai these fifti exampl could still have been properli regard onli as except to l etoil s rule until such time as the rule itself should be confut admit the rule and thi le moniteur doe not deni insist mere upon it except the argument of l etoil is suffer to remain in full forc for thi argument doe not pretend to involv more than a question of the probabl of the bodi have risen to the surfac in less than three dai and thi probabl will be in favor of l etoil s posit until the instanc so childishli adduc shall be suffici in number to establish an antagonist rule you will see at onc that all argument upon thi head should be urg if at all against the rule itself and for thi end we must examin the rational of the rule now the human bodi in gener is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the sein that is to sai the specif graviti of the human bodi in it natur condit is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displac the bodi of fat and fleshi person with small bone and of women gener ar lighter than those of the lean and largebon and of men and the specif graviti of the water of a river is somewhat influenc by the presenc of the tide from sea but leav thi tide out of question it mai be said that veri few human bodi will sink at all even in fresh water of their own accord almost ani on fall into a river will be enabl to float if he suffer the specif graviti of the water fairli to be adduc in comparison with hi ownthat is to sai if he suffer hi whole person to be immers with as littl except as possibl the proper posit for on who cannot swim is the upright posit of the walker on land with the head thrown fulli back and immers the mouth and nostril alon remain abov the surfac thu circumstanc we shall find that we float without difficulti and without exert it is evid howev that the graviti of the bodi and of the bulk of water displac ar veri nice balanc and that a trifl will caus either to preponder an arm for instanc uplift from the water and thu depriv of it support is an addit weight suffici to immers the whole head while the accident aid of the smallest piec of timber will enabl us to elev the head so as to look about now in the struggl of on unus to swim the arm ar invari thrown upward while an attempt is made to keep the head in it usual perpendicular posit the result is the immers of the mouth and nostril and the incept dure effort to breath while beneath the surfac of water into the lung much is also receiv into the stomach and the whole bodi becom heavier by the differ between the weight of the air origin distend these caviti and that of the fluid which now fill them thi differ is suffici to caus the bodi to sink as a gener rule but is insuffici in the case of individu with small bone and an abnorm quantiti of flaccid or fatti matter such individu float even after drown the corps be suppos at the bottom of the river will there remain until by some mean it specif graviti again becom less than that of the bulk of water which it displac thi effect is brought about by decomposit or otherwis the result of decomposit is the gener of ga distend the cellular tissu and all the caviti and give the puf appear which is so horribl when thi distens ha so far progress that the bulk of the corps is materi increas without a correspond increas of mass or weight it specif graviti becom less than that of the water displac and it forthwith make it appear at the surfac but decomposit is modifi by innumer circumstancesi hasten or retard by innumer agenc for exampl by the heat or cold of the season by the miner impregn or puriti of the water by it depth or shallow by it currenc or stagnat by the tempera of the bodi by it infect or freedom from diseas befor death thu it is evid that we can assign no period with ani thing like accuraci at which the corps shall rise through decomposit under certain condit thi result would be brought about within an hour under other it might not take place at all there ar chemic infus by which the anim frame can be preserv forev from corrupt the bichlorid of mercuri is on but apart from decomposit there mai be and veri usual is a gener of ga within the stomach from the acet ferment of veget matter or within other caviti from other caus suffici to induc a distens which will bring the bodi to the surfac the effect produc by the fire of a cannon is that of simpl vibrat thi mai either loosen the corps from the soft mud or ooz in which it is imbed thu permit it to rise when other agenc have alreadi prepar it for so do or it mai overcom the tenac of some putresc portion of the cellular tissu allow the caviti to distend under the influenc of the ga have thu befor us the whole philosophi of thi subject we can easili test by it the assert of l etoil all experi show sai thi paper that drown bodi or bodi thrown into the water immedi after death by violenc requir from six to ten dai for suffici decomposit to take place to bring them to the top of the water even when a cannon is fire over a corps and it rise befor at least five or six dai immers it sink again if let alon the whole of thi paragraph must now appear a tissu of inconsequ and incoher all experi doe not show that drown bodi requir from six to ten dai for suffici decomposit to take place to bring them to the surfac both scienc and experi show that the period of their rise is and necessarili must be indetermin if moreov a bodi ha risen to the surfac through fire of cannon it will not sink again if let alon until decomposit ha so far progress as to permit the escap of the gener ga but i wish to call your attent to the distinct which is made between drown bodi and bodi thrown into the water immedi after death by violenc although the writer admit the distinct he yet includ them all in the same categori i have shown how it is that the bodi of a drown man becom specif heavier than it bulk of water and that he would not sink at all except for the struggl by which he elev hi arm abov the surfac and hi gasp for breath while beneath the surfacegasp which suppli by water the place of the origin air in the lung but these struggl and these gasp would not occur in the bodi thrown into the water immedi after death by violenc thu in the latter instanc the bodi as a gener rule would not sink at alla fact of which l etoil is evid ignor when decomposit had proceed to a veri great extentwhen the flesh had in a great measur left the bonesthen inde but not till then should we lose sight of the corps and now what ar we to make of the argument that the bodi found could not be that of mari rog t becaus three dai onli have elaps thi bodi wa found float if drown be a woman she might never have sunk or have sunk might have reappear in twentyfour hour or less but no on suppos her to have been drown and dy befor be thrown into the river she might have been found float at ani period afterward whatev but sai l etoil if the bodi had been kept in it mangl state on shore until tuesdai night some trace would be found on shore of the murder here it is at first difficult to perceiv the intent of the reason he mean to anticip what he imagin would be an object to hi theoryviz that the bodi wa kept on shore two dai suffer rapid decompositionmor rapid than if immers in water he suppos that had thi been the case it might have appear at the surfac on the wednesdai and think that onli under such circumst it could so have appear he is accordingli in hast to show that it wa not kept on shore for if so some trace would be found on shore of the murder i presum you smile at the sequitur you cannot be made to see how the mere durat of the corps on the shore could oper to multipli trace of the assassin nor can i and furthermor it is exceedingli improb continu our journal that ani villain who had commit such a murder as is here suppos would have thrown the bodi in without weight to sink it when such a precaut could have so easili been taken observ here the laughabl confus of thought no onenot even l etoiledisput the murder commit on the bodi found the mark of violenc ar too obviou it is our reason s object mere to show that thi bodi is not mari s he wish to prove that mari is not assassinatednot that the corps wa not yet hi observ prove onli the latter point here is a corps without weight attach murder cast it in would not have fail to attach a weight therefor it wa not thrown in by murder thi is all which is prove if ani thing is the question of ident is not even approach and l etoil ha been at great pain mere to gainsai now what it ha admit onli a moment befor we ar perfectli convinc it sai that the bodi found wa that of a murder femal nor is thi the sole instanc even in thi divis of hi subject where our reason unwittingli reason against himself hi evid object i have alreadi said is to reduc as much as possibl the interv between mari s disappear and the find of the corps yet we find him urg the point that no person saw the girl from the moment of her leav her mother s hous we have no evid he sai that mari rog t wa in the land of the live after nine o clock on sundai june the twentysecond as hi argument is obvious an ex part on he should at least have left thi matter out of sight for had ani on been known to see mari sai on mondai or on tuesdai the interv in question would have been much reduc and by hi own ratiocin the probabl much diminish of the corps be that of the grisett it is nevertheless amus to observ that l etoil insist upon it point in the full belief of it further it gener argument reperus now that portion of thi argument which ha refer to the identif of the corps by beauvai in regard to the hair upon the arm l etoil ha been obvious disingenu m beauvai not be an idiot could never have urg in identif of the corps simpli hair upon it arm no arm is without hair the gener of the express of l etoil is a mere pervers of the wit phraseolog he must have spoken of some peculiar in thi hair it must have been a peculiar of color of quantiti of length or of situat her foot sai the journal wa smallso ar thousand of feet her garter is no proof whatevernor is her shoefor shoe and garter ar sold in packag the same mai be said of the flower in her hat on thing upon which m beauvai strongli insist is that the clasp on the garter found had been set back to take it in thi amount to noth for most women find it proper to take a pair of garter home and fit them to the size of the limb thei ar to encircl rather than to try them in the store where thei purchas here it is difficult to suppos the reason in earnest had m beauvai in hi search for the bodi of mari discov a corps correspond in gener size and appear to the miss girl he would have been warrant without refer to the question of habili at all in form an opinion that hi search had been success if in addit to the point of gener size and contour he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairi appear which he had observ upon the live mari hi opinion might have been justli strengthen and the increas of posit might well have been in the ratio of the peculiar or unusu of the hairi mark if the feet of mari be small those of the corps were also small the increas of probabl that the bodi wa that of mari would not be an increas in a ratio mere arithmet but in on highli geometr or accumul add to all thi shoe such as she had been known to wear upon the dai of her disappear and although these shoe mai be sold in packag you so far augment the probabl as to verg upon the certain what of itself would be no evid of ident becom through it corrobor posit proof most sure give us then flower in the hat correspond to those worn by the miss girl and we seek for noth farther if onli on flower we seek for noth fartherwhat then if two or three or more each success on is multipl evidenceproof not ad to proof but multipli by hundr or thousand let us now discov upon the deceas garter such as the live us and it is almost folli to proce but these garter ar found to be tighten by the set back of a clasp in just such a manner as her own had been tighten by mari shortli previou to her leav home it is now mad or hypocrisi to doubt what l etoil sai in respect to thi abbrevi of the garter s be an usual occurr show noth beyond it own pertinac in error the elast natur of the claspgart is selfdemonstr of the unusu of the abbrevi what is made to adjust itself must of necess requir foreign adjust but rare it must have been by an accid in it strictest sens that these garter of mari need the tighten describ thei alon would have ampli establish her ident but it is not that the corps wa found to have the garter of the miss girl or found to have her shoe or her bonnet or the flower of her bonnet or her feet or a peculiar mark upon the arm or her gener size and appearanceit is that the corps had each and all collect could it be prove that the editor of l etoil realli entertain a doubt under the circumst there would be no need in hi case of a commiss de lunatico inquirendo he ha thought it sagaci to echo the small talk of the lawyer who for the most part content themselv with echo the rectangular precept of the court i would here observ that veri much of what is reject

steadfast adher to principl with rigor disregard of the conflict except is a sure mode of attain the maximum of attain truth in ani long sequenc of time the practic in mass is therefor philosoph but it is not the less certain that it engend vast individu error in respect to the insinu level at beauvai you will be will to dismiss them in a breath you have alreadi fathom the true charact of thi good gentleman he is a busybodi with much of romanc and littl of wit ani on so constitut will readili so conduct himself upon occas of real excit as to render himself liabl to suspicion on the part of the over acut or the illdispos m beauvai as it appear from your note had some person interview with the editor of l etoil and offend him by ventur an opinion that the corps notwithstand the theori of the editor wa in sober fact that of mari he persist sai the paper in assert the corps to be that of mari but cannot give a circumst in addit to those which we have comment upon to make other believ now without readvert to the fact that stronger evid to make other believ could never have been adduc it mai be remark that a man mai veri well be understood to believ in a case of thi kind without the abil to advanc a singl reason for the belief of a second parti noth is more vagu than impress of individu ident each man recogn hi neighbor yet there ar few instanc in which ani on is prepar to give a

of the wai the avers to permit them to see the bodi the caution given to madam b that she must hold no convers with the gendarm until hi return beauvai and lastli hi appar determin that nobodi should have anyth to do with the proceed except himself it seem to me unquestion that beauvai wa a suitor of mari s that she coquet with him and that he wa ambiti of be thought to enjoi her fullest intimaci and confid i shall sai noth more upon thi point and as the evid fulli rebut the assert of l etoil touch the matter of apathi on the part of the mother and other relativesan apathi inconsist with the supposit of their believ the corps to be that of the perfumerygirlw shall now proce as if the question of ident were settl to our perfect satisfact and what i here demand do you think of the opinion of le commerciel that in spirit thei ar far more worthi of attent than ani which have been promulg upon the subject the deduct from the premis ar philosoph and acut but the premis in two instanc at least ar found in imperfect observ le commerciel wish to intim that mari wa seiz by some gang of low ruffian not far from her mother s door it is imposs it urg that a person so well known to thousand as thi young woman wa should have pass three block without some on have seen her thi is the idea of a man long resid in parisa public manand on whose walk to and fro in the citi have been mostli limit to the vicin of the public offic he is awar that he seldom pass so far as a dozen block from hi own bureau without be recogn and accost and know the extent of hi person acquaint with other and of other with him he compar hi notorieti with that of the perfumerygirl find no great differ between them and reach at onc the conclus that she in her walk would be equal liabl to recognit with himself in hi thi could onli be the case were her walk of the same unvari method charact and within the same speci of limit region as ar hi own he pass to and fro at regular interv within a confin peripheri abound in individu who ar led to observ of hi person through interest in the kindr natur of hi occup with their own but the walk of mari mai in gener be suppos discurs in thi particular instanc it will be understood as most probabl that she proceed upon a rout of more than averag divers from her accustom on the parallel which we imagin to have exist in the mind of le commerciel would onli be sustain in the event of the two individu travers the whole citi in thi case grant the person acquaint to be equal the chanc would be also equal that an equal number of person rencount would be made for my own part i should hold it not onli as possibl but as veri far more than probabl that mari might have proceed at ani given period by ani on of the mani rout between her own resid and that of her aunt without meet a singl individu whom she knew or by whom she wa known in view thi question in it full and proper light we must hold steadili in mind the great disproport between the person acquaint of even the most note individu in pari and the entir popul of pari itself but whatev forc there mai still appear to be in the suggest of le commerciel will be much diminish when we take into consider the hour at which the girl went abroad it wa when the street were full of peopl sai le commerciel that she went out but not so it wa at nine o clock in the morn now at nine o clock of everi morn in the week with the except of sundai the street of the citi ar it is true throng with peopl at nine on sundai the populac ar chiefli within door prepar for church no observ person can have fail to notic the peculiarli desert air of the town from about eight until ten on the morn of everi sabbath between ten and eleven the street ar throng but not at so earli a period as that design there is anoth point at which there seem a defici of observ on the part of le commerciel a piec it sai of on of the unfortun girl s petticoat two feet long and on foot wide wa torn out and ti under her chin and around the back of her head probabl to prevent scream thi wa done by fellow who had no pockethandkerchief whether thi idea is or is not well found we will endeavor to see hereaft but by fellow who have no pockethandkerchief the editor intend the lowest class of ruffian these howev ar the veri descript of peopl who will alwai be found to have handkerchief even when destitut of shirt you must

restat by le soleil ar veri far inde from remov my own doubt upon thi subject and we will examin them more particularli hereaft in connexion with anoth divis of the theme at present we must occupi ourselv with other investig you cannot fail to have remark the extrem laxiti of the examin of the corps to be sure the question of ident wa readili determin or should have been but there were other

upon it outskirt not the least usual error in investig such as thi is the limit of inquiri to the immedi with total disregard of the collater or circumstanti event it is the malpractic of the court to confin evid and discuss to the bound of appar relev yet experi ha shown and a true philosophi will alwai show that a vast perhap the larger portion of truth aris from the seemingli irrelev it is through the spirit of thi principl if not precis through it letter that modern scienc ha resolv to calcul upon the unforeseen but perhap you do not comprehend me the histori of human knowledg ha so uninterruptedli shown that to collater or incident or accident event we ar indebt for the most numer and most valuabl discoveri that it ha at length becom necessari in ani prospect view of improv to

fact that the larger portion of all truth ha sprung from the collater and it is but in accord with the spirit of the principl involv in thi fact that i would divert inquiri in the present case from the trodden and hitherto unfruit ground of the event itself to the contemporari circumst which surround it while you ascertain the valid of the affidavit i will examin the newspap more gener than you have as yet done so far we have onli reconnoitr the field of investig but it will be strang inde if a comprehens survei such as i propos of the public print will not afford us some minut point which shall establish a direct for inquiri in pursuanc of dupin s suggest i made scrupul examin of the affair of the affidavit the result wa a firm convict of their valid and of the consequ innoc of st

about three year and a half ago a disturb veri similar to the present wa caus by the disappear of thi same mari rog t from the parfumeri of monsieur le blanc in the palai royal at the end of a week howev she reappear at her customari comptoir as well as ever with the except of a slight pale not altogeth usual it wa given out by monsieur le blanc and her mother that she had mere been on a visit

inquiri and as the argument of our sever correspond appear to be more zealou than profound we do not think it advis to make them public morn paperjun we have receiv sever forcibl written commun appar from variou sourc and which go far to render it a matter of certainti that the unfortun mari rog t ha becom a victim of on of the numer band of blackguard which infest the vicin of the citi upon

brought to bear upon the matter in hand i wait for some explan from dupin it is not my present design he said to dwell upon the first and second of those extract i have copi them chiefli to show you the extrem remiss of the polic who as far as i can understand from the prefect have not troubl themselv in ani respect with an examin of the naval offic allud to yet it is mere folli to sai that between the first and second disappear of mari there is no suppos connect let us admit the first elop to have result in a quarrel between the lover and the return home of the betrai we ar now prepar to view a second elop if we know that an elop ha again taken place as indic a renew of the betray s advanc rather than as the result of new propos by a second individualw ar prepar to regard it as a make up of the old amour rather than as the commenc of a new on the chanc ar ten to on that he who had onc elop with mari would again propos an elop rather than that she to whom propos of elop had been made by on individu should have them made to her by anoth and here let me call your attent to the fact that the time elaps between the first ascertain and the second suppos elop is a few month more than the gener period of the cruis of our menofwar had the lover been interrupt in hi first villani by the necess of departur to sea and had he seiz the first moment of hi return to renew the base design not yet altogeth accomplishedor not yet altogeth accomplish by him of all these thing we know noth you will sai howev that in the second instanc there wa no elop as imagin certainli notbut ar we prepar to sai that there wa not the frustrat design beyond st eustach and perhap beauvai we find no recogn no open no honor suitor of mari of none other is there ani thing said who then is the secret lover of whom the rel at least most of them know noth but whom mari meet upon the morn of sundai and who is so deepli in her confid that she hesit not to remain with him until the shade of the even descend amid the solitari grove of the barri re du roul who is that secret lover i ask of whom at least most of the rel know noth and what mean the singular propheci of madam rog t on the morn of mari s departur i fear that i shall never see mari again but if we cannot imagin madam rog t privi to the design of elop mai we not at least suppos thi design entertain by the girl upon quit home she gave it to be understood that she wa about to visit her aunt in the rue de dr me and st eustach wa request to call for her at dark now at first glanc thi fact strongli milit against my suggestionbut let us reflect that she did meet some companion and proce with him across the river reach the barri re du roul at so late an hour as three o clock in the afternoon is known but in consent so to accompani thi individu for whatev purposeto her mother known or unknown she must have thought of her express intent when leav home and of the surpris and suspicion arous in the bosom of her affianc suitor st eustach when call for her at the hour appoint in the rue de dr me he should find that she had not been there and when moreov upon return to the pension with thi alarm intellig he should becom awar of her continu absenc from home she must have thought of these thing i sai she must have foreseen the chagrin of st eustach the suspicion of all she could not have thought of return to brave thi suspicion but the suspicion becom a point of trivial import to her if we suppos her not intend to return we mai imagin her think thu i am to meet a certain person for the purpos of elop or for certain other purpos known onli to myself it is necessari that there be no chanc of interruptionther must be suffici time given us to elud pursuiti will give it to be understood that i shall visit and spend the dai with my aunt at the rue de dr mesi well tell st eustach not to call for me until darkin thi wai my absenc from home for the longest possibl period without caus suspicion or anxieti will be account for and i shall gain more time than in ani other manner if i bid st eustach call for me at dark he will be sure not to call befor but if i wholli neglect to bid him call my time for escap will be diminish sinc it will be expect that i return the earlier and my absenc will the sooner excit anxieti now if it were my design to return at allif i had in contempl mere a stroll with the individu in questionit would not be my polici to bid st eustach call for call he will be sure to ascertain that i have plai him falsea fact of which i might keep him for ever in ignor by leav home without notifi him of my intent by return befor dark and by then state that i had been to visit my aunt in the rue de dr me but as it is my design never to returnor not for some weeksor not until certain conceal ar effectedth gain of time is the onli point about which i need give myself ani concern you have observ in your note that the most gener opinion in relat to thi sad affair is and wa from the first that the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguard now the popular opinion under certain condit is not to be disregard when aris of itselfwhen manifest itself in a strictli spontan mannerw should look upon it as analog with that intuit which is the idiosyncrasi of the individu man of geniu in ninetynin case from the hundr i would abid by it decis but it is import that we find no palpabl trace of suggest the opinion must be rigor the public s own and the distinct is often exceedingli difficult to perceiv and to maintain in the present instanc it appear to me that thi public opinion in respect to a gang ha been superinduc by the collater event which is detail in the third of my extract all pari is excit by the discov corps of mari a girl young beauti and notori thi corps is found bear mark of violenc and float in the river but it is now made known that at the veri period or about the veri period in which it is suppos that the girl wa assassin an outrag similar in natur to that endur by the deceas although less in extent wa perpetu by a gang of young ruffian upon the person of a second young femal is it wonder that the on known atroc should influenc the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown thi judgment await direct and the known outrag seem so opportun to afford it mari too wa found in the river and upon thi veri river wa thi known outrag commit the connexion of the two event had about it so much of the palpabl that the true wonder would have been a failur of the populac to appreci and to seiz it but in fact the on atroc known to be so commit is if ani thing evid that the other commit at a time nearli coincid wa not so commit it would have been a miracl inde if while a gang of ruffian were perpetr at a given local a most unheardof wrong there should have been anoth similar gang in a similar local in the same citi under the same circumst with the same mean and applianc engag in a wrong of precis the same aspect at precis the same period of time yet in what if not in thi marvel train of coincid doe the accident suggest opinion of the populac call upon us to believ befor proceed farther let us consid the suppos scene of the assassin in the thicket at the barri re du roul thi thicket although dens wa in the close vicin of a public road within were three or four larg stone form a kind of seat with a back and footstool on the upper stone wa discov a white petticoat on the second a silk scarf a parasol glove and a pockethandkerchief were also here found the handkerchief bore the name mari rog t fragment of dress were seen on the branch around the earth wa trampl the bush were broken and there wa everi evid of a violent struggl notwithstand the acclam with which the discoveri of thi thicket wa receiv by the press and the unanim with which it wa suppos to indic the precis scene of the outrag it must be admit that there wa some veri good reason for doubt that it wa the scene i mai or i mai not believebut there wa excel reason for doubt had the true scene been as le commerciel suggest in the neighborhood of the rue pav e st andr e the perpetr of the crime suppos them still resid in pari would natur have been stricken with terror at the public attent thu acut direct into the proper channel and in certain class of mind there would have arisen at onc a sens of the necess of some exert to redivert thi attent and thu the thicket of the barri re du roul have been alreadi suspect the idea of place the articl where thei were found might have been natur entertain there is no real evid although le soleil so suppos that the articl discov had been more than a veri few dai in the thicket while there is much circumstanti proof that thei could not have remain there without attract attent dure the twenti dai elaps between the fatal sundai and the afternoon upon which thei were found by the boi thei were all mildew down hard sai le soleil adopt the opinion of it predecessor with the action of the rain and stuck togeth from mildew the grass had grown around and over some of them the silk of the parasol wa strong but the thread of it were run togeth within the upper part where it had been doubl and fold wa all mildew and rotten and tore on be open in respect to the grass have grown around and over some of them it is obviou that the fact could onli have been ascertain from the word and thu from the recollect of two small boi for these boi remov the articl and took them home befor thei had been seen by a third parti but grass will grow especi in warm and damp weather such as wa that of the period of the murder as much as two or three inch in a singl dai a parasol ly upon a newli turf ground might in a singl week be entir conceal from sight by the upspring grass and touch that mildew upon which the editor of le soleil so pertinaci insist that he emploi the word no less than three time in the brief paragraph just quot is he realli unawar of the natur of thi mildew is he to be told that it is on of the mani class of fungu of which the most ordinari featur is it upspring and decad within twentyfour hour thu we see at a glanc that what ha been most triumphantli adduc in support of the idea that the articl had been for at least three or four week in the thicket is most absurdli null as regard ani evid of that fact on the other hand it is exceedingli difficult to believ that these articl could have remain in the thicket specifi for a longer period than a singl weekfor a longer period than from on sundai to the next those who know ani thing of the vicin of pari know the extrem difficulti of find seclus unless at a great distanc from it suburb such a thing as an unexplor or even an unfrequ visit recess amid it wood or grove is not for a moment to be imagin let ani on who be at heart a lover of natur is yet chain by duti to the dust and heat of thi great metropolislet ani such on attempt even dure the weekdai to slake hi thirst for solitud amid the scene of natur loveli which immedi surround us at everi second step he will find the grow charm dispel by the voic and person intrus of some ruffian or parti of carous blackguard he will seek privaci amid the densest foliag all in vain here ar the veri nook where the unwash most aboundher ar the templ most desecr with sick of the heart the wander will flee back to the pollut pari as to a less odiou becaus less incongru sink of pollut but if the vicin of the citi is so beset dure the work dai of the week how much more so on the sabbath it is now especi that releas from the claim of labor or depriv of the customari opportun of crime the town blackguard seek the precinct of the town not through love of the rural which in hi heart he despis but by wai of escap from the restraint and convention of societi he desir less the fresh air and the green tree than the utter licens of the countri here at the roadsid inn or beneath the foliag of the wood he indulg uncheck by ani ey except those of hi boon companion in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarityth joint offspr of liberti and of rum i sai noth more than what must be obviou to everi dispassion observ when i repeat that the circumst of the articl in question have remain undiscov for a longer periodthan from on sundai to anoth in ani thicket in the immedi neighborhood of pari is to be look upon as littl less than miracul but there ar not want other ground for the suspicion that the articl were place in the thicket with the view of divert attent from the real scene of the outrag and first let me direct your notic to the date of the discoveri of the articl collat thi with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspap you will find that the discoveri follow almost immedi the urgent commun sent to the even paper these commun although variou and appar from variou sourc tend all to the same pointviz the direct of attent to a gang as the perpetr of the outrag and to the neighborhood of the barri re du roul as it scene now here of cours the suspicion is not that in consequ of these commun or of the public attent by them direct the articl were found by the boi but the suspicion might and mai well have been that the articl were not befor found by the boi for the reason that the articl had not befor been in the thicket have been deposit there onli at so late a period as at the date or shortli prior to the date of the commun by the guilti author of these commun themselv thi thicket wa a singularan exceedingli singular on it wa unusu dens within it natur wall enclosur were three extraordinari stone form a seat with a back and footstool and thi thicket so full of a natur art wa in the immedi vicin within a few rod of the dwell of madam deluc whose boi were in the habit of close examin the shrubberi about them in search of the bark of the sassafra would it be a rash wagera wager of on thousand to onethat a dai never pass over the head of these boi without find at least on of them ensconc in the umbrag hall and enthron upon it natur throne those who would hesit at such a wager have either never been boi themselv or have forgotten the boyish natur i repeatit is exceedingli hard to comprehend how the articl could have remain in thi thicket undiscov for a longer period than on or two dai and that thu there is good ground for suspicion in spite of the dogmat ignor of le soleil that thei were at a compar late date deposit where found but there ar still other and stronger reason for believ them so deposit than ani which i have as yet urg and now let me beg your notic to the highli artifici arrang of the articl on the upper stone lai a white petticoat on the second a silk scarf scatter around were a parasol glove and a pockethandkerchief bear the name mari rog t here is just such an arrang as would natur be made by a not overacut person wish to dispos the articl natur but it is by no mean a realli natur arrang i should rather have look to see the thing all ly on the ground and trampl under foot in the narrow limit of that bower it would have been scarc possibl that the petticoat and scarf should have retain a posit upon the stone when subject to the brush to and fro of mani struggl person there wa evid it is said of a struggl and the earth wa trampl the bush were broken but the petticoat and the scarf ar found deposit as if upon shelv the piec of the frock torn out by the bush were about three inch wide and six inch long on part wa the hem of the frock and it had been mend thei look like strip torn off here inadvert le soleil ha emploi an exceedingli suspici phrase the piec as describ do inde look like strip torn off but purpos and by hand it is on of the rarest of accid that a piec is torn off from ani garment such as is now in question by the agenc of a thorn from the veri natur of such fabric a thorn or nail becom entangl in them tear them rectangularlydivid them into two longitudin rent at right angl with each other and meet at an apex where the thorn entersbut it is scarc possibl to conceiv the piec torn off i never so knew it nor did you to tear a piec off from such fabric two distinct forc in differ direct will be in almost everi case requir if there be two edg to the fabricif for exampl it be a pockethandkerchief and it is desir to tear from it a slip then and then onli will the on forc serv the purpos but in the present case the question is of a dress present but on edg to tear a piec from the interior where no edg is present could onli be effect by a miracl through the agenc of thorn and no on thorn could accomplish it but even where an edg is present two thorn will be necessari oper the on in two distinct direct and the other in on and thi in the supposit that the edg is unhem if hem the matter is nearli out of the question we thu see the numer and great obstacl in the wai of piec be torn off through the simpl agenc of thorn yet we ar requir to believ not onli that on piec but that mani have been so torn and on part too wa the hem of the frock anoth piec wa part of the skirt not the hem that is to sai wa torn complet out through the agenc of thorn from the uncag interior of the dress these i sai ar thing which on mai well be pardon for disbeliev yet taken collectedli thei form perhap less of reason ground for suspicion than the on startl circumst of the articl have been left in thi thicket at all by ani murder who had enough precaut to think of remov the corps you will not have apprehend me rightli howev if you suppos it my design to deni thi thicket as the scene of the outrag there might have been a wrong here or more possibl an accid at madam deluc s but in fact thi is a point of minor import we ar not engag in an attempt to discov the scene but to produc the perpetr of the murder what i have adduc notwithstand the minut with which i have adduc it ha been with the view first to show the folli of the posit and headlong assert of le soleil but secondli and chiefli to bring you by the most natur rout to a further contempl of the doubt whether thi assassin ha or ha not been the work of a gang we will resum thi question by mere allus to the revolt detail of the surgeon examin at the inquest it is onli necessari to sai that hi publish infer in regard to the number of ruffian have been properli ridicul as unjust and total baseless by all the reput anatomist of pari not that the matter might not have been as infer but that there wa no ground for the inferencewa there not much for anoth let us reflect now upon the trace of a struggl and let me ask what these trace have been suppos to demonstr a gang but do thei not rather demonstr the absenc of a gang what struggl could have taken placewhat struggl so violent and so endur as to have left it trace in all directionsbetween a weak and defenceless girl and the gang of ruffian imagin the silent grasp of a few rough arm and all would have been over the victim must have been absolut passiv at their will you will here bear in mind that the argument urg against the thicket as the scene ar applic in chief part onli against it as the scene of an outrag commit by more than a singl individu if we imagin but on violat we can conceiv and thu onli conceiv the struggl of so violent and so obstin a natur as to have left the trace appar and again i have alreadi mention the suspicion to be excit by the fact that the articl in question were suffer to remain at all in the thicket where discov it seem almost imposs that these evid of guilt should have been accident left where found there wa suffici presenc of mind it is suppos to remov the corps and yet a more posit evid than the corps itself whose featur might have been quickli obliter by decai is allow to lie conspicu in the scene of the outragei allud to the handkerchief with the name of the deceas if thi wa accid it wa not the accid of a gang we can imagin it onli the accid of an individu let us see an individu ha commit the murder he is alon with the ghost of the depart he is appal by what li motionless befor him the furi of hi passion is over and there is abund room in hi heart for the natur aw of the deed hi is none of that confid which the presenc of number inevit inspir he is alon with the dead he trembl and is bewild yet there is a necess for dispos of the corps he bear it to the river but leav behind him the other evid of guilt for it is difficult if not imposs to carri all the burthen at onc and it will be easi to return for what is left but in hi toilsom journei to the water hi fear redoubl within him the sound of life encompass hi path a dozen time he hear or fanci the step of an observ even the veri light from the citi bewild him yet in time and by long and frequent paus of deep agoni he reach the river s brink and dispos of hi ghastli chargeperhap through the medium of a boat but now what treasur doe the world holdwhat threat of vengeanc could it hold outwhich would have power to urg the return of that lone murder over that toilsom and peril path to the thicket and it blood chill recollect he return not let the consequ be what thei mai he could not return if he would hi sole thought is immedi escap he turn hi back forev upon those dread shrubberi and flee as from the wrath to come but how with a gang their number would have inspir them with confid if inde confid is ever want in the breast of the arrant blackguard and of arrant blackguard alon ar the suppos gang ever constitut their number i sai would have prevent the bewild and unreason terror which i have imagin to paralyz the singl man could we suppos an oversight in on or two or three thi oversight would have been remedi by a fourth thei would have left noth behind them for their number would have enabl them to carri all at onc there would have been no need of return consid now the circumst that in the outer garment of the corps when found a slip about a foot wide had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist wound three time round the waist and secur by a sort of hitch in the back thi wa done with the obviou design of afford a handl by which to carri the bodi but would ani number of men have dream of resort to such an expedi to three or four the limb of the corps would have afford not onli a suffici but the best possibl hold the devic is that of a singl individu and thi bring us to the fact that between the thicket and the river the rail of the fenc were found taken down and the ground bore evid trace of some heavi burden have been drag along it but would a number of men have put themselv to the superflu troubl of take down a fenc for the purpos of drag through it a corps which thei might have lift over ani fenc in an instant would a number of men have so drag a corps at all as to have left evid trace of the drag and here we must refer to an observ of le commerciel an observ upon which i have alreadi in some measur comment a piec sai thi journal of on of the unfortun girl s petticoat wa torn out and ti under her chin and around the back of her head probabl to prevent scream thi wa done by fellow who had no pockethandkerchief i have befor suggest that a genuin blackguard is never without a pockethandkerchief but it is not to thi fact that i now especi advert that it wa not through want of a handkerchief for the purpos imagin by le commerciel that thi bandag wa emploi is render appar by the handkerchief left in the thicket and that the object wa not to prevent scream appear also from the bandag have been emploi in prefer to what would so much better have answer the purpos but the languag of the evid speak of the strip in question as found around the neck fit loos and secur with a hard knot these word ar suffici vagu but differ materi from those of le commerciel the slip wa eighteen inch wide and therefor although of muslin would form a strong band when fold or rumpl longitudin and thu rumpl it wa discov my infer is thi the solitari murder have born the corps for some distanc whether from the thicket or elsewher by mean of the bandag hitch around it middl found the weight in thi mode of procedur too much for hi strength he resolv to drag the burthenth evid goe to show that it wa drag with thi object in view it becam necessari to attach someth like a rope to on of the extrem it could be best attach about the neck where the head would prevent it slip off and now the murder bethought him unquestion of the bandag about the loin he would have us thi but for it volut about the corps the hitch which embarrass it and the reflect that it had not been torn off from the garment it wa easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat he tore it made it fast about the neck and so drag hi victim to the brink of the river that thi bandag onli attain with troubl and delai and but imperfectli answer it purposethat thi bandag wa emploi at all demonstr that the necess for it employ sprang from circumst aris at a period when the handkerchief wa no longer attainablethat is to sai aris as we have imagin after quit the thicket if the thicket it wa and on the road between the thicket and the river but the evid you will sai of madam deluc point especi to the presenc of a gang in the vicin of the thicket at or about the epoch of the murder thi i grant i doubt if there were not a dozen gang such as describ by madam deluc in and about the vicin of the barri re du roul at or about the period of thi tragedi but the gang which ha drawn upon itself the point animadvers although the somewhat tardi and veri suspici evid of madam deluc is the onli gang which is repres by that honest and scrupul old ladi as have eaten her cake and swallow her brandi without put themselv to the troubl of make her payment et hinc ill ir but what is the precis evid of madam deluc a gang of miscreant made their appear behav boister at and drank without make payment follow in the rout of the young man and girl return to the inn about dusk and recross the river as if in great hast now thi great hast veri possibl seem greater hast in the ey of madam deluc sinc she dwelt lingeringli and lamentingli upon her violat cake and alecak and al for which she might still have entertain a faint hope of compens why otherwis sinc it wa about dusk should she make a point of the hast it is no caus for wonder sure that even a gang of blackguard should make hast to get home when a wide river is to be cross in small boat when storm impend and when night approach i sai approach for the night had not yet arriv it wa onli about dusk that the indec hast of these miscreant offend the sober ey of madam deluc but we ar told that it wa upon thi veri even that madam deluc as well as her eldest son heard the scream of a femal in the vicin of the inn and in what word doe madam deluc design the period of the even at which these scream were heard it wa soon after dark she sai but soon after dark is at least dark and about dusk is as certainli daylight thu it is abundantli clear that the gang quit the barri re du roul prior to the scream overheard by madam deluc and although in all the mani report of the evid the rel express in question ar distinctli and invari emploi just as i have emploi them in thi convers with yourself no notic whatev of the gross discrep ha as yet been taken by ani of the public journal or by ani of the myrmidon of polic i shall add but on to the argument against a gang but thi on ha to my own understand at least a weight altogeth irresist under the circumst of larg reward offer and full pardon to ani king s evid it is not to be imagin for a moment that some member of a gang of low ruffian or of ani bodi of men would not long ago have betrai hi accomplic each on of a gang so place is not so much greedi of reward or anxiou for escap as fear of betray he betrai eagerli and earli that he mai not himself be betrai that the secret ha not been divulg is the veri best of proof that it is in fact a secret the horror of thi dark deed ar known onli to on or two live human be and to god let us sum up now the meagr yet certain fruit of our long analysi we have attain the idea either of a fatal accid under the roof of madam deluc or of a murder perpetr in the thicket at the barri re du roul by a lover or at least by an intim and secret associ of the deceas thi associ is of swarthi complexion thi complexion the hitch in the bandag and the sailor s knot with which the bonnetribbon is ti point to a seaman hi companionship with the deceas a gai but not an abject young girl design him as abov the grade of the common sailor here the well written and urgent commun to the journal ar much in the wai of corrobor the circumst of the first elop as mention by le mercuri tend to blend the idea of thi seaman with that of the naval offic who is first known to have led the unfortun into crime and here most fitli come the consider of the continu absenc of him of the dark complexion let me paus to observ that the complexion of thi man is dark and swarthi it wa no common swarthi which constitut the sole point of remembr both as regard valenc and madam deluc but why is thi man absent wa he murder by the gang if so why ar there onli trace of the assassin girl the scene of the two outrag will natur be suppos ident and where is hi corps the assassin would most probabl have dispos of both in the same wai but it mai be said that thi man live and is deter from make himself known through dread of be charg with the murder thi consider might be suppos to oper upon him nowat thi late periodsinc it ha been given in evid that he wa seen with mariebut it would have had no forc at the period of the deed the first impuls of an innoc man would have been to announc the outrag and to aid in identifi the ruffian thi polici would have suggest he had been seen with the girl he had cross the river with her in an open ferryboat the denounc of the assassin would have appear even to an idiot the surest and sole mean of reliev himself from suspicion we cannot suppos him on the night of the fatal sundai both innoc himself and incogniz of an outrag commit yet onli under such circumst is it possibl to imagin that he would have fail if aliv in the denounc of the assassin and what mean ar our of attain the truth we shall find these mean multipli and gather distinct as we proce let us sift to the bottom thi affair of the first elop let us know the full histori of the offic with hi present circumst and hi whereabout at the precis period of the murder let us carefulli compar with each other the variou commun sent to the even paper in which the object wa to inculp a gang thi done let us compar these commun both as regard style and ms with those sent to the morn paper at a previou period and insist so vehement upon the guilt of mennai and all thi done let us again compar these variou commun with the known mss of the offic let us endeavor to ascertain by repeat question of madam deluc and her boi as well as of the omnibu driver valenc someth more of the person appear and bear of the man of dark complexion queri skilfulli direct will not fail to elicit from some of these parti inform on thi particular point or upon othersinform which the parti themselv mai not even be awar of possess and let us now trace the boat pick up by the bargeman on the morn of mondai the twentythird of june and which wa remov from the bargeoffic without the cogniz of the offic in attend and without the rudder at some period prior to the discoveri of the corps with a proper caution and persever we shall infal trace thi boat for not onli can the bargeman who pick it up identifi it but the rudder is at hand the rudder of a sailboat would not have been abandon without inquiri by on altogeth at eas in heart and here let me paus to insinu a question there wa no advertis of the pick up of thi boat it wa silent taken to the bargeoffic and as silent remov but it owner or employerhow happen he at so earli a period as tuesdai morn to be inform without the agenc of advertis of the local of the boat taken up on mondai unless we imagin some connexion with the navysom person perman connexion lead to cogniz of it minut in interestsit petti local new in speak of the lone assassin drag hi burden to the shore i have alreadi suggest the probabl of hi avail himself of a boat now we ar to understand that mari rog t wa precipit from a boat thi would natur have been the case the corps could not have been trust to the shallow water of the shore the peculiar mark on the back and shoulder of the victim tell of the bottom rib of a boat that the bodi wa found without weight is also corrobor of the idea if thrown from the shore a weight would have been attach we can onli account for it absenc by suppos the murder to have neglect the precaut of suppli himself with it befor push off in the act of consign the corps to the water he would unquestion have notic hi oversight but then no remedi would have been at hand ani risk would have been prefer to a return to that accurs shore have rid himself of hi ghastli charg the murder would have hasten to the citi there at some obscur wharf he would have leap on land but the boatwould he have secur it he would have been in too great hast for such thing as secur a boat moreov in fasten it to the wharf he would have felt as if secur evid against himself hi natur thought would have been to cast from him as far as possibl all that had held connect with hi crime he would not onli have fled from the wharf but he would not have permit the boat to remain assuredli he would have cast it adrift let us pursu our fanciesin the morn the wretch is stricken with unutter horror at find that the boat ha been pick up and detain at a local which he is in the daili habit of frequent at a local perhap which hi duti compel him to frequent the next night without dare to ask for the rudder he remov it now where is that rudderless boat let it be on of our first purpos to discov with the first glimps we obtain of it the dawn of our success shall begin thi boat shall guid us with a rapid which will surpris even ourselv to him who emploi it in the midnight of the fatal sabbath corrobor will rise upon corrobor and the murder will be trace for reason which we shall not specifi but which to mani reader will appear obviou we have taken the liberti of here omit from the mss place in our hand such portion as detail the follow up of the appar slight clew obtain by dupin we feel it advis onli to state in brief that the result desir wa brought to pass and that the prefect fulfil punctual although with reluct the term of hi compact with the chevali mr poe s articl conclud with the follow words it will be understood that i speak of coincid and no more what i have said abov upon thi topic must suffic in my own heart there dwell no faith in pr ternatur that natur and it god ar two no man who think will deni that the latter creat the former can at will control or modifi it is also unquestion i sai at will for the question is of will and not as the insan of logic ha assum of power it is not that the deiti cannot modifi hi law but that we insult him in imagin a possibl necess for modif in their origin these law were fashion to embrac all conting which could lie in the futur with god all is now i repeat then that i speak of these thing onli as of coincid and farther in what i relat it will be seen that between the fate of the unhappi mari cecilia roger so far as that fate is known and the fate of on mari rog t up to a certain epoch in her histori there ha exist a parallel in the contempl of whose wonder exactitud the reason becom embarrass i sai all thi will be seen but let it not for a moment be suppos that in proceed with the sad narr of mari from the epoch just mention and in trace to it d nouement the mysteri which enshroud her it is my covert design to hint at an extens of the parallel or even to suggest that the measur adopt in pari for the discoveri of the assassin of a grisett or measur found in ani similar ratiocin would produc ani similar result for in respect to the latter branch of the supposit it should be consid that the most trifl variat in the fact of the two case might give rise to the most import miscalcul by divert thoroughli the two cours of event veri much as in arithmet an error which in it own individu mai be inappreci produc at length by dint of multipl

idea of the extens of the parallelforbid it with a posit strong and decid just in proport as thi parallel ha alreadi been longdrawn and exact thi is on of those anomal proposit which seemingli appeal to thought altogeth apart from the mathemat is yet on which onli the mathematician can fulli entertain noth for exampl is more difficult than to convinc the mere gener reader that the fact of six have been thrown twice in success by a player at dice is suffici caus for bet the largest odd that six will not be thrown in the third attempt a suggest to thi effect is usual reject by the intellect at

for exampl there mai be a deposit of dew upon the silk to the extent even of sever hundr pound ballast ha then to be thrown out or the machin mai descend thi ballast be discard and a clear sunshin

resourc and come to the earth thi wa the great obstacl to voyag of length the guiderop remedi the difficulti in the simplest manner conceiv it is mere a veri long rope which is suffer to trail from the car and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from chang it level in ani materi degre if for exampl there should be a deposit of moistur upon the silk and the machin begin to descend in consequ there will be no necess for discharg ballast to remedi the increas of weight for it is remedi or counteract in an exactli just proport by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessari if on the other hand ani circumst should caus undu leviti and consequ ascent thi leviti is immedi counteract by the addit weight of rope uprais from the earth thu the balloon can neither ascend or descend except within veri narrow limit and it resourc either in ga or ballast remain compar unimpair when pass over an expans of water it becom necessari to emploi small keg of copper or wood fill with liquid ballast of a lighter natur than water these float and serv all the purpos of a mere rope on land anoth most import offic of the guiderop is to point out the

overrul their fear and kept resolut upon our cours we steer due west but as the trail of the buoi materi imped our progress and we had the balloon abundantli at command either for ascent or descent we first threw out fifti pound of ballast and then wound up by mean of a windlass so much of the rope as brought it quit clear of the sea we perceiv the effect of thi manoeuvr immedi in a vastli increas

to maintain a foot although the crew seem to experi littl inconveni it appear to me a miracl of miracl that our enorm bulk is not swallow up at onc and forev we ar sure doom to hover continu upon the brink of etern without take a final plung into the abyss from billow a thousand time more stupend than ani i have ever seen we glide awai with the facil of the arrowi seagul and the coloss water rear their head abov us like demon of the deep but like demon confin to simpl threat and forbidden to destroi i am led to attribut these frequent escap to the onli natur caus which can account for such effecti must suppos the ship to be within the influenc of some strong current or impetu undertow i have seen the captain face to face and in hi own cabinbut as i expect he paid me no attent although in hi appear there is to a casual observ noth which might bespeak him more or less than manstil a feel of irrepress rever and aw mingl with the sensat of wonder with which i regard him in statur he is nearli my own height that is about five feet eight inch he is of a wellknit and compact frame of bodi neither robust nor remark otherwis but it is the singular of the express which reign upon the faceit is the intens the wonder the thrill evid of old ag so utter so extrem which excit within my spirit a sensea sentiment ineff hi forehead although littl wrinkl seem to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of yearshi grai hair ar record of the past and hi grayer ey ar sybil of the futur the cabin floor wa thickli strewn with strang ironclasp folio and moulder instrument of scienc and obsolet longforgotten chart hi head wa bow down upon hi hand and he pore with a fieri unquiet ey over a paper which i took to be a commiss and which at all event bore the signatur of a monarch he mutter to himself as did the first seaman whom i saw in the hold some low peevish syllabl of a foreign tongu and although the speaker wa close at my elbow hi voic seem to reach my ear from the distanc of a mile the ship and all in it ar imbu with the spirit of eld the crew glide to and fro like the ghost of buri centuri their ey have an eager and uneasi mean and when their finger fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battlelantern i feel as i have never felt befor although i have been all my life a dealer in antiqu and have imbib the shadow of fallen column at balbec and tadmor and persepoli until my veri soul ha becom a ruin when i look around me i feel asham of my former apprehens if i trembl at the blast which ha hitherto attend us shall i not stand aghast at a war of wind and ocean to convei ani idea of which the word tornado and simoom ar trivial and ineffect all in the immedi vicin of the ship is the black of etern night and a chao of foamless water but about a leagu on either side of us mai be seen indistinctli and at interv stupend rampart of ic tower awai into the desol sky and look like the wall of the univers as i imagin the ship prove to be in a current if that appel can properli be given to a tide which howl and shriek by the white ic thunder on to the southward with a veloc like the headlong dash of a cataract to conceiv the horror of my sensat is i presum utterli imposs yet a curios to penetr the mysteri of these aw region predomin even over my despair and will reconcil me to the most hideou aspect of death it is evid that we ar hurri onward to some excit knowledgesom nevertobeimpart secret whose attain is destruct perhap thi current lead us to the southern pole itself it must be confess that a supposit appar so wild ha everi probabl in it favor the crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremul step but there is upon their counten an express more of the eager of hope than of the apathi of despair in the meantim the wind is still in our poop and as we carri a crowd of canva the ship is at time lift bodili from out the seaoh horror upon horror the ic open suddenli to the right and to the left and we ar whirl dizzili in immens concentr circl round and round the border of a gigant amphitheatr the summit of whose wall is lost in the dark and the distanc but littl time will be left me to ponder upon my destinyth circl rapidli grow smallw ar plung madli within the grasp of the whirlpooland amid a roar and bellow and thunder of ocean and of tempest the ship is quiver oh god andgo down noteth ms found in a bottl wa origin publish in and it wa not until mani year afterward that i becam acquaint with the map of mercat in which the ocean is repres as rush by four mouth into the northern polar gulf to be absorb into the bowel of the earth the pole itself be repres by a black rock tower to a prodigi height the oval portrait the chateau into which my valet had ventur to make forcibl entranc rather than permit me in my desper wound condit to pass a night in the open air wa on of those pile of commingl gloom and grandeur which have so long frown among the appennin not less in fact than in the fanci of mr radcliff to all appear it had been temporarili and veri late abandon we establish ourselv in on of the smallest and least sumptuous furnish apart it lai in a remot turret of the build it decor were rich yet tatter and antiqu it wall were hung with tapestri and bedeck with manifold and multiform armori trophi togeth with an unusu great number of veri spirit modern paint in frame of rich golden arabesqu in these paint which depend from the wall not onli in their main surfac but in veri mani nook which the bizarr architectur of the chateau render necessaryin these paint my incipi delirium perhap had caus me to take deep interest so that i bade pedro to close the heavi shutter of the roomsinc it wa alreadi nightto light the tongu of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bedand to throw open far and wide the fring curtain of black velvet which envelop the bed itself i wish all thi done that i might resign myself if not to sleep at least altern to the contempl of these pictur and the perus of a small volum which had been found upon the pillow and which purport to criticis and describ them longlong i readand devoutli devotedli i gaze rapidli and glorious the hour flew by and the deep midnight came the posit of the candelabrum displeas me and outreach my hand with difficulti rather than disturb my slumber valet i place it so as to throw it rai more fulli upon the book but the action produc an effect altogeth unanticip the rai of the numer candl for there were mani now fell within a nich of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by on of the bedpost i thu saw in vivid light a pictur all unnot befor it wa the portrait of a young girl just ripen into womanhood i glanc at the paint hurriedli and then close my ey why i did thi wa not at first appar even to my own percept but while my lid remain thu shut i ran over in my mind my reason for so shut them it wa an impuls movement to gain time for thoughtto make sure that my vision had not deceiv meto calm and subdu my fanci for a more sober and more certain gaze in a veri few moment i again look fixedli at the paint that i now saw aright i could not and would not doubt for the first flash of the candl upon that canva had seem to dissip the dreami stupor which wa steal over my sens and to startl me at onc into wake life the portrait i have alreadi said wa that of a young girl it wa a mere head and shoulder done in what is technic term a vignett manner much in the style of the favorit head of sulli the arm the bosom and even the end of the radiant hair melt impercept into the vagu yet deep shadow which form the background of the whole the frame wa oval richli gild and filigre in moresqu as a thing of art noth could be more admir than the paint itself but it could have been neither the execut of the work nor the immort beauti of the counten which had so suddenli and so vehement move me least of all could it have been that my fanci shaken from it half slumber had mistaken the head for that of a live person i saw at onc that the peculiar of the design of the vignet and of the frame must have instantli dispel such ideamust have prevent even it momentari entertain think earnestli upon these point i remain for an hour perhap half sit half reclin with my vision rivet upon the portrait at length satisfi with the true secret of it effect i fell back within the bed i had found the spell of the pictur in an absolut lifelikeli of express which at first startl final confound subdu and appal me with deep and rever aw i replac the candelabrum in it former posit the caus of my deep agit be thu shut from view i sought eagerli the volum which discuss the paint and their histori turn to the number which design the oval portrait i there read the vagu and quaint word which follow she wa a maiden of rarest beauti and not more love than full of glee and evil wa the hour when she saw and love and wed the painter he passion studiou auster and have alreadi a bride in hi art she a maiden of rarest beauti and not more love than full of glee all light and smile and frolicsom as the young fawn love and cherish all thing hate onli the art which wa her rival dread onli the pallet and brush and other untoward instrument which depriv her of the counten of her lover it wa thu a terribl thing for thi ladi to hear the painter speak of hi desir to portrai even hi young bride but she wa humbl and obedi and sat meekli for mani week in the dark high turretchamb where the light drip upon the pale canva onli from overhead but he the painter took glori in hi work which went on from hour to hour and from dai to dai and he wa a passion and wild and moodi man who becam lost in reveri so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastli in that lone turret wither the health and the spirit of hi bride who pine visibl to all but him yet she smile on and still on uncomplainingli becaus she saw that the painter who had high renown took a fervid and burn pleasur in hi task and wrought dai and night to depict her who so love him yet who grew daili more dispirit and weak and in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of it resembl in low word as of a mighti marvel and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of hi deep love for her whom he depict so surpassingli well but at length as the labor drew nearer to it conclus there were admit none into the turret for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of hi work and turn hi ey from canva mere even to regard the counten of hi wife and he would not see that the tint which he spread upon the canva were drawn from the cheek of her who sate besid him and when mani week had pass and but littl remain to do save on brush upon the mouth and on tint upon the ey the spirit of the ladi again flicker up as the flame within the socket of the lamp and then the brush wa given and then the tint wa place and for on moment the painter stood entranc befor the work which he had wrought but in the next while he yet gaze he grew tremul and
