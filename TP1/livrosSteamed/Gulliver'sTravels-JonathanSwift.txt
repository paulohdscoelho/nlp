among my brethren have therefor consult with my wife and some of my acquaint i determin to go again to sea i wa surgeon success in two ship and made sever voyag for six year to the east and west indi by which i got some addit to my fortun my hour of leisur i spent in read the best author ancient and modern be alwai provid with a good number of book and when i wa ashor in observ the manner and disposit of the peopl as well as learn their languag wherein i had a great facil by the strength of my memori the last of these voyag not prove veri fortun i grew weari of the sea and intend to stai at home with my wife and famili i remov from the old jewri to fetter lane and from thenc to wap hope to get busi among the sailor but it would not turn to account after three year expect that thing would mend i accept an advantag offer from captain william prichard master of the antelop who wa make a voyag to the south sea we set sail from bristol mai and our voyag at first wa veri prosper it would not be proper for some reason to troubl the reader with the particular of our adventur in those sea let it suffic to inform him that in our passag from thenc to the east indi we were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of van diemen land by an observ we found ourselv in the latitud of degre and minut south twelv of our crew were dead by immoder labor and ill food the rest were in a veri weak condit on the fifth of novemb which wa the begin of summer in those part the weather be veri hazi the seamen spi a rock within half a cabl length of the ship but the wind wa so strong that we were driven directli upon it and immedi split six of the crew of whom i wa on have let down the boat into the sea made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock we row by my comput about three leagu till we were abl to work no longer be alreadi spent with labor while we were in the ship we therefor trust ourselv to the merci of the wave and in about half an hour the boat wa overset by a sudden flurri from the north what becam of my companion in the boat as well as those who escap on the rock or were left in the vessel i cannot tell but conclud thei were all lost for my own part i swam as fortun direct me and wa push forward by wind and tide i often let my leg drop and could feel no bottom but when i wa almost gone and abl to struggl no longer i found myself within my depth and by thi time the storm wa much abat the decliv wa so small that i walk near a mile befor i got to the shore which i conjectur wa about eight oclock in the even i then advanc forward near half a mile but could not discov ani sign of hous or inhabit at least i wa in so weak a condit that i did not observ them i wa extrem tire and with that and the heat of the weather and about half a pint of brandi that i drank as i left the ship i found myself much inclin to sleep i lai down on the grass which wa veri short and soft where i slept sounder than ever i rememb to have done in my life and as i reckon about nine hour for when i awak it wa just daylight i attempt to rise but wa not abl to stir for as i happen to lie on my back i found my arm and leg were strongli fasten on each side to the ground and my hair which wa long and thick ti down in the same manner i likewis felt sever slender ligatur across my bodi from my armpit to my thigh i could onli look upward the sun began to grow hot and the light offend my ey i heard a confus nois about me but in the postur i lai could see noth except the sky in a littl time i felt someth aliv move on my left leg which advanc gentli forward over my breast came almost up to my chin when bend my ey downward as much as i could i perceiv it to be a human creatur not six inch high with a bow and arrow in hi hand and a quiver at hi back in the meantim i felt at least forti more of the same kind as i conjectur follow the first i wa in the utmost astonish and roar so loud that thei all ran back in a fright and some of them as i wa afterward told were hurt with the fall thei got by leap from my side upon the ground howev thei soon return and on of them who ventur so far as to get a full sight of my face lift up hi hand and ey by wai of admir cri out in a shrill but distinct voicehekinah degul the other repeat the same word sever time but i then knew not what thei meant i lai all thi while as the reader mai believ in great uneasi at length struggl to get loos i had the fortun to break the string and wrench out the peg that fasten my left arm to the ground for by lift it up to my face i discov the method thei had taken to bind me and at the same time with a violent pull which gave me excess pain i a littl loosen the string that ti down my hair on the left side so that i wa just abl to turn my head about two inch but the creatur ran off a second time befor i could seiz them whereupon there wa a great shout in a veri shrill accent and after it ceas i heard on of them cry aloud tolgo phonac when in an instant i felt abov an hundr arrow discharg on my left hand which prick me like so mani needl and besid thei shot anoth flight into the air as we do bomb in europ whereof mani i suppos fell on my bodi though i felt them not and some on my face which i immedi cover with my left hand when thi shower of arrow wa over i fell agroan with grief and pain and then strive again to get loos thei discharg anoth vollei larger than the first and some of them attempt with spear to stick me in the side but by good luck i had on me a buff jerkin which thei could not pierc i thought it the most prudent method to lie still and my design wa to continu so till night when my left hand be alreadi loos i could easili free myself and as for the inhabit i had reason to believ i might be a match for the greatest armi thei could bring against me if thei were all of the same size with him that i saw illustr i lai all thi while in great uneasi p but fortun dispos otherwis of me when the peopl observ i wa quiet thei discharg no more arrow but by the nois i heard i knew their number increas and about four yard from me over against my right ear i heard a knock for abov an hour like that of peopl at work when turn my head that wai as well as the peg and string would permit me i saw a stage erect about a foot and a half from the ground capabl of hold four of the inhabit with two or three ladder to mount it from whenc on of them who seem to be a person of qualiti made me a long speech whereof i understood not on syllabl illustr but i should have mention that befor the princip person began hi orat he cri out three time langro debul san these word and the former were afterward repeat and explain to me whereupon immedi about fifti of the inhabit came and cut the string that fasten the left side of my head which gave me the liberti of turn it to the right and of observ the person and gestur of him that wa to speak he appear to be of a middl ag and taller than ani of the other three who attend him whereof on wa a page that held up hi train and seem to be somewhat longer than my middl finger the other two stood on on each side to support him he act everi part of an orat and i could observ mani period of threaten and other of promis piti and kind i answer in a few word but in the most submiss manner lift up my left hand and both my ey to the sun as call him for a wit and be almost famish with hunger have not eaten a morsel for some hour befor i left the ship i found the demand of natur so strong upon me that i could not forbear show my impati perhap against the strict rule of decenc by put my finger frequent to my mouth to signifi that i want food the hurgo for so thei call a great lord as i afterward learn understood me veri well he descend from the stage and command that sever ladder should be appli to my side on which abov a hundr of the inhabit mount and walk toward my mouth laden with basket full of meat which had been provid and sent thither by the king order upon the first intellig he receiv of me i observ there wa the flesh of sever anim but could not distinguish them by the tast there were shoulder leg and loin shape like those of mutton and veri well dress but smaller than the wing of a lark i at them by two or three at a mouth and took three loav at a time about the big of musket bullet thei suppli me as thei could show a thousand mark of wonder and astonish at my bulk and appetit i then made anoth sign that i want drink thei found by my eat that a small quantiti would not suffic me and be a most ingeni peopl thei slung up with great dexter on of their largest hogshead then roll it toward my hand and beat out the top i drank it off at a draught which i might well do for it did not hold half a pint and tast like a small wine of burgundi but much more delici thei brought me a second hogshead which i drank in the same manner and made sign for more but thei had none to give me when i had perform these wonder thei shout for joi and danc upon my breast repeat sever time as thei did at first hekinah degul thei made me a sign that i should throw down the two hogshead but first warn the peopl below to stand out of the wai cry aloud borach nevola and when thei saw the vessel in the air there wa an univers shout of hekinah degul i confess i wa often tempt while thei were pass backward and forward on my bodi to seiz forti or fifti of the first that came in my reach and dash them against the ground but the remembr of what i had felt which probabl might not be the worst thei could do and the promis of honor i made themfor so i interpret my submiss behaviorsoon drove out those imagin besid i now consid myself as bound by the law of hospit to a peopl who had treat me with so much expens and magnific howev in my thought i could not suffici wonder at the intrepid of these diminut mortal who durst ventur to mount and walk upon my bodi while on of my hand wa at liberti without trembl at the veri sight of so prodigi a creatur as i must appear to them illustr produc hi credenti p after some time when thei observ that i made no more demand for meat there appear befor me a person of high rank from hi imperi majesti hi excel have mount on the small of my right leg advanc forward up to my face with about a dozen of hi retinu and produc hi credenti under the signetroy which he appli close to my ey spoke about ten minut without ani sign of anger but with a kind of determin resolut often point forward which as i afterward found wa toward the capit citi about half a mile distant whither it wa agre by hi majesti in council that i must be convei i answer in few word but to no purpos and made a sign with my hand that wa loos put it to the other but over hi excel head for fear of hurt him or hi train and then to my own head and bodi to signifi that i desir my liberti it appear that he understood me well enough for he shook hi head by wai of disapprob and held hi hand in a postur to show that i must be carri as a prison howev he made other sign to let me understand that i should have meat and drink enough and veri good treatment whereupon i onc more thought of attempt to break my bond but again when i felt the smart of their arrow upon my face and hand which were all in blister and mani of the dart still stick in them and observ likewis that the number of my enemi increas i gave token to let them know that thei might do with me what thei pleas upon thi the hurgo and hi train withdrew with much civil and cheer counten soon after i heard a gener shout with frequent repetit of the word peplom selan and i felt great number of peopl on my left side relax the cord to such a degre that i wa abl to turn upon my right and to get a littl eas but befor thi thei had daub my face and both my hand with a sort of ointment veri pleasant to the smell which in a few minut remov all the smart of their arrow these circumst ad to the refresh i had receiv by their victual and drink which were veri nourish dispos me to sleep i slept about eight hour as i wa afterward assur and it wa no wonder for the physician by the emperor order had mingl a sleepi potion in the hogshead of wine it seem that upon the first moment i wa discov sleep on the ground after my land the emperor had earli notic of it by an express and determin in council that i should be ti in the manner i have relat which wa done in the night while i slept that plenti of meat and drink should be sent to me and a machin prepar to carri me to the capit citi thi resolut perhap mai appear veri bold and danger and i am confid would not be imit by ani princ in europ on the like occas howev in my opinion it wa extrem prudent as well as gener for suppos these peopl had endeavor to kill me with their spear and arrow while i wa asleep i should certainli have awak with the first sens of smart which might so far have rous my rage and strength as to have enabl me to break the string wherewith i wa ti after which as thei were not abl to make

that if it had not been for the present situat of thing at court perhap i might not have obtain it so soon for said he as flourish a condit as we mai appear to be in to foreign we labor under two mighti evil a violent faction at home and the danger of an invas by a most potent enemi from abroad as to the first you ar to understand that for abov seventi moon past there have been two struggl parti in thi empir under the name of tramecksan and slamecksan from the high and low heel of their shoe by which thei distinguish themselv it is alleg inde that the high heel ar most agreeabl to our ancient constitut but howev thi mai be hi majesti hath determin to make us onli of low heel in the administr of the govern and all offic in the gift of the crown as you cannot but observ and particularli that hi majesti imperi heel ar lower at least by a drurr than ani of hi court drurr is a measur about the fourteenth part of an inch the animos between these two parti run so high that thei will neither eat nor drink nor talk with each other we comput the tramecksan or high heel to exce us in number but the power is wholli on our side we apprehend hi imperi high the heir to the crown to have some tendenc toward the high heel at least we can plainli discov that on of hi heel is higher than the other which give him a hobbl in hi gait now in the midst of these intestin disquiet we ar threaten with an invas from the island of blefuscu which is the other great empir of the univers almost as larg and power as thi of hi majesti for as to what we have heard you affirm that there ar other kingdom and state in the world inhabit by human creatur as larg as yourself our philosoph ar in much doubt and would rather conjectur that you drop from the moon or on of the star becaus it is certain that an hundr mortal of your bulk would in a short time destroi all the fruit and cattl of hi majesti dominion besid our histori of six thousand moon make no mention of ani other region than the two great empir of lilliput and blefuscu which two mighti power have as i wa go to tell you been engag in a most obstin war for sixandthirti moon past it began upon the follow occas it is allow on all hand that the primit wai of break egg befor we eat them wa upon the larger end but hi present majesti grandfath while he wa a boi go to eat an egg and break it accord to the ancient practic happen to cut on of hi finger whereupon the emperor hi father publish an edict command all hi subject upon great penalti to break the smaller end of their egg the peopl so highli resent thi law that our histori tell us there have been six rebellion rais on that account wherein on emperor lost hi life and anoth hi crown these civil commot were constantli foment by the monarch of blefuscu and when thei were quell the exil alwai fled for refug to that empir it is comput that eleven thousand person have at sever time suffer death rather than submit to break their egg at the smaller end mani hundr larg volum have been publish upon thi controversi but the book of the bigendian have been long forbidden and the whole parti render incap by law of hold employ dure the cours of these troubl the emperor of blefuscu did frequent expostul by their ambassador accus us of make a schism in religion by offend against a fundament doctrin of our great prophet lustrog in the fiftyfourth chapter of the blundecr which is their alcoran thi howev is thought to be a mere strain upon the text for the word ar these that all true believ break their egg at the conveni end and which is the conveni end seem in my humbl opinion to be left to everi man conscienc or at least in the power of the chief magistr to determin now the bigendian exil have found so much credit in the emperor of blefuscu court and so much privat assist and encourag from their parti here at home that a bloodi war hath been carri on between the two empir for sixandthirti moon with variou success dure which time we have lost forti capit ship and a much greater number of smaller vessel togeth with thirti thousand of our best seamen and soldier and the damag receiv by the enemi is reckon to be somewhat greater than our howev thei have now equip a numer fleet and ar just prepar to make a descent upon us and hi imperi majesti place great confid in your valor and strength hath command me to lai thi account of hi affair befor you illustr illustr i desir the secretari to present my humbl duti to the emperor and to let him know that i thought it would not becom me who wa a foreign to interfer with parti but i

north northeast of lilliput from whenc it is part onli by a channel of eight hundr yard wide i had not yet seen it and upon thi notic of an intend invas i avoid appear on that side of the coast for fear of be discov by some of the enemi ship who had receiv no intellig of me all intercours between the two empir have been strictli forbidden dure the war upon the pain of death and an embargo laid by our emperor upon all vessel whatsoev i commun to hi majesti a project i had form of seiz the enemi whole fleet which as our scout assur us lai at anchor in the harbor readi to sail with the first fair wind i consult the most experienc seamen upon the depth of the channel which thei had often plumb who told me that in the middl at high water it wa seventi glumgluff deep which is about six feet of european measur and the rest of it fifti glumgluff at most i walk toward the northeast coast over against blefuscu where ly down behind a hillock i took out my small perspect glass and view the enemi fleet at anchor consist of about fifti menofwar and a great number of transport i then came back to my hous and gave order for which i had a warrant for a great quantiti of the strongest cabl and bar of iron the cabl wa about as thick as packthread and the bar of the length and size of a knit needl i trebl the cabl to make it stronger and for the same reason i twist three of the iron bar togeth bend the extrem into a hook have thu fix fifti hook to as mani cabl i went back to the northeast coast and put off my coat shoe and stock walk into the sea in my leathern jerkin about half an hour befor highwat i wade with what hast i could and swam in the middl about thirti yard till i felt ground i arriv at the fleet in less than half an hour the enemi were so frighten when thei saw me that thei leap out of their ship and swam to shore where there could not be fewer than thirti thousand soul i then took my tackl and fasten a hook to the hole at the prow of each i ti all the cord togeth at the end while i wa thu emploi the enemi discharg sever thousand arrow mani of which stuck in my hand and face and besid the excess smart gave me much disturb in my work my greatest apprehens wa for mine ey which i should have infal lost if i had not suddenli thought of an expedi i kept among other littl necessari a pair of spectacl in a privat pocket which as i observ befor had escap the emperor searcher these i took out and fasten as strongli as i could upon my nose and thu arm went on boldli with my work in spite of the enemi arrow mani of which struck against the glass of my spectacl but without ani other effect farther than a littl to discompos them i had now fasten all the hook and take the knot in my hand began to pull but not a ship would stir for thei were all too fast held by their anchor so that the boldest part of my enterpris remain i therefor let go the cord and leav the hook fix to the ship i resolut cut with my knife the cabl that fasten the anchor receiv abov two hundr shot in my face and hand then i took up the knot end of the cabl to which my hook were ti and with great eas drew fifti of the enemi largest menofwar after me the blefuscudian who had not the least imagin of what i intend were at first confound with astonish thei had seen me cut the cabl and thought my design wa onli to let the ship run adrift or fall foul on each other but when thei perceiv the whole fleet move in order and saw me pull at the end thei set up such a scream of grief and despair as it is almost imposs to describ or conceiv when i had got out of danger i stop awhil to pick out the arrow that stuck in my hand and face and rub on some of the same ointment that wa given me at my first arriv as i have formerli mention i then took off my spectacl and wait about an hour till the tide wa a littl fallen i wade through the middl with my cargo and arriv safe at the royal port of lilliput the emperor and hi whole court stood on the shore expect the issu of thi great adventur thei saw the ship move forward in a larg halfmoon but could not discern me who wa up to my breast in water when i advanc to the middl of the channel thei were yet more in pain becaus i wa under water to my neck the emperor conclud me to be drown and that the enemi fleet wa approach in an hostil manner but he wa soon eas of hi fear for the channel grow shallow everi step i made i came in a short time within hear and hold up the end of the cabl by which the fleet wa fasten i cri in a loud voic long live the most puissant emperor of lilliput thi great princ receiv me at my land with all possibl encomium and creat me a nardac upon the spot which is the highest titl of honor among them hi majesti desir i would take some other opportun of bring all the rest of hi enemi ship into hi port and so immeasur is the ambit of princ that he seem to think of noth less than reduc the whole empir of blefuscu into a provinc and govern it by viceroi of destroi the bigendian exil and compel that peopl to break the smaller end of their egg by which he would remain the sole monarch of the whole world but i endeavor to divert him from thi design by mani argument drawn from the topic of polici as well as justic and i plainli protest that i would never be an instrument of bring a free and brave peopl into slaveri and when the matter wa debat in council the wisest part of the ministri were of my opinion illustr and creat me a nardac upon the spot p thi open bold declar of mine wa so opposit to the scheme and polit of hi imperi majesti that he could never forgiv me he mention it in a veri art manner at council where i wa told that some of the wisest appear at least by their silenc to be of my opinion but other who were my secret enemi could not forbear some express which by a sidewind reflect on me and from thi time began an intrigu between hi majesti and a junto of minist malici bent against me which broke out in less than two month and had like to have end in my utter destruct of so littl weight ar the greatest servic to princ when put into the balanc with a refus to gratifi their passion about three week after thi exploit there arriv a solemn embassi from blefuscu with humbl offer of peac which wa soon conclud upon condit veri advantag to our emperor wherewith i shall not troubl the reader there were six ambassador with a train of about five hundr person and their entri wa veri magnific suitabl to the grandeur of their master and the import of their busi when their treati wa finish wherein i did them sever good offic by the credit i now had or at least appear to have at court their excel who were privat told how much i had been their friend made me a visit in form thei began with mani compliment upon my valor and generos invit me to that kingdom in the emperor their master name and desir me to show some proof of my prodigi strength of which thei had heard so mani wonder wherein i readili oblig them but shall not troubl the reader with the particular illustr when i had for some time entertain their excel to their infinit satisfact and surpris i desir thei would do me the honor to present my most humbl respect to the emperor their master the renown of whose virtu had so justli fill the whole world with admir and whose royal person i resolv to attend befor i return to my own countri accordingli the next time i had the honor to see our emperor i desir hi gener licens to wait on the blefuscudian monarch which he wa pleas to grant me as i could plainli perceiv in a veri cold manner but could not guess the reason till i had a whisper from a certain person that flimnap and bolgolam had repres my intercours with those ambassador as a mark of disaffect from which i am sure my heart wa wholli free and thi wa the first time i began to conceiv some imperfect idea of court and minist it is to be observ that these ambassador spoke to me by an interpret the languag of both empir differ as much from each other as ani two in europ and each nation pride itself upon the antiqu beauti and energi of it own tongu with an avow contempt for that of it neighbor yet our emperor stand upon the advantag he had got by the seizur of their fleet oblig them to deliv their credenti and make their speech in the lilliputian tongu and it must be confess that from the great intercours of trade and commerc between both realm from the continu recept of exil which is mutual among them and from the custom in each empir to send their young nobil and richer gentri to the other in order to polish themselv by see the world and understand men and manner there ar few person of distinct or merchant or seamen who dwell in the maritim part but what can hold convers in both tongu as i found some week after when i went to pai my respect to the emperor of blefuscu which in the midst of great misfortun through the malic of my enemi prove a veri happi adventur to me as i shall relat in it proper place the reader mai rememb that when i sign those articl upon which i recov my liberti there were some which i dislik upon account of their be too servil neither could anyth but an extrem necess have forc me to submit but be now a nardac of the highest rank in that empir such offic were look upon as below my digniti and the emperor to do him justic never onc mention them to me howev it wa not long befor i had an opportun of do hi majesti at least as i then thought a most signal servic i wa alarm at midnight with the cri of mani hundr peopl at my door by which be suddenli awak i wa in some kind of terror i heard the word burglum repeat incessantli sever of the emperor court make their wai through the crowd entreat me to come immedi to the palac where her imperi majesti apart wa on fire by the careless of a maid of honor who fell asleep while she wa read a romanc i got up in an instant and order be given to clear the wai befor me and it be likewis a moonshin night i made a shift to get to the palac without trampl on ani of the peopl i found thei had alreadi appli ladder to the wall of the apart and were well provid with bucket but the water wa at some distanc these bucket were about the size of a larg thimbl and the poor peopl suppli me with them as fast as thei could but the flame wa so violent that thei did littl good i might easili have stifl it with my coat which i unfortun left behind me for hast and came awai onli in my leathern jerkin the case seem wholli desper and deplor and thi magnific palac would have infal been burnt down to the ground if by a presenc of mind unusu to me i had not suddenli thought of an expedi by which in three minut the fire wa wholli extinguish and the rest of that nobl pile which had cost so mani ag in erect preserv from destruct illustr it wa now daylight and i return to my hous without wait to congratul with the emperor becaus although i had done a veri emin piec of servic yet i could not tell how hi majesti might resent the manner by which i had perform it for by the fundament law of the realm it is capit in ani man of what qualiti soever to even touch the empress or the royal princess without invit but i wa a littl comfort by a messag from hi majesti that he would give order to the grand justiciari for pass my pardon in form which howev i could not obtain and i wa privat assur that the empress conceiv the greatest abhorr of me and in the presenc of her chief confid could not forbear vow reveng chapter vi of the inhabit of lilliput their learn law and custom the manner of educ their children the author wai of live in that countri although i intend to leav the descript of thi empir to a particular treatis yet in the meantim i am content to gratifi the curiou reader with some gener idea as the common size of the nativ is somewhat under six inch high so there is an exact proport in all other anim as well as plant and tree for instanc the tallest hors and oxen ar between four and five inch in height the sheep an inch and a half more or less their gees about the big of a sparrow and so the sever gradat downward till you come to the smallest which to my sight were almost invis but natur hath adapt the ey of the lilliputian to all object proper for their view thei see with great exact but at no great distanc and to show the sharp of their sight toward object that ar near i have been much pleas with observ a cook pull a lark which wa not so larg as a common fly and a young girl thread an invis needl with invis silk their tallest tree ar about seven feet high i mean some of those in the great royal park the top whereof i could but just reach with my fist clench the other veget ar in the same proport but thi i leav to the reader imagin i shall sai but littl at present of their learn which for mani ag hath flourish in all it branch among them but their manner of write is veri peculiar be neither from the left to the right like the european nor from the right to the left like the arabian nor from up to down like the chines but aslant from on corner of the paper to the other like ladi in england thei buri their dead with their head directli downward becaus thei hold an opinion that in eleven thousand moon thei ar all to rise again in which period the earth which thei conceiv to be flat will turn upsid down and by thi mean thei shall at the resurrect be found readi stand on their feet the learn among them confess the absurd of thi doctrin but the practic still continu in complianc to the vulgar there ar some law and custom in thi empir veri peculiar and if thei were not so directli contrari to those of my own dear countri i should be tempt to sai a littl in their justif it is onli to be wish thei were as well execut the first i shall mention relat to inform all crime against the state ar punish here with the utmost sever but if the person accus maketh hi innoc plainli to appear upon hi trial the accus is immedi put to an ignomini death and out of hi good or land the innoc person is quadrupli recompens for the loss of hi time for the danger he underw for the hardship of hi imprison and for all the charg he hath been at in make hi defenc or it that fund be defici it is larg suppli by the crown the emperor also confer on him some public mark of hi favor and proclam is made of hi innoc through the whole citi thei look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft and therefor seldom fail to punish it with death for thei alleg that care and vigil with a veri common understand mai preserv a man good from thiev but honesti ha no fenc against superior cun and sinc it is necessari that there should be a perpetu intercours of bui and sell and deal upon credit where fraud is permit and conniv at or hath no law to punish it the honest dealer is alwai undon and the knave get the advantag i rememb when i wa onc interced with the king for a crimin who had wrong hi master of a great sum of monei which he had receiv by order and run awai with and happen to tell hi majesti by wai of extenu that it wa onli a breach of trust the emperor thought it monstrou in me to offer as a defenc the greatest aggrav of the crime and truli i had littl to sai in return farther than the common answer that differ nation had differ custom for i confess i wa heartili asham although we usual call reward and punish the two hing upon which all govern turn yet i could never observ thi maxim to be put in practic by ani nation except that of lilliput whoever can there bring suffici proof that he hath strictli observ the law of hi countri for seventythre moon hath a claim to certain privileg accord to hi qualiti and condit of life with a proportion sum of out of a fund appropri for that us he likewis acquir the titl of snillpal or legal which is ad to hi name but doth not descend to hi poster and these peopl thought it a prodigi defect of polici among us when i told them that our law were enforc onli by penalti without ani mention of reward it is upon thi account that the imag of justic in their court of judicatur is form with six ey two befor as mani behind and on each side on to signifi circumspect with a bag of gold open in her right hand and a sword sheath in her left to show she wa more dispos to reward than to punish in choos person for all employ thei have more regard to good moral than to great abil for sinc govern is necessari to mankind thei believ that the common size of human understand is fit to some station or other and that provid never intend to make the manag of public affair a mysteri to be comprehend onli by a few person of sublim geniu of which there seldom ar three born in an ag but thei suppos truth justic temper and the like to be in everi man power the practic of which virtu assist by experi and a good intent would qualifi ani man for the servic of hi countri except where a cours of studi is requir but thei thought the want of moral virtu wa so far from be suppli by superior endow of the mind that employ could never be put into such danger hand as those of person so qualifi and at least that the mistak commit by ignor in a virtuou disposit would never be of such fatal consequ to the public weal as the practic of a man whose inclin led him to be corrupt and who had great abil to manag to multipli and defend hi corrupt in like manner the disbelief of a divin provid render a man incap of hold ani public station for sinc king avow themselv to be the deputi of provid the lilliputian think noth can be more absurd than for a princ to emploi such men as disown the author under which he act in relat these and the follow law i would onli be understood to mean the origin institut and not the most scandal corrupt into which these peopl ar fallen by the degener natur of man for as to that infam practic of acquir great employ by danc on the rope or badg of

increas of parti and faction ingratitud is among them a capit crime as we read it to have been in some other countri for thei reason thu that whoever make ill return to hi benefactor must need be a common enemi to the rest of mankind from whom he hath receiv no oblig and therefor such a man is not fit to live their notion relat to the duti of parent and children differ extrem from our their opinion is that parent ar the last of all other to be trust with the educ of their own children and therefor thei have in everi town public nurseri where all parent except cottag and labor ar oblig to send their infant of both sex to be rear and educ when thei come to the ag of twenti moon at which time thei ar suppos to have some rudiment of docil these school ar of sever kind suit to differ qualiti and to both sex thei have certain professor well skill in prepar children for such a condit of life as befit the rank of their parent and their own capac as well as inclin i shall first sai someth of the male nurseri and then of the femal the nurseri for male of nobl or emin birth ar provid with grave and learn professor and their sever deputi the cloth and food of the children ar plain

presenc of a professor or on of hi deputi wherebi thei avoid those earli bad impress of folli and vice to which our children ar subject their parent ar suffer to see them onli twice a year the visit to last but an hour thei ar allow to kiss the child at meet and part but a professor who alwai stand by on those occas will not suffer them to whisper or us ani fondl express or bring ani present of toi sweetmeat and the like the pension from each famili for the educ and entertain of a child upon failur of due payment is levi by the emperor offic the nurseri for children of ordinari gentlemen merchant trader and handicraft ar manag proportion after the same manner onli those design for trade ar put out apprentic at eleven year old wherea those person of qualiti continu in their exercis

for their maxim is that among peopl of qualiti a wife should be alwai a reason and agreeabl companion becaus she cannot alwai be young when the girl ar twelv year old which among them is the marriag

children at these nurseri ar oblig besid their annual pension which is as low as possibl to return to the steward of the nurseri a small monthli share of their get to be a portion for the child and therefor all parent ar limit in their expens by the law for the lilliputian think noth can be more unjust than for peopl to leav the burden of support their children on the public as to person of

rather than turn more northerli which might have brought us to the northwest part of great tartari and into the frozen sea on the sixteenth dai of june a boi on the topmast discov land on the seventeenth we came in full view of a great island or contin for we knew not which on the south side whereof wa a small neck of land jut out into the sea and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of abov on hundr ton we cast anchor within a leagu of thi creek and our captain sent a dozen of hi men well arm in the longboat with vessel for water if ani could be found i desir hi leav to go with them that i might see the countri and make what discoveri i could when we came to land we saw no river or spring nor ani sign of inhabit our men therefor wander on the shore to find out some fresh water near the sea and i walk alon about a mile on the other side where i observ the countri all barren and rocki i now began to be weari and see noth to entertain my curios i return gentli down toward the creek and the sea be full in my view i saw our men alreadi got into the boat and row for life to the ship i wa go to holla after them although it had been to littl purpos when i observ a huge creatur walk after them in the sea as fast as he could he wade not much deeper than hi knee and took prodigi stride but our men had the start of him about half a leagu and the sea thereabout be full of point rock the monster wa not abl to overtak the boat thi i wa afterward told for i durst not stai to see the issu of the adventur but ran as fast as i could the wai i first went and then climb up a steep hill which gave me some prospect of the countri i found it fulli cultiv but that which first surpris me wa the length of the grass which in those ground that seem to be kept for hai wa about twenti feet high illustr a huge creatur walk in the sea p i fell into a high road for so i took it to be though it serv to the inhabit onli as a footpath through a field of barlei here i walk on for some time but could see littl on either side it be now near harvest and the corn rise at least forti feet i wa an hour walk to the end of thi field which wa fenc in with a hedg of at least on hundr and twenti feet high and the tree so lofti that i could make no comput of their altitud there wa a stile to pass from thi field into the next it had four step and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost it wa imposs for me to climb thi stile becaus everi step wa six feet high and the upper stone abov twenti i wa endeavor to find some gap in the hedg when i discov on of the inhabit in the next field advanc toward the stile of the same size with him whom i saw in the sea pursu our boat he appear as tall as an ordinari spire steepl and took about ten yard at everi stride as near as i could guess i wa struck with the utmost fear and astonish and ran to hide myself in the corn from whenc i saw him at the top of the stile look back into the next field on the right hand and heard him call in a voic mani degre louder than a speak trumpet but the nois wa so high in the air that at first i certainli thought it wa thunder whereupon seven monster like himself came toward him with reapinghook in their hand each hook about the larg of six scyth these peopl were not so well clad as the first whose servant or labor thei seem to be for upon some word he spoke thei went to reap the corn in the field where i lai i kept from them at as great a distanc as i could but wa forc to move with extrem difficulti for the stalk of the corn were sometim not abov a foot distanc so that i could hardli squeez my bodi betwixt them howev i made a shift to go forward till i came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind here it wa imposs for me to advanc a step for the stalk were so interwoven that i could not creep through and the beard of the fallen ear so strong and point that thei pierc through my cloth into my flesh at the same time i heard the reaper not abov a hundr yard behind me be quit dispirit with toil and wholli overcom by grief and despair i lai down between two ridg and heartili wish i might there end my dai i bemoan my desol widow and fatherless children i lament my own folli and wil in attempt a second voyag against the advic of all my friend and relat in thi terribl agit of mind i could not forbear think of lilliput whose inhabit look upon me as the greatest prodigi that ever appear in the world where i wa abl to draw an imperi fleet in my hand and perform those other action which will be record forev in the chronicl of that empir while poster shall hardli believ them although attest by million i reflect what a mortif it must prove to me to appear as inconsider in thi nation as on singl lilliputian would be among us but thi i conceiv wa to be among the least of my misfortun for as human creatur ar observ to be more savag and cruel in proport to their bulk what could i expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enorm barbarian that should happen to seiz me undoubtedli philosoph ar in the right when thei tell us that noth is great or littl otherwis than by comparison it might have pleas fortun to let the lilliputian find some nation where the peopl were as diminut with respect to them as thei were to me and who know but that even thi prodigi race of mortal might be equal overmatch in some distant part of the world whereof we have yet no discoveri scare and confound as i wa i could not forbear go on with these reflect when on of the reaper approach within ten yard of the ridg where i lai made me apprehend that with the next step i should be squash to death under hi foot or cut in two with hi reapinghook and therefor when he wa again about to move i scream as loud as fear could make me whereupon the huge creatur trod short and look round about under him for some time at last espi me as i lai on the ground he consid awhil with the caution of on who endeavor to lai hold on a small danger anim in such a manner that it shall not be abl either to scratch or to bite him as i myself have sometim done with a weasel in england illustr whereupon the huge creatur trod short p at length he ventur to take me up between hi forefing and thumb and brought me within three yard of hi ey that he might behold my shape more perfectli i guess hi mean and my good fortun gave me so much presenc of mind that i resolv not to struggl in the least as he held me in the air abov sixti feet from the ground although he grievous pinch my side for fear i should slip through hi finger all i ventur wa to rais my ey toward the sun and place my hand togeth in a supplic postur and to speak some word in an humbl melancholi tone suitabl to the condit i then wa in for i apprehend everi moment that he would dash me against the ground as we usual do ani littl hate anim which we have a mind to destroi but my good star would have it that he appear pleas with my voic and gestur and began to look upon me as a curios much wonder to hear me pronounc articul word although he could not understand them in the meantim i wa not abl to forbear groan and shed tear and turn my head toward my side let him know as well as i could how cruelli i wa hurt by the pressur of hi thumb and finger he seem to apprehend my mean for lift up the lappet of hi coat he put me gentli into it and immedi ran along with me to hi master who wa a substanti farmer and the same person i had first seen in the field the farmer have as i suppos by their talk receiv such an account of me as hi servant could give him took a piec of a small straw about the size of a walkingstaff and therewith lift up the lappet of my coat which it seem he thought to be some kind of cover that natur had given me he blew my hair asid to take a better view of my face he call hi hind about him and ask them as i afterward learn whether thei had ever seen in the field ani littl creatur that resembl me he then place me softli on the ground upon all four but i got immedi up and walk slowli backward and forward to let those peopl see that i had no intent to run awai thei all sat down in a circl about me the better to observ my motion i pull off my hat and made a low bow toward the farmer i fell on my knee and lift up my hand and ey and spoke sever word as loud as i could i took a purs of gold out of my pocket and humbl present it to him he receiv it on the palm of hi hand then appli it close to hi ey to see what it wa and afterward turn it sever time with the point of a pin which he took out of hi sleev but could make noth of it whereupon i made a sign that he should place hi hand on the ground i then took the purs and open it pour all the gold into hi palm there were six spanish piec of four pistol each besid twenti or thirti smaller coin i saw him wet the tip of hi littl finger upon hi tongu and take up on of my largest piec and then anoth but he seem to be wholli ignor what thei were he made me a sign to put them again into my purs and the purs again into my pocket which after offer it to him sever time i thought it best to do the farmer by thi time wa convinc i must be a ration creatur he spoke often to me but the sound of hi voic pierc my ear like that of a watermil yet hi word were articul enough i answer as loud as i could in sever languag and he often laid hi ear within two yard of me but all in vain for we were wholli unintellig to each other he then sent hi servant to their work and take hi handkerchief out of hi pocket he doubl and spread it on hi left hand which he place flat on the ground with the palm upward make me a sign to step into it as i could easili do for it wa not abov a foot in thick i thought it my part to obei and for fear of fall laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief with the remaind of which he lap me up to the head for farther secur and in thi manner carri me home to hi hous there he call hi wife and show me to her but she scream and ran back as women in england do at the sight of a toad or a spider howev when she had awhil seen my behavior and how well i observ the sign her husband made she wa soon reconcil and by degre grew extrem tender of me it wa about twelv at noon and a servant brought in dinner it wa onli on substanti dish of meat fit for the plain condit of an husbandman in a dish of about fourandtwenti feet diamet the compani were the farmer and hi wife three children and an old grandmoth when thei were sat down the farmer place me at some distanc from him on the tabl which wa thirti feet high from the floor i wa in a terribl fright and kept as far as i could from the edg for fear of fall the wife minc a bit of meat then crumbl some bread on a trencher and place it befor me i made her a low bow took out my knife and fork and fell to eat which gave them exceed delight the mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup which held about three gallon and fill it with drink i took up the vessel with much difficulti in both hand and in a most respect manner drank to her ladyship health express the word as loud as i could in english which made the compani laugh so heartili that i wa almost deafen by the nois thi liquor tast like a small cider and wa not unpleas then the master made me a sign to come to hi trenchersid but as i walk on the tabl be in great surpris all the time as the indulg reader will easili

english farmer could eat at a meal which to me wa for some time a veri nauseou sight she would craunch the wing of a lark bone and all between her teeth although it were nine time as larg as that of a

seaport in the whole kingdom and those part of the coast into which the river issu ar so full of point rock and the sea gener so rough that there is no ventur with the smallest of their boat so that these peopl ar wholli exclud from ani commerc with the rest of the world but the larg river ar full of vessel and abound with excel fish for thei seldom get ani from the sea becaus the seafish ar of

on poor england i cannot tell whether i were more pleas or mortifi to observ in those solitari walk that the smaller bird did not appear to be at all afraid of me but would hop about within a yard distanc look for worm and other food with as much indiffer and secur as if no creatur at all were near them i rememb a thrush had the confid to snatch out of my hand with hi bill a piec of cake that

then thei would hop back unconcern to hunt for worm and snail as thei did befor but on dai i took a thick cudgel and threw it with all my strength so luckili at a linnet that i knock him down and seiz him by the neck with both my hand ran with him in triumph to my nurs howev the bird who had onli been stun recov himself gave me so mani box with hi wing on both side of my head and bodi though i held him at arm length and wa out of the reach of hi claw that i wa twenti time think of let him go but i wa soon reliev by on of our servant who wrung off the bird neck and i had him next dai for dinner by the queen command thi linnet as near as i can rememb seem to be somewhat larger than an english swan the queen who often us to hear me talk of my seavoyag and took all occas to divert me when i wa melancholi ask me whether i understood how to handl a sail or an oar and whether a littl exercis of row might not be conveni for my health i answer that i understood both veri well for although nai proper employ had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship yet often upon a pinch i wa forc to work like a common marin but i could not see how thi could be done in their countri where the smallest wherri wa equal to a firstrat manofwar among us and such a boat as i could manag would never live in ani of their river illustr the smaller bird did not appear to be at all afraid of me p her majesti said if i could contriv a boat her own joiner should make it and she would provid a place for me to sail in the fellow wa an ingeni workman and by my instruct in ten dai finish a pleasureboat with all

of trial where i could not manag my two scull or littl oar for want of room but the queen had befor contriv anoth project she order the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundr feet long fifti broad and eight deep which be well pitch to prevent leak wa place on the floor along the wall in an outer room of the palac it had a cock near the bottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale and two servant could easili fill it in halfanhour here i often us to row for my own divers as well as that of the queen and her ladi who thought themselv well entertain with my skill and agil sometim i would put up my sail and then my busi wa onli to steer while the ladi gave me a gale with their fan and when thei were weari some of their page would blow my sail forward with their breath while i show my art by steer starboard or larboard as i pleas when i had done glumdalclitch alwai carri back my boat into her closet and hung it oh a nail to dry in thi exercis i onc met an accid which had like to have cost me my life for on of the page have put my boat into the trough the gover who attend glumdalclitch veri offici lift me up to place me in the boat but i happen to slip through her finger and should infal have fallen down forti feet upon the floor if by the luckiest chanc in the world i had not been stop by a corkingpin that stuck in the good gentlewoman stomach the head of the pin pass between my shirt and the waistband of my breech and thu i held by the middl in the air till glumdalclitch ran to my relief illustr gave me a gale with their fan p anoth time on of the servant whose offic it wa to fill my trough everi third dai with fresh water wa so careless as to let a huge frog not perceiv it slip out of hi pail the frog lai conceal till i wa put into my boat but then see a restingplac climb up and made it lean so much on on side that i wa forc to balanc it with all my weight on the other to prevent overturn when the frog wa got in it hop at onc half the length of the boat and then over my head backward and forward the larg of it featur made it appear the most deform anim that can be conceiv howev i desir glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alon i bang it a good while with on of my scull and at last forc it to leap out of the boat but the greatest danger i ever underw in that kingdom wa from a monkei who belong to on of the clerk of the kitchen glumdalclitch had lock the up in her closet while she went somewher upon busi or a visit the weather be veri warm the closet window wa left open as well as the window and the door of my bigger box in which i usual live becaus of it larg and conveni as i sat quietli medit at my tabl i heard someth bounc in at the closet window and skip about from on side to the other whereat although i wa much alarm yet i ventur to look out but not stir from my seat and then i saw thi frolicsom anim frisk and leap up and down till at last he came to my box which he seem to view with great pleasur and curios peep in at the door and everi window illustr i retreat to the farther corner of my room or box but the monkei look in at everi side put me into such a fright that i want presenc of mind to conceal myself under the bed as i might easili have done after some time spent in peep grin and chatter he at last espi me and reach on of hi paw in at the door as a cat doe when she plai with a mous although i often shift place to avoid him he at length seiz the lappet of my coat which be made of that countri silk wa veri thick and strong and drag me out he took me out in hi right forefoot and held me as a nurs doe a child just as i have seen the same sort of creatur do with a kitten in europ and when i offer to struggl he squeez me so hard that i thought it more prudent to submit i have good reason to believ that he took me for a young on of hi own speci by hi often stroke my face veri gentli with hi other paw in these divers he wa interrupt by a nois at the closet door as if somebodi were open it whereupon he suddenli leap up to the window at which he had come in and thenc upon the lead and gutter walk upon three leg and hold me in the fourth till he clamber up to a roof that wa next to our i heard glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he wa carri me out the poor girl wa almost distract that quarter of the palac wa all in an uproar the servant ran for ladder the monkei wa seen by hundr in the court sit upon the ridg of a build hold me like a babi in on of hi forepaw whereat mani of the rabbl below could not forbear laugh neither do i think thei justli ought to be blame for without question the sight wa ridicul enough to everybodi but myself some of the peopl threw up stone hope to drive the monkei down but thi wa strictli forbidden or els veri probabl my brain had been dash out the ladder were now appli and mount by sever men which the monkei observ and find himself almost encompass not be abl to make speed enough with hi three leg let me drop on a ridg tile and made hi escap here i sat for some time five hundr yard from the ground expect everi moment to be blown down by the wind or to fall by my own giddi and come tumbl over and over from the ridg to the eav but an honest lad on of my nurs footmen climb up and put me into hi breechespocket brought me down safe i wa so weak and bruis in the side with the squeez given me by thi odiou anim that i wa forc to keep my bed a fortnight the king queen and all the court sent everi dai to inquir after my health and her majesti made me sever visit dure my sick the monkei wa kill and an order made that no such anim should be kept about the palac when i attend the king after my recoveri to return him thank for hi favor he wa pleas to ralli me a good deal upon thi adventur he ask me what my thought and specul were while i lai in the monkei paw he desir to know what i would have done upon such an occas in my own countri i told hi majesti that in europ we had no monkei except such as were brought for curios from other place and so small that i could deal with a dozen of them togeth if thei presum to attack me and as for that monstrou anim with whom i wa so late engag it wa inde as larg as an eleph if my fear had suffer me to think so far as to make us of my hanger look fierc and clap my hand upon the hilt as i spoke when he poke hi paw into my chamber perhap i should have given him such a wound as would have made him glad to withdraw it with more hast than he put it in thi i deliv in a firm tone like a person who wa jealou lest hi courag should be call in question howev my speech produc noth els besid a loud laughter which all the respect due to hi majesti from those about him could not make them contain thi made me reflect how vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavor to do himself honor among those who ar out of all degre of equal or comparison with him and yet i have seen the moral of my own behavior veri frequent in england sinc my return where a littl contempt varlet without the least titl to birth person wit or commonsens shall presum to look with import and put himself upon a foot with the greatest person of the kingdom i wa everi dai furnish the court with some ridicul stori and glumdalclitch although she love me to excess yet wa arch enough to inform the queen whenev i commit ani folli that she thought would be divert to her majesti the girl who had been out of order wa carri by her gover to take the air about an hour distanc or thirti mile from town thei alight out of the coach near a small footpath in a field and glumdalclitch set down my travellingbox i went out of it to walk there wa a pool of mud in the path and i must need try my activ by attempt to leap over it i took a run but unfortun jump short and found myself just in the middl up to my knee i wade through with some difficulti and on of the footmen wipe me as clean as he could with hi handkerchief for i wa filthili bemir and my nurs confin me to my box till we return home when the queen wa soon inform of what had pass and the footman spread it about the court so that all the mirth for some dai wa at my expens chapter vi sever contriv of the author to pleas the king and queen he show hi skill in music the king inquir into the state of england which the author relat to him the king observ thereon i us to attend the king leve onc or twice a week and had often seen him under the barber hand which inde wa at first veri terribl to behold for the razor wa almost twice as long as an ordinari scyth hi majesti accord to the custom of the countri wa onli shave twice a week i onc prevail on the barber to give me some of the sud or lather out of which i pick forti or fifti of the strongest stump of hair i then took a piec of fine wood and cut it like the back of a comb make sever hole in it at equal distanc with as small a needl as i could get from glumdalclitch i fix in the stump so artifici scrape and slope them with my knife toward the point that i made a veri toler comb which wa a season suppli my own be so much broken in the teeth that it wa almost useless neither did i know ani artist in that countri so nice and exact as would undertak to make me anoth and thi put me in mind of an amus wherein i spent mani of my leisur hour i desir the queen woman to save for me the comb of her majesti hair whereof in time i got a good quantiti and consult with my friend the cabinetmak who had receiv gener order to do littl job for me i direct him to make two chairfram no larger than those i had in my box and then to bore littl hole with a fine awl round those part where i design the back and seat through these hole i wove the strongest hair i could pick out just after the manner of cane chair in england when thei were finish i made a present of them to her majesti who kept them in her cabinet and us to shew them for curios as inde thei were the wonder of everi on that beheld them of these hair as i had alwai a mechan geniu i likewis made a neat littl purs about five feet long with her majesti name deciph in gold letter which i gave to glumdalclitch by the queen consent to sai the truth it wa more for show than us be not of strength to bear the weight of the larger coin and therefor she kept noth in it but some littl coin that girl ar fond of the king who delight in music had frequent concert at court to which i wa sometim carri and set in my box on a tabl to hear them but the nois wa so great that i could hardli distinguish the tune i am confid that all the drum and trumpet of a royal armi beat and sound togeth just at your ear could not equal it my practic wa to have my box remov from the place where the perform sat as far as i could then to shut the door and window of it and draw the windowcurtain after which i found their music not disagre illustr i had learnt in my youth to plai a littl upon the spinet glumdalclitch kept on in her chamber and a master attend twice a week to teach her i call it a spinet becaus it somewhat resembl that instrument and wa plai upon in the same manner a fanci came into my head that i would entertain the king and queen with an english tune upon thi instrument but thi appear extrem difficult for the spinet wa nearli sixti feet long each kei be almost a foot wide so that with my arm extend i could not reach to abov five kei and to press them down requir a good smart stroke with my fist which would be too great a labor and to no purpos the method i contriv wa thi i prepar two round stick about the big of common cudgel thei were thicker at on end than the other and i cover the thicker end with a piec of mous skin that by rap on them i might neither damag the top of the kei nor interrupt the sound befor the spinet a bench wa place about four feet below the kei and i wa put upon the bench i ran sidel upon it that wai and thi as fast as i could bang the proper kei with my two stick and made a shift to plai a jig to the great satisfact of both their majesti but it wa the most violent exercis i ever underw and yet i could not strike abov sixteen kei nor consequ plai the bass and trebl togeth as other artist do which wa a great disadvantag to my perform the king who as i befor observ wa a princ of excel understand would frequent order that i should be brought in my box and set upon the tabl in hi closet he would then command me to bring on of my chair out of the box and sit down within three yard distanc upon the top of the cabinet which brought me almost to a level with hi face in thi manner i had sever convers with him i on dai took the freedom to tell hi majesti that the contempt he discov toward europ and the rest of the world did not seem answer to those excel qualiti of mind that he wa master of that reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the bodi on the contrari we observ in our countri that the tallest person were usual least provid with it that among other anim bee and ant had the reput of more industri art and sagac than mani of the larger kind and that as inconsider as he took me to be i hope i might live to do hi majesti some signal servic the king heard me with attent and began to conceiv a much better opinion of me than he had ever befor he desir i would give him as exact an account of the govern of england as i possibl could becaus as fond as princ commonli ar of their own custom for he conjectur of other monarch by

farther into hi majesti favor i told him of an invent discov between three and four hundr year ago to make a certain powder into a heap on which the smallest spark of fire fall would kindl the whole in a moment although it were as big as a mountain and make it all fly up in the air togeth with a nois and agit greater than thunder that a proper quantiti of thi powder ram into a hollow tube of

hundr of bodi in the middl and lai all wast befor them that we often put thi powder into larg hollow ball of iron and discharg them by an engin into some citi we were besieg which would rip up the

familiar a manner as to appear wholli unmov at all the scene of blood and desol which i had paint as the common effect of those destruct machin whereof he said some evil geniu enemi to mankind must have been the first contriv as for himself he protest that although few thing delight him so much as new discoveri in art or in natur yet he would rather lose half hi kingdom than be privi to such a secret which he command me as i valu my life never to mention ani more a strang effect of narrow principl and short view that a princ possess of everi qualiti which procur vener love and esteem of

excel king whose charact i am sensibl will on thi account be veri much lessen in the opinion of an english reader but i take thi defect among them to have arisen from their ignor by not have hitherto reduc polit into a scienc as the more acut wit of europ have done for i rememb veri well in a discours on dai with the king when i happen to sai there were sever thousand book among us written upon the art of govern it gave him directli contrari to my intent a veri mean opinion of our understand he profess both to abomin and despis all mysteri refin and intrigu either in a princ or a minist he could not tell what i meant by secret of state where an enemi or some rival nation were not in the case he confin the knowledg of govern within veri narrow bound to common sens and reason to justic and leniti to the speedi determin of civil and crimin caus with some other obviou topic which ar not worth consid and he gave it for hi opinion that whoever could make two ear of corn or two blade of

number of letter in their alphabet which consist onli in twoandtwenti but inde few of them extend even to that length thei ar express in the most plain and simpl term wherein those peopl ar not mercuri enough to discov abov on interpret and to write a comment upon ani law is a capit crime as to the decis of civil caus or proceed against crimin their preced ar so few that thei have littl

walk to the right and left about eight or ten pace accord to the length of the line till i had gotten a littl below the level of mine ey and then descend gradual till i came to the bottom after which i mount again and began the other page in the same manner and so turn over the leaf which i could easili do with both my hand for it wa as thick and stiff as a pasteboard and in the largest folio not

write of moral and devot the book treat of the weak of human kind and is in littl esteem except among the women and the vulgar howev i wa curiou to see what an author of that countri could sai upon such a subject illustr thi writer went through all the usual topic of european moralist show how diminut contempt and helpless an anim wa man in hi own natur how unabl to defend himself from inclem of the air or the furi of wild beast how much he wa excel by on creatur in strength by anoth in speed by a third in foresight by a fourth in industri he ad that natur wa degener in these latter declin ag of the world and could now produc onli small birth in comparison to those in ancient time he said it wa veri reason to think not onli that the speci of men were origin much larger but also that there must have been giant in former ag which as it is assert by histori and tradit so it hath been confirm by huge bone and skull casual dug up in sever part of the kingdom far exceed the common dwindl

fall from a hous or a stone cast from the hand of a boi or be drown in a littl brook from thi wai of reason the author drew sever moral applic us in the conduct of life but needless here to repeat for my own part i could not avoid reflect how univers thi talent wa spread of draw lectur in moral or inde rather matter of discont and repin from the quarrel we rais with natur and i believ upon a strict inquiri those quarrel might be shown as illground among us as thei ar among that peopl as to their militari affair thei boast that the king armi consist of a hundr and seventysix thousand foot and thirtytwo thousand hors if that mai be call an armi which is made up of tradesmen in the sever citi and farmer in the countri whose command ar onli the nobil and gentri without pai or reward thei ar inde perfect enough in their exercis and under veri good disciplin wherein i saw no great merit for how should it be otherwis where everi farmer is under the command of hi own landlord and everi citizen under that of the princip men in hi own citi chosen after the manner of venic by ballot i have often seen the militia of lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercis in a great field near the citi of twenti mile squar thei were in all not abov twentyf thousand foot and six thousand hors but it wa imposs for me to comput their number consid the space of ground thei took up a cavali mount on a larg steed might be about nineti feet high i have seen thi whole bodi of hors upon a word of command draw their sword at onc and brandish them in the air imagin can figur noth so grand so surpris and so astonish it look as if ten thousand flash of lightn were dart at the same time from everi quarter of the sky i wa curiou to know how thi princ to whose dominion there is no access from ani other countri came to think of armi or to teach hi peopl the practic of militari disciplin but i wa soon inform both by convers and read their histori for in the cours of mani ag thei have been troubl with the same diseas to which the whole race of mankind is subject the nobil often contend for power the peopl for liberti and the king for absolut dominion all which howev happili temper by the law of that kingdom have been sometim violat by each of the three parti and have more than onc occas civil war the last whereof wa happili put an end to by thi princ grandfath in a gener composit and the

he leav the countri veri particularli relat he return to england i had alwai a strong impuls that i should sometim recov my liberti though it wa imposs to conjectur by what mean or to form ani project with the least hope of succeed the ship in which i sail wa the first ever known to be driven within sight of the coast and the king had given strict order that if at ani time anoth appear it should be taken ashor and with all it crew and passeng brought in a tumbrel to lorbrulgrud i wa treat with much kind i wa the favorit of a great king and queen and the delight of the whole court but it wa upon such a foot as ill becam the digniti of human kind i could never forget those domest pledg i had left behind me i want to be among peopl with whom i could convers upon even term and walk about the street and field without be afraid of be trod to death like a frog or a young puppi but my deliver came sooner than i expect and in a manner not veri common the whole stori and circumst of which i shall faithfulli relat illustr she had some forebod p i had now been two year in thi countri and about the begin of the third glumdalclitch and i attend the king and queen in a progress to the south coast of the kingdom i wa carri as usual in my travellingbox which as i have alreadi describ wa a veri conveni closet of twelv feet wide and i had order a hammock to be fix by silken rope from the four corner at the top to break the jolt when a servant carri me befor him on horseback as i sometim desir and would often sleep in my hammock while we were upon the road on the roof of my closet not directli over the middl of the hammock i order the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot squar to give me air in hot weather as i slept which hole i shut at pleasur with a board that drew backward and forward through a groov when we came to our journei end the king thought proper to pass a few dai at a palac he hath near flanflasn a citi within eighteen english of the seasid glumdalclitch and i were much fatigu i had gotten a small cold but the poor girl wa so ill as to be confin to her chamber i long to see the ocean which must be the onli scene of my escap if ever it should happen i pretend to be wors than i realli wa and desir leav to take the fresh air of the sea with a page whom i wa veri fond of and who had sometim been trust with me i shall never forget with what unwilling glumdalclitch consent nor the strict charg she gave the page to be care of me burst at the same time into a flood of tear as if she had some forebod of what wa to happen the boi took me out in my box about halfanhour walk from the palac toward the rock on the seashor i order him to set me down and lift up on of my sash cast mani a wist melancholi look toward the sea i found myself not veri well and told the page that i had a mind to take a nap in my hammock which i hope would do me good i got in and the boi shut the window close down to keep out the cold i soon fell asleep and all i can conjectur is that while i slept the page think no danger could happen went among the rock to look for bird egg have befor observ him from my window search about and pick up on or two in the cleft be that as it will i found myself suddenli awak with a violent pull upon the ring which wa fasten at the top of my box for the conveni of carriag i felt my box rais veri high in the air and then born forward with prodigi speed the first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock but afterward the motion wa easi enough i call out sever time as loud as i could rais my voic but all to no purpos i look toward my window and could see noth but the cloud and sky i heard a nois just over my head like the clap of wing and then began to perceiv the woful condit i wa in that some eagl had got the ring of my box in hi beak with an intent to let it fall on a rock like a tortois in a shell and then pick out my bodi and devour it for the sagac and smell of thi bird enabl him to discov hi quarri at a great distanc though better conceal than i could be within a twoinch board illustr in a littl time i observ the nois and flutter of wing to increas veri fast and my box wa toss up and down like a sign in a windi dai i heard sever bang or buffet as i thought given to the eagl for such i am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in hi beak and then all on a sudden felt myself fall perpendicularli down for abov a minut but with such incred swift that i almost lost my breath my fall wa stop by a terribl squash that sound louder to my ear than the cataract of niagara after which i wa quit in the dark for anoth minut and then my box began to rise so high that i could see light from the top of the window i now perceiv i wa fallen into the sea my box by the weight of my bodi the good that were in and the broad plate of iron fix for strength at the four corner of the top and bottom float about five feet deep in the water i did then and do now suppos that the eagl which flew awai with my box wa pursu by two or three other and forc to let me drop while he defend himself against the rest who hope to share in the prei the plate of iron fasten at the bottom of the box for those were the strongest preserv the balanc while it fell and hinder it from be broken on the surfac of the water everi joint of it wa well groov and the door did not move on hing but up and down like a sash which kept my closet so tight that veri littl water came in i got with much difficulti out of my hammock have first ventur to draw back my slipboard on the roof alreadi mention contriv on purpos to let in air for want of which i found myself almost stifl how often did i then wish myself with my dear glumdalclitch from whom on singl hour had so far divid me and i mai sai with truth that in the midst of my own misfortun i could not forbear lament my poor nurs the grief she would suffer for my loss the displeasur of the queen and the ruin of her fortun perhap mani travel have not been under greater difficulti and distress than i wa at junctur expect everi moment to see my box dash to piec or at least overset by the first violent blast or rise wave a breach in on singl pane of glass would have been immedi death nor could anyth have preserv the window but the strong latticewir place on the outsid against accid in travel i saw the water ooz in at sever cranni although the leak were not consider and i endeavor to stop them as well as i could i wa not abl to lift up the roof of my closet which otherwis i certainli should have done and sat on the top of it where i might at least preserv myself some hour longer than by be shut up as i mai call it in the hold or if i escap these danger for a dai or two what could i expect but a miser death of cold and hunger i wa four hour under these circumst expect and inde wish everi moment to be my last i have alreadi told the reader that there were two strong stapl fix upon that side of my box which had no window and into which the servant who us to carri me on horseback would put a leathern belt and buckl it about hi waist be in thi disconsol state i heard or at least thought i heard some kind of grate nois on that side of my box where the stapl were fix and soon after i began to fanci that the box wa pull or tow along in the sea for i now and then felt a sort of tug which made the wave rise near the top of my window leav me almost in the dark thi gave me some faint hope of relief although i wa not abl to imagin how it could be brought about i ventur to unscrew on of my chair which were alwai fasten to the floor and have made a hard shift to screw it down again directli under the slip board that i had late open i mount on the chair and put my mouth as near as i could to the hole i call for help in a loud voic and in all the languag i understood i then fasten my handkerchief to a stick i usual carri and thrust it up the hole wave it sever time in the air that if ani boat or ship were near the seamen might conjectur some unhappi mortal to be shut up in the box i found no effect from all i could do but plainli perceiv my closet to be move along and in the space of an hour or better that side of the box where the stapl were and had no window struck against someth that wa hard i apprehend it to be a rock and found myself toss more than ever i plainli heard a nois upon the cover of my closet like that of a cabl and the grate of it as it pass through the ring i then found myself hoist up by degre at least three feet higher than i wa befor whereupon i again thrust up my stick and handkerchief call for help till i wa almost hoars in return to which i heard a great shout repeat three time give me such transport of joi as ar not to be conceiv but by those who feel them i now heard a trampl over my head and somebodi call through the hole with a loud voic in the english tongu if there be anybodi below let them speak i answer i wa an englishman drawn by ill fortun into the greatest calam that ever ani creatur underw and beg by all that wa move to be deliv out of the dungeon i wa in the voic repli i wa safe for my box wa fasten to their ship and the carpent should immedi come and saw a hole in the cover larg enough to pull me out i answer that wa needless and would take up too much time for there wa no more to be done but let on of the crew put hi finger into the ring and take the box out of the sea into the ship and so into the captain cabin some of them upon hear me talk so wildli thought i wa mad other laugh for inde it never came into my head that i wa now got among peopl of my own statur and strength the carpent came and in a few minut saw a passag about four feet squar then let down a small ladder upon which i mount and from thenc wa taken into the ship in a veri weak condit illustr somebodi call in the english tongu p the sailor were all in amaz and ask me a thousand question which i had no inclin to answer i wa equal confound at the sight of so mani pygmi for such i took them to be after have so long accustom mine ey to the monstrou object i had left but the captain mr thoma wilcock an honest worthi shropshir man observ i wa readi to faint took me into hi cabin gave me a cordial to comfort me and made me turn in upon hi own bed advis me to take a littl rest of which i had great need befor i went to sleep i gave him to understand that i had some valuabl furnitur in my box too good to be lost a fine hammock a handsom two chair a tabl and a cabinet that my closet wa hung on all side or rather quilt with silk and cotton that if he would let on of the crew bring my closet into hi cabin i would open it there befor him and show him my good the captain hear me utter these absurd conclud i wa rave howev i suppos to pacifi me he promis to give order as i desir and go upon deck sent some of hi men down into my closet from whenc as i afterward found thei drew up all my good and strip off the quilt but the chair cabinet and bedstead be screw to the floor were much damag by the ignor of the seamen who tore them up by forc then thei knock off some of the board for the us of the ship and when thei had got all thei had a mind for let the hull drop into the sea which by reason of so mani breach made in the bottom and side sunk to right and inde i wa glad not to have been a spectat of the havoc thei made becaus i am confid it would have sensibl touch me by bring former passag into my mind which i had rather forgotten i slept some hour but wa perpetu disturb with dream of the place i had left and the danger i had escap howev upon wake i found myself much recov it wa now about eight oclock at night and the captain order supper immedi think i had alreadi fast too long he entertain me with great kind observ me not to look wildli or talk inconsist and when we were left alon desir i would give him a relat of my travel and by what accid i came to be set adrift in that monstrou wooden chest he said that about twelv oclock at noon as he wa look through hi glass he spi it at a distanc and thought it wa a sail which he had a mind to make be not much out of hi cours in hope of bui some biscuit hi own begin to fall short that upon come nearer and find hi error he sent out hi longboat to discov what it wa that hi men came back in a fright swear thei had seen a swimminghous that he laugh at their folli and went himself in the boat order hi men to take a strong cabl along with them that the weather be calm he row round me sever time observ my window and wirelattic that defenc them that he discov two stapl upon on side which wa all of board without ani passag for light he then command hi men to row up to that side and fasten a cabl to on of the stapl order them to tow my chest as thei call it toward the ship when it wa there he gave direct to fasten anoth cabl to the ring fix in the cover and to rais up my chest with pullei which all the sailor were not abl to do abov two or three feet he said thei saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole and conclud that some unhappi man must be shut up in the caviti i ask whether he or the crew had seen ani prodigi bird in the air about the time he first discov me to which he answer that discours thi matter with the sailor while i wa asleep on of them said he had observ three eagl fly toward the north but remark noth of their be larger than the usual size which i suppos must be imput to the great height thei were at and he could not guess the reason of my question i then ask the captain how far he reckon we might be from land he said by the best comput he could make we were at least a hundr leagu i assur him that he must be mistaken by almost half for i had not left the countri from whenc i came abov two hour befor i dropt into the sea whereupon he began again to think that my brain wa disturb of which he gave me a hint and advis me to go to bed in a cabin he had provid i assur him i wa well refresh with hi good entertain and compani and as much in my sens as ever i wa in my life he then grew seriou and desir to ask me freeli whether i were not troubl in mind by the conscious of some enorm crime for which i wa punish by the command of some princ by expos me in that chest as great crimin in other countri have been forc to sea in a leaki vessel without provis for although he should be sorri to have taken so ill a man into hi ship yet he would engag hi word to set me safe ashor in the first port where we arriv he ad that hi suspicion were much increas by some veri absurd speech i had deliv at first to hi sailor and afterward to himself in relat to my closet chest as well as by my odd look and behavior while i wa at supper i beg hi patienc to hear me tell my stori which i faithfulli did from the last time i left england to the moment he first discov me and as truth alwai forceth it wai into ration mind so thi honest worthi gentleman who had some tinctur of learn and veri good sens wa immedi convinc of my candor and verac but farther to confirm all i had said i entreat him to give order that my cabinet should be brought of which i had the kei in my pocket for he had alreadi inform me how seamen dispos of my closet i open it in hi own presenc and show him the small collect of rariti i made in the countri from whenc i had been so strang deliv there wa the comb i had contriv out of the stump of the king beard there wa a collect of needl and pin from a foot to half a yard long four wasp sting like joiner tack some comb of the queen hair a gold ring which on dai she made me a present of in a most oblig manner take it from her littl finger and throw it over my head like a collar i desir the captain would pleas to accept thi ring in return of hi civil which he absolut refus lastli i desir him to see the breech i had then on which were made of a mous skin i could forc noth upon him but a footman tooth which i observ him to examin with great curios and found he had a fanci for it he receiv it with abund of thank more than such a trifl could deserv it wa drawn by an unskil surgeon in a mistak from on of glumdalclitch men who wa affect with the toothach but it wa as sound as ani in hi head i got it clean and put it in my cabinet it wa about a foot long and four inch in diamet the captain wa veri well satisfi with thi plain relat i had given him and said he hope when we return to england i would oblig the world by put it on paper and make it public my answer wa that i thought we were alreadi overstock with book of travel that noth could now pass which wa not extraordinari wherein i doubt some author less consult truth than their own vaniti or interest or the divers of ignor reader that my stori could contain littl besid common event without those ornament descript of strang plant tree bird and other anim or of the barbar custom and idolatri of savag peopl with which most writer abound howev i thank him for hi good opinion and promis to take the matter into my thought he said he wonder at on thing veri much which wa to hear me speak so loud ask me whether the king or queen of that countri were thick of hear i told him it wa what i had been us to for abov two year past and that i wonder as much at the voic of him and hi men who seem to me onli to whisper and yet i could hear them well enough but when i spoke in that countri it wa like a man talk in the street to anoth look out from the top of a steepl unless when i wa place on a tabl or held in ani person hand i told him i had likewis observ anoth thing that when i first got into the ship and the sailor stood all about me i thought thei were the most contempt littl creatur i had ever beheld for inde while i wa in that princ countri i could never endur to look in a glass after my ey had been accustom to such prodigi object becaus the comparison gave me so despic a conceit of myself the captain said that while we were at supper he observ me to look at everyth with a sort of wonder and that i often seem hardli abl to contain my laughter which he knew not well how to take but imput it to some disord in my brain i answer it wa veri true and i wonder how i could forbear when i saw hi dish of the size of a silver threepenc a leg of pork hardli a mouth a cup not so big as a nutshel and so i went on describ the rest of hi household stuff and provis after the same manner for although the queen had order a littl equipag of all thing necessari for me while i wa in her servic yet my idea were wholli taken up with what i saw on everi side of me and i wink at my own littl as peopl do at their own fault the captain understood my railleri veri well and merrili repli that he did not observ my stomach so good although i had fast all dai and continu in hi mirth protest he would have gladli given a hundr pound to have seen my closet in the eagl bill and afterward in it fall from so great a height into the sea which would certainli have been a most astonish object worthi to have the descript of it transmit to futur ag and the comparison of phaeton wa so obviou that he could not forbear appli it although i did not much admir the conceit illustr my daughter kneel but i could not see her p the captain have been at tonquin wa in hi return to england driven northeastward to the latitud of degre and of longitud but meet a tradewind two dai after i came on board him we sail southward a long time and coast new holland kept our cours westsouthwest and then southsouthwest till we doubl the cape of good hope our voyag wa veri prosper but i shall not troubl the reader with a journal of it the captain call in at on or two port and sent in hi longboat for provis and fresh water but i never went out of the ship till we came into the down which wa on the third dai of june about nine month after my escap i offer to leav pai good in secur for payment of my freight but the captain protest he would not receiv on farth we took a kind leav of each other and i made him promis he would come to see me at my hous in redriff i hire a hors and guid for five shill which i borrow of the captain as i wa on the road observ the littl of the housesth tree the cattl and the peopl i began to think myself in lilliput i wa afraid of trampl on everi travel i met and often call aloud to have them stand out of the wai so that i had like to have gotten on or two broken head for my impertin when i came to my own hous for which i wa forc to inquir on of the servant open the door i bent down to go in like a goos under a gate for fear of strike my head my wife ran out to embrac me but i stoop lower than her knee think she could otherwis never be abl to reach my mouth my daughter kneel to ask my bless but i could not see her till she aros have been so long us to stand with my head and ey erect to abov sixti feet and then i went to take her up with on hand by the waist i look down upon the servant and on or two friend who were in the hous as if thei had been pygmi and i a giant i told my wife she had been too thrifti for i found she had starv herself and her daughter to noth in short i behav myself so unaccount that thei were all of the captain opinion when he first saw me and conclud i had lost my wit thi i mention as an instanc of the great power of habit and prejudic in a littl time i and my famili and friend came to a right understand but my wife protest i should never go to sea ani more although my evil destini so order that she had not power to hinder me as the reader mai know hereaft in the meantim i here conclud the second part of my unfortun voyag
