pleasur everi friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happili marri and you have forgotten on matter of joi to me said emma and a veri consider onethat i made the match myself i made the match you know four year ago and to have it take place and be prove in the right when so mani peopl said mr weston would never marri again mai comfort me for ani thing mr knightlei shook hi head at her her father fondli repli ah my dear i wish you would not make match and foretel thing for whatev you sai alwai come to pass prai do not make ani more match i promis you to make none for myself papa but i must inde for other peopl it is the greatest amus in the world and after such success you knoweveri bodi said that mr weston would never marri again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widow so long and who seem so perfectli comfort without a wife so constantli occupi either in hi busi in town or among hi friend here alwai accept wherev he went alwai cheerfulmr weston need not spend a singl even in the year alon if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainli would never marri again some peopl even talk of a promis to hi wife on her deathb and other of the son and the uncl not let him all manner of solemn nonsens wa talk on the subject but i believ none of it ever sinc the dayabout four year agothat miss taylor and i met with him in broadwai lane when becaus it began to drizzl he dart awai with so much gallantri and borrow two umbrella for us from farmer mitchel s i made up my mind on the subject i plan the match from that hour and when such success ha bless me in thi instanc dear papa you cannot think that i shall leav off matchmak i do not understand what you mean by success said mr knightlei success suppos endeavour your time ha been properli and delic spent if you have been endeavour for the last four year to bring about thi marriag a worthi employ for a young ladi s mind but if which i rather imagin your make the match as you call it mean onli your plan it your sai to yourself on idl dai i think it would be a veri good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marri her and sai it again to yourself everi now and then afterward why do you talk of success where is your merit what ar you proud of you made a lucki guess and that is all that can be said and have you never known the pleasur and triumph of a lucki guessi piti youi thought you clevererfor depend upon it a lucki guess is never mere luck there is alwai some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entir without ani claim to it you have drawn two pretti pictur but i think there mai be a thirda someth between the donoth and the doall if i had not promot mr weston s visit here and given mani littl encourag and smooth mani littl matter it might not have come to ani thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that a straightforward openheart man like weston and a ration unaffect woman like miss taylor mai be safe left to manag their own concern you ar more like to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interfer emma never think of herself if she can do good to other rejoin mr woodhous understand but in part but my dear prai do not make ani more match thei ar silli thing and break up on s famili circl grievous onli on more papa onli for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papai must look about for a wife for him there is nobodi in highburi who deserv himand he ha been here a whole year and ha fit up hi hous so comfort that it would be a shame to have him singl ani longerand i thought when he wa join their hand todai he look so veri much as if he would like to have the same kind offic done for him i think veri well of mr elton and thi is the onli wai i have of do him a servic mr elton is a veri pretti young man to be sure and a veri good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him ani attent my dear ask him to come and dine with us some dai that

better thing invit him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leav him to chuse hi own wife depend upon it a man of six or sevenandtwenti can take care of himself chapter ii mr weston wa a nativ of highburi and born of a respect famili which for the last two or three gener had been rise into gentil and properti he had receiv a good educ but on succeed earli in life to a small independ had becom indispos for ani of the more home pursuit in which hi brother were engag and had satisfi an activ cheer mind and social temper by enter into the militia of hi counti then embodi captain weston wa a gener favourit and when the chanc of hi militari life had introduc him to miss churchil of a great yorkshir famili and miss churchil fell in love with him nobodi wa surpriz except her brother and hi wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and import which the connexion would offend miss churchil howev be of ag and with the full command of her fortunethough her fortun bore no proport to the familyestatewa not to be dissuad from the marriag and it took place to the infinit mortif of mr and mr churchil who threw her off with due decorum it wa an unsuit connexion and did not produc much happi mr weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think everi thing due to her in return for the great good of be in love with him but though she had on sort of spirit she had not the best she had resolut enough to pursu her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreason regret at that brother s unreason anger nor from miss the luxuri of her former home thei live beyond their incom but still it wa noth in comparison of enscomb she did not ceas to love her husband but she want at onc to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchil of enscomb captain weston who had been consid especi by the churchil as make such an amaz match wa prove to have much the worst of the bargain for when hi wife di after a three year marriag he wa rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain from the expens of the child howev he wa soon reliev the boi had with the addit soften claim of a linger ill of hi mother s been the mean of a sort of reconcili and mr and mr churchil have no children of their own nor ani other young creatur of equal kindr to care for offer to take the whole charg of the littl frank soon after her deceas some scrupl and some reluct the widowerfath mai be suppos to have felt but as thei were overcom by other consider the child wa given up to the care and the wealth of the churchil and he had onli hi own comfort to seek and hi own situat to improv as he could a complet chang of life becam desir he quit the militia and engag in trade have brother alreadi establish in a good wai in london which afford him a favour open it wa a concern which brought just employ enough he had still a small hous in highburi where most of hi leisur dai were spent and between us occup and the pleasur of societi the next eighteen or twenti year of hi life pass cheerfulli awai he had by that time realis an easi competenceenough to secur the purchas of a littl estat adjoin highburi which he had alwai long forenough to marri a woman as portionless even as miss taylor and to live accord to the wish of hi own friendli and social disposit it wa now some time sinc miss taylor had begun to influenc hi scheme but as it wa not the tyrann influenc of youth on youth it had not shaken hi determin of never settl till he could purchas randal and the sale of randal wa long look forward to but he had gone steadili on with these object in view till thei were accomplish he had made hi fortun bought hi hous and obtain hi wife and wa begin a new period of exist with everi probabl of greater happi than in ani yet pass through he had never been an unhappi man hi own temper had secur him from that even in hi first marriag but hi second must shew him how delight a welljudg and truli amiabl woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of it be a great deal better to choos than to be chosen to excit gratitud than to feel it he had onli himself to pleas in hi choic hi fortun wa hi own for as to frank it wa more than be tacitli brought up as hi uncl s heir it had becom so avow an adopt as to have him assum the name of churchil on come of ag it wa most unlik therefor that he should ever want hi father s assist hi father had no apprehens of it the aunt wa a caprici woman and govern her husband entir but it wa not in mr weston s natur to imagin that ani capric could be strong enough to affect on so dear and as he believ so deservedli dear he saw hi son everi year in london and wa proud of him and hi fond report of him as a veri fine young man had made highburi feel a sort of pride in him too he wa look on as suffici belong to the place to make hi merit and prospect a kind of common concern mr frank churchil wa on of the boast of highburi and a live curios to see him prevail though the compliment wa so littl return that he had never been there in hi life hi come to visit hi father had been often talk of but never achiev now upon hi father s marriag it wa veri gener propos as a most proper attent that the visit should take place there wa not a dissenti voic on the subject either when mr perri drank tea with mr and miss bate or when mr and miss bate return the visit now wa the time for mr frank churchil to come among them and the hope strengthen when it wa understood that he had written to hi new mother on the occas for a few dai everi morn visit in highburi includ some mention of the handsom letter mr weston had receiv i suppos you have heard of the handsom letter mr frank churchil ha written to mr weston i understand it wa a veri handsom letter inde mr woodhous told me of it mr woodhous saw the letter and he sai he never saw such a handsom letter in hi life it wa inde a highli prize letter mr weston had of cours form a veri favour idea of the young man and such a pleas attent wa an irresist proof of hi great good sens and a most welcom addit to everi sourc and everi express of congratul which her marriag had alreadi secur she felt herself a most fortun woman and she had live long enough to know how fortun she might well be thought where the onli regret wa for a partial separ from friend whose friendship for her had never cool and who could ill bear to part with her she knew that at time she must be miss and could not think without pain of emma s lose a singl pleasur or suffer an hour s ennui from the want of her companion but dear emma wa of no feebl charact she wa more equal to her situat than most girl would have been and had sens and energi and spirit that might be hope would bear her well and happili through it littl difficulti and privat and then there wa such comfort in the veri easi distanc of randal from hartfield so conveni for even solitari femal walk and in mr weston s disposit and circumst which would make the approach season no hindranc to their spend half the even in the week togeth her situat wa altogeth the subject of hour of gratitud to mr weston and of moment onli of regret and her satisfactionh more than satisfactionh cheer enjoy wa so just and so appar that emma well as she knew her father wa sometim taken by surpriz at hi be still abl to piti poor miss taylor when thei left her at randal in the centr of everi domest comfort or saw her go awai in the even attend by her pleasant husband to a carriag of her own but never did she go without mr woodhous s give a gentl sigh and sai ah poor miss taylor she would be veri glad to stai there wa no recov miss taylornor much likelihood of ceas to piti her but a few week brought some allevi to mr woodhous the compliment of hi neighbour were over he wa no longer teas by be wish joi of so sorrow an event and the weddingcak which had been a great distress to him wa all eat up hi own stomach could bear noth rich and he could never believ other peopl to be differ from himself what wa unwholesom to him he regard as unfit for ani bodi and he had therefor earnestli tri to dissuad them from have ani weddingcak at all and when that prove vain as earnestli tri to prevent ani bodi s eat it he had been at the pain of consult mr perri the apothecari on the subject mr perri wa an intellig gentlemanlik man whose frequent visit were on of the comfort of mr woodhous s life and upon be appli to he could not but acknowledg though it seem rather against the bia of inclin that weddingcak might certainli disagre with manyperhap with most peopl unless taken moder with such an opinion in confirm of hi own mr woodhous hope to influenc everi visitor of the newli marri pair but still the cake wa eaten and there wa no rest for hi benevol nerv till it wa all gone there wa a strang rumour in highburi of all the littl perri be seen with a slice of mr weston s weddingcak in their

could disagre with you emma allow her father to talkbut suppli her visitor in a much more satisfactori style and on the present even had particular pleasur in send them awai happi the happi of miss smith wa quit equal to her intent miss woodhous wa so great a personag in highburi that the prospect of the introduct had given as much panic as pleasur but the humbl grate littl girl went off with highli gratifi feel delight with the affabl with which miss woodhous had treat her all the even and actual shaken hand with her at last chapter iv harriet smith s intimaci at hartfield wa soon a settl thing quick and decid in her wai emma lost no time in invit encourag and tell her to come veri often and as their acquaint increas so did their satisfact in each other as a walk companion emma had veri earli foreseen how us she might find her in that respect mr weston s loss had been import her father never went beyond the shrubberi where two divis of the ground suffic him for hi long walk or hi short as the year vari and sinc mr weston s marriag her exercis had been too much confin she had ventur onc alon to randal but it wa not pleasant and a harriet smith therefor on whom she could summon at ani time to a walk would be a valuabl addit to her privileg but in everi respect as she saw more of her she approv her and wa confirm in all her kind design harriet certainli wa not clever but she had a sweet docil grate disposit wa total free from conceit and onli desir to be guid by ani on she look up to her earli attach to herself wa veri amiabl and her inclin for good compani and power of appreci what wa eleg and clever shew that there wa no want of tast though strength of understand must not be expect altogeth she wa quit convinc of harriet smith s be exactli the young friend she wantedexactli the someth which her home requir such a friend as mr weston wa out of the question two such could never be grant two such she did not want it wa quit a differ sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independ mr weston wa the object of a regard which had it basi in gratitud and esteem harriet would be love as on to whom she could be us for mr weston there wa noth to be done for harriet everi thing her first attempt at us were in an endeavour to find out who were the parent but harriet could not tell she wa readi to tell everi thing in her power but on thi subject question were vain emma wa oblig to fanci what she likedbut she could never believ that in the same situat she should not have discov the truth harriet had no penetr she had been satisfi to hear and believ just what mr goddard chose to tell her and look no farther mr goddard and the teacher and the girl and the affair of the school in gener form natur a great part of the conversationand but for her acquaint with the martin of abbeymil farm it must have been the whole but the martin occupi her thought a good deal she had spent two veri happi month with them and now love to talk of the pleasur of her visit and describ the mani comfort and wonder of the place emma encourag her talkativenessamus by such a pictur of anoth set of be and enjoi the youth simplic which could speak with so much exult of mr martin s have two parlour two veri good parlour inde on of them quit as larg as mr goddard s drawingroom and of her have an upper maid who had live fiveandtwenti year with her and of their have eight cow two of them aldernei and on a littl welch cow a veri pretti littl welch cow inde and of mr martin s sai as she wa so fond of it it should be call her cow and of their have a veri handsom summerhous in their garden where some dai next year thei were all to drink teaa veri handsom summerhous larg enough to hold a dozen peopl for some time she wa amus without think beyond the immedi caus but as she came to understand the famili better other feel aros she had taken up a wrong idea fanci it wa a mother and daughter a son and son s wife who all live togeth but when it appear that the mr martin who bore a part in the narr and wa alwai mention with approb for hi great goodnatur in do someth or other wa a singl man that there wa no young mr martin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor littl friend from all thi hospit and kind and that if she were not taken care of she might be requir to sink herself forev with thi inspirit notion her question increas in number and mean and she particularli led harriet to talk more of mr martin and there wa evid no dislik to it harriet wa veri readi to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walk and merri even game and dwelt a good deal upon hi be so veri goodhumour and oblig he had gone three mile round on dai in order to bring her some walnut becaus she had said how fond she wa of them and in everi thing els he wa so veri oblig he had hi shepherd s son into the parlour on night on purpos to sing to her she wa veri fond of sing he could sing a littl himself she believ he wa veri clever and understood everi thing he had a veri fine flock and while she wa with them he had been bid more for hi wool than ani bodi in the countri she believ everi bodi spoke well of him hi mother and sister were veri fond of him mr martin had told her on dai and there wa a blush as she said it that it wa imposs for ani bodi to be a better son and therefor she wa sure whenev he marri he would make a good husband not that she want him to marri she wa in no hurri at all well done mr martin thought emma you know what you ar about and when she had come awai mr martin wa so veri kind as to send mr goddard a beauti gooseth finest goos mr goddard had ever seen mr goddard had dress it on a sundai and ask all the three teacher miss nash and miss princ and miss richardson to sup with her mr martin i suppos is not a man of inform beyond the line of hi own busi he doe not read oh yesthat is noi do not knowbut i believ he ha read a good dealbut not what you would think ani thing of he read the agricultur report and some other book that lai in on of the window seatsbut he read all them to himself but sometim of an even befor we went to card he would read someth aloud out of the eleg extract veri entertain and i know he ha read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romanc of the forest nor the children of the abbei he had never heard of such book befor i mention them but he is determin to get them now as soon as ever he can the next question wa what sort of look man is mr martin oh not handsomenot at all handsom i thought him veri plain at first but i do not think him so plain now on doe not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highburi everi now and then and he is sure to ride through everi week in hi wai to kingston he ha pass you veri often that mai be and i mai have seen him fifti time but without have ani idea of hi name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the veri last sort of person to rais my curios the yeomanri ar precis the order of peopl with whom i feel i can have noth to do a degre or two lower and a credit appear might interest me i might hope to be us to their famili in some wai or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefor in on sens as much abov my notic as in everi other he is below it to be sure oh ye it is not like you should ever have observ him but he know you veri well indeedi mean by sight i have no doubt of hi be a veri respect young man i know inde that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagin hi ag to be he wa fourandtwenti the th of last june and my birthdai is the rd just a fortnight and a dai s differencewhich is veri odd onli fourandtwenti that is too young to settl hi mother is perfectli right not to be in a hurri thei seem veri comfort as thei ar and if she were to take ani pain to marri him she would probabl repent it six year henc if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as hi own with a littl monei it might be veri desir six year henc dear miss woodhous he would be thirti year old well and that is as earli as most men can afford to marri who ar not born to an independ mr martin i imagin ha hi fortun entir to makecannot be at all beforehand with the world whatev monei he might come into when hi father di whatev hi share of the famili properti it is i dare sai all afloat all emploi in hi stock and so forth and though with dilig and good luck he mai be rich in time it is next to imposs that he should have realis ani thing yet to be sure so it is but thei live veri comfort thei have no indoor man els thei do not want for ani thing and mr martin talk of take a boi anoth year i wish you mai not get into a scrape harriet whenev he doe marryi mean as to be acquaint with hi wifefor though hi sister from a superior educ ar not to be altogeth object to it doe not follow that he might marri ani bodi at all fit for you to notic the misfortun of your birth ought to make you particularli care as to your associ there can be no doubt of your be a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by everi thing within your own power or there will be plenti of peopl who would take pleasur in degrad you ye to be sure i suppos there ar but while i visit at hartfield and you ar so kind to me miss woodhous i am not afraid of what ani bodi can do you understand the forc of influenc pretti well harriet but i would have you so firmli establish in good societi as to be independ even of hartfield and miss woodhous i want to see you perman well connect and to that end it will be advis to have as few odd acquaint as mai be and therefor i sai that if you should still be in thi countri when mr martin marri i wish you mai not be drawn in by your intimaci with the sister to be acquaint with the wife who will probabl be some mere farmer s daughter without educ to be sure ye not that i think mr martin would ever marri ani bodi but what had had some educationand been veri well brought up howev i do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaint of hi wife i shall alwai have a great regard for the miss martin especi elizabeth and should be veri sorri to give them up for thei ar quit as well educ as me but if he marri a veri ignor vulgar woman certainli i had better not visit her if i can help it emma watch her through the fluctuat of thi speech and saw no alarm symptom of love the young man had been the first admir but she trust there wa no other hold and that there would be no seriou difficulti on harriet s side to oppos ani friendli arrang of her own thei met mr martin the veri next dai as thei were walk on the donwel road he wa on foot and after look veri respectfulli at her look with most unfeign satisfact at her companion emma wa not sorri to have such an opportun of survei and walk a few yard forward while thei talk togeth soon made her quick ey suffici acquaint with mr robert martin hi appear wa veri neat and he look like a sensibl young man but hi person had no other advantag and when he came to be contrast with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gain in harriet s inclin harriet wa not insens of manner she had voluntarili notic her father s gentl with admir as well as wonder mr martin look as if he did not know what manner wa thei remain but a few minut togeth as miss woodhous must not be kept wait and harriet then came run to her with a smile face and in a flutter of spirit which miss woodhous hope veri soon to compos onli think of our happen to meet himhow veri odd it wa quit a chanc he said that he had not gone round by randal he did not think we ever walk thi road he thought we walk toward randal most dai he ha not been abl to get the romanc of the forest yet he wa so busi the last time he wa at kingston that he quit forgot it but he goe again tomorrow so veri odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhous is he like what you expect what do you think of him do you think him so veri plain he is veri plain undoubtedlyremark plainbut that is noth compar with hi entir want of gentil i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so veri clownish so total without air i had imagin him i confess a degre or two nearer gentil to be sure said harriet in a mortifi voic he is not so genteel as real gentlemen i think harriet sinc your acquaint with us you have been repeatedli in the compani of some such veri real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the differ in mr martin at hartfield you have had veri good specimen of well educ well bred men i should be surpriz if after see them you could be in compani with mr martin again without perceiv him to be a veri inferior creatureand rather wonder at yourself for have ever thought him at all agreeabl befor do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by hi awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouth of a voic which i heard to be wholli unmodul as i stood here certainli he is not like mr knightlei he ha not such a fine air and wai of walk as mr knightlei i see the differ plain enough but mr knightlei is so veri fine a man mr knightlei s air is so remark good that it is not fair to compar mr martin with him you might not see on in a hundr with gentleman so plainli written as in mr knightlei but he is not the onli gentleman you have been late us to what sai you to mr weston and mr elton compar mr martin with either of them compar their manner of carri themselv of walk of speak of be silent you must see the differ oh yesther is a great differ but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forti and fifti which make hi good manner the more valuabl the older a person grow harriet the more import it is that their manner should not be bad the more glare and disgust ani loud or coars or awkward becom what is passabl in youth is detest in later ag mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life there is no sai inde repli harriet rather solemnli but there mai be pretti good guess he will be a complet gross vulgar farmer total inattent to appear and think of noth but profit and loss will he inde that will be veri bad how much hi busi engross him alreadi is veri plain from the circumst of hi forget to inquir for the book you recommend he wa a great deal too full of the market to think of ani thing elsewhich is just as it should be for a thrive man what ha he to do with book and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a veri rich man in timeand hi be illiter and coars need not disturb us i wonder he did not rememb the book wa all harriet s answer and spoken with a degre of grave displeasur which emma thought might be safe left to itself she therefor said no more for some time her next begin wa in on respect perhap mr elton s manner ar superior to mr knightlei s or mr weston s thei have more gentl thei might be more safe held up as a pattern there is an open a quick almost a blunt in mr weston which everi bodi like in him becaus there is so much goodhumour with itbut that would not do to be copi neither would mr knightlei s downright decid command sort of manner though it suit him veri well hi figur and look and situat in life seem to allow it but if ani young man were to set about copi him he would not be suffer on the contrari i think a young man might be veri safe recommend to take mr elton as a model mr elton is goodhumour cheer oblig and gentl he seem to me to be grown particularli gentl of late i do not know whether he ha ani design of ingrati himself with either of us harriet by addit soft but it strike me that hi manner ar softer than thei us to be if he mean ani thing it must be to pleas you did not i tell you what he said of you the other dai she then repeat some warm person prais which she had drawn from mr elton and now did full justic to and harriet blush and smile and said she had alwai thought mr elton veri agreeabl mr elton wa the veri person fix on by emma for drive the young farmer out of harriet s head she thought it would be an excel match and onli too palpabl desir natur and probabl for her to have much merit in plan it she fear it wa what everi bodi els must think of and predict it wa not like howev that ani bodi should have equal her in the date of the plan as it had enter her brain dure the veri first even of harriet s come to hartfield the longer she consid it the greater wa her sens of it expedi mr elton s situat wa most suitabl quit the gentleman himself and without low connexion at the same time not of ani famili that could fairli object to the doubt birth of harriet he had a comfort home for her and emma imagin a veri suffici incom for though the vicarag of highburi wa not larg he wa known to have some independ properti and she thought veri highli of him as a goodhumour wellmean respect young man without ani defici of us understand or knowledg of the world she had alreadi satisfi herself that he thought harriet a beauti girl which she trust with such frequent meet at hartfield wa foundat enough on hi side and on harriet s there could be littl doubt that the idea of be prefer by him would have all the usual weight and efficaci and he wa realli a veri pleas young man a young man whom ani woman not fastidi might like he wa reckon veri handsom hi person much admir in gener though not by her there be a want of eleg of featur which she could not dispens withbut the girl who could be gratifi by a robert martin s ride about the countri to get walnut for her might veri well be conquer by mr elton s admir chapter v i do not know what your opinion mai be mr weston said mr knightlei of thi great intimaci between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing a bad thing do you realli think it a bad thingwhi so i think thei will neither of them do the other ani good you surpriz me emma must do harriet good and by suppli her with a new object of interest harriet mai be said to do emma good i have been see their intimaci with the greatest pleasur how veri differ we feelnot think thei will do each other ani good thi will certainli be the begin of on of our quarrel about emma mr knightlei perhap you think i am come on purpos to quarrel with you know weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battl mr weston would undoubtedli support me if he were here for he think exactli as i do on the subject we were speak of it onli yesterdai and agre how fortun it wa for emma that there should be such a girl in highburi for her to associ with mr knightlei i shall not allow you to be a fair judg in thi case you ar so much us to live alon that you do not know the valu of a companion and perhap no man can be a good judg of the comfort a woman feel in the societi of on of her own sex after be us to it all her life i can imagin your object to harriet smith she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be but on the other hand as emma want to see her better inform it will be an induc to her to read more herself thei will read togeth she mean it i know emma ha been mean to read more ever sinc she wa twelv year old i have seen a great mani list of her drawingup at variou time of book that she meant to read regularli throughand veri good list thei wereveri well chosen and veri neatli arrangedsometim alphabet and sometim by some other rule the list she drew up when onli fourteeni rememb think it did her judgment so much credit that i preserv it some time and i dare sai she mai have made out a veri good list now but i have done with expect ani cours of steadi read from emma she will never submit to ani thing requir industri and patienc and a subject of the fanci to the understand where miss taylor fail to stimul i mai safe affirm that harriet smith will do nothingy never could persuad her to read half so much as you wishedy know you could not i dare sai repli mr weston smile that i thought so thenbut sinc we have part i can never rememb emma s omit to do ani thing i wish there is hardli ani desir to refresh such a memori as that said mr knightlei feelingli and for a moment or two he had done but i he soon ad who have had no such charm thrown over my sens must still see hear and rememb emma is spoil by be the cleverest of her famili at ten year old she had the misfortun of be abl to answer question which puzzl her sister at seventeen she wa alwai quick and assur isabella slow and diffid and ever sinc she wa twelv emma ha been mistress of the hous and of you all in her mother she lost the onli person abl to cope with her she inherit her mother s talent and must have been under subject to her i should have been sorri mr knightlei to be depend on your recommend had i quit mr woodhous s famili and want anoth situat i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to ani bodi i am sure you alwai thought me unfit for the offic i held ye said he smile you ar better place here veri fit for a wife but not at all for a gover but you were prepar yourself to be an excel wife all the time you were at hartfield you might not give emma such a complet educ as your power would seem to promis but you were receiv a veri good educ from her on the veri materi matrimoni point of submit your own will and do as you were bid and if weston had ask me to recommend him a wife i should certainli have name miss taylor thank you there will be veri littl merit in make a good wife to such a man as mr weston why to own the truth i am afraid you ar rather thrown awai and that with everi disposit to bear there will be noth to be born we will not despair howev weston mai grow cross from the wanton of comfort or hi son mai plagu him i hope not thatit is not like no mr knightlei do not foretel vexat from that quarter not i inde i onli name possibl i do not pretend to emma s geniu for foretel and guess i hope with all my heart the young man mai be a weston in merit and a churchil in fortunebut harriet smithi have not half done about harriet smith i think her the veri worst sort of companion that emma could possibl have she know noth herself and look upon emma as know everi thing she is a flatter in all her wai and so much the wors becaus undesign her ignor is hourli flatteri how can emma imagin she ha ani thing to learn herself while harriet is present such a delight inferior and as for harriet i will ventur to sai that she cannot gain by the acquaint hartfield will onli put her out of conceit with all the other place she belong to she will grow just refin enough to be uncomfort with those among whom birth and circumst have place her home i am much mistaken if emma s doctrin give ani strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself ration to the varieti of her situat in lifethei onli give a littl polish i either depend more upon emma s good sens than you do or am more anxiou for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaint how well she look last night oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you veri well i shall not attempt to deni emma s be pretti pretti sai beauti rather can you imagin ani thing nearer perfect beauti than emma altogetherfac and figur i do not know what i could imagin but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figur more pleas to me than her but i am a partial old friend such an eyeth true hazl eyeand so brilliant regular featur open counten with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretti height and size such a firm and upright figur there is health not mere in her bloom but in her air her head her glanc on hear sometim of a child be the pictur of health now emma alwai give me the idea of be the complet pictur of grownup health she is loveli itself mr knightlei is not she i have not a fault to find with her person he repli i think her all you describ i love to look at her and i will add thi prais that i do not think her person vain consid how veri handsom she is she appear to be littl occupi with it her vaniti li anoth wai mr weston i am not to be talk out of my dislik of harriet smith or my dread of it do them both harm and i mr knightlei am equal stout in my confid of it not do them ani harm with all dear emma s littl fault she is an excel creatur where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she ha qualiti which mai be trust she will never lead ani on realli wrong she will make no last blunder where emma err onc she is in the right a hundr time veri well i will not plagu you ani more emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christma bring john and isabella john love emma with a reason and therefor not a blind affect and isabella alwai think as he doe except when he is not quit frighten enough about the children i am sure of have their opinion with me i know that you all love her realli too well to be unjust or unkind but excus me mr knightlei if i take the liberti i consid myself you know as have somewhat of the privileg of speech that emma s mother might have had the liberti of hint that i do not think ani possibl good can aris from harriet smith s intimaci be made a matter of much discuss among you prai excus me but suppos ani littl inconveni mai be apprehend from the intimaci it cannot be expect that emma account to nobodi but her father who perfectli approv the acquaint should put an end to it so long as it is a sourc of pleasur to herself it ha been so mani year my provinc to give advic that you cannot be surpriz mr knightlei at thi littl remain of offic not at all cri he i am much oblig to you for it it is veri good advic and it shall have a better fate than your advic ha often found for it shall be attend to mr john knightlei is easili alarm and might be made unhappi about her sister be satisfi said he i will not rais ani outcri i will keep my illhumour to myself i have a veri sincer interest in emma isabella doe not seem more my sister ha never excit a greater interest perhap hardli so great there is an anxieti a curios in what on feel for emma i wonder what will becom of her so do i said mr weston gentli veri much she alwai declar she will never marri which of cours mean just noth at all but i have no idea that she ha yet ever seen a man she care for it would not be a bad thing for her to be veri much in love with a proper object i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good but there is nobodi hereabout to attach her and she goe so seldom from home there doe inde seem as littl to tempt her to break her resolut at present said mr weston as can well be and while she is so happi at hartfield i cannot wish her to be form ani attach which would be creat such difficulti on poor mr woodhous s account i do not recommend matrimoni at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assur you part of her mean wa to conceal some favourit thought of her own and mr weston s on the subject as much as possibl there were wish at randal respect emma s destini but it wa not desir to have them suspect and the quiet transit which mr knightlei soon afterward made to what doe weston think of the weather shall we have rain convinc her that he had noth more to sai or surmis about hartfield chapter vi emma could not feel a doubt of have given harriet s fanci a proper direct and rais the gratitud of her young vaniti to a veri good purpos for she found her decidedli more sensibl than befor of mr elton s be a remark handsom man with most agreeabl manner and as she had no hesit in follow up the assur of hi admir by agreeabl hint she wa soon pretti confid of creat as much like on harriet s side as there could be ani occas for she wa quit convinc of mr elton s be in the fairest wai of fall in love if not in love alreadi she had no scrupl with regard to him he talk of harriet and prais her so warmli that she could not suppos ani thing want which a littl time would not add hi percept of the strike improv of harriet s manner sinc her introduct at hartfield wa not on of the least agreeabl proof of hi grow attach you have given miss smith all that she requir said he you have made her grace and easi she wa a beauti creatur when she came to you but in my opinion the attract you have ad ar infinit superior to what she receiv from natur i am glad you think i have been us to her but harriet onli want draw out and receiv a few veri few hint she had all the natur grace of sweet of temper and artless in herself i have done veri littl if it were admiss to contradict a ladi said the gallant mr elton i have perhap given her a littl more decis of charact have taught her to think on point which had not fallen in her wai befor exactli so that is what princip strike me so much superad decis of charact skil ha been the hand great ha been the pleasur i am sure i never met with a disposit more truli amiabl i have no doubt of it and it wa spoken with a sort of sigh anim which had a vast deal of the lover she wa not less pleas anoth dai with the manner in which he second a sudden wish of her to have harriet s pictur did you ever have your like taken harriet said she did you ever sit for your pictur harriet wa on the point of leav the room and onli stopt to sai with a veri interest naivet oh dear no never no sooner wa she out of sight than emma exclaim what an exquisit possess a good pictur of her would be i would give ani monei for it i almost long to attempt her like myself you do not know it i dare sai but two or three year ago i had a great passion for take like and attempt sever of my friend and wa thought to have a toler ey in gener but from on caus or anoth i gave it up in disgust but realli i could almost ventur if harriet would sit to me it would be such a delight to have her pictur let me entreat you cri mr elton it would inde be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhous to exercis so charm a talent in favour of your friend i know what your draw ar how could you suppos me ignor is not thi room rich in specimen of your landscap and flower and ha not mr weston some inimit figurepiec in her drawingroom at randal ye good manthought emmabut what ha all that to do with take like you know noth of draw don t pretend to be in raptur about mine keep your raptur for harriet s face well if you give me such kind encourag mr elton i believ i shall try what i can do harriet s featur ar veri delic which make a like difficult and yet there is a peculiar in the shape of the ey and the line about the mouth which on ought to catch exactli soth shape of the ey and the line about the mouthi have not a doubt of your success prai prai attempt it as you will do it it will inde to us your own word be an exquisit possess but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit she think so littl of her own beauti did not you observ her manner of answer me how complet it meant why should my pictur be drawn oh ye i observ it i assur you it wa not lost on me but still i cannot imagin she would not be persuad harriet wa soon back again and the propos almost immedi made and she had no scrupl which could stand mani minut against the earnest press of both the other emma wish to go to work directli and therefor produc the portfolio contain her variou attempt at portrait for not on of them had ever been finish that thei might decid togeth on the best size for harriet her mani begin were displai miniatur halflength wholelength pencil crayon and watercolour had been all tri in turn she had alwai want to do everi thing and had made more progress both in draw and music than mani might have done with so littl labour as she would ever submit to she plai and sangand drew in almost everi style but steadi had alwai been want and in noth had she approach the degre of excel which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have fail of she wa not much deceiv as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician but she wa not unwil to have other deceiv or sorri to know her reput for accomplish often higher than it deserv there wa merit in everi drawingin the least finish perhap the most her style wa spirit but had there been much less or had there been ten time more the delight and admir of her two companion would have been the same thei were both in ecstasi a like pleas everi bodi and miss woodhous s perform must be capit no great varieti of face for you said emma i had onli my own famili to studi from there is my fatheranoth of my fatherbut the idea of sit for hi pictur made him so nervou that i could onli take him by stealth neither of them veri like therefor mr weston again and again and again you see dear mr weston alwai my kindest friend on everi occas she would sit whenev i ask her there is my sister and realli quit her own littl eleg figureand the face not unlik i should have made a good like of her if she would have sat longer but she wa in such a hurri to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet then here come all my attempt at three of those four childrenther thei ar henri and john and bella from on end of the sheet to the other and ani on of them might do for ani on of the rest she wa so eager to have them drawn that i could not refus but there is no make children of three or four year old stand still you know nor can it be veri easi to take ani like of them beyond the air and complexion unless thei ar coarser featur than ani of mama s children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth who wa a babi i took him as he wa sleep on the sofa and it is as strong a like of hi cockad as you would wish to see he had nestl down hi head most conveni that s veri like i am rather proud of littl georg the corner of the sofa is veri good then here is my last unclos a pretti sketch of a gentleman in small size wholelength my last and my bestmi brother mr john knightleythi did not want much of be finish when i put it awai in a pet and vow i would never take anoth like i could not help be provok for after all my pain and when i had realli made a veri good like of itmr weston and i were quit agre in think it veri likeonli too handsometoo flatteringbut that wa a fault on the right side after all thi came poor dear isabella s cold approb of ye it wa a littl likebut to be sure it did not do him justic we had had a great deal of troubl in persuad him to sit at all it wa made a great favour of and altogeth it wa more than i could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologis over as an unfavour like to everi morn visitor in brunswick squareand as i said i did then forswear ever draw ani bodi again but for harriet s sake or rather for my own and as there ar no husband and wive in the case at present i will break my resolut now mr elton seem veri properli struck and delight by the idea and wa repeat no husband and wive in the case at present inde as you observ exactli so no husband and wive with so interest a conscious that emma began to consid whether she had not better leav them togeth at onc but as she want to be draw the declar must wait a littl longer she had soon fix on the size and sort of portrait it wa to be a wholelength in watercolour like mr john knightlei s and wa destin if she could pleas herself to hold a veri honour station over the mantelpiec the sit began and harriet smile and blush and afraid of not keep her attitud and counten present a veri sweet mixtur of youth express to the steadi ey of the artist but there wa no do ani thing with mr elton fidget behind her and watch everi touch she gave him credit for station himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offenc but wa realli oblig to put an end to it and request him to place himself elsewher it then occur to her to emploi him in read if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kind inde it would amus awai the difficulti of her part and lessen the irksom of miss smith s mr elton wa onli too happi harriet listen and emma drew in peac she must allow him to be still frequent come to look ani thing less would certainli have been too littl in a lover and he wa readi at the smallest intermiss of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmedther wa no be displeas with such an encourag for hi admir made him discern a like almost befor it wa possibl she could not respect hi ey but hi love and hi complais were unexception the sit wa altogeth veri satisfactori she wa quit enough pleas with the first dai s sketch to wish to go on there wa no want of like she had been fortun in the attitud and as she meant to throw in a littl improv to the figur to give a littl more height and consider more eleg she had great confid of it be in everi wai a pretti draw at last and of it fill it destin place with credit to them botha stand memori of the beauti of on the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as mani other agreeabl associ as mr elton s veri promis attach wa like to add harriet wa to sit again the next dai and mr elton just as he ought entreat for the permiss of attend and read to them again by all mean we shall be most happi to consid you as on of the parti the same civil and courtesi the same success and satisfact took place on the morrow and accompani the whole progress of the pictur which wa rapid and happi everi bodi who saw it wa pleas but mr elton wa in continu raptur and defend it through everi critic miss woodhous ha given her friend the onli beauti she want observ mr weston to himnot in the least suspect that she wa address a lover the express of the ey is most correct but miss smith ha not those eyebrow and eyelash it is the fault of her face that she ha them not do you think so repli he i cannot agre with you it appear to me a most perfect resembl in everi featur i never saw such a like in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know you have made her too tall emma said mr knightlei emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmli ad oh no certainli not too tall not in the least too tall consid she is sit downwhich natur present a differentwhich in short give exactli the ideaand the

your draw alwai ar my dear i do not know ani bodi who draw so well as you do the onli thing i do not thoroughli like is that she seem to be sit out of door with onli a littl shawl over her shouldersand it make on think she must catch cold but my dear papa it is suppos to be summer a warm dai in summer look at the tree but it is never safe to sit out of door my dear you sir mai sai ani thing cri mr elton but i must confess that i regard it as a most happi thought the place of miss smith out of door and the tree is touch with such inimit spirit ani other situat would have been much less in charact the naivet of miss smith s mannersand altogetheroh it is most admir i cannot keep my ey from it i never saw such a like the next thing want wa to get the pictur frame and here were a few difficulti it must be done directli it must be done in london the order must go through the hand of some intellig person whose tast could be depend on and isabella the usual doer of all commiss must not be appli to becaus it wa decemb and mr woodhous could not bear the idea of her stir out of her hous in the fog of decemb but no sooner wa the distress known to mr elton than it wa remov hi gallantri wa alwai on the alert might he be trust with the commiss what infinit pleasur should he have in execut it he could ride to london at ani time it wa imposs to sai how much he should be gratifi by be emploi on such an errand he wa too goodsh could not endur the thoughtsh would not give him such a troublesom offic for the world brought on the desir repetit of entreati and assurancesand a veri few minut settl the busi mr elton wa to take the draw to london chuse the frame and give the direct and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensur it safeti without much incommod him while he seem mostli fear of not be incommod enough what a preciou deposit said he with a tender sigh as he receiv it thi man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma i should sai so but that i suppos there mai be a hundr differ wai of be in love he is an excel young man and will suit harriet exactli it will be an exactli so as he sai himself but he doe sigh and languish and studi for compliment rather more than i could endur as a princip i come in for a pretti good share as a second but it is hi gratitud on harriet s account chapter vii the veri dai of mr elton s go to london produc a fresh occas for emma s servic toward her friend harriet had been at hartfield as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home to return again to dinner she return and

letter wa much abov her expect there were not mere no grammat error but as a composit it would not have disgrac a gentleman the languag though plain wa strong and unaffect and the sentiment it convei veri much to the credit of the writer it wa short but express good sens warm attach liber proprieti even delicaci of feel she paus over it while harriet stood anxious watch for her opinion with a well well and wa at last forc to add is it a good letter or is it too short ye inde a veri good letter repli emma rather slowli so good a letter harriet that everi thing consid i think on of hi sister must have help him i can hardli imagin the young man whom i saw talk with you the other dai could express himself so well if left quit to hi own power and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainli it

you were consult me onli as to the word of it harriet wa silent with a littl reserv of manner emma continu you mean to return a favour answer i collect no i do not that is i do not meanwhat shall i do what would you advis me to do prai dear miss woodhous tell me what i ought to do i shall not give you ani advic harriet i will have noth to do with it thi is a point which you must settl with your feel i had no notion that he like me so veri much said harriet contempl the letter for a littl while emma persev in her silenc but begin to apprehend the bewitch flatteri of that letter might be too power she thought it best to sai i lai it down as a gener rule harriet that if a woman doubt as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainli ought to refus him if she can hesit as to ye she ought to sai no directli it is not a state to be safe enter into with doubt feel with half a heart i thought it my duti as a friend and older than yourself to sai thu much to you but do not imagin that i want to influenc you oh no i am sure you ar a great deal too kind tobut if you would just advis me what i had best dono no i do not mean thata you sai on s mind ought to be quit made upon should not be hesitatingit is a veri seriou thingit will be safer to sai no perhapsdo you think i had better sai no not for the world said emma smile gracious would i advis you either wai you must be

bodi els occur to you at thi moment under such a definit harriet harriet do not deceiv yourself do not be run awai with by gratitud and compass at thi moment whom ar you think of the symptom were favourableinstead of answer harriet turn awai confus and stood thoughtfulli by the fire and though the letter wa still in her hand it wa now mechan twist about without regard emma wait the result with impati but not without strong hope at last with some hesit harriet said miss woodhous as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quit determin and realli almost made up my mindto refus mr martin do you think i am right perfectli perfectli right my dearest harriet you ar do just what you ought while you were at all in suspens i kept my feel to myself but now that you ar so complet decid i have no hesit in approv dear harriet i give myself joi of thi it would have griev me to lose your acquaint which must have been the consequ of your marri mr martin while you were in the smallest degre waver i said noth about it becaus i would not influenc but it would have been the loss of a friend to me i could not have visit mr robert martin of abbeymil farm now i am secur of you for ever harriet had not surmis her own danger but the idea of it struck her forcibl you could not have visit me she cri look aghast no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that befor that would have been too dreadfulwhat an escapedear miss woodhous i would not give up the pleasur and honour of be intim with you for ani thing in the world inde harriet it would have been a sever pang to lose you but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all good societi i must have given you up dear mehow should i ever have born it it would have kill me never to come to hartfield ani more dear affection creaturey banish to abbeymil farmyou confin to the societi of the illiter and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assur to ask it he must have a pretti good opinion of himself i do not think he is conceit either in gener said harriet her conscienc oppos such censur at least he is veri good natur and i shall alwai feel much oblig to him and have a great regard forbut that is quit a differ thing fromand you know though he mai like me it doe not follow that i shouldand certainli i must confess that sinc my visit here i have seen peopleand if on come to compar them person and manner there is no comparison at all on is so veri handsom and agreeabl howev i do realli think mr martin a veri amiabl young man and have a great opinion of him and hi be so much attach to meand hi write such a letterbut as to leav you it is what i would not do upon ani consider thank you thank you my own sweet littl friend we will not be part a woman is not to marri a man mere becaus she is ask or becaus he is attach to her and can write a toler letter oh noand it is but a short letter too emma felt the bad tast of her friend but let it pass with a veri true and it would be a small consol to her for the clownish manner which might be offend her everi hour of the dai to know that her husband could write a good letter oh ye veri nobodi care for a letter the thing is to be alwai happi with pleasant companion i am quit determin to refus him but how shall i do what shall i sai emma assur her there would be no difficulti in the answer and advis it be written directli which wa agre to in the hope of her assist and though emma continu to protest against ani assist be want it wa in fact given in the format of everi sentenc the look over hi letter again in repli to it had such a soften tendenc that it wa particularli necessari to brace her up with a few decis express and she wa so veri much concern at the idea of make him unhappi and thought so much of what hi mother and sister would think and sai and wa so anxiou that thei should not fanci her ungrat that emma believ if the young man had come in her wai at that moment he would have been accept after all thi letter howev wa written and seal and sent the busi wa finish and harriet safe she wa rather low all the even but emma could allow for her amiabl regret and sometim reliev them by speak of her own affect sometim by bring forward the idea of mr elton i shall never be invit to abbeymil again wa said in rather a sorrow tone nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet you ar a great deal too necessari at hartfield to be spare to abbeymil and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happi but at hartfield some time afterward it wa i think mr goddard would be veri much surpriz if she knew what had happen i am sure miss nash wouldfor miss nash think her own sister veri well marri and it is onli a linendrap on should be sorri to see greater pride or refin in the teacher of a school harriet i dare sai miss nash would envi you such an opportun as thi of be marri even thi conquest would appear valuabl in her ey as to ani thing superior for you i suppos she is quit in the dark the attent of a certain person can hardli be among the tittletattl of highburi yet hitherto i fanci you and i ar the onli peopl to whom hi look and manner have explain themselv harriet blush and smile and said someth about wonder that peopl should like her so much the idea of mr elton wa certainli cheer but still after a time she wa tenderheart again toward the reject mr martin now he ha got my letter said she softli i wonder what thei ar all doingwheth hi sister knowif he is unhappi thei will be unhappi too i hope he will not mind it so veri much let us think of those among our absent friend who ar more cheerfulli emploi cri emma at thi moment perhap mr elton is shew your pictur to hi mother and sister tell how much more beauti is the origin and after be ask for it five or six time allow them to hear your name your own dear name my picturebut he ha left my pictur in bondstreet ha he sothen i know noth of mr elton no

famili it introduc you among them it diffus through the parti those pleasantest feel of our natur eager curios and warm prepossess how cheer how anim how suspici how busi their imagin all ar harriet smile again and her smile grew stronger chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield that night for some week past she had been spend more than half her time there and gradual get to have a bedroom appropri to herself and emma judg it best in everi respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possibl just at present she wa oblig to go the next morn for an hour or two to mr goddard s but it wa then to be settl that she should return to hartfield to make a regular visit of some dai while she wa gone mr knightlei call and sat some time with mr woodhous and emma till mr woodhous who had previous made up hi mind to walk out wa persuad by hi daughter not to defer it and wa induc by the entreati of both though against the scrupl of hi own civil to leav mr knightlei for that purpos mr knightlei who had noth of ceremoni about him wa offer by hi short decid answer an amus contrast to the protract apolog and civil hesit of the other well i believ if you will excus me mr knightlei if you will not consid me as do a veri rude thing i shall take emma s advic and go out for a quarter of an hour as the sun is out i believ i had better take my three turn while i can i treat you without ceremoni mr knightlei we invalid think we ar privileg peopl my dear sir do not make a stranger of me i leav an excel substitut in my daughter emma will be happi to entertain you and therefor i think i will beg your excus and take my three turnsmi winter walk you cannot do better sir i would ask for the pleasur of your compani mr knightlei but i am a veri slow walker and my pace would be tediou to you and besid you have anoth long walk befor you to donwel abbei thank you sir thank you i am go thi moment myself and i think the sooner you go the better i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you mr woodhous at last wa off but mr knightlei instead of be immedi off likewis sat down again seemingli inclin for more chat he began speak of harriet and speak of her with more voluntari prais than emma had ever heard befor i cannot rate her beauti as you do said he but she is a pretti littl creatur and i am inclin to think veri well of her disposit her charact depend upon those she is with but in good hand she will turn out a valuabl woman i am glad you think so and the good hand i hope mai not be want come said he you ar anxiou for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improv her you have cure her of her schoolgirl s giggl she realli doe you credit thank you i should be mortifi inde if i did not believ i had been of some us but it is not everi bodi who will bestow prais where thei mai you do not often overpow me with it you ar expect her again you sai thi morn almost everi moment she ha been gone longer alreadi than she intend someth ha happen to delai her some visitor perhap highburi gossipstiresom wretch harriet mai not consid everi bodi tiresom that you would emma knew thi wa too true for contradict and therefor said noth he present ad with a smile i do not pretend to fix on time or place but i must tell you that i have good reason to believ your littl friend will soon hear of someth to her advantag inde how so of what sort a veri seriou sort i assur you still smile veri seriou i can think of but on thingwho is in love with her who make you their confid emma wa more than half in hope of mr elton s have dropt a hint mr knightlei wa a sort of gener friend and advis and she knew mr elton look up to him i have reason to think he repli that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriag and from a most unexception quarterrobert martin is the man her visit to abbeymil thi summer seem to have done hi busi he is desper in love and mean to marri her he is veri oblig said emma but is he sure that harriet mean to marri him well well mean to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbei two even ago on purpos to consult me about it he know i have a thorough regard for him and all hi famili and i believ consid me as on of hi best friend he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprud in him to settl so earli whether i thought her too young in short whether i approv hi choic altogeth have some apprehens perhap of her be consid especi sinc your make so much of her as in a line of societi abov him i wa veri much pleas with all that he said i never hear better sens from ani on than robert martin he alwai speak to the purpos open straightforward and veri well judg he told me everi thing hi circumst and plan and what thei all propos do in the event of hi marriag he is an excel young man both as son and brother i had no hesit in advis him to marri he prove to me that he could afford it and that be the case i wa convinc he could not do better i prais the fair ladi too and altogeth sent him awai veri happi if he had never esteem my opinion befor he would have thought highli of me then and i dare sai left the hous think me the best friend and counsellor man ever had thi happen the night befor last now as we mai fairli suppos he would not allow much time to pass befor he spoke to the ladi and as he doe not appear to have spoken yesterdai it is not unlik that he should be at mr goddard s todai and she mai be detain by a visitor without think him at all a tiresom wretch prai mr knightlei said emma who had been smile to herself through a great part of thi speech how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterdai certainli repli he surpriz i do not absolut know it but it mai be infer wa not she the whole dai with you come said she i will tell you someth in return for what you have told me he did speak yesterdaythat is he wrote and wa refus thi wa oblig to be repeat befor it could be believ and mr knightlei actual look red with surpriz and displeasur as he stood up in tall indign and said then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believ her what is the foolish girl about oh to be sure cri emma it is alwai incomprehens to a man that a woman should ever refus an offer of marriag a man alwai imagin a woman to be readi for ani bodi who ask her nonsens a man doe not imagin ani such thing but what is the mean of thi harriet smith refus robert martin mad if it is so but i hope you ar mistaken i saw her answernoth could be clearer you saw her answery wrote her answer too emma thi is your do you persuad her to refus him and if i did which howev i am far from allow i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a veri respect young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surpriz inde that he should have ventur to address her by your account he doe seem to have had some scrupl it is a piti that thei were ever got over not harriet s equal exclaim mr knightlei loudli and warmli and with calmer asper ad a few moment afterward no he is not her equal inde for he is as much her superior in sens as in situat emma your infatu about that girl blind you what ar harriet smith s claim either of birth natur or educ to ani connexion higher than robert martin she is the natur daughter of nobodi know whom with probabl no settl provis at all and certainli no respect relat she is known onli as parlourboard at a common school she is not a sensibl girl nor a girl of ani inform she ha been taught noth us and is too young and too simpl to have acquir ani thing herself at her ag she can have no experi and with her littl wit is not veri like ever to have ani that can avail her she is pretti and she is good temper and that is all my onli scrupl in advis the match wa on hi account as be beneath hi desert and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortun in all probabl he might do much better and that as to a ration companion or us helpmat he could not do wors but i could not reason so to a man in love and wa will to trust to there be no harm in her to her have that sort of disposit which in good hand like hi might be easili led aright and turn out veri well the advantag of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a gener cryout upon her extrem good luck even your satisfact i made sure of it cross my mind immedi that you would not regret your friend s leav highburi for the sake of her be settl so well i rememb sai to myself even emma with all her partial for harriet will think thi a good match i cannot help wonder at your know so littl of emma as to sai ani such thing what think a farmer and with all hi sens and all hi merit mr martin is noth more a good match for my intim friend not regret her leav highburi for the sake of marri a man whom i could never admit as an acquaint of my own i wonder you should think it possibl for me to have such feel i assur you mine ar veri differ i must think your statement by no mean fair you ar not just to harriet s claim thei would be estim veri differ by other as well as myself mr martin mai be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedli her inferior as to rank in societyth sphere in which she move is much abov hisit would be a degrad a degrad to illegitimaci and ignor to be marri to a respect intellig gentlemanfarm as to the circumst of her birth though in a legal sens she mai be call nobodi it will not hold in common sens she is not to pai for the offenc of other by be held below the level of those with whom she is brought upther can scarc be a doubt that her father is a gentlemanand a gentleman of fortuneh allow is veri liber noth ha ever been grudg for her improv or comfortthat she is a gentleman s daughter is indubit to me that she associ with gentlemen s daughter no on i apprehend will denysh is superior to mr robert martin whoever might be her parent said mr knightlei whoever mai have had the charg of her it doe not appear to have been ani part of their plan to introduc her into what you would call good societi after receiv a veri indiffer educ she is left in mr goddard s hand to shift as she canto move in short in mr goddard s line to have mr goddard s acquaint her friend evid thought thi good enough for her and it wa good enough she desir noth better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distast for her own set nor ani ambit beyond it she wa as happi as possibl with the martin in the summer she had no sens of superior then if she ha it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceed so far if he had not felt persuad of her not be disinclin to him i know him well he ha too much real feel to address ani woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of ani man i know depend upon it he had encourag it wa most conveni to emma not to make a direct repli to thi assert she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again you ar a veri warm friend to mr martin but as i said befor ar unjust to harriet harriet s claim to marri well ar not so contempt as you repres them she is not a clever girl but she ha better sens than you ar awar of and doe not deserv to have her understand spoken of so slightingli waiv that point howev and suppos her to be as you describ her onli pretti and goodnatur let me tell you that in the degre she possess them thei ar not trivial recommend to the world in gener for she is in fact a beauti girl and must be thought so by ninetynin peopl out of an hundr and till it appear that men ar much more philosoph on the subject of beauti than thei ar gener suppos till thei do fall in love with wellinform mind instead of handsom face a girl with such loveli as harriet ha a certainti of be admir and sought after of have the power of chuse from among mani consequ a claim to be nice her goodnatur too is not so veri slight a claim comprehend as it doe real thorough sweet of temper and manner a veri humbl opinion of herself and a great readi to be pleas with other peopl i am veri much mistaken if your sex in gener would not think such beauti and such temper the highest claim a woman could possess upon my word emma to hear you abus the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sens than misappli it as you do to be sure cri she playfulli i know that is the feel of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactli what everi man delight inwhat at onc bewitch hi sens and satisfi hi judgment oh harriet mai pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marri she is the veri woman for you and is she at seventeen just enter into life just begin to be known to be wonder at becaus she doe not accept the first offer she receiv noprai let her have time to look about her i have alwai thought it a veri foolish intimaci said mr knightlei present though i have kept my thought to myself but i now perceiv that it will be a veri unfortun on for harriet you will puff her up with such idea of her own beauti and of what she ha a claim to that in a littl while nobodi within her reach will be good enough for her vaniti work on a weak head produc everi sort of mischief noth so easi as for a young ladi to rais her expect too high miss harriet smith mai not find offer of marriag flow in so fast though she is a veri pretti girl men of sens whatev you mai chuse to sai do not want silli wive men of famili would not be veri fond of connect themselv with a girl of such obscurityand most prudent men would be afraid of the inconveni and disgrac thei might be involv in when the mysteri of her parentag came to be reveal let her marri robert martin and she is safe respect and happi for ever but if you encourag her to expect to marri greatli and teach her to be satisfi with noth less than a man of consequ and larg fortun she mai be a parlourboard at mr goddard s all the rest of her lifeor at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marri somebodi or other till she grow desper and is glad to catch at the old writingmast s son we think so veri differ on thi point mr knightlei that there can be no us in canvass it we shall onli be make each other more angri but as to my let her marri robert martin it is imposs she ha refus him and so decidedli i think as must prevent ani second applic she must abid by the evil of have refus him whatev it mai be and as to the refus itself i will not pretend to sai that i might not influenc her a littl but i assur you there wa veri littl for me or for ani bodi to do hi appear is so much against him and hi manner so bad that if she ever were dispos to favour him she is not now i can imagin that befor she had seen ani bodi superior she might toler

and project you haveand as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain emma laugh and disclaim he continu depend upon it elton will not do elton is a veri good sort of man and a veri respect vicar of highburi but not at all like to make an imprud match he know the valu of a good incom as well as ani bodi elton mai talk sentiment but he will act

he wa veri much vex he felt the disappoint of the young man and wa mortifi to have been the mean of promot it by the sanction he had given and the part which he wa persuad emma had taken in the affair wa provok him exceedingli emma remain in a state of vexat too but there wa more indistinct in the caus of her s than in hi she did not alwai feel so absolut satisfi with herself so entir convinc that her opinion were right and her adversari s wrong as mr knightlei he walk off in more complet selfapprob than he left for her she wa not so materi cast down howev but that a littl time and the return of harriet were veri adequ restor harriet s stai awai so long wa begin to make her uneasi the possibl of the young man s come to mr goddard s that morn and meet with harriet and plead hi own caus gave alarm idea the dread of such a failur after all becam the promin uneasi and when harriet appear and in veri good spirit and without have ani such reason to give for her long absenc she felt a satisfact which settl her with her own mind and convinc her that let mr knightlei think or sai what he would she had done noth which woman s friendship and woman s feel would not justifi he had frighten her a littl about mr elton but when she consid that mr knightlei could not have observ him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allow to tell herself in spite of mr

collect your friend will not take it amiss i hope of cours i have not transcrib beyond the first eight line mr elton certainli did not veri well know what to sai he look rather doubtinglyrath confus said someth about honour glanc at emma and at harriet and then see the book open on the tabl took it up and examin it veri attent with the view of pass off an awkward moment emma smilingli said you must make my apolog to your friend but so good a charad must not be confin to on or two he mai be sure of everi woman s approb while he write with such gallantri i have no hesit in sai repli mr elton though hesit a good deal while he spoke i have no hesit in sayingat least if my friend feel at all as i doi have not the smallest doubt that could he see hi littl effus honour as i see it look at the book again and replac it on the tabl he would consid it as the proudest moment of hi life after thi speech he wa gone as soon as possibl emma could not think it too soon for with all hi good and agreeabl qualiti there wa a sort of parad in hi speech which wa veri apt to inclin her to laugh she ran awai to indulg the inclin leav the tender and the sublim of pleasur to harriet s share chapter x though now the middl of decemb there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladi from toler regular exercis and on the morrow emma had a charit visit to pai to a poor sick famili who live a littl wai out of highburi their road to thi detach cottag wa down vicarag lane a lane lead at right angl from the broad though irregular main street of the place and as mai be infer contain the bless abod of mr elton a few inferior dwell were first to be pass and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarag an old and not veri good hous almost as close to the road as it could be it had no advantag of situat but had been veri much smarten up by the present proprietor and such as it wa there could be no possibl of the two friend pass it without a slacken pace and observ eyesemma s remark wa there it is there go you and your riddlebook on of these dai harriet s wa oh what a sweet househow veri beautifulther ar the yellow curtain that miss nash admir so much i do not often walk thi wai now said emma as thei proceed but then there will be an induc and i shall gradual get intim acquaint with all the hedg gate pool and pollard of thi part of highburi harriet she found had never in her life been insid the vicarag and her curios to see it wa so extrem that consid exterior and probabl emma could onli class it as a proof of love with mr elton s see readi wit in her i wish we could contriv it said she but i cannot think of ani toler pretenc for go inno servant that i want to inquir about of hi housekeeperno messag from my father she ponder but could think of noth after a mutual silenc of some minut harriet thu began again i do so wonder miss woodhous that you should not be marri or go to be marri so charm as you ar emma laugh and repli my be charm harriet is not quit enough to induc me to marri i must find other peopl charmingon other person at least and i am not onli not go to be marri at present but have veri littl intent of ever marri at all ahso you sai but i cannot believ it i must see somebodi veri superior to ani on i have seen yet to be tempt mr elton you know recollect herself is out of the question and i do not wish to see ani such person i would rather not be tempt i cannot realli chang for the better if i were to marri i must expect to repent it dear meit is so odd to hear a woman talk so i have none of the usual induc of women to marri were i to fall in love inde it would be a differ thing but i never have been in love it is not my wai or my natur and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i should be a fool to chang such a situat as mine fortun i do not want employ i do not want consequ i do not want i believ few marri women ar half as much mistress of their husband s hous as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truli belov and import so alwai first and alwai right in ani man s ey as i am in my father s but then to be an old maid at last like miss bate that is as formid an imag as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bate so sillyso satisfiedso smilingso prosingso undistinguish and unfastidiousand so apt to tell everi thing rel to everi bodi about me i would marri tomorrow but between us i am convinc there never can be ani like except in be unmarri but still you will be an old maid and that s so dread never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverti onli which make celibaci contempt to a gener public a singl woman with a veri narrow incom must be a ridicul disagre old maid the proper sport of boi and girl but

veri veri kind in their visit mr weston is realli as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholi wai you will be give isabella a fals idea of us all everi bodi must be awar that miss taylor must be miss but everi bodi ought also to be assur that mr and mr weston do realli prevent our miss her by ani mean to the extent we ourselv anticipatedwhich is the exact truth just as it should be said mr john knightlei and just as i hope it wa from your letter her wish of shew you attent could not be doubt and hi be a disengag and social man make it all easi i have been alwai tell you my love that i had no idea of the chang be so veri materi to hartfield as you apprehend and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfi why to be sure said mr woodhous ye certainlyi cannot deni that mr weston poor mr weston doe come and see us pretti oftenbut thensh is alwai oblig to go awai again it would be veri hard upon mr weston if she did not papay quit forget poor mr weston i think

taylor but as the most fortun woman in the world and as to slight mr weston that excel mr weston i think there is noth he doe not deserv i believ he is on of the veri besttemp men that ever exist except yourself and your brother i do not know hi equal for temper i shall never forget hi fly henri s kite for him that veri windi dai last easterand ever sinc hi particular kind last septemb

expect of hi come soon after the marriag but it end in noth and i have not heard him mention late but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father he wrote a letter to poor mr weston to

how it went on and it wa sign f c weston churchil i rememb that perfectli how veri pleas and proper of him cri the goodheart mr john knightlei i have no doubt of hi be a most amiabl young man but how

give up on s child i realli never could think well of ani bodi who propos such a thing to ani bodi els nobodi ever did think well of the churchil i fanci observ mr john knightlei coolli but you need not imagin mr weston to have felt what you would feel in give up henri or john mr weston is rather an easi cheerfultemp man than a man of strong feel he take thing as he find them and make enjoy of them somehow or other depend i suspect much more upon what is call societi for hi comfort that is upon the power of eat and drink and plai whist with hi neighbour five time a week than upon famili affect or ani thing that home afford emma could not like what border on a reflect on mr weston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggl and let it pass she would keep the peac if possibl and

on complet dinner engag and out of the hous too there wa no avoid though at christma mr weston would take no denial thei must all dine at randal on dayeven mr woodhous wa persuad to think it a possibl thing in prefer to a divis of the parti how thei were all to be convei he would have made a difficulti if he could but as hi son and daughter s carriag and hors were actual at hartfield he wa not abl to make more than a simpl question on that head it hardli amount to a doubt nor did it occupi emma long to convinc him that thei might in on of the carriag find room for harriet also harriet mr elton and mr knightlei their own especi set were the onli person invit to meet themth hour were to be earli as well as the number few mr woodhous s habit and inclin be consult in everi thing the even befor thi great event for it wa a veri great event that mr woodhous should dine out on the th of decemb had been spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indispos with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of be nurs by mr goddard emma could not have allow her to leav the hous emma call on her the next dai and found her doom alreadi sign with regard to randal she wa veri feverish and had a bad sore throat mr goddard wa full of care and affect mr perri wa talk of and harriet herself wa too ill and low to resist the author which exclud her from thi delight engag though she could not speak of her loss without mani tear emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mr goddard s unavoid absenc and rais her spirit by repres how much mr elton s would be depress when he knew her state and left her at last toler comfort in the sweet depend of hi have a most comfortless visit and of their all miss her veri much she had not advanc mani yard from mr goddard s door when she wa met by mr elton himself evid come toward it and as thei walk on slowli togeth in convers about the invalidof whom he on the rumour of consider ill had been go to inquir that he might carri some report of her to hartfieldthei were overtaken by mr john knightlei return from the daili visit to donwel with hi two eldest boi whose healthi glow face shew all the benefit of a countri run and seem to ensur a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pud thei were hasten home for thei join compani and proceed togeth emma wa just describ the natur of her friend s complaint a throat veri much inflam with a great deal of heat about her a quick low puls c and she wa sorri to find from mr goddard that harriet wa liabl to veri bad sorethroat and had often alarm her with them mr elton look all alarm on the occas as he exclaim a sorethroati hope not infecti i hope not of a putrid infecti sort ha perri seen her inde you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend let me entreat you to run no risk why doe not perri see her emma who wa not realli at all frighten herself tranquillis thi excess of apprehens by assur of mr goddard s experi and care but as there must still remain a degre of uneasi which she could not wish to reason awai which she would rather feed and assist than not she ad soon afterwardsa if quit anoth subject it is so cold so veri coldand look and feel so veri much like snow that if it were to ani other place or with ani other parti i should realli try not to go out todayand dissuad my father from ventur but as he ha made up hi mind and doe not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfer as i know it would be so great a disappoint to mr and mr weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainli excus myself you appear to me a littl hoars alreadi and when you consid what demand of voic and what fatigu tomorrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudenc to stai at home and take care of yourself tonight mr elton look as if he did not veri well know what answer to make which wa exactli the case for though veri much gratifi by the kind care of such a fair ladi and not like to resist ani advic of her s he had not realli the least inclin to give up the visitbut emma too eager and busi in her own previou concept and view to hear him imparti or see him with clear vision wa veri well satisfi with hi mutter acknowledg of it be veri cold certainli veri cold and walk on rejoic in have extric him from randal and secur him the power of send to inquir after harriet everi hour of the even you do quit right said she we will make your apolog to mr and mr weston but hardli had she so spoken when she found her brother wa civilli offer a seat in hi carriag if the weather were mr elton s onli object and mr elton actual accept the offer with much prompt satisfact it wa a done thing mr elton wa to go and never had hi broad handsom face express more pleasur than at thi moment never had hi smile been stronger nor hi ey more exult than when he next look at her well said she to herself thi is most strangeaft i had got him off so well to chuse to go into compani and leav harriet ill behindmost strang indeedbut there is i believ in mani men especi singl men such an inclinationsuch a passion for dine outa dinner engag is so high in the class of their pleasur their employ their digniti almost their duti that ani thing give wai to itand thi must be the case with mr elton a most valuabl amiabl pleas young man undoubtedli and veri much in love with harriet but still he cannot refus an invit he must dine out wherev he is ask what a strang thing love is he can see readi wit in harriet but will not dine alon for her soon afterward mr elton quit them and she could not but do him the justic of feel that there wa a great deal of sentiment in hi manner of name harriet at part in the tone of hi voic while assur her that he should call at mr goddard s for new of her fair friend the last thing befor he prepar for the happi of meet her again when he hope to be abl to give a better report and he sigh and smile himself off in a wai that left the balanc of approb much in hi favour after a few minut of entir silenc between them john knightlei began with i never in my life saw a man more intent on be agreeabl than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladi ar concern with men he can be ration and unaffect but when he ha ladi to pleas everi featur work mr elton s manner ar not perfect repli emma but where there is a wish to pleas on ought to overlook and on doe overlook a great deal where a man doe hi best with onli moder power he will have the advantag over neglig superior there is such perfect goodtemp and goodwil in mr elton as on cannot but valu ye said mr john knightlei present with some slyness he seem to have a great deal of goodwil toward you me she repli with a smile of astonish ar you imagin me to be mr elton s object such an imagin ha cross me i own emma and if it never occur to you befor you mai as well take it into consider now mr elton in love with mewhat an idea i do not sai it is so but you will do well to consid whether it is so or not and to regul your behaviour accordingli i think your manner to him encourag i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do i thank you but i assur you you ar quit mistaken mr elton and i ar veri good friend and noth more and she walk on amus herself in the consider of the blunder which often aris from a partial knowledg of circumst of the mistak which peopl of high pretens to judgment ar for ever fall into and not veri well pleas with her brother for imagin her blind and ignor and in want of counsel he said no more mr woodhous had so complet made up hi mind to the visit that in spite of the increas cold he seem to have no idea of shrink from it and set forward at last most punctual with hi eldest daughter in hi own carriag with less appar conscious of the weather than either of the other too full of the wonder of hi own go and the pleasur it wa to afford at randal to see that it wa cold and too well wrapt up to feel it the cold howev wa sever and by the time the second carriag wa in motion a few flake of snow were find their wai down and the sky had the appear of be so overcharg as to want onli a milder air to produc a veri white world in a veri short time emma soon saw that her companion wa not in the happiest humour the prepar and the go abroad in such weather with the sacrific of hi children after dinner were evil were disagre at least which mr john knightlei did not by ani mean like he anticip noth in the visit that could be at all worth the purchas and the whole of their drive to the vicarag wa spent by him in express hi discont a man said he must have a veri good opinion of himself when he ask peopl to leav their own firesid and encount such a dai as thi for the sake of come to see him he must think himself a most agreeabl fellow i could not do such a thing it is the greatest absurdityactu snow at thi momentth folli of not allow peopl to be comfort at homeand the folli of peopl s not stai comfort

in worsefour hors and four servant taken out for noth but to convei five idl shiver creatur into colder room and wors compani than thei might have had at home emma did not find herself equal to give the pleas assent which no doubt he wa in the habit of receiv to emul the veri true my love which must have been usual administ by hi travel companion but she had resolut enough to refrain from make ani answer at all she could not be compli she dread be quarrelsom her heroism reach onli to silenc she allow him to talk and arrang the glass and wrap herself up without open her lip thei arriv the carriag turn the step wa let down and mr elton spruce black and smile wa with them instantli emma thought with pleasur of some chang of subject mr elton wa all oblig and cheer he wa so veri cheer in hi civil inde that she began to think he must have receiv a differ account of harriet from what had reach her she had sent while dress and the answer had been much the samenot better my report from mr

of tell you that when i call at mr goddard s door which i did the veri last thing befor i return to dress i wa told that miss smith wa not better by no mean better rather wors veri much griev and concernedi had flatter myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morn emma smile and answer my visit wa of us to the nervou part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm awai a sore throat it is a most sever cold inde mr perri ha been with her as you probabl heard yesi imaginedthat isi did not he ha been us to her in these complaint and i hope tomorrow morn will bring us both a more comfort report but it is imposs not to feel uneasi such a sad loss to our parti todai dreadfulexactli so indeedsh will be miss everi moment thi wa veri proper the sigh which accompani it wa realli estim but it should have last longer emma wa rather in dismai when onli half a minut afterward he began to speak of other thing and in a voic of the greatest

the larg parti of london mai not quit enter into our feel i know noth of the larg parti of london siri never dine with ani bodi inde in a tone of wonder and piti i had no idea that the law had been so great a slaveri well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all thi when you will have littl labour and great enjoy my first enjoy repli john knightlei as thei pass through the sweepgat will be to find myself safe at hartfield again chapter xiv some chang of counten wa necessari for each gentleman as thei walk into mr weston s drawingroommr elton must compos hi joyou look and mr john knightlei dispers hi illhumour mr elton must smile less and mr john knightlei more to fit them for the placeemma onli might be as natur prompt and shew herself just as happi as she wa to her it wa real enjoy to be with the weston mr weston wa a great favourit and there wa not a creatur in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserv as to hi wife not ani on to whom she relat with such convict of be listen to and understood of be alwai interest and alwai intellig the littl affair arrang perplex and pleasur of her father and herself she could tell noth of hartfield in which mr weston had not a live concern and half an hour s uninterrupt commun of all those littl matter on which the daili happi of privat life depend wa on of the first gratif of each thi wa a pleasur which perhap the whole dai s visit might not afford which certainli did not belong to the present halfhour but the veri sight of mr weston her smile her touch her voic wa grate to emma and she determin to think as littl as possibl of mr elton s odditi or of ani thing els unpleas and enjoi all that wa enjoy to the utmost the misfortun of harriet s cold had been pretti well gone through befor her arriv mr woodhous had been safe seat long enough to give the histori of it besid all the histori of hi own and isabella s come and of emma s be to follow and had inde just got to the end of hi satisfact that jame should come and see hi daughter when the other appear and mr weston who had been almost wholli engross by her attent to him wa abl to turn awai and welcom her dear emma emma s project of forget mr elton for a while made her rather sorri to find when thei had all taken their place that he wa close to her the difficulti wa great of drive hi strang insens toward harriet from her mind while he not onli sat at her elbow but wa continu obtrud hi happi counten on her notic and solicit address her upon everi occas instead of forget him hi behaviour wa such that she could not avoid the intern suggest of can it realli be as my brother imagin can it be possibl for thi man to be begin to transfer hi affect from harriet to meabsurd and insuffer yet he would be so anxiou for her be perfectli warm would be so interest about her father and so delight with mr weston and at last would begin admir her draw with so much zeal and so littl knowledg as seem terribl like a wouldb lover and made it some effort with her to preserv her good manner for her own sake she could not be rude and for harriet s in the hope that all would yet turn out right she wa even posit civil but it wa an effort especi as someth wa go on amongst the other in the most overpow period of mr elton s nonsens which she particularli wish to listen to she heard enough to know that mr weston wa give some inform about hi son she heard the word my son and frank and my son repeat sever time over and from a few other halfsyl veri much suspect that he wa announc an earli visit from hi son but befor she could quiet mr elton the subject wa so complet past that ani reviv question from her would have been awkward now it so happen that in spite of emma s resolut of never marri there wa someth in the name in the idea of mr frank churchil which alwai interest her she had frequent thoughtespeci sinc hi father s marriag with miss taylorthat if she were to marri he wa the veri person to suit her in ag charact and condit he seem by thi connexion between the famili quit to belong to her she could not but suppos it to be a match that everi bodi who knew them must think of that mr and mr weston did think of it she wa veri strongli persuad and though not mean to be induc by him or by ani bodi els to give up a situat which she believ more replet with good than ani she could chang it for she had a great curios to see him a decid intent of find him pleasant of be like by him to a certain degre and a sort of pleasur in the idea of their be coupl in their friend imagin with such sensat mr elton s civil were dreadfulli illtim but she had the comfort of appear veri polit while feel veri crossand of think that the rest of the visit could not possibl pass without bring forward the same inform again or the substanc of it from the openheart mr westonso it provedfor when happili releas from mr elton and seat by mr weston at dinner he made us of the veri first interv in the care of hospit the veri first leisur from the saddl of mutton to sai to her we want onli two more to be just the right number i should like to see two more hereyour pretti littl friend miss smith and my sonand then i should sai we were quit complet i believ you did not hear me tell the other in the drawingroom that we ar expect frank i had a letter from him thi morn and he will be with us within a fortnight emma spoke with a veri proper degre of pleasur and fulli assent to hi proposit of mr frank churchil and miss smith make their parti quit complet he ha been want to come to us continu mr weston ever sinc septemb everi letter ha been full of it but he cannot command hi own time he ha those to pleas who must be pleas and who between ourselv ar sometim to be pleas onli by a good mani sacrific but now i have no doubt of see him here about the second week in januari what a veri great pleasur it will be to you and mr weston is so anxiou to be acquaint with him that she must be almost as happi as yourself ye she would be but that she think there will be anoth putoff she doe not depend upon hi come so much as i do but she doe not know the parti so well as i do the case you see isbut thi is quit between ourselv i did not mention a syllabl of it in the other room there ar secret in all famili you knowth case is that a parti of friend ar invit to pai a visit at enscomb in januari and that frank s come depend upon their be put off if thei ar not put off he cannot stir but i know thei will becaus it is a famili that a certain ladi of some consequ at enscomb ha a particular dislik to and though it is thought necessari to invit them onc in two or three year thei alwai ar put off when it come to the point i have not the smallest doubt of the issu i am as confid of see frank here befor the middl of januari as i am of be here myself but your good friend there nod toward the upper end of the tabl ha so few vagari herself and ha been so littl us to them at hartfield that she cannot calcul on their effect as i have been long in the practic of do i am sorri there should be ani thing like doubt in the case repli emma but am dispos to side with you mr weston if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscomb yesi have some right to that knowledg though i have never been at the place in my lifesh is an odd womanbut i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believ her to be veri fond of him i us to think she wa not capabl of be fond of ani bodi except herself but she ha alwai been kind to him in her wayallow for littl whim and capric and expect everi thing to be as she like and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excit such an affect for though i would not sai it to ani bodi els she ha no more heart than a stone to peopl in gener and the devil of a temper emma like the subject so well that she began upon it to mr weston veri soon after their move into the drawingroom wish her joyyet observ that she knew the first meet must be rather alarm mr weston agre to it but ad that she should be veri glad to be secur of undergo the anxieti of a first meet at the time talk of for i cannot depend upon hi come i cannot be so sanguin as mr weston i am veri much afraid that it will all end in noth mr weston i dare sai ha been tell you exactli how the matter stand yesit seem to depend upon noth but the illhumour of mr churchil which i imagin to be the most certain thing in the world my emma repli mr weston smile what is the certainti of capric then turn to isabella who had not been attend befor you must know my dear mr knightlei that we ar by no mean so sure of see mr frank churchil in my opinion as hi father think it depend entir upon hi aunt s spirit and pleasur in short upon her temper to youto my two daughtersi mai ventur on the truth mr churchil rule at enscomb and is a veri oddtemp woman and hi come now depend upon her be will to spare him oh mr churchil everi bodi know mr churchil repli isabella and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compass to be constantli live with an illtemp person must be dread it is what we happili have never known ani thing of but it must be a life of miseri what a bless that she never had ani children poor littl creatur how unhappi she would have made them emma wish she had been alon with mr weston she should then have heard more mr weston would speak to her with a degre of unreserv which she would not hazard with isabella and she realli believ would scarc try to conceal ani thing rel to the churchil from her except those view on the young man of which her own imagin had alreadi given her such instinct knowledg but at present there wa noth more to be said mr woodhous veri soon follow them into the drawingroom to be sit long after dinner wa a confin that he could not endur neither wine nor convers wa ani thing to him and gladli did he move to those with whom he wa alwai comfort while he talk to isabella howev emma found an opportun of sai and so you do not consid thi visit from your son as by ani mean certain i am sorri for it the introduct must be unpleas whenev it take place and the sooner it could be over the better ye and everi delai make on more apprehens of other delai even if thi famili the braithwait ar put off i am still afraid that some excus mai be found for disappoint us i cannot bear to imagin ani reluct on hi side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchil to keep him to themselv there is jealousi thei ar jealou even of hi regard for hi father in short i can feel no depend on hi come and i wish mr weston were less sanguin he ought to come said emma if he could stai onli a coupl of dai he ought to come and on can hardli conceiv a young man s not have it in hi power to do as much as that a young woman if she fall into bad hand mai be teas and kept at a distanc from those she want to be with but on cannot comprehend a young man s be under such restraint as not to be abl to spend a week with hi father if he like it on ought to be at enscomb and know the wai of the famili befor on decid upon what he can do repli mr weston on ought to us the same caution perhap in judg of the conduct of ani on individu of ani on famili but enscomb i believ certainli must not be judg by gener rule she is so veri unreason and everi thing give wai to her but she is so fond of the nephew he is so veri great a favourit now accord to my idea of mr churchil it would be most natur that while she make no sacrific for the comfort of the husband to whom she ow everi thing while she exercis incess capric toward him she should frequent be govern by the nephew to whom she ow noth at all my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad on or to lai down rule for it you must let it go it own wai i have no doubt of hi have at time consider influenc but it mai be perfectli imposs for him to know beforehand when it will be emma listen and then coolli said i shall not be satisfi unless he come he mai have a great deal of influenc on some point continu mr weston and on other veri littl and among those on which she is beyond hi reach it is but too like mai be thi veri circumst of hi come awai from them to visit us chapter xv mr woodhous wa soon readi for hi tea and when he had drank hi tea he wa quit readi to go home and it wa as much as hi three companion could do to entertain awai hi notic of the late of the hour befor the other gentlemen appear mr weston wa chatti and convivi and no friend to earli separ of ani sort but at last the drawingroom parti did receiv an augment mr elton in veri good spirit wa on of the first to walk in mr weston and emma were sit togeth on a sofa he join them immedi and with scarc an invit seat himself between them emma in good spirit too from the amus afford her mind by the expect of mr frank churchil wa will to forget hi late improprieti and be as well satisfi with him as befor and on hi make harriet hi veri first subject wa readi to listen with most friendli smile he profess himself extrem anxiou about her fair friendher fair love amiabl friend did she knowhad she heard ani thing about her sinc their be at randallsh felt much anxietyh must confess that the natur of her complaint alarm him consider and in thi style he talk on for some time veri properli not much attend to ani answer but altogeth suffici awak to the terror of a bad sore throat and emma wa quit in chariti with him but at last there seem a pervers turn it seem all at onc as if he were more afraid of it be a bad sore throat on her account than on harriet smore anxiou that she should escap the infect than that there should be no infect in the complaint he began with great earnest to entreat her to refrain from visit the sickchamb again for the presentto entreat her to promis him not to ventur into such hazard till he had seen mr perri and learnt hi opinion and though she tri to laugh it off and bring the subject back into it proper cours there wa no put an end to hi extrem solicitud about her she wa vex it did appearther wa no conceal itexactli like the pretenc of be in love with her instead of harriet an inconst if real the most contempt and abomin and she had difficulti in behav with temper he turn to mr weston to implor her assist would not she give him her supportwould not she add her persuas to hi to induc miss woodhous not to go to mr goddard s till it were certain that miss smith s disord had no infect he could not be satisfi without a promisewould not she give him her influenc in procur it so scrupul for other he continu and yet so careless for herself she want me to nurs my cold by stai at home todai and yet will not promis to avoid the danger of catch an ulcer sore throat herself is thi fair mr westonjudg between us have not i some right to complain i am sure of your kind support and aid emma saw mr weston s surpriz and felt that it must be great at an address which in word and manner wa assum to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she wa too much provok and offend to have the power of directli sai ani thing to the purpos she could onli give him a look but it wa such a look as she thought must restor him to hi sens and then left the sofa remov to a seat by her sister and give her all her attent she had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidli did anoth subject succe for mr john knightlei now came into the room from examin the weather and open on them all with the inform of the ground be cover with snow and of it still snow fast with a strong drift wind conclud with these word to mr woodhous thi will prove a spirit begin of your winter engag sir someth new for your coachman and hors to be make their wai through a storm of snow poor mr woodhous wa silent from constern but everi bodi els had someth to sai everi bodi wa either surpriz or not surpriz and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer mr weston and emma tri earnestli to cheer him and turn hi attent from hi soninlaw who wa pursu hi triumph rather unfeelingli i admir your resolut veri much sir said he in ventur out in such weather for of cours you saw there would be snow veri soon everi

in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare sai we shall be all safe at hartfield befor midnight mr weston with triumph of a differ sort wa confess that he had known it to be snow some time but had not said a word lest it should make mr woodhous uncomfort and be an excus for hi hurri awai as to there be ani quantiti of snow fallen or like to fall to imped their return that wa a mere joke he wa afraid thei would find no difficulti he wish the road might be impass that he might be abl to keep them all at randal and with the utmost goodwil wa sure that accommod might be found for everi bodi call on hi wife to agre with him that with a littl contriv everi bodi might be lodg which she hardli knew how to do from the conscious of there be but two spare room in the hous what is to be done my dear emmawhat is to be done wa mr woodhous s first exclam and all that he could sai for some time to her he look for comfort and her assur of safeti her represent of the

and that is hi duti not by manoeuvr and finess but by vigour and resolut it is frank churchil s duti to pai thi attent to hi father he know it to be so by hi promis and messag but if he wish to do it it might be done a man who felt rightli would sai at onc simpli and resolut to mr churchil everi sacrific of mere pleasur you will alwai find me readi to make to your conveni but i must go and see my

you expect miss fairfax here soon oh ye next week indeedthat must be a veri great pleasur thank you you ar veri kind ye next week everi bodi is so surpriz and everi bodi sai the same oblig thing i am

veri good of them to send her the whole wai but thei alwai do you know oh ye fridai or saturdai next that is what she write about that is the reason of her write out of rule as we call it for in the common cours we should not have heard from her befor next tuesdai or wednesdai ye so i imagin i wa afraid there could be littl chanc of my hear ani thing of miss fairfax todai so oblig of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for thi particular circumst of her be to come here so soon my mother is so delightedfor she is to be three month with us at least three month she sai so posit as i am go to have the pleasur of read to you the case is you see that the campbel ar go to ireland mr dixon ha persuad her father and mother to come over and see her directli thei had not intend to go over till the summer but she is so impati to see them againfor till she marri last octob she wa never awai from them so much as a week which must make it veri strang to be in differ kingdom i wa go to sai but howev differ countri and so she wrote a veri urgent letter to her motheror her father i declar i do not know which it wa but we shall see present in jane s letterwrot in mr dixon s name as well as her own to press their come over directli and thei would give them the meet in dublin and take them back to their countri seat balycraig a beauti place i fanci jane ha heard a great deal of it beauti from mr dixon i meani do not know that she ever heard about it from ani bodi els but it wa veri natur you know that he should like to speak of hi own place while he wa pai hi addressesand as jane us to be veri often walk out with themfor colonel and mr campbel were veri particular about their daughter s not walk out often with onli mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of cours she heard everi thing he might be tell miss campbel about hi own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some draw of the place view that he had taken himself he is a most amiabl charm young man i believ jane wa quit long to go to ireland from hi account of thing at thi moment an ingeni and anim suspicion enter emma s brain with regard to jane fairfax thi charm mr dixon and the not go to ireland she said with the insidi design of farther discoveri you must feel it veri fortun that miss fairfax should be allow to come to you at such a time consid the veri particular friendship between her and mr dixon you could hardli have expect her to be excus from accompani colonel and mr campbel veri true veri true inde the veri thing that we have alwai been rather afraid of for we should not have like to have her at such a distanc from us for month togethernot abl to come if ani thing wa to happen but you see everi thing turn out for the best thei want her mr and mr dixon excess to come over with colonel and mr campbel quit depend upon it noth can be more kind or press than their joint invit jane sai as you will hear present mr dixon doe not seem in the least backward in ani attent he is a most charm young man ever sinc the servic he render jane at weymouth when thei were out in that parti on the water and she by the sudden whirl round of someth or other among the sail would have been dash into the sea at onc and actual wa all but gone if he had not with the greatest presenc of mind caught hold of her habit i can never think of it without tremblingbut ever sinc we had the histori of that dai i have been so fond of mr dixon but in spite of all her friend urgenc and her own wish of see ireland miss fairfax prefer devot the time to you and mr bate yesentir her own do entir her own choic and colonel and mr campbel think she doe quit right just what thei should recommend and inde thei particularli wish her to try her nativ air as she ha not been quit so well as usual late i am concern to hear of it i think thei judg wise but mr dixon must be veri much disappoint mr dixon i understand ha no remark degre of person beauti is not by ani mean to be compar with miss fairfax oh no you ar veri oblig to sai such thingsbut certainli not there is no comparison between them miss campbel alwai wa absolut plainbut extrem eleg and amiabl ye that of cours jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the th of novemb as i am go to read to you and ha never been well sinc a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mention it befor becaus she would not alarm us just like her so consideratebut howev she is so far from well that her kind friend the campbel think she had better come home and try an air that alwai agre with her and thei have no doubt that three or four month at highburi will entir cure herand it is certainli a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwel nobodi could nurs her as we should do it appear to me the most desir arrang in the world and so she is to come to us next fridai or saturdai and the campbel leav town in their wai to holyhead the mondai followinga you will find from jane s letter so suddeny mai guess dear miss woodhous what a flurri it ha thrown me in if it wa not for the drawback of her illnessbut i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and look veri poorli i must tell you what an unlucki thing happen to me as to that i alwai make a point of read jane s letter through to myself first befor i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there be ani thing in them to distress her jane desir me to do it so i alwai do and so i began todai with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her be unwel than i burst out quit frighten with bless me poor jane is ill which my mother be on the watch heard distinctli and wa sadli alarm at howev when i read on i found it wa not near so bad as i had fanci at first and i make so light of it now to her that she doe not think much about it but i cannot imagin how i could be so off my guard if jane doe not get well soon we will call in mr perri the expens shall not be thought of and though he is so liber and so fond of jane that i dare sai he would not mean to charg ani thing for attend we could not suffer it to be so you know he ha a wife and famili to maintain and is not to be give awai hi time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane write about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tell her own stori a great deal better than i can tell it for her i am afraid we must be run awai said emma glanc at harriet and begin to rise my father will be expect us i had no intent i thought i had no power of stai more than five minut when i first

in which her conscienc could not quit acquit her but she could never get acquaint with her she did not know how it wa but there wa such cold and reservesuch appar indiffer whether she pleas or notand

as she wa pass by the hous where a young woman wa make up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stai half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directli as fast as she could and took shelter at ford s ford s wa the princip woollendrap linendrap and haberdash s shop

agreeabl prospect of see him again and for a longer time than hitherto of judg of hi gener manner and by infer of the mean of hi manner toward herself of guess how soon it might be necessari for her to throw cold into her air and of fanci what the observ of all those might be who were now see them togeth for the first time she meant to be veri happi in spite of the scene be laid at mr cole s and

much reason to be satisfi with the rest of the parti as with mr knightlei she wa receiv with a cordial respect which could not but pleas and given all the consequ she could wish for when the weston arriv the kindest look of love the strongest of admir were for her from both husband and wife the son approach her with a cheer eager which mark her as hi peculiar object and at dinner she found him seat by herand as she firmli believ not without some dexter on hi side the parti wa rather larg as it includ on other famili a proper unobjection countri famili whom the cole had the advantag of name among their acquaint and the male part of mr cox s famili the lawyer of highburi the less worthi femal were to come in the even with miss bate miss fairfax and miss smith but alreadi at dinner thei were too numer for ani subject of convers to be gener and while polit and mr elton were talk over emma could fairli surrend all her attent to the pleasant of her neighbour the first remot sound to which she felt herself oblig to attend wa the name of jane fairfax mr cole seem to be relat someth of her that wa expect to be veri interest she listen and found it well worth listen to that veri dear part of emma her fanci receiv an amus suppli mr cole wa tell that she had been call on miss bate and as soon as she enter the room had been struck by the sight of a pianofortea veri eleg look instrumentnot a grand but a larges squar pianofort and the substanc of the stori the end of all the dialogu which ensu of surpriz and inquiri and congratul on her side and explan on miss bate s wa that thi pianofort had arriv from broadwood s the dai befor to the great astonish of both aunt and nieceentir unexpect that at first by miss bate s account jane herself wa quit at a loss quit bewild to think who could possibl have order itbut now thei were both perfectli satisfi that it could be from onli on quarterof cours it must be from colonel campbel on can suppos noth els ad mr cole and i wa onli surpriz that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seem had a letter from them veri late and not a word wa said about it she know their wai best but i should not consid their silenc as ani reason for their not mean to make the present thei might chuse to surpriz her mr cole had mani to agre with her everi bodi who spoke on the subject wa equal convinc that it must come from colonel campbel and equal rejoic that such a present had been made and there were enough readi to speak to allow emma to think her own wai and still listen to mr cole i declar i do not know when i have heard ani thing that ha given me more satisfactionit alwai ha quit hurt me that jane fairfax who plai so delightfulli should not have an instrument it seem quit a shame especi consid how mani hous there ar where fine instrument ar absolut thrown awai thi is like give ourselv a slap to be sure and it wa but yesterdai i wa tell mr cole i realli wa asham to look at our new grand pianofort in the drawingroom while i do not know on note from anoth and our littl girl who ar but just begin perhap mai never make ani thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music ha not ani thing of the natur of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amus herself withi wa sai thi to mr cole but yesterdai and he quit agre with me onli he is so particularli fond of music that he could not help indulg himself in the purchas hope that some of our good neighbour might be so oblig occasion to put it to a better us than we can and that realli is the reason why the instrument wa boughtor els i am sure we ought to be asham of itw ar in great hope that miss woodhous mai be prevail with to try it thi even miss woodhous made the proper acquiesc and find that noth more wa to be entrap from ani commun of mr cole s turn to frank churchil why do you smile said she nai why do you mei suppos i smile for pleasur at colonel campbel s be so rich and so liberalit is a handsom present veri i rather wonder that it wa never made befor perhap miss fairfax ha never been stai here so long befor or that he did not give her the us of their own instrumentwhich must now be shut up in london untouch by ani bodi that is a grand pianofort and he might think it too larg for mr bate s hous you mai sai what you chusebut your counten testifi that your thought on thi subject ar veri much like mine i do not know i rather believ you ar give me more credit for acut than i deserv i smile becaus you smile and shall probabl suspect whatev i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbel is not the person who can be what do you sai to mr dixon mr dixon veri true inde i had not thought of mr dixon she must know as well as her father how accept an instrument would be and perhap the mode of it the mysteri the surpriz is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderli man s it is mr dixon i dare sai i told you that your suspicion would guid mine if so you must extend your suspicion and comprehend mr dixon in them mr dixonveri well ye i immedi perceiv that it must be the joint present of mr and mr dixon we were speak the other dai you know of hi be so warm an admir of her perform ye and what you told me on that head confirm an idea which i had entertain beforei do not mean to reflect upon the good intent of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspect either that after make hi propos to her friend he had the misfortun to fall in love with her or that he becam consciou of a littl attach on her side on might guess twenti thing without guess exactli the right but i am sure there must be a particular caus for her chuse to come to highburi instead of go with the campbel to ireland here she must be lead a life of privat and penanc there it would have been all enjoy as to the pretenc of try her nativ air i look upon that as a mere excusein the summer it might have pass but what can ani bodi s nativ air do for them in the month of januari februari and march good fire and carriag would be much more to the purpos in most case of delic health and i dare sai in her s i do not requir you to adopt all my suspicion though you make so nobl a profess of do it but i honestli tell you what thei ar and upon my word thei have an air of great probabl mr dixon s prefer of her music to her friend s i can answer for be veri decid and then he save her life did you ever hear of thata water parti and by some accid she wa fall overboard he caught her he did i wa thereon of the parti were you reallywellbut you observ noth of cours for it seem to be a new idea to youif i had been there i think i should have made some discoveri i dare sai you would but i simpl i saw noth but the fact that miss fairfax wa nearli dash from the vessel and that mr dixon caught herit wa the work of a moment and though the consequ shock and alarm wa veri great and much more durableinde i believ it wa half an hour befor ani of us were comfort againyet that wa too gener a sensat for ani thing of peculiar anxieti to be observ i do not mean to sai howev that you might not have made discoveri the convers wa here interrupt thei were call on to share in the awkward of a rather long interv between the cours and oblig to be as formal and as orderli as the other but when the tabl wa again safe cover when everi corner dish wa place exactli right and occup and eas were gener restor emma said the arriv of thi pianofort is decis with me i want to know a littl more and thi tell me quit enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mr dixon and if the dixon should absolut deni all knowledg of it we must conclud it to come from the campbel no i am sure it is not from the campbel miss fairfax know it is not from the campbel or thei would have been guess at first she would not have been puzzl had she dare fix on them i mai not have convinc you perhap but i am perfectli convinc myself that mr dixon is a princip in the busi inde you injur me if you suppos me unconvinc your reason carri my judgment along with them entir at first while i suppos you satisfi that colonel campbel wa the giver i saw it onli as patern kind and thought it the most natur thing in the world but when you mention mr dixon i felt how much more probabl that it should be the tribut of warm femal friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offer of love there wa no occas to press the matter farther the convict seem real he look as if he felt it she said no more other subject took their turn and the rest of the dinner pass awai the dessert succeed the children came in and were talk to and admir amid the usual rate of convers a few clever thing said a few downright silli but by much the larger proport neither the on nor the othernoth wors than everydai remark dull repetit old new and heavi joke the ladi had not been long in the drawingroom befor the other ladi in their differ divis arriv emma watch the entre of her own particular littl friend and if she could not exult in her digniti and grace she could not onli love the bloom sweet and the artless manner but could most heartili rejoic in that light cheer unsentiment disposit which allow her so mani allevi of pleasur in the midst of the pang of disappoint affect there she satand who would have guess how mani tear she had been late shed to be in compani nice dress herself and see other nice dress to sit and smile and look pretti and sai noth wa enough for the happi of the present hour jane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspect she might have been glad to chang feel with harriet veri glad to have purchas the mortif of have lovedy of have love even mr elton in vainbi the surrend of all the danger pleasur of know herself belov by the husband of her friend in so larg a parti it wa not necessari that emma should approach her she did not wish to speak of the pianofort she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appear of curios or interest fair and therefor purpos kept at a distanc but by the other the subject wa almost immedi introduc and she saw the blush of conscious with which congratul were receiv the blush of guilt which accompani the name of my excel friend colonel campbel mr weston kindheart and music wa particularli interest by the circumst and emma could not help be amus at her persever in dwell on the subject and have so much to ask and to sai as to tone touch and pedal total unsuspici of that wish of sai as littl about it as possibl which she plainli read in the fair heroin s counten thei were soon join by some of the gentlemen and the veri first of the earli wa frank churchil in he walk the first and the handsomest and after pai hi compliment en passant to miss bate and her niec made hi wai directli to the opposit side of the circl where sat miss woodhous and till he could find a seat by her would not sit at all emma divin what everi bodi present must be think she wa hi object and everi bodi must perceiv it she introduc him to her friend miss smith and at conveni moment afterward heard what each thought of the other he had never seen so love a face and wa delight with her naivet and she onli to be sure it wa pai him too great a compliment but she did think there were some look a littl like mr elton emma restrain her indign and onli turn from her in silenc smile of intellig pass between her and the gentleman on first glanc toward miss fairfax but it wa most prudent to avoid speech he told her that he had been impati to leav the diningroomh sit longwa alwai the first to move when he couldthat hi father mr knightlei mr cox and mr cole were left veri busi over parish businessthat as long as he had staid howev it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in gener a set of gentlemanlik sensibl men and spoke so handsom of highburi altogetherthought it so abund in agreeabl familiesthat emma began to feel she had been us to despis the place rather too much she question him as to the societi in yorkshireth extent of the neighbourhood about enscomb and the sort and could make out from hi answer that as far as enscomb wa concern there wa veri littl go on that their visit were among a rang of great famili none veri near and that even when dai were fix and invit accept it wa an even chanc that mr churchil were not in health and spirit for go that thei made a point of visit no fresh person and that though he had hi separ engag it wa not without difficulti without consider address at time that he could get awai or introduc an acquaint for a night she saw that enscomb could not satisfi and that highburi taken at it best might reason pleas a young man who had more retir at home than he like hi import at enscomb wa veri evid he did not boast but it natur betrai itself that he had persuad hi aunt where hi uncl could do noth and on her laugh and notic it he own that he believ except on or two point he could with time persuad her to ani thing on of those point on which hi influenc fail he then mention he had want veri much to go abroadhad been veri eager inde to be allow to travelbut she would not hear of it thi had happen the year befor now he said he wa begin to have no longer the same wish the unpersuad point which he did not mention emma guess to be good behaviour to hi father i have made a most wretch discoveri said he after a short paus i have been here a week tomorrowhalf my time i never knew dai fly so fast a week tomorrowand i have hardli begun to enjoi myself but just got acquaint with mr weston and othersi hate the recollect perhap you mai now begin to regret that you spent on whole dai out of so few in have your hair cut no said he smile that is no subject of regret at all i have no pleasur in see my friend unless i can believ myself fit to be seen the rest of the gentlemen be now in the room emma found herself oblig to turn from him for a few minut and listen to mr cole when mr cole had move awai and her attent could be restor as befor she saw frank churchil look intent across the room at miss fairfax who wa sit exactli opposit what is the matter said she he start thank you for rous me he repli i believ i have been veri rude but realli miss fairfax ha done her hair in so odd a wayso veri odd a waythat i cannot keep my ey from her i never saw ani thing so outreethos curlsthi must be a fanci of her own i see nobodi els look like heri must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall iy i willi declar i willand you shall see how she take itwheth she colour he wa gone immedi and emma soon saw him stand befor miss fairfax and talk to her but as to it effect on the young ladi as he had improvid place himself exactli between them exactli in front of miss fairfax she could absolut distinguish noth befor he could return to hi chair it wa taken by mr weston thi is the luxuri of a larg parti said she on can get near everi bodi and sai everi thing my dear emma i am long to talk to you i have been make discoveri and form plan just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh do you know how miss bate and her niec came here howthei were invit were not thei oh yesbut how thei were convei hitherth manner of their come thei walk i conclud how els could thei come veri truewel a littl while ago it occur to me how veri sad it would be to have jane fairfax walk home again late at night and cold as the night ar now and as i look at her though i never saw her appear to more advantag it struck me that she wa heat and would therefor be particularli liabl to take cold poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriag you mai guess how readili he came into my wish and have hi approb i made my wai directli to miss bate to assur her that the carriag would be at her servic befor it took us home for i thought it would be make her comfort at onc good soul she wa as grate as possibl you mai be sure nobodi wa ever so fortun as herself but with mani mani thank there wa no occas to troubl us for mr knightlei s carriag had brought and wa to take them home again i wa quit surprizedveri glad i am sure but realli quit surpriz such a veri kind attentionand so thought an attentionth sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short from know hi usual wai i am veri much inclin to think that it wa for their accommod the carriag wa us at all i do suspect he would not have had a pair of hors for himself and that it wa onli as an excus for assist them veri like said emma noth more like i know no man more like than mr knightlei to do the sort of thingto do ani thing realli goodnatur us consider or benevol he is not a gallant man but he is a veri human on and thi consid jane fairfax s illhealth would appear a case of human to himand for an act of unostentati kind there is nobodi whom i would fix on more than on mr knightlei i know he had hors todayfor we arriv togeth and i laugh at him about it but he said not a word that could betrai well said mr weston smile you give him credit for more simpl disinterest benevol in thi instanc than i do for while miss bate wa speak a suspicion dart into my head and i have never been abl to get it out again the more i think of it the more probabl it appear in short i have made a match between mr knightlei and jane fairfax see the consequ of keep you companywhat do you sai to it mr knightlei and jane fairfax exclaim emma dear mr weston how could you think of such a thingmr knightleymr knightlei must not marryy would not have littl henri cut out from donwelloh no no henri must have donwel i cannot at all consent to mr knightlei s marri and i am sure it is not at all like i am amaz that you should think of such a thing my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it i do not want the matchi do not want to injur dear littl henrybut the idea ha been given me by circumst and if mr knightlei realli wish to marri you would not have him refrain on henri s account a boi of six year old who know noth of the matter ye i would i could not bear to have henri supplantedmr knightlei marryno i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women nai she ha alwai been a first favourit with him as you veri well know but the imprud of such a match i am not speak of it prudenc mere it probabl i see no probabl in it unless you have ani better foundat than what you mention hi goodnatur hi human as i tell you would be quit enough to account for the hors he ha a great regard for the bates you know independ of jane fairfaxand is alwai glad to shew them attent my dear mr weston do not take to matchmak you do it veri ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbeyoh no noeveri feel revolt for hi own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing imprud if you pleasebut not mad except inequ of fortun and perhap a littl dispar of ag i can see noth unsuit but mr knightlei doe not want to marri i am sure he ha not the least idea of it do not put it into hi head why should he marryh is as happi as possibl by himself with hi farm and hi sheep and hi librari and all the parish to manag and he is extrem fond of hi brother s children he ha no occas to marri either to fill up hi time or hi heart my dear emma as long as he think so it is so but if he realli love jane fairfax nonsens he doe not care about jane fairfax in the wai of love i am sure he doe not he would do ani good to her or her famili but well said mr weston laugh perhap the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respect home if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a veri shame and degrad connexion how would he bear to have miss bate belong to himto have her haunt the abbei and thank him all dai long for hi great kind in marri jane so veri kind and obligingbut he alwai had been such a veri kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentenc to her mother s old petticoat not that it wa such a veri old petticoat eitherfor still it would last a great whileand inde she must thankfulli sai that their petticoat were all veri strong for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against my conscienc and upon my word i do not think mr knightlei would be much disturb by miss bate littl thing do not irrit him she might talk on and if he want to sai ani thing himself he would onli talk louder and drown her voic but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wish it and i think he doe i have heard him speak and so must you so veri highli of jane fairfax the interest he take in herhi anxieti about her healthhi concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmli on those pointssuch an admir of her perform on the pianofort and of her voic i have heard him sai that he could listen to her for ever oh and i had almost forgotten on idea that occur to methi pianofort that ha been sent here by somebodythough we have all been so well satisfi to consid it a present from the campbel mai it not be from mr knightlei i cannot help suspect him i think he is just the person to do it even without be in love then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love but i do not think it is at all a like thing for him to do mr knightlei doe noth mysteri i have heard him lament her have no instrument repeatedli often than i should suppos such a circumst would in the common cours of thing occur to him veri well and if he had intend to give her on he would have told her so there might be scrupl of delicaci my dear emma i have a veri strong notion that it come from him i am sure he wa particularli silent when mr cole told us of it at dinner you take up an idea mr weston and run awai with it as you have mani a time reproach me with do i see no sign of attachmenti believ noth of the pianoforteand proof onli shall convinc me that mr knightlei ha ani thought of marri jane fairfax thei combat the point some time longer in the same wai emma rather gain ground over the mind of her friend for mr weston wa the most us of the two to yield till a littl bustl in the room shew them that tea wa over and the instrument in preparationand at the same moment mr cole approach to entreat miss woodhous would do them the honour of try it frank churchil of whom in the eager of her convers with mr weston she had been see noth except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax follow mr cole to add hi veri press entreati and as in everi respect it suit emma best to lead she gave a veri proper complianc she knew the limit of her own power too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she want neither tast nor spirit in the littl thing which ar gener accept and could accompani her own voic well on accompani to her song took her agreeabl by surprizea second slightli but correctli taken by frank churchil her pardon wa duli beg at the close of the song and everi thing usual follow he wa accus of have a delight voic and a perfect knowledg of music which wa properli deni and that he knew noth of the matter and had no voic at all roundli assert thei sang togeth onc more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax whose perform both vocal and instrument she never could attempt to conceal from herself wa infinit superior to her own with mix feel she seat herself at a littl distanc from the number round the instrument to listen frank churchil sang again thei had sung togeth onc or twice it appear at weymouth but the sight of mr knightlei among the most attent soon drew awai half emma s mind and she fell into a train of think on the subject of mr weston s suspicion to which the sweet sound of the unit voic gave onli momentari interrupt her object to mr knightlei s marri did not in the least subsid she could see noth but evil in it it would be a great disappoint to mr john knightlei consequ to isabella a real injuri to the childrena most mortifi chang and materi loss to them alla veri great deduct from her father s daili comfortand as to herself she could not at all endur the idea of jane fairfax at donwel abbei a mr knightlei for them all to give wai tonomr knightlei must never marri littl henri must remain the heir of donwel present mr knightlei look back and came and sat down by her thei talk at first onli of the perform hi admir wa certainli veri warm yet she thought but for mr weston it would not have struck her as a sort of touchston howev she began to speak of hi kind in convei the aunt and niec and though hi answer wa in the spirit of cut the matter short she believ it to indic onli hi disinclin to dwell on ani kind of hi own i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriag more us on such occas it is not that i am without the wish but you know how imposs my father would deem it that jame should putto for such a purpos quit out of the question quit out of the question he repli but you must often wish it i am sure and he smile with such seem pleasur at the convict that she must proce anoth step thi present from the campbel said she thi pianofort is veri kindli given ye he repli and without the smallest appar embarrass but thei would have done better had thei given her notic of it surpriz ar foolish thing the pleasur is not enhanc and the inconveni is often consider i should have expect better judgment in colonel campbel from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightlei had had no concern in give the instrument but whether he were entir free from peculiar attachmentwheth there were no actual preferenceremain a littl longer doubt toward the end of jane s second song her voic grew thick that will do said he when it wa finish think aloud you have sung quit enough for on eveningnow be quiet anoth song howev wa soon beg for on morethei would not fatigu miss fairfax on ani account and would onli ask for on more and frank churchil wa heard to sai i think you could manag thi without effort the first part is so veri trifl the strength of the song fall on the second mr knightlei grew angri that fellow said he indignantli think of noth but shew off hi own voic thi must not be and touch miss bate who at that moment pass near miss bate ar you mad to let your niec sing herself hoars in thi manner go and interfer thei have no merci on her miss bate in her real anxieti for jane could hardli stai even to be grate befor she stept forward and put an end to all farther sing here ceas the concert part of the even for miss woodhous and miss fairfax were the onli young ladi perform but soon within five minut the propos of dancingorigin nobodi exactli knew wherewa so effectu promot by mr and mr cole that everi thing wa rapidli clear awai to give proper space mr weston capit in her countryd wa seat and begin an irresist waltz and frank churchil come up with most becom gallantri to emma had secur her hand and led her up to the top while wait till the other young peopl could pair themselv off emma found time in spite of the compliment she wa receiv on her voic and her tast to look about and see what becam of mr knightlei thi would be a trial he wa no dancer in gener if he were to be veri alert in engag jane fairfax now it might augur someth there wa no immedi appear no he wa talk to mr coleh wa look on unconcern jane wa ask by somebodi els and he wa still talk to mr cole emma had no longer an alarm for henri hi interest wa yet safe and she led off the danc with genuin spirit and enjoy not more than five coupl could be muster but the rariti and the sudden of it made it veri delight and she found herself well match in a partner thei were a coupl worth look at two danc unfortun were all that could be allow it wa grow late and miss bate becam anxiou to get home on her mother s account after some attempt therefor to be permit to begin again thei were oblig to thank mr weston look sorrow and have done perhap it is as well said frank churchil as he attend emma to her carriag i must have ask miss fairfax and her languid danc would not have agre with me after your chapter ix emma did not repent her condescens in go to the cole the visit afford her mani pleasant recollect the next dai and all that she might be suppos to have lost on the side of dignifi seclus must be ampli repaid in the splendour of popular she must have delight the colesworthi peopl who deserv to be made happyand left a name behind her that would not soon die awai perfect happi even in memori is not common and there were two point on which she wa not quit easi she doubt whether she had not transgress the duti of woman by woman in betrai her suspicion of jane fairfax s feel to frank churchil it wa hardli right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escap her and hi submiss to all that she told wa a compliment to her penetr which made it difficult for her to be quit certain that she ought to have held her tongu the other circumst of regret relat also to jane fairfax and there she had no doubt she did unfeignedli and unequivoc regret the inferior of her own plai and sing she did most heartili griev over the idl of her childhoodand sat down and practis vigor an hour and a half she wa then interrupt by harriet s come in and if harriet s prais could have satisfi her she might soon have been comfort oh if i could but plai as well as you and miss fairfax don t class us togeth harriet my plai is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshin oh deari think you plai the best of the two i think you plai quit as well as she doe i am sure i had much rather hear you everi bodi last night said how well you plai those who knew ani thing about it must have felt the differ the truth is harriet that my plai is just good enough to be prais but jane fairfax s is much beyond it well i alwai shall think that you plai quit as well as she doe or that if there is ani differ nobodi would ever find it out mr cole said how much tast you had and mr frank churchil talk a great deal about your tast and that he valu tast much more than execut ah but jane fairfax ha them both harriet

would poor littl harriet so you would all mr weston you would be quit laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing prai do not let them talk of it that young man speak lower is veri thoughtless do not tell hi father but that young man is not quit the thing he ha been open the door veri often thi even and keep them open veri inconsider he doe not think of the draught i do not mean to set you

suffici for five coupl wa now endeavour to be made out quit enough for ten we were too magnific said he we allow unnecessari room ten coupl mai stand here veri well emma demur it would be a crowda sad crowd and what could be wors than danc without space to turn in veri true he grave repli it wa veri bad but still he went on measur and still he end with i think there will be veri toler room for ten coupl no no said she you ar quit unreason it would be dread to be stand so close noth can be farther from pleasur than to be danc in a crowdand a crowd in a littl room there is no deni it he repli i agre with you exactli a crowd in a littl roommiss woodhous you have the art of give pictur in a few word exquisit quit exquisitestil howev have proceed so far on is unwil to give the matter up it would be a disappoint to my fatherand altogetheri do not know thati am rather of opinion that ten coupl might stand here veri well emma perceiv that the natur of hi gallantri wa a littl selfwil and that he would rather oppos than lose the pleasur of danc with her but she took the compliment and forgav the rest had she intend ever to marri him it might have been worth while to paus and consid and try to understand the valu of hi prefer and the charact of hi temper but for all the purpos of their acquaint he wa quit amiabl enough befor the middl of the next dai he wa at hartfield and he enter the room with such an agreeabl smile as certifi the continu of the scheme it soon appear that he came to announc an improv well miss woodhous he almost immedi began your inclin for danc ha not been quit frighten awai i hope by the terror of my father s littl room i bring a new propos on the subjecta thought of my father s which wait onli your approb to be act upon mai i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first danc of thi littl project ball to be given not at randal but at the crown inn the crown ye if you and mr woodhous see no object and i trust you cannot my father hope hi friend will be so kind as to visit him there better accommod he can promis them and not a less grate welcom than at randal it is hi own idea mr weston see no object to it provid you ar satisfi thi is what we all feel oh you were perfectli right ten coupl in either of the randal room would have been insufferabledreadfuli felt how right you were the whole time but wa too anxiou for secur ani thing to like to yield is not it a good exchangey consenti hope you consent it appear to me a plan that nobodi can object to if mr and mr weston do not i think it admir and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happyit seem the onli improv that could be papa do you not think it an excel improv she wa oblig to repeat and explain it befor it wa fulli comprehend and then be quit new farther represent were necessari to make it accept no he thought it veri far from an improvementa veri bad planmuch wors than the other a room at an inn wa alwai damp and danger never properli air or fit to be inhabit if thei must danc thei had better danc at randal he had never been in the room at the crown in hi lifedid not know the peopl who kept it by sightoh noa veri bad plan thei would catch wors cold at the crown than anywher i wa go to observ sir said frank churchil that on of the great recommend of thi chang would be the veri littl danger of ani bodi s catch coldso much less danger at the crown than at randal mr perri might have reason to regret the alter but nobodi els could sir said mr woodhous rather warmli you ar veri much mistaken if you suppos mr perri to be that sort of charact mr perri is extrem concern when ani of us ar ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s hous from the veri circumst of it be larger sir we shall have no occas to open the window at allnot onc the whole even and it is that dread habit of open the window let in cold air upon heat bodi which as you well know sir doe the mischief open the windowsbut sure mr churchil nobodi would think of open the window at randal nobodi could be so imprud i never heard of such a thing danc with open windowsi am sure neither your father nor mr weston poor miss taylor that wa would suffer it ah sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometim step behind a windowcurtain and throw up a sash without it be suspect i have often known it done myself have you inde sirbless me i never could have suppos it but i live out of the world and am often astonish at what i hear howev thi doe make a differ and perhap when we come to talk it overbut these sort of thing requir a good deal of consider on cannot resolv upon them in a hurri if mr and mr weston will be so oblig as to call here on morn we mai talk it over and see what can be done but unfortun sir my time is so limit oh interrupt emma there will be plenti of time for talk everi thing over there is no hurri at all if it can be contriv to be at the crown papa it will be veri conveni for the hors thei will be so near their own stabl so thei will my dear that is a great thing not that jame ever complain but it is right to spare our hors when we can if i could be sure of the room be thoroughli airedbut is mr stoke to be trust i doubt it i do not know her even by sight i can answer for everi thing of that natur sir becaus it will be under mr weston s care mr weston undertak to direct the whole there papanow you must be satisfiedour own dear mr weston who is care itself do not you rememb what mr perri said so mani year ago when i had the measl if miss taylor undertak to wrap miss emma up you need not have ani fear sir how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ay veri true mr perri did sai so i shall never forget it poor littl emma you were veri bad with the measl that is you would have been veri bad but for perri s great attent he came four time a dai for a week he said from the first it wa a veri good sortwhich wa our great comfort but the measl ar a

want you to save yourself from greater pain perhap i mai sometim have felt that harriet would not forget what wa dueor rather what would be kind by me thi appeal to her affect did more than all the rest the idea of want gratitud and consider for miss woodhous whom she realli love extrem made her wretch for a while and when the violenc of grief wa comfort awai still remain power enough to prompt

curios could not be satisfi by a bride in a pew and it must be left for the visit in form which were then to be paid to settl whether she were veri pretti inde or onli rather pretti or not pretti at

beyond the nothingmean term of be elegantli dress and veri pleas she did not realli like her she would not be in a hurri to find fault but she suspect that there wa no eleganceeas but not eleg she wa almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there wa too much eas her person wa rather good her face not unpretti but neither featur nor air nor voic nor manner were eleg emma thought at least it would turn out so as for mr elton hi manner did not appearbut no she would not permit a hasti or a witti word from herself about hi manner it wa an awkward ceremoni at ani time to be receiv wed visit and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it the woman wa better off she might have the assist of fine cloth and the privileg of bash but the man had onli hi own good sens to depend on and when she consid how peculiarli unlucki poor mr elton wa in be in the same room at onc with the woman he had just marri the woman he had want to marri and the woman whom he had been expect to marri she must allow him to have the right to look as littl wise and to be as much affectedli and as littl realli easi as could be well miss woodhous said harriet when thei had quit the

about it some other time but it will not do now i shall onli just mention the circumst to the other in a common wai mr weston wa most comfort pleas on the occas her look and word had noth to restrain them she wa happi she knew she wa happi and knew she ought to be happi her congratul were warm and open but emma could not speak so fluentli she wa a littl occupi in weigh her own feel and try to understand the degre of her agit which she rather thought wa consider mr weston howev too eager to be veri observ too commun to want other to talk wa veri well satisfi with what she did sai and soon move awai to make the rest of hi friend happi by a partial commun of what the whole room must have overheard alreadi it wa well that he took everi bodi s joi for grant or he might not have thought either mr woodhous or mr knightlei particularli delight thei were the first entitl after mr weston and emma to be made happyfrom them he would have proceed to miss fairfax but she wa so deep in convers with john knightlei that it would have been too posit an interrupt and find himself close to mr elton and her attent disengag he necessarili began on the subject with her chapter xviii i hope i shall soon have the pleasur of introduc my son to you said mr weston mr elton veri will to suppos a particular compliment intend her by such a hope smile most gracious you have heard of a certain frank churchil i presum he continu and know him to be my son though he doe not bear my name oh ye and i shall be veri happi in hi acquaint i am sure mr elton will lose no time in call on him and we

the letter in my wai thi morn and see my son s hand presum to open itthough it wa not direct to meit wa to mr weston she is hi princip correspond i assur you i hardli ever get a letter and so you absolut open what wa direct to her oh mr westonlaugh affectedli i must protest against thata most danger preced indeedi beg you will not let your neighbour follow your exampleupon my word if thi is what i am to expect we marri women must begin to exert ourselvesoh mr weston i could not have believ it of you ay we men ar sad fellow you must take care of yourself mr eltonthi letter tell usit is a short letterwritten in a hurri mere to give us noticeit tell us that thei ar all come up to town directli on mr churchil s accountsh ha not been well the whole winter and think enscomb too cold for herso thei ar all to move southward without loss of time indeedfrom yorkshir i think enscomb is in yorkshir ye thei ar about on hundr and nineti mile from london a consider journei ye upon my word veri consider sixtyf mile farther than from mapl grove to london but what is distanc mr weston to peopl of larg fortuney would be amaz to hear how my brother mr suckl sometim fli about you will hardli believ mebut twice in on week he and mr bragg went to london and back again with four hors the evil of the distanc from enscomb said mr weston is that mr churchil as we understand ha not been abl to leav the sofa for a week togeth in frank s last letter she complain he said of be too weak to get into her conservatori without have both hi arm and hi uncl s thi you know speak a great degre of weaknessbut now she is so impati to be in town that she mean to sleep onli two night on the roadso frank write word certainli delic ladi have veri extraordinari constitut mr elton you must grant me that no inde i shall grant you noth i alwai take the part of my own sex i do inde i give you noticey will find me a formid antagonist on that point i alwai stand up for womenand i assur you if you knew how selina feel with respect to sleep at an inn you would not wonder at mr churchil s make incred exert to avoid it selina sai it is quit horror to herand i believ i have caught a littl of her niceti she alwai travel with her own sheet an excel precaut doe mr churchil do the same depend upon it mr churchil doe everi thing that ani other fine ladi ever did mr churchil will not be second to ani ladi in the land for mr elton eagerli interpos with oh mr weston do not mistak me selina is no fine ladi i assur you do not run awai with such an idea is not she then she is no rule for mr churchil who is as thorough a fine ladi as ani bodi ever beheld mr elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaim so warmli it wa by no mean her object to have it believ that her sister wa not a fine ladi perhap there wa want of spirit in the pretenc of itand she wa consid in what wai she had best retract when mr weston went on mr churchil is not much in my good grace as you mai suspectbut thi is quit between ourselv she is veri fond of frank and therefor i would not speak ill of her besid she is out of health now but that inde by her own account she ha alwai been i would not sai so to everi bodi mr elton but i have not much faith in mr churchil s ill if she is realli ill why not go to bath mr westonto bath or to clifton she ha taken it into her head that enscomb is too cold for her the fact is i suppos that she is tire of enscomb she ha now been a longer time stationari there than she ever wa befor and she begin to want chang it is a retir place a fine place but veri retir ayelik mapl grove i dare sai noth can stand more retir from the road than mapl grove such an immens plantat all round it you seem shut out from everi thingin the most complet retirementand mr churchil probabl ha not health or spirit like selina to enjoi that sort of seclus or perhap she mai not have resourc enough in herself to be qualifi for a countri life i alwai sai a woman cannot have too mani resourcesand i feel veri thank that i have so mani myself as to be quit independ of societi frank wa here in februari for a fortnight so i rememb to have heard he will find an addit to the societi of highburi when he come again that is if i mai presum to call myself an addit but perhap he mai never have heard of there be such a creatur in the world thi wa too loud a call for a compliment to be pass by and mr weston with a veri good grace immedi exclaim my dear madam nobodi but yourself could imagin such a thing possibl not heard of youi believ mr weston s letter late have been full of veri littl els than mr elton he had done hi duti and could return to hi son when frank left us continu he it wa quit uncertain when we might see him again which make thi dai s new doubli welcom it ha been complet unexpect that is i alwai had a strong persuas he would be here again soon i wa sure someth favour would turn upbut nobodi believ me he and mr weston were both dreadfulli despond how could he contriv to come and how could it be suppos that hi uncl and aunt would spare him again and so forthi alwai felt that someth would happen in our favour and so it ha you see i have observ mr elton in the cours of my life that if thing ar go untowardli on month thei ar sure to mend the next veri true mr weston perfectli true it is just what i us to sai to a certain gentleman in compani in the dai of courtship when becaus thing did not go quit right did not proce with all the rapid which suit hi feel he wa apt to be in despair and exclaim that he wa sure at thi rate it would be mai befor hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us oh the pain i have been at to dispel those gloomi idea and give him cheerful view the carriagew had disappoint about the carriageon morn i rememb he came to me quit in despair she wa stop by a slight fit of cough and mr weston instantli seiz the opportun of go on you were mention mai mai is the veri month which mr churchil is order or ha order herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombein short to spend in london so that we have the agreeabl prospect of frequent visit from frank the whole springprecis the season of the year which on should have chosen for it dai almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant alwai invit on out and never too hot for exercis when he wa here befor we made the best of it but there wa a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there alwai is in februari you know and we could not do half that we intend now will be the time thi will be complet enjoy and i do not know mr elton whether the uncertainti of our meet the sort of constant expect there will be of hi come in todai or tomorrow and at ani hour mai not be more friendli to happi than have him actual in the hous i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which give most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleas with my son but you must not expect a prodigi he is gener thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigi mr weston s partial for him is veri great and as you mai suppos most gratifi to me she think nobodi equal to him and i assur you mr weston i have veri littl doubt that my opinion will be decidedli in hi favour i have heard so much in prais of mr frank churchillat the same time it is fair to observ that i am on of those who alwai judg for themselv and ar by no mean implicitli guid by other i give you notic that as i find your son so i shall judg of himi am no flatter mr weston wa muse i hope said he present i have not been sever upon poor mr churchil if she is ill i should be sorri to do her injustic but there ar some trait in her charact which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbear i could wish you cannot be ignor mr elton of my connexion with the famili nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselv the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she wa the instig frank s mother would never have been slight as she wa but for her mr churchil ha pride but hi pride is noth to hi wife s hi is a quiet indol gentlemanlik sort of pride that would harm nobodi and onli make himself a littl helpless and tiresom but her pride is arrog and insol and what inclin on less to bear she ha no fair pretenc of famili or blood she wa nobodi when he marri her bare the daughter of a gentleman but ever sinc her be turn into a churchil she ha outchurchil d them all in high and mighti claim but in herself i assur you she is an upstart onli think well that must be infinit provok i have quit a horror of upstart mapl grove ha given me a thorough disgust to peopl of that sort for there is a famili in that neighbourhood who ar such an annoy to my brother and sister from the air thei give themselv your descript of mr churchil made me think of them directli peopl of the name of tupman veri late settl there and encumb with mani low connexion but give themselv immens air and expect to be on a foot with the old establish famili a year and a half is the veri utmost that thei can have live at west hall and how thei got their fortun nobodi know thei came from birmingham which is not a place to promis much you know mr weston on ha not great hope from birmingham i alwai sai there is someth dire in the sound but noth more is posit known of the tupman though a good mani thing i assur you ar suspect and yet by their manner thei evid think themselv equal even to my brother mr suckl who happen to be on of their nearest neighbour it is infinit too bad mr suckl who ha been eleven year a resid at mapl grove and whose father had it befor himi believ at leasti am almost sure that old mr suckl had complet the purchas befor hi death thei were interrupt tea wa carri round and mr weston have said all that he want soon took the opportun of walk awai after tea mr and mr weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhous to card the remain five were left to their own power and emma doubt their get on veri well for mr knightlei seem littl dispos for convers mr elton wa want notic which nobodi had inclin to pai and she wa herself in a worri of spirit which would have made her prefer be silent mr john knightlei prove more talk than hi brother he wa to leav them earli the next dai and he soon began with well emma i do not believ i have ani thing more to sai about the boi but you have your sister s letter and everi thing is down at full length there we mai be sure my charg would be much more concis than her s and probabl not much in the same spirit all that i have to recommend be compris in do not spoil them and do not physic them i rather hope to satisfi you both said emma for i shall do all in my power to make them happi which will be enough for isabella and happi must preclud fals indulg and physic and if you find them troublesom you must send them home again that is veri like you think so do not you i hope i am awar that thei mai be too noisi for your fatheror even mai be some encumbr to you if your visit engag continu to increas as much as thei have done

here delight you too much to pass unnot but you turn to mr knightlei who know how veri veri seldom i am ever two hour from hartfield why you should forese such a seri of dissip for me i cannot imagin and as to my dear littl boi i must sai that if aunt emma ha not time for them i do not think thei would fare much better with uncl knightlei who is absent from home about five hour where she is absent oneand who when he is at home is either read to himself or settl hi account mr knightlei seem to be try not to smile and succeed without difficulti upon mr elton s begin to talk to him volum iii chapter i a veri littl quiet reflect wa enough to satisfi emma as to the natur of her agit on hear thi new of frank churchil she wa soon convinc that it wa not for herself she wa feel at all apprehens or embarrass it wa for him her own attach had realli subsid into a mere noth it wa not worth think ofbut if he who had undoubtedli been alwai so much the most in love of the two were to be return with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken awai it would be veri distress if a separ of two month should not have cool him there were danger and evil befor hercaut for him and for herself would be necessari she did not mean to have her own affect entangl again and it would be incumb on her to avoid ani encourag of hi she wish she might be abl to keep him from an absolut declar that would be so veri pain a conclus of their present acquaint and yet she could not help rather anticip someth decis she felt as if the spring would not pass without bring a crisi an event a someth to alter her present compos and tranquil state it wa not veri long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen befor she had the power of form some opinion of frank churchil s feel the enscomb famili were not in town quit so soon as had been imagin but he wa at highburi veri soon afterward he rode down for a coupl of hour he could not yet do more but as he came from randal immedi to hartfield she could

when should i ever have thought of put by in cotton a piec of courtplaist that frank churchil had been pull about i never wa equal to thi here resum harriet turn to her box again here is someth still more valuabl i mean that ha been more valuabl becaus thi is what did realli onc belong to him which the courtplaist never did emma wa quit eager to see thi superior treasur it wa the end of an old pencilth part without ani lead thi wa realli hi said harriet do not you rememb on morningno i dare sai you do not but on morningi forget exactli the daybut perhap it wa the tuesdai or wednesdai befor that even he want to make a memorandum in hi pocketbook it wa about spruceb mr knightlei had been tell him someth about brew spruceb and he want to put it down but when he took out hi pencil there wa so littl lead that he soon cut it all awai and it would not do so you lent him anoth and thi wa left upon the tabl as good for noth but i kept my ey on it and as soon as i dare caught it up and never part with it again from that moment i do rememb it cri emma i perfectli rememb ittalk about sprucebeeroh yesmr knightlei and i both sai we like it and mr elton s seem resolv to learn to like it too i perfectli rememb itstop mr knightlei wa stand just here wa not he i have an idea he wa stand just here ah i do not know i cannot recollectit is veri odd but i cannot recollectmr elton wa sit here i

when thought emma will there be a begin of mr churchil she had soon afterward reason to believ that the begin wa alreadi made and could not but hope that the gipsi though she had told no fortun might be prove to have made harriet sabout a fortnight after the alarm thei came to a suffici explan and quit undesignedli emma wa not think of it at the moment which made the inform she receiv more valuabl she mere said in the cours of some trivial chat well harriet whenev you marri i would advis you to do so and so and thought no more of it till after a minut s silenc she heard harriet sai in a veri

superior to mr elton she then took a longer time for consider should she proce no farthershould she let it pass and seem to suspect nothingperhap harriet might think her cold or angri if she did or perhap if she were total silent it might onli drive harriet into ask her to hear too much and against ani thing like such an unreserv as had been such an open and frequent discuss of hope and chanc she wa perfectli resolvedsh believ it would be wiser for her to sai and know at onc all that she meant to sai and know plain deal wa alwai best she had previous determin how far she would proce on ani

he could not understand it but there were symptom of intellig between themh thought so at leastsymptom of admir on hi side which have onc observ he could not persuad himself to think entir void of

affair wa to be complet a secret mr churchil had made a point of it as a token of respect to the wife he had so veri recent lost and everi bodi admit it to be no more than due decorum emma had promis but still harriet must be except it wa her superior duti in spite of her vexat she could not help feel it almost ridicul that she should have the veri same distress and delic offic to perform by

who would ever look at him in the compani of the other i hope i have a better tast than to think of mr frank churchil who is like nobodi by hi side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazingi am sure but for believ that you entir approv and meant to encourag me in my attach i should have consid it at first too great a presumpt almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not

and she sat silent medit in a fix attitud for a few minut a few minut were suffici for make her acquaint with her own heart a mind like her onc open to suspicion made rapid progress she touchedsh admittedsh acknowledg the whole truth why wa it so much wors that harriet should be in love with mr knightlei than with frank churchil why wa the evil so dreadfulli increas by harriet s have some hope of a return it dart through her with the speed of an arrow that mr knightlei must marri no on but herself her own conduct as well as her own heart wa befor her in the same few minut she saw it all with a clear which had never bless her befor how improperli had she been act by harriet how inconsider how indel how irrat how unfeel had been her conduct what blind what mad had led her on it struck

two decis dancesemma knew that he had on that occas found her much superior to hi expect from that even or at least from the time of miss woodhous s encourag her to think of him harriet had begun to be sensibl of hi talk to her much more than he had been us to do and of hi have inde quit a differ manner toward her a manner of kind and sweetnesslatterli she had been more and more awar of it when thei had been all walk togeth he had so often come and walk by her and talk so veri delightfullyh seem to want to be acquaint with her emma knew it to have been veri much the case she had often observ the chang to almost the same extentharriet repeat express of approb and prais from himand emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of hi opinion of harriet he prais her for be without art or affect for have simpl honest gener feelingssh knew that he saw such recommend in harriet he had dwelt on them to her more than oncemuch that live in harriet s memori mani littl

half an hour s relat and contain multipli proof to her who had seen them had pass undiscern by her who now heard them but the two latest occurr to be mention the two of strongest promis to harriet were not without some degre of wit from emma herselfth first wa hi walk with her apart from the other in the limewalk at donwel where thei had been walk some time befor emma came and he had taken pain as she wa convinc to draw her from the rest to himselfand at first he had talk to her in a more particular wai than he had ever done befor in a veri particular wai indeedharriet could not recal it without a blush he seem to be almost ask her whether her affect were engagedbut as soon as she miss woodhous appear like to join them he chang the subject and began talk about farmingth second wa hi have sat talk with her nearli half an hour befor emma came back from her visit the veri last morn of hi be at hartfieldthough when he first came in he had said that he could not stai five minutesand hi have told her dure their convers that though he must go to london it wa veri much against hi inclin that he left home at all which wa much more as emma felt than he had acknowledg to her the superior degre of confid toward harriet which thi on articl mark gave her sever pain on the subject of the first of the two circumst she did after a littl reflect ventur the follow question might he noti not it possibl that when enquir as you thought into the state of your affect he might be allud to mr martinh might have mr martin s interest in view but harriet reject the suspicion with spirit mr martin no indeedther wa not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspect of it when harriet had close her evid she appeal to her dear miss woodhous to sai whether she had not good ground for hope i never should have presum to think of it at first said she but for you you told me to observ him carefulli and let hi behaviour be the rule of mineand so i have but now i seem to feel that i mai deserv him and that if he doe chuse me it will not be ani thing so veri wonder the bitter feel occas by thi speech the mani bitter feel made the utmost exert necessari on emma s side to enabl her to sai on repli harriet i will onli ventur to declar that mr knightlei is the last man in the world who would intention give ani woman the idea of hi feel for her more than he realli doe harriet seem readi to worship her friend for a sentenc so satisfactori and emma wa onli save from raptur and fond which at that moment would have been dread penanc by the sound of her father s footstep he wa come through the hall harriet wa too much agit to encount him she could not compos herself mr woodhous would be alarmedsh had better go with most readi encourag from her
