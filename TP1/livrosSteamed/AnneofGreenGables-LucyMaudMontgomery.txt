ann of green gabl chapter i mr rachel lynd is surpris mr rachel lynd live just where the avonlea main road dip down into a littl hollow fring with alder and ladi eardrop and travers by a brook that had it sourc awai back in the wood of the old cuthbert place it wa reput to be an intric headlong brook in it earlier cours through those wood with dark secret of pool and cascad but by the time it reach lynd s hollow it wa a quiet wellconduct littl stream for not even a brook could run past mr rachel lynd s door without due regard for decenc and decorum it probabl wa consciou that mr rachel wa sit at her window keep a sharp ey on everyth that pass from brook and children up and that if she notic anyth odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferret out the why and wherefor thereof there ar plenti of peopl in avonlea and out of it who can attend close to their neighbor s busi by dint of neglect their own but mr rachel lynd wa on of those capabl creatur who can manag their own concern and those of other folk into the bargain she wa a notabl housewif her work wa alwai done and well done she ran the sew circl help run the sundayschool and wa the strongest prop of the church aid societi and foreign mission auxiliari yet with all thi mr rachel found abund time to sit for hour at her kitchen window knit cotton warp quiltssh had knit sixteen of them as avonlea housekeep were wont to tell in aw voicesand keep a sharp ey on the main road that cross the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond sinc avonlea occupi a littl triangular peninsula jut out into the gulf of st lawrenc with water on two side of it anybodi who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of mr rachel s allse ey she wa sit there on afternoon in earli june the sun wa come in at the window warm and bright the orchard on the slope below the hous wa in a bridal flush of pinkywhit bloom hum over by a myriad of bee thoma lyndea meek littl man whom avonlea peopl call rachel lynd s husband wa sow hi late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn and matthew cuthbert ought to have been sow hi on the big red brook field awai over by green gabl mr rachel knew that he ought becaus she had heard him tell peter morrison the even befor in william j blair s store over at carmodi that he meant to sow hi turnip seed the next afternoon peter had ask him of cours for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunt inform about anyth in hi whole life and yet here wa matthew cuthbert at halfpast three on the afternoon of a busi dai placidli drive over the hollow and up the hill moreov he wore a white collar and hi best suit of cloth which wa plain proof that he wa go out of avonlea and he had the buggi and the sorrel mare which betoken that he wa go a consider distanc now where wa matthew cuthbert go and why wa he go there had it been ani other man in avonlea mr rachel deftli put thi and that togeth might have given a pretti good guess as to both question but matthew so rare went from home that it must be someth press and unusu which wa take him he wa the shyest man aliv and hate to have to go among stranger or to ani place where he might have to talk matthew dress up with a white collar and drive in a buggi wa someth that didn t happen often mr rachel ponder as she might could make noth of it and her afternoon s enjoy wa spoil i ll just step over to green gabl after tea and find out from marilla where he s gone and why the worthi woman final conclud he doesn t gener go to town thi time of year and he never visit if he d run out of turnip seed he wouldn t dress up and take the buggi to go for more he wasn t drive fast enough to be go for a doctor yet someth must have happen sinc last night to start him off i m clean puzzl that s what and i won t know a minut s peac of mind or conscienc until i know what ha taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea todai accordingli after tea mr rachel set out she had not far to go the big rambl orchardembow hous where the cuthbert live wa a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynd s hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert s father as shy and silent as hi son after him had got as far awai as he possibl could from hi fellow men without actual retreat into the wood when he found hi homestead green gabl wa built at the furthest edg of hi clear land and there it wa to thi dai bare visibl from the main road along which all the other avonlea hous were so sociabl situat mr rachel lynd did not call live in such a place live at all it s just stai that s what she said as she step along the deeprut grassi lane border with wild rose bush it s no wonder matthew and marilla ar both a littl odd live awai back here by themselv tree aren t much compani though dear know if thei were there d be enough of them i d ruther look at peopl to be sure thei seem content enough but then i suppos thei re us to it a bodi can get us to anyth even to be hang as the irishman said with thi mr rachel step out of the lane into the backyard of green gabl veri green and neat and precis wa that yard set about on on side with great patriarch willow and the other with prim lombardi not a strai stick nor stone wa to be seen for mr rachel would have seen it if there had been privat she wa of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her hous on could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrim the proverbi peck of dirt mr rachel rap smartli at the kitchen door and step in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gabl wa a cheer apartmentor would have been cheer if it had not been so painfulli clean as to give it someth of the appear of an unus parlor it window look east and west through the west on look out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east on whenc you got a glimps of the bloom white cherrytre in the left orchard and nod slender birch down in the hollow by the brook wa green over by a tangl of vine here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all alwai slightli distrust of sunshin which seem to her too danc and irrespons a thing for a world which wa meant to be taken serious and here she sat now knit and the tabl behind her wa laid for supper mr rachel befor she had fairli close the door had taken a mental note of everyth that wa on that tabl there were three plate laid so that marilla must be expect some on home with matthew to tea but the dish were everydai dish and there wa onli crabappl preserv and on kind of cake so that the expect compani could not be ani particular compani yet what of matthew s white collar and the sorrel mare mr rachel wa get fairli dizzi with thi unusu mysteri about quiet unmysteri green gabl good even rachel marilla said briskli thi is a real fine even isn t it won t you sit down how ar all your folk someth that for lack of ani other name might be call friendship exist and alwai had exist between marilla cuthbert and mr rachel in spite ofor perhap becaus oftheir dissimilar marilla wa a tall thin woman with angl and without curv her dark hair show some grai streak and wa alwai twist up in a hard littl knot behind with two wire hairpin stuck aggress through it she look like a woman of narrow experi and rigid conscienc which she wa but there wa a save someth about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightli develop might have been consid indic of a sens of humor we re all pretti well said mr rachel i wa kind of afraid you weren t though when i saw matthew start off todai i thought mayb he wa go to the doctor s marilla s lip twitch understandingli she had expect mr rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunt off so unaccount would be too much for her neighbor s curios oh no i m quit well although i had a bad headach yesterdai she said matthew went to bright river we re get a littl boi from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he s come on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia mr rachel could not have been more astonish she wa actual stricken dumb for five second it wa unsuppos that marilla wa make fun of her but mr rachel wa almost forc to suppos it ar you in earnest marilla she demand when voic return to her ye of cours said marilla as if get boi from orphan asylum in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on ani wellregul avonlea farm instead of be an unheard of innov mr rachel felt that she had receiv a sever mental jolt she thought in exclam point a boi marilla and matthew cuthbert of all peopl adopt a boi from an orphan asylum well the world wa certainli turn upsid down she would be surpris at noth after thi noth what on earth put such a notion into your head she demand disapprovingli thi had been done without her advic be ask and must perforc be disapprov well we ve been think about it for some timeal winter in fact return marilla mr alexand spencer wa up here on dai befor christma and she said she wa go to get a littl girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring her cousin live there and mr spencer ha visit here and know all about it so matthew and i have talk it over off and on ever sinc we thought we d get a boi matthew is get up in year you knowh s sixtyand he isn t so spry as he onc wa hi heart troubl him a good deal and you know how desper hard it s got to be to get hire help there s never anybodi to be had but those stupid halfgrown littl french boi and as soon as you do get on broke into your wai and taught someth he s up and off to the lobster canneri or the state at first matthew suggest get a home boi but i said no flat to that thei mai be all righti m not sai thei re notbut no london street arab for me i said give me a nativ born at least there ll be a risk no matter who we get but i ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at night if we get a born canadian so in the end we decid to ask mr spencer to pick us out on when she went over to get her littl girl we heard last week she wa go so we sent her word by richard spencer s folk at carmodi to bring us a smart like boi of about ten or eleven we decid that would be the best ageold enough to be of some us in do chore right off and young enough to be train up proper we mean to give him a good home and school we had a telegram from mr alexand spencer todayth mailman brought it from the stationsai thei were come on the fivethirti train tonight so matthew went to bright river to meet him mr spencer will drop him off there of cours she goe on to white sand station herself mr rachel pride herself on alwai speak her mind she proceed to speak it now have adjust her mental attitud to thi amaz piec of new well marilla i ll just tell you plain that i think you re do a mighti foolish thinga riski thing that s what you don t know what you re get you re bring a strang child into your hous and home and you don t know a singl thing about him nor what hi disposit is like nor what sort of parent he had nor how he s like to turn out why it wa onli last week i read in the paper how a man and hi wife up west of the island took a boi out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the hous at nightset it on purpos marillaand nearli burnt them to a crisp in their bed and i know anoth case where an adopt boi us to suck the eggsthei couldn t break him of it if you had ask my advic in the matterwhich you didn t do marillai d have said for merci s sake not to think of such a thing that s what thi job s comfort seem neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knit steadili on i don t deni there s someth in what you sai rachel i ve had some qualm myself but matthew wa terribl set on it i could see that so i gave in it s so seldom matthew set hi mind on anyth that when he doe i alwai feel it s my duti to give in and as for the risk there s risk in pretti near everyth a bodi doe in thi world there s risk in peopl s have children of their own if it come to thatthei don t alwai turn out well and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn t as if we were get him from england or the state he can t be much differ from ourselv well i hope it will turn out all right said mr rachel in a tone that plainli indic her pain doubt onli don t sai i didn t warn you if he burn green gabl down or put strychnin in the welli heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole famili di in fear agoni onli it wa a girl in that instanc well we re not get a girl said marilla as if poison well were a pure feminin accomplish and not to be dread in the case of a boi i d never dream of take a girl to bring up i wonder at mr alexand spencer for do it but there she wouldn t shrink from adopt a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head mr rachel would have like to stai until matthew came home with hi import orphan but reflect that it would be a good two hour at least befor hi arriv she conclud to go up the road to robert bell s and tell the new it would certainli make a sensat second to none and mr rachel dearli love to make a sensat so she took herself awai somewhat to marilla s relief for the latter felt her doubt and fear reviv under the influenc of mr rachel s pessim well of all thing that ever were or will be ejacul mr rachel when she wa safe out in the lane it doe realli seem as if i must be dream well i m sorri for that poor young on and no mistak matthew and marilla don t know anyth about children and thei ll expect him to be wiser and steadier that hi own grandfath if so be s he ever had a grandfath which is doubt it seem uncanni to think of a child at green gabl somehow there s never been on there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new hous wa builtif thei ever were children which is hard to believ when on look at them i wouldn t be in that orphan s shoe for anyth my but i piti him that s what so said mr rachel to the wild rose bush out of the ful of her heart but if she could have seen the child who wa wait patient at the bright river station at that veri moment her piti would have been still deeper and more profound chapter ii matthew cuthbert is surpris matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jog comfort over the eight mile to bright river it wa a pretti road run along between snug farmstead with now and again a bit of balsami fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plum hung out their filmi bloom the air wa sweet with the breath of mani appl orchard and the meadow slope awai in the distanc to horizon mist of pearl and purpl while the littl bird sang as if it were the on dai of summer in all the year matthew enjoi the drive after hi own fashion except dure the moment when he met women and had to nod to themfor in princ edward island you ar suppos to nod to all and sundri you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dread all women except marilla and mr rachel he had an uncomfort feel that the mysteri creatur were secretli laugh at him he mai have been quit right in think so for he wa an oddlook personag with an ungainli figur and long irongrai hair that touch hi stoop shoulder and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever sinc he wa twenti in fact he had look at twenti veri much as he look at sixti lack a littl of the gray when he reach bright river there wa no sign of ani train he thought he wa too earli so he ti hi hors in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station hous the long platform wa almost desert the onli live creatur in sight be a girl who wa sit on a pile of shingl at the extrem end matthew bare note that it wa a girl sidl past her as quickli as possibl without look at her had he look he could hardli have fail to notic the tens rigid and expect of her attitud and express she wa sit there wait for someth or somebodi and sinc sit and wait wa the onli thing to do just then she sat and wait with all her might and main matthew encount the stationmast lock up the ticket offic preparatori to go home for supper and ask him if the fivethirti train would soon be along the fivethirti train ha been in and gone half an hour ago answer that brisk offici but there wa a passeng drop off for youa littl girl she s sit out there on the shingl i ask her to go into the ladi wait room but she inform me grave that she prefer to stai outsid there wa more scope for imagin she said she s a case i should sai i m not expect a girl said matthew blankli it s a boi i ve come for he should be here mr alexand spencer wa to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmast whistl guess there s some mistak he said mr spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charg said you and your sister were adopt her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her present that s all i know about itand i haven t got ani more orphan conceal hereabout i don t understand said matthew helplessli wish that marilla wa at hand to cope with the situat well you d better question the girl said the stationmast carelessli i dare sai she ll be abl to explainsh s got a tongu of her own that s certain mayb thei were out of boi of the brand you want he walk jauntili awai be hungri and the unfortun matthew wa left to do that which wa harder for him than beard a lion in it denwalk up to a girla strang girlan orphan girland demand of her why she wasn t a boi matthew groan in spirit as he turn about and shuffl gentli down the platform toward her she had been watch him ever sinc he had pass her and she had her ey on him now matthew wa not look at her and would not have seen what she wa realli like if he had been but an ordinari observ would have seen thi a child of about eleven garb in a veri short veri tight veri ugli dress of yellowishgrai wincei she wore a fade brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extend down her back were two braid of veri thick decidedli red hair her face wa small white and thin also much freckl her mouth wa larg and so were her ey which look green in some light and mood and grai in other so far the ordinari observ an extraordinari observ might have seen that the chin wa veri point and pronounc that the big ey were full of spirit and vivac that the mouth wa sweetlip and express that the forehead wa broad and full in short our discern extraordinari observ might have conclud that no commonplac soul inhabit the bodi of thi strai womanchild of whom shy matthew cuthbert wa so ludicr afraid matthew howev wa spare the ordeal of speak first for as soon as she conclud that he wa come to her she stood up grasp with on thin brown hand the handl of a shabbi oldfashion carpetbag the other she held out to him i suppos you ar mr matthew cuthbert of green gabl she said in a peculiarli clear sweet voic i m veri glad to see you i wa begin to be afraid you weren t come for me and i wa imagin all the thing that might have happen to prevent you i had made up my mind that if you didn t come for me tonight i d go down the track to that big wild cherrytre at the bend and climb up into it to stai all night i wouldn t be a bit afraid and it would be love to sleep in a wild cherrytre all white with bloom in the moonshin don t you think you could imagin you were dwell in marbl hall couldn t you and i wa quit sure you would come for me in the morn if you didn t tonight matthew had taken the scrawni littl hand awkwardli in hi then and there he decid what to do he could not tell thi child with the glow ey that there had been a mistak he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldn t be left at bright river anyhow no matter what mistak had been made so all question and explan might as well be defer until he wa safe back at green gabl i m sorri i wa late he said shyli come along the hors is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carri it the child respond cheerfulli it isn t heavi i ve got all my worldli good in it but it isn t heavi and if it isn t carri in just a

cherrytre we ve got to drive a long piec haven t we mr spencer said it wa eight mile i m glad becaus i love drive oh it seem so wonder that i m go to live with you and belong to you i ve never belong to anybodynot realli but the asylum wa the worst i ve onli been in it four month but that wa enough i don t suppos you ever were an orphan in an asylum so you can t possibl understand what it is like it s wors than anyth you could imagin mr spencer said it wa wick of me to talk like that but i didn t mean to be wick it s so easi to be wick without know it isn t it thei were good you knowth asylum peopl but there is so littl scope for the imagin in an asylumonli just in the other orphan it wa pretti interest to imagin thing about themto imagin that perhap the girl who sat next to you wa realli the daughter of a belt earl who had been stolen awai from her parent in her infanc by a cruel nurs who di befor she could confess i us to lie awak at night and imagin thing like that becaus i didn t have time in the dai i guess that s why i m so thini am dread thin ain t i there isn t a pick on my bone i do love to imagin i m nice and plump with dimpl in my elbow with thi matthew s companion stop talk partli becaus she wa out of breath and partli becaus thei had reach the buggi not anoth word did she sai until thei had left the villag and were drive down a steep littl hill the road part of which had been cut so deepli into the soft soil that the bank fring with bloom wild cherrytre and slim white birch were sever feet abov their head the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brush against the side of the buggi isn t that beauti what did that tree lean out from the bank all white and laci make you think of she ask well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of coursea bride all in white with a love misti veil i ve never seen on but i can imagin what she would look like i don t ever expect to be a bride myself i m so home nobodi will ever want to marri meunless it might be a foreign missionari i suppos a foreign missionari mightn t be veri particular but i do hope that some dai i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthli bliss i just love pretti cloth and i ve never had a pretti dress in my life that i can rememberbut of cours it s all the more to look forward to isn t it and then i can imagin that i m dress gorgeous thi morn when i left the asylum i felt so asham becaus i had to wear thi horrid old wincei dress all the orphan had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donat three hundr yard of wincei to the asylum some peopl said it wa becaus he couldn t sell it but i d rather believ that it wa out of the kind of hi heart wouldn t you when we got on the train i felt as if everybodi must be look at me and piti me but i just went to work and imagin that i had on the most beauti pale blue silk dressbecaus when you ar imagin you might as well imagin someth worth whileand a big hat all flower and nod plume and a gold watch and kid glove and boot i felt cheer up right awai and i enjoi my trip to the island with all my might i wasn t a bit sick come over in the boat neither wa mr spencer although she gener is she said she hadn t time to get sick watch to see that i didn t fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowl about but if it kept her from be seasick it s a merci i did prowl isn t it and i want to see everyth that wa to be seen on that boat becaus i didn t know whether i d ever have anoth opportun oh there ar a lot more cherrytre all in bloom thi island is the bloomiest place i just love it alreadi and i m so glad i m go to live here i ve alwai heard that princ edward island wa the prettiest place in the world and i us to imagin i wa live here but i never realli expect i would it s delight when your imagin come true isn t it but those red road ar so funni when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red road began to flash past i ask mr spencer what made them red and she said she didn t know and for piti s sake not to ask her ani more question she said i must have ask her a thousand alreadi i suppos i had too but how you go to find out about thing if you don t ask question and what doe make the road red well now i dunno said matthew well that is on of the thing to find out sometim isn t it splendid to think of all the thing there ar to find out about it just make me feel glad to be aliveit s such an interest world it wouldn t be half so interest if we know all about everyth would it there d be no scope for imagin then would there but am i talk too much peopl ar alwai tell me i do would you rather i didn t talk if you sai so i ll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it s difficult matthew much to hi own surpris wa enjoi himself like most quiet folk he like talk peopl when thei were will to do the talk themselv and did not expect him to keep up hi end of it but he had never expect to enjoi the societi of a littl girl women were bad enough in all conscienc but littl girl were wors he detest the wai thei had of sidl past him timidli with sidewis glanc as if thei expect him to gobbl them up at a mouth if thei ventur to sai a word that wa the avonlea type of wellbr littl girl but thi freckl witch wa veri differ and although he found it rather difficult for hi slower intellig to keep up with her brisk mental process he thought that he kind of like her chatter so he said as shyli as usual oh you can talk as much as you like i don t mind oh i m so glad i know you and i ar go to get along togeth fine it s such a relief to talk when on want to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard i ve had that said to me a million time if i have onc and peopl laugh at me becaus i us big word but if you have big idea you have to us big word to express them haven t you well now that seem reason said matthew mr spencer said that my tongu must be hung in the middl but it isn tit s firmli fasten at on end mr spencer said your place wa name green gabl i ask her all about it and she said there were tree all around it i wa gladder than ever i just love tree and there weren t ani at all about the asylum onli a few poor weenyteeni thing out in front with littl whitewash cagei thing about them thei just look like orphan themselv those tree did it us to make me want to cry to look at them i us to sai to them oh you poor littl thing if you were out in a great big wood with other tree all around you and littl moss and june bell grow over your root and a brook not far awai and bird sing in you branch you could grow couldn t you but you can t where you ar i know just exactli how you feel littl tree i felt sorri to leav them behind thi morn you do get so attach to thing like that don t you is there a brook anywher near green gabl i forgot to ask mr spencer that well now ye there s on right below the hous fanci it s alwai been on of my dream to live near a brook i never expect i would though dream don t often come true do thei wouldn t it be nice if thei did but just now i feel pretti nearli perfectli happi i can t feel exactli perfectli happi becausewel what color would you call thi she twitch on of her long glossi braid over her thin shoulder and held it up befor matthew s ey matthew wa not us to decid on the tint of ladi tress but in thi case there couldn t be much doubt it s red ain t it he said the girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seem to come from her veri toe and to exhal forth all the sorrow of the ag ye it s red she said resignedli now you see why i can t be perfectli happi nobodi could who ha red hair i don t mind the other thing so muchth freckl and the green ey and my skinni i can imagin them awai i can imagin that i have a beauti roseleaf complexion and love starri violet ey but i cannot imagin that red hair awai i do my best i think to myself now my hair is a gloriou black black as the raven s wing but all the time i know it is just plain red and it break my heart it will be my lifelong sorrow i read of a girl onc in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn t red hair her hair wa pure gold rippl back from her alabast brow what is an alabast brow i never could find out can you tell me well now i m afraid i can t said matthew who wa get a littl dizzi he felt as he had onc felt in hi rash youth when anoth boi had entic him on the merrygoround at a picnic well whatev it wa it must have been someth nice becaus she wa divin beauti have you ever imagin what it must feel like to be divin beauti well now no i haven t confess matthew ingenu i have often which would you rather be if you had the choicedivin beauti or dazzlingli clever or angel good well now ii don t know exactli neither do i i can never decid but it doesn t make much real differ for it isn t like i ll ever be either it s certain i ll never be angel good mr spencer saysoh mr cuthbert oh mr cuthbert oh mr cuthbert that wa not what mr spencer had said neither had the child tumbl out of the buggi nor had matthew done anyth astonish thei had simpli round a curv in the road and found themselv in the avenu the avenu so call by the newbridg peopl wa a stretch of road four or five hundr yard long complet arch over with huge widespread appletre plant year ago by an eccentr old farmer overhead wa on long canopi of snowi fragrant bloom below the bough the air wa full of a purpl twilight and far ahead a glimps of paint sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedr aisl it beauti seem to strike the child dumb she lean back in the buggi her thin hand clasp befor her her face lift raptur to the white splendor abov even when thei had pass out and were drive down the long slope to newbridg she never move or spoke still with rapt face she gaze afar into the sunset west with ey that saw vision troop splendidli across that glow background through newbridg a bustl littl villag where dog bark at them and small boi hoot and curiou face peer from the window thei drove still in silenc when three more mile had drop awai behind them the child had not spoken she could keep silenc it wa evid as energet as she could talk i

pleasant ach did you ever have an ach like that mr cuthbert well now i just can t recollect that i ever had i have it lot of timewhenev i see anyth royal beauti but thei shouldn t call that love place the avenu there is no mean in a name like that thei should call itlet me seeth white wai of delight isn t that a nice imagin name when i don t like the name of a place or a person i alwai imagin a new on and alwai think of them so there wa a girl at the asylum whose name wa hepzibah jenkin but i alwai imagin her as rosalia dever other peopl mai call that place the avenu but i shall alwai call it the white wai of delight have we realli onli anoth mile to go befor we get home i m glad and i m sorri i m sorri becaus thi drive ha been so pleasant and i m alwai sorri when pleasant thing end someth still pleasant mai come after but you can never be sure and it s so often the case that it isn t pleasant that ha been my experi anyhow but i m glad to think of get home you see i ve never had a real home sinc i can rememb it give me that pleasant ach again just to think of come to a realli truli home oh isn t that pretti thei had driven over the crest of a hill below them wa a pond look almost like a river so long and wind wa it a bridg span it midwai and from there to it lower end where an amberhu belt of sandhil shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond the water wa a glori of mani shift huesth most spiritu shade of crocu and rose and ether green with other elus tint for which no name ha ever been found abov the bridg the pond ran up into fring grove of fir and mapl and lai all darkli transluc in their waver shadow here and there a wild plum lean out from the bank like a whiteclad girl tipto to her own reflect from the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear mournfullysweet choru of the frog there wa a littl grai hous peer around a white appl orchard on a slope beyond and although it wa not yet quit dark a light wa shine from on of it window that s barri s pond said matthew oh i don t like that name either i shall call itlet me seeth lake of shine water ye that is the right name for it i know becaus of the thrill when i hit on a name that suit exactli it give me a thrill do thing ever give you a thrill matthew rumin well now ye it alwai kind of give me a thrill to see them ugli white grub that spade up in the cucumb bed i hate the look of them oh i don t think that can be exactli the same kind of a thrill do you think it can there doesn t seem to be much connect between grub and lake of shine water doe there but why do other peopl call it barri s pond i reckon becaus mr barri live up there in that hous orchard slope s the name of hi place if it wasn t for that big bush behind it you could see green gabl from here but we have to go over the bridg and round by the road so it s near half a mile further ha mr barri ani littl girl well not so veri littl eitherabout my size he s got on about eleven her name is diana oh with a long indraw of breath what a perfectli love name well now i dunno there s someth dread heathenish about it seem to me i d ruther jane or mari or some sensibl name like that but when diana wa born there wa a schoolmast board there and thei gave him the name of her and he call her diana i wish there had been a schoolmast like that around when i wa born then oh here we ar at the bridg i m go to shut my ey tight i m

like in thi world there we re over now i ll look back good night dear lake of shine water i alwai sai good night to the thing i love just as i would to peopl i think thei like it that water look as if

that if she deni the appeal of that look it would haunt her to her dy dai moreov she did not fanci mr blewett to hand a sensit highstrung child over to such a woman no she could not take the respons of do that well i don t know she said slowli i didn t sai that matthew and i had absolut decid that we wouldn t keep her in fact i mai sai that matthew is dispos to keep her i just came over to find

when mr spencer and mr blewett went out in quest of a recip the latter had come to borrow she sprang up and flew across the room to marilla oh miss cuthbert did you realli sai that perhap you would let me stai at green gabl she said in a breathless whisper as if speak aloud might shatter the gloriou possibl did you realli sai it or did i onli imagin that you did i think you d better learn to

marilla smother a smile under the convict that ann must be reprov for such a speech a littl girl like you should be asham of talk so about a ladi and a stranger she said sever go back and sit down quietli and hold your tongu and behav as a good girl should i ll try to do and be anyth you want me if you ll onli keep me said ann return meekli to her ottoman when thei arriv back at green gabl that even matthew met them in the lane marilla from afar had note him prowl along it and guess hi motiv she wa prepar for the relief she read in hi face when he saw that she had at least brought back ann back with her but she said noth to him rel to the affair until thei were both out in the yard behind the barn milk the cow then she briefli told him ann s histori and the result of the interview with mr spencer i wouldn t give a dog i like to that blewett woman said matthew with unusu vim i don t fanci her style myself admit marilla but it s that or keep her ourselv matthew and sinc you seem to want her i suppos i m willingor have to be i ve been think over the idea until i ve got kind of us to it it seem a sort of duti i ve never brought up a child especi a girl and i dare sai i ll make a terribl mess of it but i ll do my best so far as i m concern matthew she mai stai matthew s shy face wa a glow of delight well now i reckon you d come to see it in that light marilla he said she s such an interest littl thing it d be more to the point if you could sai she wa a us littl thing retort marilla but i ll make it my busi to see she s train to be that and mind matthew you re not to go interf with my method perhap an old maid doesn t know much about bring up a child but i guess she know more than an old bachelor so you just leav me to manag her when i fail it ll be time enough to put your oar in there there marilla you can have your own wai said matthew reassuringli onli be as good and kind to her as you can without spoil her i kind of think she s on of the sort you can do anyth with if you onli get her to love you marilla snif to express her contempt for matthew s opinion concern anyth feminin and walk off to the dairi with the pail i won t tell her tonight that she can stai she reflect as she strain the milk into the creamer she d be so excit that she wouldn t sleep a wink marilla cuthbert you re fairli in for it did you ever suppos you d see the dai when you d be adopt an orphan girl it s surpris enough but not so surpris as that matthew should be at the bottom of it him that alwai seem to have such a mortal dread of littl girl anyhow we ve decid on the experi and good onli know what will come of it chapter vii ann sai her prayer when marilla took ann up to bed that night she said stiffli now ann i notic last night that you threw your cloth all about the floor when you took them off that is a veri untidi habit and i can t allow it at all as soon as you take off ani articl of cloth fold it neatli and place it on the chair i haven t ani us at all for littl girl who aren t neat i wa so harrow up in my mind last night that i didn t think about my cloth at all said ann i ll fold them nice tonight thei alwai made us do that at the asylum half the

anyhow i d alwai be too tire at night to bother sai prayer peopl who have to look after twin can t be expect to sai their prayer now do you honestli think thei can marilla decid that ann s religi train must be begun at onc plainli there wa no time to be lost you must sai your prayer while you ar under my roof ann why of cours if you want me to assent ann cheerfulli i d do anyth to oblig you but you ll have to tell me what to sai for thi onc after i get into bed i ll imagin out a real nice prayer to sai alwai i believ that it will be quit interest now that i come to think of it you must kneel down said marilla in embarrass ann knelt at marilla s knee and look up grave why must peopl kneel down to prai if i realli want to prai i ll tell you what i d do i d go out into a great big field all alon or into the deep deep wood and i d look up into the skyupupupinto that love blue sky that look as if there wa no end to it blueness and then i d just feel a prayer well i m readi what

troubl i ve had a pretti easi life of it so far but my time ha come at last and i suppos i ll just have to make the best of it chapter viii ann s bringingup is begun for reason best known to herself marilla did not tell ann that she wa to stai at green gabl until the next afternoon dure the forenoon she kept the child busi with variou task and watch over her with a keen ey while she did them by noon she had conclud that ann wa smart and obedi will to work and quick to learn her most seriou shortcom seem to be a tendenc to fall into daydream in the middl of a task and forget all about it

such prai as i heard last night i suppos i wa veri awkward said ann apologet but then you see i d never had ani practic you couldn t realli expect a person to prai veri well the first time she tri could you i thought out a splendid prayer after i went to bed just as i promis you i would it wa nearli as long as a minist s and so poetic but would you believ it i couldn t rememb on word when i woke up thi morn and i m afraid i ll never be abl to think out anoth on as good somehow thing never ar so good when thei re thought out a second time have you ever notic that here is someth for you to notic ann when i tell you to do a thing i want you to obei me at onc and not stand stockstil and discours about it just you go and do as i bid you ann promptli depart for the sittingroom across the hall she fail to return after wait ten minut marilla laid down her knit and march after her with a grim express she found ann stand motionless befor a pictur hang on the wall between the two window with her ey astar with dream the white and green light strain through appl tree and cluster vine outsid fell over the rapt littl figur with a halfunearthli radianc ann whatev ar you think of demand marilla sharpli ann came back to earth with a start that she said point to the picturea rather vivid chromo entitl christ bless littl children and i wa just imagin i wa on of themthat i wa the littl girl in the blue dress stand off by herself in the corner as if she didn t belong to anybodi like me she look lone and sad don t you think i guess she hadn t ani father or mother of her own but she want to be bless too so she just crept shyli up on the outsid of the crowd hope nobodi would notic herexcept him i m sure i know just how she felt her heart must have beat and her hand must have got cold like mine did when i ask you if i could stai she wa afraid he mightn t notic her but it s like he did don t you think i ve been try to imagin it all outher edg a littl nearer all the time until she wa quit close to him and then he would look at her and put hi hand on her hair and oh such a thrill of joi as would run over her but i wish the artist hadn t paint him so sorrow look all hi pictur ar like that if you ve notic but i don t believ he could realli have look so sad or the children would have been afraid of him ann said marilla wonder why she had not broken into thi speech long befor you shouldn t talk that wai it s irreverentposit irrever ann s ey marvel why i felt just as rever as could be i m sure i didn t mean to be irrever well i don t suppos you didbut it doesn t sound right to talk so familiarli about such thing and anoth thing ann when i send you after someth you re to bring it at onc and not fall into moon and imagin befor pictur rememb that take that card and come right to the kitchen now sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by heart ann set the card up against the jug of appl blossom she had brought in to decor the dinnertablemarilla had ei that

thei mai have good dai of cours but thei can never have thi on and it s splendid still to have such a love wai to go to school by isn t it it s a lot nicer than go round by the road that is so dusti and hot said diana practic peep into her dinner basket and mental calcul if the three juici toothsom raspberri tart repos there were divid among ten girl how mani bite each girl would have the littl girl of avonlea school alwai pool their lunch and to eat three raspberri tart all alon or even to share them onli with on s best chum would have forev and ever brand as aw mean the girl who did it and yet when the tart were divid among ten girl you just got enough to tantal you the wai ann and diana went to school wa a pretti on ann thought those walk to and from school with diana couldn t be improv upon even by imagin go around by the main road would have been so unromant but to go by lover s lane and willowmer and violet vale and the birch path wa romant if ever anyth wa lover s lane open out below the orchard at green gabl and stretch far up into the wood to the end of the cuthbert farm it wa the wai by which the cow were taken to the back pastur and the wood haul home in winter ann had name it lover s lane befor she had been a month at green gabl not that lover ever realli walk there she explain to marilla but diana and i ar read a perfectli magnific book and there s a lover s lane in it so we want to have on too and it s a veri pretti name don t you think so romant we can t imagin the lover into it you know i like that lane becaus you can think out loud there without peopl call you crazi ann start out alon in the morn went down lover s lane as far as the brook here diana met her and the two littl girl went on up the lane under the leafi arch of mapl mapl ar such sociabl tree said ann thei re alwai rustl and whisper to you until thei came to a rustic bridg then thei left the lane and walk through mr barri s back field and past willowmer beyond willowmer came violet valea littl green dimpl in the shadow of mr andrew bell s big wood of cours there ar no violet there now ann told marilla but diana sai there ar million of them in spring oh marilla can t you just imagin you see them it actual take awai my breath i name it violet vale diana sai she never saw the beat of me for hit on fanci name for place it s nice to be clever at someth isn t it but diana name the birch path she want to so i let her but i m sure i could have found someth more poetic than plain birch path anybodi can think of a name like that but the birch path is on of the prettiest place in the world marilla it wa other peopl besid ann thought so when thei stumbl on it it wa a littl narrow twist path wind down over a long hill straight through mr bell s wood where the light came down sift through so mani emerald screen that it wa as flawless as the heart of a diamond it wa fring in all it length with slim young birch white stem and lissom bough fern and starflow and wild liliesofthevallei and scarlet tuft of pigeonberri grew thickli along it and alwai there wa a delight spici in the air and music of bird call and the murmur and laugh of wood wind in the tree overhead now and then you might see a rabbit skip across the road if you were quietwhich with ann and diana happen about onc in a blue moon down in the vallei the path came out to the main road and then it wa just up the spruce hill to the school the avonlea school wa a whitewash build low in the eav and wide in the window furnish insid with comfort substanti oldfashion desk that open and shut and were carv all over their lid with the initi and hieroglyph of three gener of school children the schoolhous wa set back from the road and behind it wa a duski fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottl of milk in the morn to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour marilla had seen ann start off to school on the first dai of septemb with mani secret misgiv ann wa such an odd girl how would she get on with the other children and how on earth would she ever manag to hold her tongu dure school hour thing went better than marilla fear howev ann came home that even in high spirit i

bring her up that wa marilla s exclus duti if it had been hi he would have been worri over frequent conflict between inclin and said duti as it wa he wa free to spoil ann marilla s phrasinga much as he like but it wa not such a bad arrang after all a littl appreci sometim doe quit as much good as all the conscienti bring up in the world chapter xxv matthew insist on puf sleev matthew wa have a bad ten minut of it he had come into the kitchen in the twilight of a cold grai decemb even and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off hi heavi boot unconsci of the fact that ann and a bevi of her schoolmat were have a practic of the fairi queen in the sit room present thei came troop through the hall and out into the kitchen laugh and chatter gaili thei did not see matthew who shrank bashfulli back into the shadow beyond the woodbox with a boot in on hand and a bootjack in the other and he watch them shyli for the aforesaid ten minut as thei put on cap and jacket and talk about the dialogu and the concert ann stood among them bright ei and anim as thei but matthew suddenli becam consciou that there wa someth about her differ from her mate and what worri matthew wa that the differ impress him as be someth that should not exist ann had a brighter face and bigger starrier ey and more delic featur than the other even shy unobserv matthew had learn to take note of these thing but the differ that disturb him did not consist in ani of these respect then in what did it consist matthew wa haunt by thi question long after the girl had gone arm in arm down the long hardfrozen lane and ann had betaken herself to her book he could not refer it to marilla who he felt would be quit sure to sniff scornfulli and remark that the onli differ she saw between ann and the other girl wa that thei sometim kept their tongu quiet while ann never did thi matthew felt would be no great help he had recours to hi pipe that even to help him studi it out much to marilla s disgust after two hour of smoke and hard reflect matthew arriv at a solut of hi problem ann wa not dress like the other girl the more matthew thought about the matter the more he wa convinc that ann never had been dress like the other girlsnev sinc she had come to green gabl marilla kept her cloth in plain dark dress all made after the same unvari pattern if matthew knew there wa such a thing as fashion in dress it wa as much as he did but he wa quit sure that ann s sleev did not look at all like the sleev the other girl wore he recal the cluster of littl girl he had seen around her that eveningal gai in waist of red and blue and pink and whiteand he wonder why marilla alwai kept her so plainli and soberli gown of cours it must be all right marilla knew best and marilla wa bring her up probabl some wise inscrut motiv wa to be serv therebi but sure it would do no harm to let the child have on pretti dresssometh like diana barri alwai wore matthew decid that he would give her on that sure could not be object to as an unwarr put in of hi oar christma wa onli a fortnight off a nice new dress would be the veri thing for a present matthew with a sigh of satisfact put awai hi pipe and went to bed while marilla open all the door and air the hous the veri next even matthew betook himself to carmodi to bui the dress determin to get the worst over and have done with it it would be he felt assur no trifl ordeal there were some thing matthew could bui and prove himself no mean bargain but he knew he would be at the merci of shopkeep when it came to bui a girl s dress after much cogit matthew resolv to go to samuel lawson s store instead of william blair s to be sure the cuthbert alwai had gone to william blair s it wa almost as much a matter of conscienc with them as to attend the presbyterian church and vote conserv but william blair s two daughter frequent wait on custom there and matthew held them in absolut dread he could contriv to deal with them when he knew exactli what he want and could point it out but in such a matter as thi requir explan and consult matthew felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter so he would go to lawson s where samuel or hi son would wait on him ala matthew did not know that samuel in the recent expans of hi busi had set up a ladi clerk also she wa a niec of hi wife s and a veri dash young person inde with a huge

when matthew came to think the matter over he decid that a woman wa requir to cope with the situat marilla wa out of the question matthew felt sure she would throw cold water on hi project at onc remain onli mr lynd for of no other woman in avonlea would matthew have dare to ask advic to mr lynd he went accordingli and that good ladi promptli took the matter out of the harass man s hand pick out a dress for you to give ann to be sure i will i m go to carmodi tomorrow and i ll attend to it have you someth particular in mind no well i ll just go by my own judgment then i believ a nice rich brown would just suit ann and william blair ha some new gloria in that s real pretti perhap you d like me to make it up for her too see that if marilla wa to make it ann would probabl get wind of it

someth decent for onc the wai marilla dress her is posit ridicul that s what and i ve ach to tell her so plainli a dozen time i ve held my tongu though for i can see marilla doesn t want advic and she think she know more about bring children up than i do for all she s an old maid but that s alwai the wai folk that ha brought up children know that there s no hard and fast method in the world that ll suit everi child but them as never have think it s all as plain and easi as rule of threejust set your three term down so fashion and the sum ll work out correct but flesh and blood don t come under the head of arithmet and that s where marilla cuthbert make her mistak i suppos she s try to cultiv a spirit of humil in ann by dress her as she doe but it s more like to cultiv envi and discont i m sure the child must feel the differ between her cloth and the other girl but to think of matthew take notic of it that man is wake up after be asleep for over sixti year marilla knew all the follow fortnight that matthew had someth on hi mind but what it wa she could not guess until christma ev when mr lynd brought up the new dress marilla behav pretti well on the whole although it is veri like

allan call out my name i realli cannot tell how i ever got up on that platform i felt as if a million ey were look at me and through me and for on dread moment i wa sure i couldn t begin at all then i thought of my love puf sleev and took courag i knew that i must live up to those sleev diana so i start in and my voic seem to be come from ever so far awai i just felt like a parrot it s providenti that i practic those recit so often up in the garret or i d never have been abl to get through did i groan all right ye inde you groan love assur diana i saw old mr sloan wipe awai tear when i sat down it wa splendid to think i had touch somebodi s heart it s so romant to take part in a concert isn t it oh it s been a veri memor occas inde wasn t the boi dialogu fine said diana gilbert blyth wa just splendid ann i do think it s aw mean the wai you treat gil wait till i tell you when you ran off the platform after the fairi dialogu on of your rose fell out of your hair i saw gil pick it up and put it in hi breast pocket there now you re so romant that i m sure you ought to be pleas at that it s noth to me what that person doe said ann loftili i simpli never wast a thought on him diana that night marilla and matthew who had been out to a concert for the first time in twenti year sat for a while by the kitchen fire after ann had gone to bed well now i guess our ann did as well as ani of them said matthew proudli ye she did admit marilla she s a bright child matthew and she look real nice too i ve been kind of oppos to thi concert scheme but i suppos there s no real harm in it after all anyhow i wa proud of ann tonight although i m not go to tell her so well now i wa proud of her and i did tell her so fore she went upstair said matthew we must see what we can do for her some of these dai marilla i guess she ll need someth more than avonlea school by and by there s time enough to think of that said marilla she s onli thirteen in march though tonight it struck me she wa grow quit a big girl mr lynd made that dress a mite too long and it make ann look so tall she s quick to learn and i guess the best thing we can do for her will be to send her to queen s after a spell but noth need be said about that for a year or two yet well now it ll do no harm to be think it over off and on said matthew thing like that ar all the better for lot of think over chapter xxvi the stori club is form junior avonlea found it hard to settl down to humdrum exist again to ann in particular thing seem fearfulli flat stale and unprofit after the goblet of excit she had been sip for week could she go back to the former quiet pleasur of those farawai dai befor the concert at first as she told diana she did not realli think she could i m posit certain diana that life can never be quit the same again as it wa in those olden dai she said mournfulli as if refer to a period of at least fifti year back perhap after a while i ll get us to it but i m afraid concert spoil peopl for everydai life i suppos that is why marilla disapprov of them marilla is such a sensibl woman it must be a great deal better to be sensibl but still i don t believ i d realli want to be a sensibl person becaus thei ar so unromant mr lynd sai there is no danger of my ever be on but you can never tell i feel just now that i mai grow up to be sensibl yet but perhap that is onli becaus i m tire i simpli couldn t sleep last night for ever so long i just lai awak and imagin the concert over and over again that s on splendid thing about such affairsit s so love to look back to them eventu howev avonlea school slip back into it old groov and took up it old interest to be sure the concert left trace rubi gilli and emma white who had quarrel over a point of preced in their platform seat no longer sat at the same desk and a promis friendship of three year wa broken up josi pye and julia bell did not speak for three month becaus josi pye had told bessi wright that julia bell s bow when she got up to recit made her think of a chicken jerk it head and bessi told julia none of the sloan would have ani deal with the bell becaus the bell had declar that the sloan had too much to do in the program and the sloan had retort that the bell were not capabl of do the littl thei had to do properli final charli sloan fought moodi spurgeon macpherson becaus moodi spurgeon had said that ann shirlei put on air about her recit and moodi spurgeon wa lick consequ moodi spurgeon s sister ella mai would not speak to ann shirlei all the rest of the winter with the except of these trifl friction work in miss staci s littl kingdom went on with regular and smooth the winter week slip by it wa an unusu mild winter with so littl snow that ann and diana could go to school nearli everi dai by wai of the birch path on ann s birthdai thei were trip lightli down it keep ey and ear alert amid all their chatter for miss staci had told them that thei must soon write a composit on a winter s walk in the wood and it behoov them to be observ just think diana i m thirteen year old todai remark ann in an aw voic i can scarc realiz that i m in my teen when i woke thi morn it seem to me that everyth must be differ you ve been thirteen for a month so i suppos it doesn t seem such a novelti to you as it doe to me it make life seem so much more interest in two more year i ll be realli grown up it s a great comfort to think that i ll be abl to us big word then without be laugh at rubi gilli sai she mean to have a beau as soon as she s fifteen said diana rubi gilli think of noth but beau said ann disdainfulli she s actual delight when anyon write her name up in a takenotic for all she pretend to be so mad but i m afraid that is an uncharit speech mr allan sai we should never make uncharit speech but thei do slip out so often befor you think don t thei i simpli can t talk about josi pye without make an uncharit speech so i never mention her at all you mai have notic that i m try to be as much like mr allan as i possibl can for i think she s perfect mr allan think so too mr lynd sai he just worship the ground she tread on and she doesn t realli think it right for a minist to set hi affect so much on a mortal be but then diana even minist ar human and have their beset sin just like everybodi els i had such an interest talk with mr allan about beset sin last sundai afternoon there ar just a few thing it s proper to talk about on sundai and that is on of them my beset sin is imagin too much and forget my duti i m strive veri hard to overcom it and now that i m realli thirteen perhap i ll get on better in four more year we ll be abl to put our hair up said diana alic bell is onli sixteen and she is wear her up but i think that s ridicul i shall wait until i m seventeen if i had alic bell s crook nose said ann decidedli i wouldn tbut there i won t sai what i wa go to becaus it wa extrem uncharit besid i wa compar it with my own nose and that s vaniti i m afraid i think too much about my nose ever sinc i heard that compliment about it long ago it realli is a great comfort to me oh diana look there s a rabbit that s someth to rememb for our wood composit i realli think the wood ar just as love in winter as in summer thei re so white and still as if thei were asleep and dream pretti dream i won t mind write that composit when it time come sigh diana i can manag to write about the wood but the on we re to hand in mondai is terribl the idea of miss staci tell us to write a stori out of our own head why it s as easi as wink said ann it s easi for you becaus you have an imagin retort diana but what would you do if you had been born without on i suppos you have your composit all done ann nod try hard not to look virtuous complac and fail miser i wrote it last mondai even it s call the jealou rival or in death not divid i read it to marilla and she said it wa stuff and nonsens then i read it to matthew and he said it wa fine that is the kind of critic i like it s a sad sweet stori i just cri like a child while i wa write it it s about two beauti maiden call cordelia montmor and geraldin seymour who live in the same villag and were devotedli attach to each other cordelia wa a regal brunett with a coronet of midnight hair and duskli flash ey geraldin wa a queenli blond with hair like spun gold and velveti purpl ey i never saw anybodi with purpl ey said diana dubious neither did i i just imagin them i want someth out of the common geraldin had an alabast brow too i ve found out what an alabast brow is that is on of the advantag of be thirteen you know so much more than you did when you were onli twelv well what becam of cordelia and geraldin ask diana who wa begin to feel rather interest in their fate thei grew in beauti side by side until thei were sixteen then bertram dever came to their nativ villag and fell in love with the fair geraldin he save her life when her hors ran awai with her in a carriag and she faint in hi arm and he carri her home three mile becaus you understand the carriag wa all smash up i found it rather hard to imagin the propos becaus i had no experi to go by i ask rubi gilli if she knew anyth about how men propos becaus i thought she d like be an author on the subject have so mani sister marri rubi told me she wa hid in the hall pantri when malcolm andr propos to her sister susan she said malcolm told susan that hi dad had given him the farm in hi own name and then said what do you sai darl pet if we get hitch thi fall and susan said yesnoi don t knowlet me see and there thei were engag as quick as that but i didn t think that sort of a propos wa a veri romant on so in the end i had to imagin it out as well as i could i made it veri floweri and poetic and bertram went on hi knee although rubi gilli sai it isn t done nowadai geraldin accept him in a speech a page long i can tell you i took a lot of troubl with that speech i rewrot it five time and i look upon it as my masterpiec bertram gave her a diamond ring and a rubi necklac and told her thei would go to europ for a wed tour for he wa immens wealthi but then ala shadow began to darken over their path cordelia wa secretli in love with bertram herself and when geraldin told her about the engag she wa simpli furiou especi when she saw the necklac and the diamond ring all her affect for geraldin turn to bitter hate and she vow that she should never marri bertram but she pretend to be geraldin s friend the same as ever on even thei were stand on the bridg over a rush turbul stream and cordelia think thei were alon push geraldin over the brink with a wild mock ha ha ha but bertram saw it all and he at onc plung into the current exclaim i will save thee my peerless geraldin but ala he had forgotten he couldn t swim and thei were both drown clasp in each other s arm their bodi were wash ashor soon afterward thei were buri in the on grave and their funer wa most impos diana it s so much more romant to end a stori up with a funer than a wed as for cordelia she went insan with remors and wa shut up in a lunat asylum i thought that wa a poetic retribut for her crime how perfectli love sigh diana who belong to matthew s school of critic i don t see how you can make up such thrill thing out of your own head ann i wish my imagin wa as good as your it would be if you d onli cultiv it said ann cheeringli i ve just thought of a plan diana let you and me have a stori club all our own and write stori for practic i ll help you along until you can do them by yourself you ought to cultiv your imagin you know miss staci sai so onli we must take the right wai i told her about the haunt wood but she said we went the wrong wai about it in that thi wa how the stori club came into exist it wa limit to diana and ann at first but soon it wa extend to includ jane andrew and rubi gilli and on or two other who felt that their imagin need cultiv no boi were allow in italthough rubi gilli opin that their admiss would make it more excitingand each member had to produc on stori a week it s extrem interest ann told marilla each girl ha to read her stori out loud and then we talk it over we ar go to keep them all sacredli and have them to read to our descend we each write under a nomdeplum mine is rosamond montmor all the girl do pretti well rubi gilli is rather sentiment she put too much lovemak into her stori and you know too much is wors than too littl jane never put ani becaus she sai it make her feel so silli when she had to read it out loud jane s stori ar extrem sensibl then diana put too mani murder into her she sai most of the time she doesn t know what to do with the peopl so she kill them off to get rid of them i mostli alwai have to tell them what to write about but that isn t hard for i ve million of idea i think thi storywrit busi is the foolishest yet scof marilla you ll get a pack of nonsens into your head and wast time that should be put on your lesson read stori is bad enough but write them is wors but we re so care to put a moral into them all marilla explain ann i insist upon that all the good peopl ar reward and all the bad on ar suitabl punish i m sure that must have a wholesom effect the moral is the great thing mr allan sai so i read on of my stori to him and mr allan and thei both agre that the moral wa excel onli thei laugh in the wrong place i like it better when peopl cry jane and rubi almost alwai cry when i come to the pathet part diana wrote her aunt josephin about our club and her aunt josephin wrote back that we were to send her some of our stori so we copi out four of our veri best and sent them miss josephin barri wrote back that she had never read anyth so amus in her life that kind of puzzl us becaus the stori were all veri pathet and almost everybodi di but i m glad miss barri like them it show our club is do some good in the world mr allan sai that ought to be our object in everyth i do realli try to make it my object but i forget so often when i m have fun i hope i shall be a littl like mr allan when i grow up do you think there is ani prospect of it marilla i shouldn t sai there wa a great deal wa marilla s encourag answer i m sure mr allan wa never such a silli forget littl girl as you ar no but she wasn t alwai so good as she is now either said ann serious she told me so herselfthat is she said she wa a dread mischief when she wa a girl and wa alwai get into scrape i felt so encourag when i heard that is it veri wick of me marilla to feel encourag when i hear that other peopl have been bad and mischiev mr lynd sai it is mr lynd sai she alwai feel shock when she hear of anyon ever have been naughti no matter how small thei were mr lynd sai she onc heard a minist confess that when he wa a boi he stole a strawberri tart out of hi aunt s pantri and she never had ani respect for that minist again now i wouldn t have felt that wai i d have thought that it wa real nobl of him to confess it and i d have thought what an encourag thing it would be for small boi nowadai who do naughti thing and ar sorri for them to know that perhap thei mai grow up to be minist in spite of it that s how i d feel marilla the wai i feel at present ann said marilla is that it s high time you had those dish wash you ve taken half an hour longer than you should with all your chatter learn to work first and talk afterward chapter xxvii vaniti and vexat of spirit marilla walk home on late april even from an aid meet realiz that the winter wa over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fail to bring to the oldest and saddest as well as to the youngest and merriest marilla wa not given to subject analysi of her thought and feel she probabl imagin that she wa think about the aid and their missionari box and the new carpet for the vestri room but under these reflect wa a harmoni conscious of red field smoke into palepurpli mist in the declin sun of long sharppoint fir shadow fall over the meadow beyond the brook of still crimsonbud mapl around a mirrorlik wood pool of a waken in the world and a stir of hidden puls under the grai sod the spring wa abroad in the land and marilla s sober middleag step wa lighter and swifter becaus of it deep primal glad her ey dwelt affection on green gabl peer through it network of tree and reflect the sunlight back from it window in sever littl corusc of glori marilla as she pick her step along the damp lane thought that it wa realli a satisfact to know that she wa go home to a briskli snap wood fire and a tabl nice spread for tea instead of to the cold comfort of old aid meet even befor ann had come to green gabl consequ when marilla enter her kitchen and found the fire black out with no sign of ann anywher she felt justli disappoint and irrit she had told ann to be sure and have tea readi at five o clock but now she must hurri to take off her secondbest dress and prepar the meal herself against matthew s return from plow i ll settl

s gad off somewher with diana write stori or practic dialogu or some such tomfooleri and never think onc about the time or her duti she s just got to be pull up short and sudden on thi sort of thing i don t care if mr allan doe sai she s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew she mai be bright and sweet enough but her head is full of nonsens and there s never ani know what shape it ll break out in next just as soon as she grow out of on freak she take up with anoth but there here i am sai the veri thing i wa so rile with rachel lynd for sai at the aid todai i wa real glad when mr allan

thing i must sai with all her fault i never found her disobedi or untrustworthi befor and i m real sorri to find her so now well now i dunno said matthew who be patient and wise and abov all hungri had deem it best to let marilla talk her wrath out unhind have learn by experi that she got through with whatev work wa on hand much quicker if not delai by untim argument perhap you re judg her too hasti marilla don t call her untrustworthi until you re sure she ha disobei you mebb it can all be explainedann s a great hand at explain she s not here when i told her to stai retort marilla i reckon she ll find it hard to explain that to my satisfact of cours i knew you d take her part matthew but i m bring her up not you it wa dark when supper wa readi and still no sign of ann come hurriedli over the log bridg or up lover s lane breathless and repent with a sens of neglect duti marilla wash and put awai the dish grimli then want a candl to light her wai down the cellar she went up to the

as ann s hair at that moment ye it s green moan ann i thought noth could be as bad as red hair but now i know it s ten time wors to have green hair oh marilla you littl know how utterli wretch i am i littl know how you got into thi fix but i mean to find out said marilla come right down to the kitchenit s too cold up hereand tell me just what you ve done i ve been expect someth queer for some time

ye i knew it wa a littl wick admit ann but i thought it wa worth while to be a littl wick to get rid of red hair i count the cost marilla besid i meant to be extra good in other wai to make up for it well said marilla sarcast if i d decid it wa worth while to dye my hair i d have dy it a decent color at least i wouldn t have dy it green but i didn t mean to dye it green marilla protest ann dejectedli if i wa wick i meant to be wick to some purpos he said it would turn my hair a beauti raven blackh posit assur me that it would how could i doubt hi word marilla i know what it feel like to have your word doubt and mr allan sai we should never suspect anyon of not tell us the truth unless we have proof that thei re not i have proof nowgreen hair is proof enough for anybodi but i hadn t then and i believ everi word he said implicitli who said who ar you talk about the peddler that wa here thi afternoon i bought the dye from him ann shirlei how often have i told you never to let on of those italian in the hous i don t believ in encourag them to come around at all oh i didn t let him in the hous i rememb what you told me and i went out carefulli shut the door and look at hi thing on the step besid he wasn t an italianh wa a german jew he had a big box full of veri interest thing and he told me he wa work hard to make enough monei to bring hi wife and children out from germani he spoke so feelingli about them that it touch my heart i want to bui someth from him to help him in such a worthi object then all at onc i saw the bottl of hair dye the peddler said it wa warrant to dye ani hair a beauti raven black and wouldn t wash off in a trice i saw myself with beauti ravenblack hair and the temptat wa irresist but the price of the bottl wa seventyf cent and i had onli fifti cent left out of my chicken monei i think the peddler had a veri kind heart for he said that see it wa me he d sell it for fifti cent and that wa just give it awai so i bought it and as soon as he had gone i came up here and appli it with an old hairbrush as the direct said i us up the whole bottl and oh marilla when i saw the dread color it turn my hair i repent of be wick i can tell you and i ve been repent ever sinc well i hope you ll repent to good purpos said marilla sever and that you ve got your ey open to where your vaniti ha led you ann good know what s to be done i suppos the first thing is to give your hair a good wash and see if that will do ani good accordingli ann wash her hair scrub it vigor with soap and water but for all the differ it made she might as well have been scour it origin red the peddler had certainli spoken the truth when he declar that the dye wouldn t wash off howev hi verac might be impeach in other respect oh marilla what shall i do question ann in tear i can never live thi down peopl have pretti well forgotten my other mistakesth liniment cake and set diana drunk and fly into a temper with mr lynd but thei ll never forget thi thei will think i

in princ edward island ann s unhappi continu for a week dure that time she went nowher and shampoo her hair everi dai diana alon of outsid knew the fatal secret but she promis solemnli never to tell and it mai be state here and now that she kept her word at the end of the week marilla said decidedli it s no us ann that is fast dye if ever there wa ani your hair must be cut off there is no other wai you can t go out with it look like that ann s lip quiver but she realiz the bitter truth of marilla s remark with a dismal sigh she went for the scissor pleas cut it off at onc marilla and have it over oh i feel that my heart is broken thi is such an unromant afflict the girl in book lose their hair in fever or sell it to get monei for some good deed and i m sure i wouldn t mind lose my hair in some such fashion half so much but there is noth comfort in have your hair cut off becaus you ve dy it a dread color is there i m go to weep all the time you re cut it off if it won t interfer it seem such a tragic thing ann wept then but later on when she went upstair and look in the glass she wa calm with despair marilla had done her work thoroughli and it had been necessari to shingl the hair as close as possibl the result wa not becom to state the case as mildli as mai be ann promptli turn her glass to the wall i ll never never look at myself again until my hair grow she exclaim passion then

wouldn t do to tell her that it s alwai wrong to do anyth you can t tell the minist s wife it s as good as an extra conscienc to have a minist s wife for your friend and i wa veri glad i didn t bet becaus the red hors did win and i would have lost ten cent so you see that virtu wa it own reward we saw a man go up in a balloon i d love to go up in a balloon marilla it would be simpli thrill and we saw a man sell fortun you paid him ten cent and a littl bird pick out your fortun for you miss barri gave diana and me ten cent each to have our fortun told mine wa that i would marri a

had never care much for anybodi but herself she valu peopl onli as thei were of servic to her or amus her ann had amus her and consequ stood high in the old ladi s good grace but miss barri found herself think less about ann s quaint speech than of her fresh enthusiasm her transpar emot her littl win wai and the sweet of her ey and lip i thought marilla cuthbert wa an old fool when i heard she d adopt a girl out of an orphan asylum she said to herself but i guess she didn t make much of a mistak after all if i d a child like ann in the hous all the time i d be a better and happier woman ann

much as look at ben hur for a whole week not even to see how the chariot race turn out but miss staci said she wouldn t requir that and she forgav me freeli so i think it wasn t veri kind of her to come up here to you about it after all miss staci never mention such a thing to me ann and it onli your guilti conscienc that s the matter with you you have no busi to be take storybook to school you read too mani novel anyhow when i wa a girl i wasn t so much as allow to look at a novel oh how can you call ben hur a novel when it s realli such a religi book protest ann of cours it s a littl too excit to be proper read for sundai and i onli read it on weekdai and i never read ani book now unless either miss staci or mr allan think it is a proper book for a girl thirteen and threequart to read miss staci made me promis that she found me read a book on dai call the lurid mysteri of the haunt hall it wa on rubi gilli had lent me and oh marilla it wa so fascin and creepi it just curdl the blood in my vein but miss staci said it wa a veri silli unwholesom book and she ask me not to read ani more of it or ani like it i didn t mind promis not to read ani more like it but it wa agon to give back that book without know how it turn out but my love for miss staci stood the test and i did it s realli wonder marilla what you can do when you re truli anxiou to pleas a certain person well i guess i ll light the lamp and get to work said marilla i see plainli that you don t want to hear what miss staci had to sai you re more interest in the sound of your own tongu than in anyth els oh inde marilla i do want to hear it cri ann contrit i won t sai anoth wordnot on i know i talk too much but i am realli try to overcom it and although i sai far too much yet if you onli knew how mani thing i want to sai and don t you d give me some credit for it pleas tell me marilla well miss staci want to organ a class among her advanc student who mean to studi for the entranc examin into queen s she intend to give them extra lesson for an hour after school and she came to ask matthew and me if we would like to have you join it what do you think about it yourself ann would you like to go to queen s and pass for a teacher oh marilla ann straighten to her knee and clasp her hand it s been the dream of my lifethat is for the last six month ever sinc rubi and jane began to talk of studi for the entranc but i didn t sai anyth about it becaus i suppos it would be perfectli useless i d love to be a teacher but won t it be dreadfulli expens mr andrew sai it cost him on hundr and fifti dollar to put prissi through and prissi wasn t a dunc in geometri i guess you needn t worri about that part of it when matthew and i took you to bring up we resolv we would do the best we could for you and give you a good educ i believ in a girl be fit to earn her own live whether she ever ha to or not you ll alwai have a home at green gabl as long as matthew and i ar here but nobodi know what is go to happen in thi uncertain world and it s just as well to be prepar so you can join the queen s class if you like ann oh marilla thank you ann flung her arm about marilla s waist and look up earnestli into her face i m extrem grate to you and matthew and i ll studi as hard as i can and do my veri best to be a credit to you i warn you not to expect much in geometri but i think i can hold my own in anyth els if i work hard i dare sai you ll get along well enough miss staci sai you ar bright and dilig not for world would marilla have told ann just what miss staci had said about her that would have been to pamper vaniti you needn t rush to ani extrem of kill yourself over your book there is no hurri you won t be readi to try the entranc for a year and a half yet but it s well to begin in time and be thoroughli ground miss staci sai i shall take more interest than ever in my studi now said ann blissfulli becaus i have a purpos in life mr allan sai everybodi should have a purpos in life and pursu it faithfulli onli he sai we must first make sure that it is a worthi purpos i would call it a worthi purpos to want to be a teacher like miss staci wouldn t you marilla i think it s a veri nobl profess the queen s class wa organ in due time gilbert blyth ann shirlei rubi gilli jane andrew josi pye charli sloan and moodi spurgeon macpherson join it diana barri did not as her parent did not intend to send her to queen s thi seem noth short of a calam to ann never sinc the night on which minni mai had had the croup had she and diana been separ in anyth on the even when the queen s class first remain in school for the extra lesson and ann saw diana go slowli out with the other to walk home alon through the birch path and violet vale it wa all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain from rush impuls after her chum a lump came into her throat and she hastili retir behind the page of her uplift latin grammar to hide the tear in her ey not for world would ann have had gilbert blyth or josi pye see those tear but oh marilla i realli felt that i had tast the bitter of death as mr allan said in hi sermon last sundai when i saw diana go out alon she said mournfulli that night i thought how splendid it would have been if diana had onli been go to studi for the entranc too but we can t have thing perfect in thi imperfect world as mr lynd sai mr lynd isn t exactli a comfort person sometim but there s no doubt she sai a great mani veri true thing and i think the queen s class is go to be extrem interest jane and rubi ar just go to studi to be teacher that is the height of their ambit rubi sai she will onli teach for two year after she get through and then she intend to be marri jane sai she will devot her whole life to teach and never never marri becaus you ar paid a salari for teach but a husband won t pai you anyth and growl if you ask for a share in the egg and butter monei i expect jane speak from mourn experi for mr lynd sai that her father is a perfect old crank and meaner than second skim josi pye sai she is just go to colleg for educ s sake becaus she won t have to earn her own live she sai of cours it is differ with orphan who ar live on charitythei have to hustl moodi spurgeon is go to be a minist mr lynd sai he couldn t be anyth els with a name like that to live up to i hope it isn t wick of me marilla but realli the thought of moodi spurgeon be a minist make me laugh he s such a funnylook boi with that big fat face and hi littl blue ey and hi ear stick out like flap but perhap he will be more intellectu look when he grow up charli sloan sai he s go to go into polit and be a member of parliament but mr lynd sai he ll never succe at that becaus the sloan ar all honest peopl and it s onli rascal that get on in polit nowadai what is gilbert blyth go to be queri marilla see that ann wa open her caesar i don t happen to know what gilbert blyth s ambit in life isif he ha ani said ann scornfulli there wa open rivalri between gilbert and ann now previous the rivalri had been rather onesid but there wa no longer ani doubt that gilbert wa as determin to be first in class as ann wa he wa a foeman worthi of her steel the other member of the class tacitli acknowledg their superior and never dream of try to compet with them sinc the dai by the pond when she had refus to listen to hi plea for forgiv gilbert save for the aforesaid determin rivalri had evinc no recognit whatev of the exist of ann shirlei he talk and jest with the other girl exchang book and puzzl with them discuss lesson and plan sometim walk home with on or the other of them from prayer meet or debat club but ann shirlei he simpli ignor and ann found out that it is not pleasant to be ignor it wa in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head that she did not care deep down in her wayward feminin littl heart she knew that she did care and that if she had that chanc of the lake of shine water again she would answer veri differ all at onc as it seem and to her secret dismai she found that the old resent she had cherish against him wa gonegon just when she most need it sustain power it wa in vain that she recal everi incid and emot of that memor occas and tri to feel the old satisfi anger that dai by the pond had wit it last spasmod flicker ann realiz that she had forgiven and forgotten without know it but it wa too late and at least neither gilbert nor anybodi els not even diana should ever suspect how sorri she wa and how much she wish she hadn t been so proud and horrid she determin to shroud her feel in deepest oblivion and it mai be state here and now that she did it so successfulli that gilbert who possibl wa not quit so indiffer as he seem could not consol himself with ani belief that ann felt hi retaliatori scorn the onli poor comfort he had wa that she snub charli sloan unmercifulli continu and undeservedli otherwis the winter pass awai in a round of pleasant duti and studi for ann the dai slip by like golden

when i went home that night i sai to thoma sai i mark my word thoma marilla cuthbert ll live to rue the step she s took but i wa mistaken and i m real glad of it i ain t on of those kind of peopl marilla as can never be brought to own up that thei ve made a mistak no that never wa my wai thank good i did make a mistak in judg ann but it weren t no wonder for an odder unexpected witch of a child there never wa in thi world that s what there wa no cipher her out by the rule that work with other children it s noth short of wonder how she s improv these three year but especi in look she s a real pretti girl got to be though i can t sai i m overli partial to that pale bigei style myself i like more snap and color like diana barri ha or rubi gilli rubi gilli s look ar real showi but somehowi don t know how it is but when ann and them ar togeth though she ain t half as handsom she make them look kind of common and overdonesometh like them white june lili she call narcissu alongsid of the big red peoni that s what chapter xxxi where the brook and river meet ann had her good summer and enjoi it wholeheartedli she and diana fairli live outdoor revel in all the delight that lover s lane and the dryad s bubbl and willowmer and victoria island afford marilla offer no object to ann s gypsi the spencerval doctor who had come the night minni mai had the croup met ann at the hous of a patient on afternoon earli in vacat look her over sharpli screw up hi mouth shook hi head and sent a messag to marilla cuthbert by anoth person it wa keep that redhead girl of your in the open air all summer and don t let her read book until she get more spring into her step thi messag frighten marilla wholesom she read ann s death warrant by consumpt in it unless it wa scrupul obei as a result ann had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went she walk row berri and dream to her heart s content and when septemb came she wa brightei and alert with a step that would have satisfi the spencerval doctor and a heart full of ambit and zest onc more i feel just like studi with might and main she declar as she brought her book down from the attic oh you good old friend i m glad to see your honest face onc morey even you geometri i ve had a perfectli beauti summer marilla and now i m rejoic as a strong man to run a race as mr allan said last sundai doesn t mr allan preach magnific sermon mr lynd sai he is improv everi dai and the first thing we know some citi church will gobbl him up and then we ll be left and have to turn to and break in anoth green preacher but i don t see the us of meet troubl halfwai do you marilla i think it would be better just to enjoi mr allan while we have him if i were a man i think i d be a minist thei can have such an influenc for good if their theologi is sound and it must be thrill to preach splendid sermon and stir your hearer heart why can t women be minist marilla i ask mr lynd that and she wa shock and said it would be a scandal thing she said there might be femal minist in the state and she believ there wa but thank good we hadn t got to that stage in canada yet and she hope we never would but i don t see why i think women would make splendid minist when there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anyth els to rais monei the women have to turn to and do the work i m sure mr lynd can prai everi bit as well as superintend bell and i ve no doubt she could preach too with a littl practic ye i believ she could said marilla dryli she doe plenti of unoffici preach as it is nobodi ha much of a chanc to go wrong in avonlea with rachel to overse them marilla said ann in a burst of confid i want to tell you someth and ask you what you think about it it ha worri me terriblyon sundai afternoon that is when i think special about such matter i do realli want to be good and when i m with you or mr allan or miss staci i want it more than ever and i want to do just what would pleas you and what you would approv of but mostli when i m with mr lynd i feel desper wick and as if i want to go and do the veri thing she tell me i oughtn t to do i feel irresist tempt to do it now what do you think is the reason i feel like that do you think it s becaus i m realli bad and unregener marilla look dubiou for a moment then she laugh if you ar i guess i am too ann for rachel often ha that veri effect on me i sometim think she d have more of an influenc for good as you sai yourself if she didn t keep nag peopl to do right there should have been a special command against nag but there i shouldn t talk so rachel is a good christian woman and she mean well there isn t a kinder soul in avonlea and she never shirk her share of work i m veri glad you feel the same said ann decidedli it s so encourag i shan t worri so much over that after thi but i dare sai there ll be other thing to worri me thei keep come up new all the timeth to perplex you you know you settl on question and there s anoth right after there ar so mani thing to be thought over and decid when you re begin to grow up it keep me busi all the time think them over and decid what is right it s a seriou thing to grow up isn t it marilla but when i have such good friend as you and matthew and mr allan and miss staci i ought to grow up successfulli and i m sure it will be my own fault if i don t i feel it s a great respons becaus i have onli the on chanc if i don t grow up right i can t go back and begin over again i ve grown two inch thi summer marilla mr gilli measur me at rubi s parti i m so glad you made my new dress longer

ll be abl to studi better becaus of mine i shall have such a comfort feel deep down in my mind about that flounc it s worth someth to have that admit marilla miss staci came back to avonlea school and found all her pupil eager for work onc more especi did the queen s class gird up their loin for the frai for at the end of the come year dimli shadow their pathwai alreadi loom up that fate thing known as the entranc at the thought of which on and all felt their heart sink into their veri shoe suppos thei did not pass that thought wa doom to haunt ann through the wake hour of that winter sundai afternoon inclus to the almost entir exclus of moral and theolog problem when ann had bad dream she found herself stare miser at pass list of the entranc exam where gilbert blyth s name wa blazon at the top and in which her did not appear at all but it wa a jolli busi happi swiftfli winter schoolwork wa as interest class rivalri as absorb as of yore new world of thought feel and ambit fresh fascin field of unexplor knowledg seem to be open out befor ann s eager ey hill peep o er hill and alp on alp aros much of all thi wa due to miss staci s tact care broadmind guidanc she led her class to think and explor and discov for themselv and encourag strai from the old beaten path to a degre that quit shock mr lynd and the school truste who view all innov on establish method rather dubious apart from her studi ann expand social for marilla mind of the spencerval doctor s dictum no longer veto occasion out the debat club flourish and gave sever concert there were on or two parti

girl wa taller than herself why ann how you ve grown she said almost unbelievingli a sigh follow on the word marilla felt a queer regret over ann s inch the child she had learn to love had vanish somehow and here wa thi tall seriousei girl of fifteen with the thought brow and the proudli pois littl head in her place marilla love the girl as much as she had love the child but she wa consciou of a queer sorrow sens of loss and that night when ann had gone to prayer meet with diana marilla sat alon in the wintri twilight and indulg in the weak of a cry matthew come in with a lantern caught her at it and gaze at her in such constern that marilla had to laugh through her tear i wa think about ann she explain she s got to be such a big girland she ll probabl be awai from us next winter i ll miss her terribl she ll be abl to come home often comfort matthew to whom ann wa as yet and alwai would be the littl eager girl he had brought home from bright river on that june even four year befor the branch railroad will be built to carmodi by that time it won t be the same thing as have her here all the time sigh marilla gloomili determin to enjoi her luxuri of grief uncomfort but theremen can t understand these thing there were other chang in ann no less real than the physic chang for on thing she becam much quieter perhap she thought all the more and dream as much as ever but she certainli talk less marilla notic and comment on thi also you don t chatter half as much as you us to ann nor us half as mani big word what ha come over you ann color and laugh a littl as she drop her
