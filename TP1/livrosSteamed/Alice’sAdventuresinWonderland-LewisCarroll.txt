come to an end i wonder how mani mile i ve fallen by thi time she said aloud i must be get somewher near the centr of the earth let me see that would be four thousand mile down i think for you see alic had learnt sever thing of thi sort in her lesson in the schoolroom and though thi wa not a veri good opportun for show off her knowledg as there wa no on to listen to her still it wa good practic to sai it over ye that s about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitud or longitud i ve got to alic had no idea what latitud wa or longitud either but thought thei were nice grand word to sai present she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funni it ll seem to come out among the peopl that walk with their head downward the antipathi i think she wa rather glad there wa no on listen thi time as it didn t sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the countri is you know pleas ma am is thi new zealand or australia and she tri to curtsei as she spokef curtsei as you re fall through the air do you think you could manag it and what an ignor littl girl she ll think me for ask no it ll never do to ask perhap i shall see it written up somewher down down down there wa noth els to do so alic soon began talk again dinah ll miss me veri much tonight i should think dinah wa the cat i hope thei ll rememb her saucer of milk at teatim dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there ar no mice in the air i m afraid but you might catch a bat and that s veri like a mous you know but do cat eat bat i wonder and here alic began to get rather sleepi and went on sai to herself in a dreami sort of wai do cat eat bat do cat eat bat and sometim do bat eat cat for you see as she couldn t answer either question it didn t much matter which wai she put it she felt that she wa doze off and had just begun to dream that she wa walk hand in hand with dinah and sai to her veri earnestli now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenli thump thump down she came upon a heap of stick and dry leav and the fall wa over alic wa not a bit hurt and she jump up on to her feet in a moment she look up but it wa all dark overhead befor her wa anoth long passag and the white rabbit wa still in sight hurri down it there wa not a moment to be lost awai went alic like the wind and wa just in time to hear it sai as it turn a corner oh my ear and whisker how late it s get she wa close behind it when she turn the corner but the rabbit wa no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which wa lit up by a row of lamp hang from the roof there were door all round the hall but thei were all lock and when alic had been all the wai down on side and up the other try everi door she walk sadli down the middl wonder how she wa ever to get out again suddenli she came upon a littl threeleg tabl all made of solid glass there wa noth on it except a tini golden kei and alic s first thought wa that it might belong to on of the door of the hall but ala either the lock were too larg or the kei wa too small but at ani rate it would not open ani of them howev on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not notic befor and behind it wa a littl door about fifteen inch high she tri the littl golden kei in the lock and to her great delight it fit alic open the door and found that it led into a small passag not much larger than a rathol she knelt down and look along the passag into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she long to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those bed of bright flower and those cool fountain but she could not even get her head through the doorwai and even if my head would go through thought poor alic it would be of veri littl us without my shoulder oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescop i think i could if i onli knew how to begin for you see so mani outofthewai thing had happen late that alic had begun to think that veri few thing inde were realli imposs there seem to be no us in wait by the littl door so she went back to the tabl half hope she might find anoth kei on it or at ani rate a book of rule for shut peopl up like telescop thi time she found a littl bottl on it which certainli wa not here befor said alic and round the neck of the bottl wa a paper label with the word drink me beautifulli print on it in larg letter it wa all veri well to sai drink me but the wise littl alic wa not go to do that in a hurri no i ll look first she said and see whether it s mark poison or not for she had read sever nice littl histori about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beast and other unpleas thing all becaus thei would not rememb the simpl rule their friend had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger veri deepli with a knife it usual bleed and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottl mark poison it is almost certain to disagre with you sooner or later howev thi bottl wa not mark poison so alic ventur to tast it and find it veri nice it had in fact a sort of mix flavour of cherrytart custard pineappl roast turkei toffe and hot butter toast she veri soon finish it off what a curiou feel said alic i must be shut up like a telescop and so it wa inde she wa now onli ten inch high and her face brighten up at the thought that she wa now the right size for go through the littl door into that love garden first howev she wait for a few minut to see if she wa go to shrink ani further she felt a littl nervou about thi for it might end you know said alic to herself in my go out altogeth like a candl i wonder what i should be like then and she tri to fanci what the flame of a candl is like after the candl is blown out for she could not rememb ever have seen such a thing after a while find that noth more happen she decid on go into the garden at onc but ala for poor alic when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the littl golden kei and when she went back to the tabl for it she found she could not possibl reach it she could see it quit plainli through the glass and she tri her best to climb up on of the leg of the tabl but it wa too slipperi and when she had tire herself out with try the poor littl thing sat down and cri come there s no us in cry like that said alic to herself rather sharpli i advis you to leav off thi minut she gener gave herself veri good advic though she veri seldom follow it and sometim she scold herself so sever as to bring tear into her ey and onc she rememb try to box her own ear for have cheat herself in a game of croquet she wa plai against herself for thi curiou child wa veri fond of pretend to be two peopl but it s no us now thought poor alic to pretend to be two peopl why there s hardli enough of me left to make on respect person soon her ey fell on a littl glass box that wa ly under the tabl she open it and found in it a veri small cake on which the word eat me were beautifulli mark in currant well i ll eat it said alic and if it make me grow larger i can reach the kei and if it make me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either wai i ll get into the garden and i don t care which happen she at a littl bit and said anxious to herself which wai which wai hold her hand on the top of her head to feel which wai it wa grow and she wa quit surpris to find that she remain the same size to be sure thi gener happen when on eat cake but alic had got so much into the wai of expect noth but outofthewai thing to happen that it seem quit dull and stupid for life to go on in the common wai so she set to work and veri soon finish off the cake chapter ii the pool of tear curious and curious cri alic she wa so much surpris that for the moment she quit forgot how to speak good english now i m open out like the largest telescop that ever wa goodby feet for when she look down at her feet thei seem to be almost out of sight thei were get so far off oh my poor littl feet i wonder who will put on your shoe and stock for you now dear i m sure i shan t be abl i shall be a great deal too far off to troubl myself about you you must manag the best wai you canbut i must be kind to them thought alic or perhap thei won t walk the wai i want to go let me see i ll give them a new pair of boot everi christma and she went on plan to herself how she would manag it thei must go by the carrier she thought and how funni it ll seem send present to on s own feet and how odd the direct will look alic s right foot esq hearthrug near the fender with alic s love oh dear what nonsens i m talk just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she wa now more than nine feet high and she at onc took up the littl golden kei and hurri off to the garden door poor alic it wa as much as she could do ly down on on side to look through into the garden with on ey but to get through wa more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again you ought to be asham of yourself said alic a great girl like you she might well sai thi to go on cry in thi wai stop thi moment i tell you but she went on all the same shed gallon of tear until there wa

moment she appear but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood the first thing i ve got to do said alic to herself as she wander about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my wai into that love garden i think that will be the best plan it sound an excel plan no doubt and veri neatli and simpli arrang the onli difficulti wa that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she wa peer about anxious among the tree a littl sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurri an enorm puppi wa look down at her with larg round ey and feebli stretch out on paw try to touch her poor littl thing said alic in a coax tone and she tri hard to whistl to it but she wa terribl frighten all the time at the thought that it might be hungri in which case it would be veri like to eat her up in spite of all her coax hardli know what she did she pick up a littl bit of stick and held it out to the puppi whereupon the puppi jump into the air off all it feet at onc with a yelp of delight and rush at the stick and made believ to worri it then alic dodg behind a great thistl to keep herself from be run over and the moment she appear on the other side the puppi made anoth rush at the stick and tumbl head over heel in it hurri to get hold of it then alic think it wa veri like have a game of plai with a carthors and expect everi moment to be trampl under it feet ran round the thistl again then the puppi began a seri of short charg at the stick run a veri littl wai forward each time and a long wai back and bark hoars all the while till at last it sat down a good wai off pant with it tongu hang out of it mouth and it great ey half shut thi seem to alic a good opportun for make her escap so she set off at onc and ran till she wa quit tire and out of breath and till the puppi s bark sound quit faint in the distanc and yet what a dear littl puppi it wa said alic as she leant against a

until it chose to speak again in a minut or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of it mouth and yawn onc or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and crawl awai in the grass mere remark as it went on side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter on side of what the other side of what thought alic to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had ask it aloud and in anoth moment it wa out of sight alic remain look thoughtfulli at the mushroom for a minut try to make out which were the two side of it and as it wa perfectli round she found thi a veri difficult question howev at last she stretch her arm round it as far as thei would go and broke off a bit of the edg with each hand and now which is which she said to herself and nibbl a littl of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot she wa a good deal frighten by thi veri sudden chang but she felt that there wa no time to be lost as she wa shrink rapidli so she set to work at onc to eat some of the other bit her chin wa press so close against her foot that there wa hardli room to open her mouth but she did it at last and manag to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit come my head s free at last said alic in a tone of delight which chang into alarm in anoth moment when she found that her shoulder were nowher to be found all she could see when she look down wa an immens length of neck which seem to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leav that lai far below her what can all that green stuff be said alic and where have my shoulder got to and oh my poor hand how is it i can t see you she wa move them about as she spoke but no result seem to follow except a littl shake among the distant green leav as there seem to be no chanc of get her hand up to her head she tri to get her head down to them and wa delight to find that her neck would bend about easili in ani direct like a serpent she had just succeed in curv it down into a grace zigzag and wa go to dive in among the leav which she found to be noth but the top of the tree under which she had been wander when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurri a larg pigeon had flown into her face and wa beat her violent with it wing serpent scream the pigeon i m not a serpent said alic indignantli let me alon serpent i sai again repeat the pigeon but in a more subdu tone and ad with a kind of sob i ve tri everi wai and noth seem to suit them i haven t the least idea what you re talk about said alic i ve tri the root of tree and i ve tri bank and i ve tri hedg the pigeon went on without attend to her but those serpent there s no pleas them alic wa more and more puzzl but she thought there wa no us in sai anyth more till the pigeon had finish as if it wasn t troubl enough hatch the egg said the pigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpent night and dai why i haven t had a wink of sleep these three week i m veri sorri you ve been annoi said alic who wa begin to see it mean and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continu the pigeon rais it voic to a shriek and just as i wa think i should be free of them at last thei must need come wriggl down from the sky ugh serpent but i m not a serpent i tell you said alic i m ai m a well what ar you said the pigeon i can see you re try to invent someth ii m a littl girl said alic rather doubtfulli as she rememb the number of chang she had gone through that dai a like stori inde said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt i

egg certainli said alic who wa a veri truth child but littl girl eat egg quit as much as serpent do you know i don t believ it said the pigeon but if thei do why then thei re a kind of serpent that s all i can sai thi wa such a new idea to alic that she wa quit silent for a minut or two which gave the pigeon the opportun of ad you re look for egg i know that well enough and what doe it matter to me whether you re a littl girl or a serpent it matter a good deal to me said alic hastili but i m not look for egg as it happen and if i wa i shouldn t want your i don t like them raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulki tone as it settl down again into it nest alic crouch down among the tree as well as she could for her neck kept get entangl among the branch and everi now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she rememb that she still held the piec of mushroom in her hand and she set to work veri carefulli nibbl first at on and then at the other and grow sometim taller and sometim shorter until she had succeed in bring herself down to her usual height it wa so long sinc she had been anyth near the right size that it felt quit strang at first but she got us to it in a few minut and began talk to herself as usual come there s half my plan done now how puzzl all these chang ar i m never sure what i m go to be from on minut to anoth howev i ve got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beauti gardenhow is that to be done i wonder as she said thi she came suddenli upon an open place with a littl hous in it about four feet high whoever live there thought alic it ll never do to come upon them thi size why i should frighten them out of their wit so she began nibbl at the righthand bit again and did not ventur to go near the hous till she had brought herself down to nine inch high chapter vi pig and pepper for a minut or two she stood look at the hous and wonder what to do next when suddenli a footman in liveri came run out of the woodsh consid him to be a footman becaus he wa in liveri otherwis judg by hi face onli she would have call him a fishand rap loudli at the door with hi knuckl it wa open by anoth footman in liveri with a round face and larg ey like a frog and both footmen alic notic had powder hair that curl all over their head she felt veri curiou to know what it wa all about and crept a littl wai out of the wood to listen the fishfootman began by produc from under hi arm a great letter nearli as larg as himself and thi he hand over to the other sai in a solemn tone for the duchess an invit from the queen to plai croquet the frogfootman repeat in the same solemn tone onli chang the order of the word a littl from the queen an invit for the duchess to plai croquet then thei both bow low and their curl got entangl togeth alic laugh so much at thi that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hear her and when she next peep out the fishfootman wa gone and the other wa sit on the ground near the door stare stupidli up into the sky alic went timidli up to the door and knock there s no sort of us in knock said the footman and that for two reason first becaus i m on the same side of the door as you ar secondli becaus thei re make such a nois insid no on could possibl hear you and certainli there wa a most extraordinari nois go on withina constant howl and sneez and everi now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettl had been broken to piec pleas then said alic how am i to get in there might be some sens in your knock the footman went on without attend to her if we had the door between us for instanc if you were insid you might knock and i could let you out you know he wa look up into the sky all the time he wa speak and thi alic thought decidedli uncivil but perhap he can t help it she said to herself hi ey ar so veri nearli at the top of hi head but at ani rate he might answer questionshow am i to get in she repeat aloud i shall sit here the footman remark till tomorrow at thi moment the door of the hous open and a larg plate came skim out straight at the footman s head it just graze hi nose and broke to piec against on of the tree behind him or next dai mayb the footman continu in the same tone exactli as if noth had happen how am i to get in ask alic again in a louder tone ar you to get in at all said the footman that s the first question you know it wa no doubt onli alic did not like to be told so it s realli dread she mutter to herself the wai all the creatur argu it s enough to drive on crazi the footman seem to think thi a good opportun for repeat hi remark with variat i shall sit here he said on and off for dai and dai but what am i to do said alic anyth you like said the footman and began whistl oh there s no us in talk to him said alic desper he s perfectli idiot and she open the door and went in the door led right into a larg kitchen which wa full of smoke from on end to the other the duchess wa sit on a threeleg stool in the middl nurs a babi the cook wa lean over the fire stir a larg cauldron which seem to be full of soup there s certainli too much pepper in that soup alic said to herself as well as she could for sneez there wa certainli too much of it in the air even the duchess sneez occasion and as for the babi it wa sneez and howl altern without a moment s paus the onli thing in the kitchen that did not sneez were the cook and a larg cat which wa sit on the hearth and grin from ear to ear pleas would you tell me said alic a littl timidli for she wa not quit sure whether it wa good manner for her to speak first why your cat grin like that it s a cheshir cat said the duchess and that s why pig she said the last word with such sudden violenc that alic quit jump but she saw in anoth moment that it wa address to the babi and not to her so she took courag and went on again i didn t know that cheshir cat alwai grin in fact i didn t know that cat could grin thei all can said the duchess and most of em do i don t know of ani that do alic said veri polit feel quit pleas to have got into a convers you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact alic did not at all like the tone of thi remark and thought it would be as well to introduc some other subject of convers while she wa try to fix on on the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at onc set to work throw everyth within her reach at the duchess and the babyth fireiron came first then follow a shower of saucepan plate and dish the duchess took no notic of them even when thei hit her and the babi wa howl so much alreadi that it wa quit imposs to sai whether the blow hurt it or not oh pleas mind what you re do cri alic jump up and down in an agoni of terror oh there goe hi preciou nose as an unusu larg saucepan flew close by it and veri nearli carri it off if everybodi mind their own busi the duchess said in a hoars growl the world would go round a deal faster than it doe which would not be an advantag said alic who felt veri glad to get an opportun of show off a littl of her knowledg just think of what work it would make with the dai and night you see the earth take twentyfour hour to turn round on it axi talk of ax said the duchess chop off her head alic glanc rather anxious at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook wa busili stir the soup and seem not to be listen so she went on again twentyfour hour i think or is it twelv i oh don t bother me said the duchess i never could abid figur and with that she began nurs her child again sing a sort of lullabi to it as she did so and give it a violent shake at the end of everi line speak roughli to your littl boi and beat him when he sneez he onli doe it to annoi becaus he know it teas choru in which the cook and the babi join wow wow wow while the duchess sang the second vers of the song she kept toss the babi violent up and down and the poor littl thing howl so that alic could hardli hear the word i speak sever to my boi i beat him when he sneez for he can thoroughli enjoi the pepper when he pleas choru wow wow wow here you mai nurs it a bit if you like the duchess said to alic fling the babi at her as she spoke i must go and get readi to plai croquet with the queen and she hurri out of the room the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out but it just miss her alic caught the babi with some difficulti as it wa a queershap littl creatur and held out it arm and leg in all direct just like a starfish thought alic the poor littl thing wa snort like a steamengin when she caught it and kept doubl itself up and straighten itself out again so that altogeth for the first minut or two it wa as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper wai of nurs it which wa to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of it right ear and left foot so as to prevent it undo itself she carri it out into the open air if i don t take thi child awai with me thought alic thei re sure to kill it in a dai or two wouldn t it be murder to leav it behind she said the last word out loud and the littl thing grunt in repli it had left off sneez by thi time don t grunt said alic that s not at all a proper wai of express yourself the babi grunt again and alic look veri anxious into it face to see what wa the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a veri turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also it ey were get extrem small for a babi altogeth alic did not like the look of the thing at all but perhap it wa onli sob she thought and look into it ey again to see if there were ani tear no there were no tear if you re go to turn into a pig my dear said alic serious i ll have noth more to do with you mind now the poor littl thing sob again or grunt it wa imposs to sai which and thei went on for some while in silenc alic wa just begin to think to herself now what am i to do with thi creatur when i get it home when it grunt again so violent that she look down into it face in some alarm thi time there could be no mistak about it it wa neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quit absurd for her to carri it further so she set the littl creatur down and felt quit reliev to see it trot awai quietli into the wood if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfulli ugli child but it make rather a handsom pig i think and she began think over other children she knew who might do veri well as pig and wa just sai to herself if on onli knew the right wai to chang them when she wa a littl startl by see the cheshir cat sit on a bough of a tree a few yard off the cat onli grin when it saw alic it look goodnatur she thought still it had veri long claw and a great mani teeth so she felt that it ought to be treat with respect cheshir puss she began rather timidli as she did not at all know whether it would like the name howev it onli grin a littl wider come it s pleas so far thought alic and she went on would you tell me pleas which wai i ought to go from here that depend a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat i don t much care where said alic then it doesn t matter which wai you go said the cat so long as i get somewher alic ad as an explan oh you re sure to do that said the cat if you onli walk long enough alic felt that thi could not be deni so she tri anoth question what sort of peopl live about here in that direct the cat said wave it right paw round live a hatter and in that direct wave the other paw live a march hare visit either you like thei re both mad but i don t want to go

alic quietli said just as if it had come back in a natur wai i thought it would said the cat and vanish again alic wait a littl half expect to see it again but it did not appear and after a minut or two she walk on in the direct in which the march hare wa said to live i ve seen hatter befor she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interest and perhap as thi is mai it won t be rave madat least not so mad as it wa in march as she said thi she look up and there wa the cat again sit on a branch of a tree did you sai pig or fig said the cat i said pig repli alic and i wish you

after the rest of it had gone well i ve often seen a cat without a grin thought alic but a grin without a cat it s the most curiou thing i ever saw in my life she had not gone much farther befor she came in sight of the hous of the march hare she thought it must be the right hous becaus the chimnei were shape like ear and the roof wa thatch with fur it wa so larg a hous that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbl some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and rais herself to about two feet high even then she walk up toward it rather timidli sai to herself suppos it should be rave

queen in a voic of thunder and peopl began run about in all direct tumbl up against each other howev thei got settl down in a minut or two and the game began alic thought she had never seen such a curiou croquetground in her life it wa all ridg and furrow the ball were live hedgehog the mallet live flamingo and the soldier had to doubl themselv up and to stand on their hand and feet to make the arch the chief difficulti alic found at first wa in manag her flamingo she succeed in get it bodi tuck awai comfort enough under her arm with it leg hang down but gener just as she had got it neck nice straighten out and wa go to give the hedgehog a blow with it head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzl express that she could not help burst out laugh and when she had got it head down and wa go to begin again it wa veri provok to find that the hedgehog had unrol itself and wa in the act of crawl awai besid all thi there wa gener a ridg or furrow in the wai wherev she want to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldier were alwai get up and walk off to other part of the ground alic soon came to the conclus that it wa a veri difficult game inde the player all plai at onc without wait for turn quarrel all the while and fight for the hedgehog and in a veri short time the queen wa in a furiou passion and went stamp about and shout off with hi head or off with her head about onc in a minut alic began to feel veri uneasi to be sure she had not as yet had ani disput with the queen but she knew that it might happen ani minut and then thought she what would becom of me thei re dreadfulli fond of behead peopl here the great wonder is that there s ani on left aliv she wa look about for some wai of escap and wonder whether she could get awai without be seen when she notic a curiou appear in the air it puzzl her veri much at first but after watch it a minut or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself it s the cheshir cat now i shall have somebodi to talk to how ar you get on said the cat as soon as there wa mouth enough for it to speak with alic wait till the ey appear and then nod it s no us speak to it she thought till it ear have come or at least on of them in anoth minut the whole head appear and then alic put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feel veri glad she had someon to listen to her the cat seem to think that there wa enough of it now in sight and no more of it appear i don t think thei plai at all fairli alic began in rather a complain tone and thei all quarrel so dreadfulli on can t hear oneself speakand thei don t seem to have ani rule in particular at least if there ar nobodi attend to themand you ve no idea how confus it is all the thing be aliv for instanc there s the arch i ve got to go through next walk about at the other end of the groundand i should have croquet the queen s hedgehog just now onli it ran awai when it saw mine come how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voic not at all said alic she s so extrem just then she notic that the queen wa close behind her listen so she went on like to win that it s hardli worth while finish the game the queen smile and pass on who ar you talk to said the king go up to alic and look at the cat s head with great curios it s a friend of minea cheshir cat said alic allow me to introduc it i don t like the look of it at all said the king howev it mai kiss my hand if it like i d rather not the cat remark don t be impertin said the king and don t look at me like that he got behind alic as he spoke a cat mai look at a king said alic i ve read that in some book but i don t rememb where well it must be remov said the king veri decidedli and he call the queen who wa pass at the moment my dear i wish you would have thi cat remov the queen had onli on wai of settl all difficulti great or small off with hi head she said without even look round i ll fetch the execution myself said the king eagerli and he hurri off alic thought she might as well go back and see how the game wa go on as she heard the queen s voic in the distanc scream with passion she had alreadi heard her sentenc three of the player to be execut for have miss their turn and she did not like the look of thing at all as the game wa in such confus that she never knew whether it wa her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog wa engag in a fight with anoth hedgehog which seem to alic an excel opportun for croquet on of them with the other the onli difficulti wa that her flamingo wa gone across to the other side of the garden where alic could see it try in a helpless sort of wai to fly up into a tree by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight wa over and both the hedgehog were out of sight but it doesn t matter much thought alic as all the arch ar gone from thi side of the ground so she tuck it awai under her arm that it might not escap again and went back for a littl more convers with her friend when she got back to the cheshir cat she wa surpris to find quit a larg crowd collect round it there wa a disput go on between the execution the king and the queen who were all talk at onc while all the rest were quit silent and look veri uncomfort the moment alic appear she wa appeal to by all three to settl the question and thei repeat their argument to her though as thei all spoke at onc she found it veri hard inde to make out exactli what thei said the execution s argument wa that you couldn t cut off a head unless there wa a bodi to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing befor and he wasn t go to begin at hi time of life the king s argument wa that anyth that had a head could be behead and that you weren t to talk nonsens the queen s argument wa that if someth wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybodi execut all round it wa thi last remark that had made the whole parti look so grave and anxiou alic could think of noth els to sai but it belong to the duchess you d better ask her about it she s in prison the queen said to the execution fetch her here and the execution went off like an arrow the cat s head began fade awai the moment he wa gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entir disappear so the king and the execution ran wildli up and down look for it while the rest of the parti went back to the game chapter ix the mock turtl s stori you can t think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tuck her arm affection into alic s and thei walk off togeth alic wa veri glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhap it wa onli the pepper that had made her so savag when thei met in the kitchen when i m a duchess she said to herself not in a veri hope tone though i won t have ani pepper in my kitchen at all soup doe veri well withoutmayb it s alwai pepper that make peopl hottemp she went on veri much pleas at have found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that make them sourand camomil that make them bitterandand barleysugar and such thing that make children sweettemp i onli wish peopl knew that then thei wouldn t be so stingi about it you know she had quit forgotten the duchess by thi time and wa a littl startl when she heard her voic close to her ear you re think about someth my dear and that make you forget to talk i can t tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall rememb it in a bit perhap it hasn t on alic ventur to remark tut tut child said the duchess everyth s got a moral if onli you can find it and she squeez herself up closer to alic s side as she spoke alic did not much like keep so close to her first becaus the duchess wa veri ugli and secondli becaus she wa exactli the right height to rest her chin upon alic s shoulder and it wa an uncomfort sharp chin howev she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could the game s go on rather better now she said by wai of keep up the convers a littl ti so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh ti love ti love that make the world go round somebodi said alic whisper that it s done by everybodi mind their own busi ah well it mean much the same thing said the duchess dig her sharp littl chin into alic s shoulder as she ad and the moral of that is take care of the sens and the sound will take care of themselv how fond she is of find moral in thing alic thought to herself i dare sai you re wonder why i don t put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a paus the reason is that i m doubt about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experi he might bite alic cautious repli not feel at all anxiou to have the experi tri veri true said the duchess flamingo and mustard both bite and the moral of that is bird of a feather flock togeth onli mustard isn t a bird alic remark right as usual said the duchess what a clear wai you have of put thing it s a miner i think said alic of cours it is said the duchess who seem readi to agre to everyth that alic said there s a larg mustardmin near here and the moral of that is the more there is of mine the less there is of your oh i know exclaim alic who had not attend to thi last remark it s a veget it doesn t look like on but it is i quit agre with you said the duchess and the moral of that is be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more simpli never imagin yourself not to be otherwis than what it might appear to other that what you were or might have been wa not otherwis than what you had been would have appear to them to be otherwis i think i should understand that better alic said veri polit if i had it written down but i can t quit follow it as you sai it that s noth to what i could sai if i chose the duchess repli in a pleas tone prai don t troubl yourself to sai it ani longer than that said alic oh don t talk about troubl said the duchess i make you a present of everyth i ve said as yet a cheap sort of present thought alic i m glad thei don t give birthdai present like that but she did not ventur to sai it out loud think again the duchess ask with anoth dig of her sharp littl chin i ve a right to think said alic sharpli for she wa begin to feel a littl worri just about as much right said the duchess as pig have to fly and the m but here to alic s great surpris the duchess s voic di
