which on seldom find nowadai among our old men of twenti and particularli he is so frank and ha so much heart he is so pure and poetic that my relat with him transient as thei were have been on of the sweetest comfort to my poor heart which ha alreadi suffer so much somedai i will tell you about our part and all that wa said then that is still too fresh ah dear friend you ar happi not to know these poignant joi and sorrow you ar fortun for the latter ar gener the stronger i know veri well that count nichola is too young ever to be more to me than a friend but thi sweet friendship thi poetic and pure intimaci were what my heart need but enough of thi the chief new about which all moscow gossip is the death of old count bez khov and hi inherit fanci the three princess have receiv veri littl princ va li noth and it is monsieur pierr who ha inherit all the properti and ha besid been recogn as legitim so that he is now count bez khov and possessor of the finest fortun in russia it is rumor that princ va li plai a veri despic part in thi affair and that he return to petersburg quit crestfallen i confess i understand veri littl about all these matter of will and inherit but i do know that sinc thi young man whom we all us to know as plain monsieur pierr ha becom count bez khov and the owner of on of the largest fortun in russia i am much amus to watch the chang in the tone and manner of the mamma burden by marriag daughter and of the young ladi themselv toward him though between you and me he alwai seem to me a poor sort of fellow as for the past two year peopl have amus themselv by find husband for me most of whom i don t even know the matchmak chronicl of moscow now speak of me as the futur countess bez khova but you will understand that i have no desir for the post propo of marriag do you know that a while ago that univers aunti anna mikh ylovna told me under the seal of strict secreci of a plan of marriag for you it is neither more nor less than with princ va li s son

if never have felt them i cannot approv of them neither do i condemn them onli it seem to me that christian love love of on s neighbor love of on s enemi is worthier sweeter and better than the feel

thousand thank dear friend for the volum you have sent me and which ha such success in moscow yet sinc you tell me that among some good thing it contain other which our weak human understand cannot

chapter xiv on novemb kut zov had receiv through a spy new that the armi he command wa in an almost hopeless posit the spy report that the french after cross the bridg at vienna were advanc in immens forc upon kut zov s line of commun with the troop that were arriv from russia if kut zov decid to remain at krem napoleon s armi of on hundr and fifti thousand men would cut him off complet and surround hi exhaust armi of forti thousand and he would find himself in the posit of mack at ulm if kut zov decid to abandon the road connect him with the troop arriv from russia he would have to march with no road into unknown part of the bohemian mountain defend himself against superior forc of the enemi and abandon all hope of a junction with buxh wden if kut zov decid to retreat along the road from krem to olm tz to unit with the troop arriv from russia he risk be forestal on that road by the french who had cross the vienna bridg and encumb by hi baggag and transport have to accept battl on the march against an enemi three time as strong who would hem him in from two side kut zov chose thi latter cours the french the spy report have cross the vienna bridg were advanc by forc march toward znaim which lai sixtysix mile off on the line of kut zov s retreat if he reach znaim befor the french there would be great hope of save the armi to let the french forestal him at znaim meant the exposur of hi whole armi to a disgrac such as that of ulm or to utter destruct but to forestal the french with hi whole armi wa imposs the road for the french from vienna to znaim wa shorter

znaim henc bagrati n with hi four thousand hungri exhaust men would have to detain for dai the whole enemi armi that came upon him at hollabr nn which wa clearli imposs but a freak of fate made the imposs possibl the success of the trick that had place the vienna bridg in the hand of the french without a fight led murat to try to deceiv kut zov in a similar wai meet bagrati n s weak detach on the znaim road he suppos it to be kut zov s whole armi to be abl to crush it absolut he await the arriv of the rest of the troop who were on their wai from vienna and with thi object offer a three dai

and hungri detach which alon cover thi movement of the transport and of the whole armi had to remain stationari in face of an enemi eight time as strong as itself kut zov s expect that the propos of

with all hi might feel that he would like to injur himself by that shout if onli to express hi raptur fulli the tsar stop a few minut in front of the hussar as if undecid how can the emperor be undecid thought rost v but then even thi indecis appear to him majest and enchant like everyth els the tsar did that hesit last onli an instant the tsar s foot in the narrow point boot then fashion

anoth and the revolv pullei whirr with the rapid of their movement but a neighbor wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepar to remain so for a hundr year but the moment come when the lever catch it and obei the impuls that wheel begin to creak and join in the common motion the result and aim of which ar beyond it ken just as in a clock the result of the complic motion of innumer

outburst of pride fear and enthusiasm wa onli the loss of the battl of austerlitz the socal battl of the three emperor that is to sai a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human histori princ andrew wa on duti that dai and in constant attend on the command in chief at six in the even kut zov went to the emperor s headquart and after stai but a short time with the tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court count tolst y bolk nski took the opportun to go in to get some detail of the come action from dolgor kov he felt that kut zov wa upset and dissatisfi about someth and that at headquart thei were dissatisfi with him and also that at the emperor s headquart everyon adopt toward him the tone of men who know someth other do not know he therefor wish to speak to dolgor kov well how d you do my dear fellow said dolgor kov who wa sit at tea with bil bin the fete is for tomorrow how is your old fellow out of sort i won t sai he is out of sort but i fanci he would like to be

said princ andrew well what is bonapart like how did he impress you ye i saw him and am convinc that he fear noth so much as a gener engag repeat dolgor kov evid prize thi gener conclus which he had arriv at from hi interview with napoleon if he weren t afraid of a battl why did he ask for that interview why negoti and abov all why retreat when to retreat is so contrari to hi method of conduct

we should be a nice set of fellow if we were to wait about and so give him a chanc to escap or to trick us now that we certainli have him in our hand no we mustn t forget suv rov and hi rule not to put yourself in a posit to be attack but yourself to attack believ me in war the energi of young men often show the wai better than all the experi of old cunctat but in what posit ar we go to attack him i have been at the outpost todai and it is imposs to sai where hi chief forc ar situat said princ andrew he wish to explain to dolgor kov a plan of attack he had himself form oh that is all the same dolgor kov said quickli and get up he spread a map on the tabl all eventu have been foreseen if he is stand befor br nn and princ dolgor kov rapidli but indistinctli explain weyroth s plan of a flank movement princ andrew began to repli and to state hi own plan which might have been as good as weyroth s but for the disadvantag that weyroth s had alreadi been approv as soon as princ andrew began to demonstr the defect of the latter and the merit of hi own plan princ dolgor kov ceas to listen to him and gaze absentmindedli not at the map but at princ andrew s face there will be a council of war at kut zov s tonight though you can sai all thi there remark dolgor kov i will do so said princ andrew move awai from the map whatev ar you bother about gentlemen said bil bin who till then had

sit silent besid him what he thought of tomorrow s battl kut zov look sternli at hi adjut and after a paus repli i think the battl will be lost and so i told count tolst y and ask him to tell the emperor what do you think he repli but my dear gener i am engag with rice and cutlet look after militari matter yourself ye that wa the answer i got chapter xii shortli after nine o clock that even weyroth drove with hi plan to kut zov s quarter where the council of war wa to be held all the command of column were summon to the command in chief s and with the except of princ bagrati n who declin to come were all there at the appoint time weyroth who wa in full control of the propos battl by hi eager and brisk present a mark contrast to the dissatisfi and drowsi kut zov who reluctantli plai the part of chairman and presid of the council of war weyroth evid felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had alreadi becom unrestrain he wa like a hors run downhil har to a heavi cart whether he wa pull it or be push by it he did not know but rush along at headlong speed with no time to consid what thi movement might lead to weyroth had been twice that even to the enemi s picket line to reconnoit person and twice to the emperor russian and austrian to report and explain and to hi headquart where he had dictat the disposit in german and now much exhaust he arriv at kut zov s he wa evid so busi that he even forgot to be polit to the command in chief he interrupt him talk rapidli and indistinctli without look at the man he wa address and did not repli to question put to him he wa bespatt with mud and had a piti weari and distract air though at the same time he wa haughti and selfconfid kut zov wa occupi a nobleman s castl of modest dimens near ostralitz in the larg draw room which had becom the command in chief s offic were gather kut zov himself weyroth and the member of the council of war thei were drink tea and onli await princ bagrati n to begin the council at last bagrati n s orderli came with the new that the princ could not attend princ andrew came in to inform the command in chief of thi and avail himself of permiss previous given him by kut zov to be present at the council he remain in the room sinc princ bagrati n is not come we mai begin said weyroth hurriedli rise from hi seat and go up to the tabl on which an enorm map of the environ of br nn wa spread out kut zov with hi uniform unbutton so that hi fat neck bulg over hi collar as if escap wa sit almost asleep in a low chair with hi podgi old hand rest symmetr on it arm at the sound of weyroth s voic he open hi on ey with an effort ye ye if you pleas it is alreadi late said he and nod hi head he let it droop and again close hi ey if at first the member of the council thought that kut zov wa pretend to sleep the sound hi nose emit dure the read that follow prove that the command in chief at that moment wa absorb by a far more seriou matter than a desir to show hi contempt for the disposit or anyth els he wa engag in satisfi the irresist human need for sleep he realli wa asleep weyroth with the gestur of a man too busi to lose a moment glanc at kut zov and have convinc himself that he wa asleep took up a paper and in a loud monoton voic began to read out the disposit for the impend battl under a head which he also read out disposit for an attack on the enemi posit behind kobelnitz and sokolnitz novemb the disposit were veri complic and difficult thei began as follow as the enemi s left wing rest on wood hill and hi right extend along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the pond that ar there while we on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank hi right it is advantag to attack the enemi s latter wing especi if we occupi the villag of sokolnitz and kobelnitz wherebi we can both fall on hi flank and pursu him over the plain between schlappanitz and the thuerassa forest avoid the defil of schlappanitz and bellowitz which cover the enemi s front for thi object it is necessari that the first column march the second column march the third column march and so on read weyroth the gener seem to listen reluctantli to the difficult disposit the tall fairhair gener buxh wden stood lean hi back against the wall hi ey fix on a burn candl and seem not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen exactli opposit weyroth with hi glisten wideopen ey fix upon him and hi mustach twist upward sat the ruddi milor dovich in a militari pose hi elbow turn outward hi hand on hi knee and hi shoulder rais he remain stubbornli silent gaze at weyroth s face and onli turn awai hi ey when the austrian chief of staff finish read then milor dovich look round significantli at the other gener but on could not tell from that signific look whether he agre or disagre and wa satisfi or not with the arrang next to weyroth sat count langeron who with a subtl smile that never left hi typic southern french face dure the whole time of the read gaze at hi delic finger which rapidli twirl by it corner a gold snuffbox on which wa a portrait in the middl of on of the longest sentenc he stop the rotari motion of the snuffbox rais hi head and with inim polit lurk in the corner of hi thin lip interrupt weyroth wish to sai someth but the austrian gener continu to read frown angrili and jerk hi elbow as if to sai you can tell me your view later but now be so good as to look at the map and listen langeron lift hi ey with an express of perplex turn round to milor dovich as if seek an explan but meet the latter s impress but meaningless gaze droop hi ey sadli and again took to twirl hi snuffbox a geographi lesson he mutter as if to himself but loud enough to be heard przebysz wski with respect but dignifi polit held hi hand to hi ear toward weyroth with the air of a man absorb in attent dohkt rov a littl man sat opposit weyroth with an assidu and modest mien and stoop over the outspread map conscienti studi the disposit and the unfamiliar local he ask weyroth sever time to repeat word he had not clearli heard and the difficult name of villag weyroth compli and dohkt rov note them down when the read which last more than an hour wa over langeron again brought hi snuffbox to rest and without look at weyroth or at anyon in particular began to sai how difficult it wa to carri out such a plan in which the enemi s posit wa assum to be known wherea it wa perhap not known sinc the enemi wa in movement langeron s object were valid but it wa obviou that their chief aim wa to show gener weyroth who had read hi disposit with as much selfconfid as if he were address school children that he had to do not with fool but with men who could teach him someth in militari matter when the monoton sound of weyroth s voic ceas kut zov open hi ey as a miller wake up when the soporif drone of the mill wheel is interrupt he listen to what langeron said as if remark so you ar still at that silli busi quickli close hi ey again and let hi head sink still lower langeron try as virul as possibl to sting weyroth s vaniti as author of the militari plan argu that bonapart might easili attack instead of be attack and so render the whole of thi plan perfectli worthless weyroth met all object with a firm and contemptu smile evid prepar beforehand to meet all object be thei what thei might if he could attack us he would have done so todai said he so you think he is powerless said langeron he ha forti thousand men at most repli weyroth with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wish to explain the treatment of a case in that case he is invit hi doom by await our attack said langeron with a subtli iron smile again glanc round for support to milor dovich who wa near him but milor dovich wa at that moment evid think of anyth rather than of what the gener were disput about ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield weyroth again gave that smile which seem to sai that to him it wa strang and ridicul to meet object from russian gener and to have to prove to them what he had not mere convinc himself of but had also convinc the sovereign emperor of the enemi ha quench hi fire and a continu nois is heard from hi camp said he what doe that mean either he is retreat which is the onli thing we need fear or he is chang hi posit he smile iron but even if he also took up a posit in the thuerassa he mere save us a great deal of troubl and all our arrang to the minutest detail remain the same how is that began princ andrew who had for long been wait an opportun to express hi doubt kut zov here woke up cough heavili and look round at the gener gentlemen the disposit for tomorrow or rather for todai for it is past midnight cannot now be alter said he you have heard them and we shall all do our duti but befor a battl there is noth more import he paus than to have a good sleep he move as if to rise the gener bow and retir it wa past midnight princ andrew went out the council of war at which princ andrew had not been abl to express hi opinion as he had hope to left on him a vagu and uneasi impress whether dolgor kov and weyroth or kut zov langeron and the other who did not approv of the plan of attack were right he did not know but wa it realli not possibl for kut zov to state hi view plainli to the emperor is it possibl that on account of court and person consider ten of thousand of live and my life my life he thought must be risk ye it is veri like that i shall be kill tomorrow he thought and suddenli at thi thought of death a whole seri of most distant most intim memori rose in hi imagin he rememb hi last part from hi father and hi wife he rememb the dai when he first love her he thought of her pregnanc and felt sorri for her and for himself and in a nervous emot and soften mood he went out of the hut in which he wa billet with nesv tski and began to walk up and down befor it the night wa foggi and through the fog the moonlight gleam mysteri ye tomorrow

shout in the enemi s armi were occas by the fact that while napoleon s proclam wa be read to the troop the emperor himself rode round hi bivouac the soldier on see him lit wisp of straw and ran after him shout vive l empereur napoleon s proclam wa as follow soldier the russian armi is advanc against you to aveng the austrian armi of ulm thei ar the same battalion you broke at hollabr nn and have pursu ever sinc to thi place the posit we occupi is a strong on and while thei ar march to go round me on the right thei will expos a flank to me soldier i will myself direct your battalion i will keep out of fire if you with your habitu valor carri disord and confus into the enemi s rank but should victori be in doubt even for a moment you will see your emperor expos himself to the first blow of the enemi for there must be no doubt of victori especi on thi dai when what is at stake is the honor of the french infantri so necessari to the honor of our nation do not break your rank on the plea of remov the wound let everi man be fulli imbu with the thought that we must defeat these hirel of england inspir by such hatr of our nation thi victori will conclud our campaign and we can return to winter quarter where fresh french troop who ar be rais in franc will join us and the peac i shall conclud will be worthi of my peopl of you and of myself napoleon chapter xiv at five in the morn it wa still quit dark the troop of the center the reserv and bagrati n s right flank had not yet move but on the left flank the column of infantri cavalri and artilleri which were to be the first to descend the height to attack the french right flank and drive it into the bohemian mountain accord to plan were alreadi up and astir the smoke of the campfir into which thei were throw everyth superflu made the ey smart it wa cold and dark the offic were hurriedli drink tea and breakfast the soldier munch biscuit and beat a tattoo with their feet to warm themselv gather round the fire throw into the flame the remain of shed chair tabl wheel tub and everyth that thei did not want or could not carri awai with them austrian column guid were move in and out among the russian troop and serv as herald of the advanc as soon as an austrian offic show himself near a command offic s quarter the regiment began to move the soldier ran from the fire thrust their pipe into their boot their bag into the cart got their musket readi and form rank the offic button up their coat buckl on their sword and pouch and move along the rank shout the train driver and orderli har and pack the wagon and ti on the load the adjut and battalion and regiment command mount cross themselv gave final instruct order and commiss to the baggag men who remain behind and the monoton tramp of thousand of feet resound the column move forward without know where and unabl from the mass around them the smoke and the increas fog to see either the place thei were leav or that to which thei were go a soldier on the march is hem in and born along by hi regiment as much as a sailor is by hi ship howev far he ha walk whatev strang unknown and danger place he reach just as a sailor is alwai surround by the same deck mast and rig of hi ship so the soldier alwai ha around him the same comrad the same rank the same sergeant major iv n m trich the same compani dog jack and the same command the sailor rare care to know the latitud in which hi ship is sail but on the dai of battl heaven know how and whenc a stern note of which all ar consciou sound in the moral atmospher of an armi announc the approach of someth decis and solemn and awaken in the men an unusu curios on the dai of battl the soldier excitedli try to get beyond the interest of their regiment thei listen intent look about and eagerli ask concern what is go on around them the fog had grown so dens that though it wa grow light thei could not see ten pace ahead bush look like gigant tree and level ground like cliff and slope anywher on ani side on might encount an enemi invis ten pace off but the column advanc for a long time alwai in the same fog descend and ascend hill avoid garden and enclosur go over new and unknown ground and nowher encount the enemi on the contrari the soldier becam awar that in front behind and on all side other russian column were move in the same direct everi soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he wa go mani more of our men were go too there now the k rski have also gone past wa be said in the rank it s wonder what a lot of our troop have gather lad last night i look at the campfir and there wa no end of them a regular moscow though none of the column command rode up to the rank or talk to the men the command as we saw at the council of war were out of humor and dissatisfi with the affair and so did not exert themselv to cheer the men but mere carri out the order yet the troop march gaili as thei alwai do when go into action especi to an attack but when thei had march for about an hour in the dens fog the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleas conscious of some disloc and blunder spread through the rank how such a conscious is commun is veri difficult to defin but it certainli is commun veri sure and flow rapidli impercept and irrepress as water doe in a creek had the russian armi been alon without ani alli it might perhap have been a long time befor thi conscious of mismanag becam a gener convict but as it wa the disord wa readili and natur attribut to the stupid german and everyon wa convinc that a danger muddl had been occas by the sausag eater why have we stop is the wai block or have we alreadi come up against the french no on can t hear them thei d be fire if we had thei were in a hurri enough to start us and now here we stand in the middl of a field without rhyme or reason it s all those damn german muddl what stupid devil ye i d send them on in front but no fear thei re crowd up behind and now here we stand hungri i sai shall we soon be clear thei sai the cavalri ar block the wai said an offic ah those damn german thei don t know their own countri said anoth what divis ar you shout an adjut ride up the eighteenth then why ar you here you should have gone on long ago now you won t get there till even what stupid order thei don t themselv know what thei ar do said the offic and rode off then a gener rode past shout someth angrili not in russian tafalafa but what he s jabber no on can make out said a soldier mimick the gener who had ridden awai i d shoot them the scoundrel we were order to be at the place befor nine but we haven t got halfwai fine order wa be repeat on differ side and the feel of energi with which the troop had start began to turn into vexat and anger at the stupid arrang and at the german the caus of the confus wa that while the austrian cavalri wa move toward our left flank the higher command found that our center wa too far separ from our right flank and the cavalri were all order to turn back to the right sever thousand cavalri cross in front of the infantri who had to wait at the front an alterc occur between an austrian guid and a russian gener the gener shout a demand that the cavalri should be halt the austrian argu that not he but the higher command wa to blame the troop meanwhil stood grow listless and dispirit after an hour s delai thei at last move on descend the hill the fog that wa dispers on the hill lai still more dens below where thei were descend in front in the fog a shot wa heard and then anoth at first irregularli at vari interv tratatat and then more and more regularli and rapidli and the action at the goldbach stream began not expect to come on the enemi down by the stream and have stumbl on him in the fog hear no encourag word from their command and with a conscious of be too late spread through the rank and abov all be unabl to see anyth in front or around them in the thick fog the russian exchang shot with the enemi lazili and advanc and again halt receiv no time order from the offic or adjut who wander about in the fog in those unknown surround unabl to find their own regiment in thi wai the action began for the first second and third column which had gone down into the vallei the fourth column with which kut zov wa stood on the pratzen height below where the fight wa begin there wa still thick fog on the higher ground it wa clear but noth could be seen of what wa go on in front whether all the enemi forc were as we suppos six mile awai or whether thei were near by in that sea of mist no on knew till after eight o clock it wa nine o clock in the morn the fog lai unbroken like a sea down below but higher up at the villag of schlappanitz where napoleon stood with hi marshal around him it wa quit light abov him wa a clear blue sky and the sun s vast orb quiver like a huge hollow crimson float on the surfac of that milki sea of mist the whole french armi and even napoleon himself with hi staff were not on the far side of the stream and hollow of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we intend to take up our posit and begin the action but were on thi side so close to our own forc that napoleon with the nake ey could distinguish a mount man from on on foot napoleon in the blue cloak which he had worn on hi italian campaign sat on hi small grai arab hors a littl in front of hi marshal he gaze silent at the hill which seem to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian troop were move in the distanc and he listen to the sound of fire in the vallei not a singl muscl of hi face which in those dai wa still thin move hi gleam ey were fix intent on on spot hi predict were be justifi part of the russian forc had alreadi descend into the vallei toward the pond and lake and part were leav these pratzen height which he intend to attack and regard as the kei to the posit he saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hill near the villag of pratzen the russian column their bayonet glitter were move continu in on direct toward the vallei and disappear on after anoth into the mist from inform he had receiv the even befor from the sound of wheel and footstep heard by the outpost dure the night by the disorderli movement of the russian column and from all indic he saw clearli that the alli believ him to be far awai in front of them and that the column move near pratzen constitut the center of the russian armi and that that center wa alreadi suffici weaken to be successfulli attack but still he did not begin the engag todai wa a great dai for him the anniversari of hi coron befor dawn he had slept for a few hour and refresh vigor and in good spirit he mount hi hors and rode out into the field in that happi mood in which everyth seem possibl and everyth succe he sat motionless look at the height visibl abov the mist and hi cold face wore that special look of confid selfcomplac happi that on see on the face of a boi happili in love the marshal stood behind him not ventur to distract hi attent he look now at the pratzen height now at the sun float up out of the mist when the sun had entir emerg from the fog and field and mist were aglow with dazzl light as if he had onli await thi to begin the action he drew the glove from hi shape white hand made a sign with it to the marshal and order the action to begin the marshal accompani by adjut gallop off in differ direct and a few minut later the chief forc of the french armi move rapidli toward those pratzen height which were be more and more denud by russian troop move down the vallei to their left

in front of him and behind our troop where he could never have expect the enemi to be what can it be he thought the enemi in the rear of our armi imposs and suddenli he wa seiz by a panic of fear for himself and for the issu of the whole battl but be that what it mai he reflect there is no ride round it now i must look for the command in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest the forebod of evil that had suddenli come over rost v wa more and more confirm the farther he rode into the region behind the villag of pratzen which wa full of troop of all kind what doe it

headquart i have certainli acquir a tast for war and it is just as well for me what i have seen dure these last three month is incred i begin ab ovo the enemi of the human race as you know attack the prussian the prussian ar our faith alli who have onli betrai us three time in three year we take up their caus but it turn out that the enemi of the human race pai no heed to our fine speech and in hi rude and savag wai throw himself on the prussian without give them time to finish the parad thei had begun and in two twist of the hand he break them to smithereen and instal himself in the palac at potsdam i most ardent desir write the king of prussia to bonapart that your majesti should be receiv and treat in my palac in a manner agreeabl to yourself and in so far as circumst allow i have hasten to take all step to that end mai i have succeed the prussian gener pride themselv on be polit to the french and lai down their arm at the first demand the head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men ask the king of prussia what he is to do if he is summon to surrend all thi is absolut true in short hope to settl matter by take up a warlik attitud it turn out that we have land ourselv in war and what is more in war on our own frontier with and for the king of prussia we have everyth in perfect order onli on littl thing is lack name a command in chief as it wa consid that the austerlitz success might have been more decis had the command in chief not been so young all our octogenarian were review and of prozor vski and k menski the latter wa prefer the gener come to us suv rovlik in a kib tka and is receiv with acclam of joi and triumph on the th the first courier arriv from petersburg the mail ar taken to the field marshal s room for he like to do everyth himself i am call in to help sort the letter and take those meant for us the field marshal look on and wait for letter address to him we search but none ar to be found the field marshal grow impati and set to work himself and find letter from the emperor to count t princ v and other then he burst into on of hi wild furi and rage at everyon and everyth seiz the letter open them and read those from the emperor address to other ah so that s the wai thei treat me no confid in me ah order to keep an ey on me veri well then get along with you so he write the famou order of the dai to gener bennigsen i am wound and cannot ride and consequ cannot command the armi you have brought your armi corp to pult sk rout here it is expos and without fuel or forag so someth must be done and as you yourself report to count buxh wden yesterdai you must think of retreat to our frontier which do todai from all my ride he write to the emperor i have got a saddl sore which come after all my previou journei quit prevent my ride and command so vast an armi so i have pass on the command to the gener next in senior count buxh wden have sent him my whole staff and all that belong to it advis him if there is a lack of bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for onli on dai s ration of bread remain and in some regiment none at all as report by the divis command ostermann and sedmor tzki and all that the peasant had ha been eaten up i myself will remain in hospit at ostrolenka till i recov in regard to which i humbl submit my report with the inform that if the armi remain in it present bivouac anoth fortnight there will not be a healthi man left in it by spring grant leav to retir to hi countri seat to an old man who is alreadi in ani case dishonor by be unabl to fulfil the great and gloriou task for which he wa chosen i shall await your most graciou permiss here in hospit that i mai not have to plai the part of a secretari rather than command in the armi my remov from the armi doe not produc the slightest stir a blind man ha left it there ar thousand such as i in russia the field marshal is angri with the emperor and he punish us all isn t it logic thi is the first act those that follow ar natur increasingli interest and entertain after the field marshal s departur it appear that we ar within sight of the enemi and must give battl buxh wden is command in chief by senior but gener bennigsen doe not quit see it more particularli as it is he and hi corp who ar within sight of the enemi and he wish to profit by the opportun to fight a battl on hi own hand as the german sai he doe so thi is the battl of pult sk which is consid a great victori but in my opinion wa noth of the kind we civilian as you know have a veri bad wai of decid whether a battl wa won or lost those who retreat after a battl have lost it is what we sai and accord to that it is we who lost the battl of pult sk in short we retreat after the battl but send a courier to petersburg with new of a victori and gener bennigsen hope to receiv from petersburg the post of command in chief as a reward for hi victori doe not give up the command of the armi to gener buxh wden dure thi interregnum we begin a veri origin and interest seri of maneuv our aim is no longer as it should be to avoid or attack the enemi but sole to avoid gener buxh wden who by right of senior should be our chief so energet do we pursu thi aim that after cross an unford river we burn the bridg to separ ourselv from our enemi who at the moment is not bonapart but buxh wden gener buxh wden wa all but attack and captur by a superior enemi forc as a result of on of these maneuv that enabl us to escap him buxh wden pursu us we scuttl he hardli cross the river to our side befor we recross to the other at last our enemi buxh wden catch us and attack both gener ar angri and the result is a challeng on buxh wden s part and an epilept fit on bennigsen s but at the critic moment the courier who carri the new of our victori at pult sk to petersburg return bring our appoint as command in chief and our first foe buxh wden is vanquish we can now turn our thought to the second bonapart but as it turn out just at that moment a third enemi rise befor us name the orthodox russian soldier loudli demand bread meat biscuit fodder and whatnot the store ar empti the road impass the orthodox begin loot and in a wai of which our last campaign can give you no idea half the regiment form band and scour the countrysid and put everyth to fire and sword the inhabit ar total ruin the hospit overflow with sick and famin is everywher twice the maraud even attack our headquart and the command in chief ha to ask for a battalion to dispers them dure on of these attack thei carri off my empti portmanteau and my dress gown the emperor propos to give all command of divis the right to shoot maraud but i much fear thi will oblig on half the armi to shoot the other at first princ andrew read with hi ey onli but after a while in spite of himself although he knew how far it wa safe to trust bil bin what he had read began to interest him more and more when he had read thu far he crumpl the letter up and threw it awai it wa not what he had read that vex him but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut hi ey rub hi forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read and listen to what wa pass in the nurseri suddenli he thought he heard a strang nois through the door he wa seiz with alarm lest someth should have happen to the child while he wa read the letter he went on tipto to the nurseri door and open it just as he went in he saw that the nurs wa hide someth from him with a scare look and that princess mari wa no longer by the cot my dear he heard what seem to him her despair whisper behind him as often happen after long sleepless and long anxieti he wa seiz by an unreason panic it occur to him that the child wa dead all that he saw and heard seem to confirm thi terror all is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on hi forehead he went to the cot in confus sure that he would find it empti and that the nurs had been hide the dead babi he drew the curtain asid and for some time hi frighten restless ey could not find the babi at last he saw him the rosi boi had toss about till he lai across the bed with hi head lower than the pillow and wa smack hi lip in hi sleep and breath evenli princ andrew wa as glad to find the boi like that as if he had alreadi lost him he bent over him and as hi sister had taught him tri with hi lip whether the child wa still feverish the soft forehead wa moist princ andrew touch the head with hi hand even the hair wa wet so profus had the child perspir he wa not dead but evid the crisi wa over and he wa convalesc princ andrew long to snatch up to squeez to hold to hi heart thi helpless littl creatur but dare not do so he stood over him gaze at hi head and at the littl arm and leg which show under the blanket he heard a rustl behind him and a shadow appear under the curtain of the cot he did not look round but still gaze at the infant s face listen to hi regular breath the dark shadow wa princess mari who had come up to the cot with noiseless step lift the curtain and drop it again behind her princ andrew recogn her without look and held out hi hand to her she press it he ha perspir said princ andrew i wa come to tell you so the child move slightli in hi sleep smile and rub hi forehead against the pillow princ andrew look at hi sister in the dim shadow of the curtain her lumin ey shone more brightli than usual from the tear of joi that were in them she lean over to her brother and kiss him slightli catch the curtain of the cot each made the other a warn gestur and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wish to leav that seclus where thei three were shut off from all the world princ andrew wa the first to move awai ruffl hi hair against the muslin of the curtain ye thi is the on thing left me now he said with a sigh chapter x soon after hi admiss to the mason brotherhood pierr went to the kiev provinc where he had the greatest number of serf take with him full direct which he had written down for hi own guidanc as to what he should do on hi estat when he reach kiev he sent for all hi steward to the head offic and explain to them hi intent and wish he told them that step would be taken immedi to free hi serf and that till then thei were not to be overburden with labor women while nurs their babi were not to be sent to work assist wa to be given to the serf punish were to be admonitori and not corpor and hospit asylum and school were to be establish on all the estat some of the steward there were semiliter foremen among them listen with alarm suppos these word to mean that the young count wa displeas with their manag and embezzl of monei some after their first fright were amus by pierr s lisp and the new word thei had not heard befor other simpli enjoi hear how the master talk while the cleverest among them includ the chief steward understood from thi speech how thei could best handl the master for their own end the chief steward express great sympathi with pierr s intent but remark that besid these chang it would be necessari to go into the gener state of affair which wa far from satisfactori despit count bez khov s enorm wealth sinc he had come into an incom which wa said to amount to five hundr thousand rubl a year pierr felt himself far poorer than when hi father had made him an allow of ten thousand rubl he had a dim percept of the follow budget about went in payment on all the estat to the land bank about went for the upkeep of the estat near moscow the town hous and the allow to the three princess about wa given in pension and the same amount for asylum alimoni wa sent to the countess about went for interest on debt the build of a new church previous begun had cost about in each of the last two year and he did not know how the rest about rubl wa spent and almost everi year he wa oblig to borrow besid thi the chief steward wrote everi year tell him of fire and bad harvest or of the necess of rebuild factori and workshop so the first task pierr had to face wa on for which he had veri littl aptitud or inclin practic busi he discuss estat affair everi dai with hi chief steward but he felt that thi did not forward matter at all he felt that these consult were detach from real affair and did not link up with them or make them move on the on hand the chief steward put the state of thing to him in the veri worst light point out the necess of pai off the debt and undertak new activ with serf labor to which pierr did not agre on the other hand pierr demand that step should be taken to liber the serf which the steward met by show the necess of first pai off the loan from the land bank and the consequ imposs of a speedi emancip the steward did not sai it wa quit imposs but suggest sell the forest in the provinc of kostrom the land lower down the river and the crimean estat in order to make it possibl all of which oper accord to him were connect with such complic measur the remov of injunct petit permit and so on that pierr becam quit bewild and onli repli ye ye do so pierr had none of the practic persist that would have enabl him to attend to the busi himself and so he dislik it and onli tri to pretend to the steward that he wa attend to it the steward for hi part tri to pretend to the count that he consid these consult veri valuabl for the proprietor and troublesom to himself in kiev pierr found some peopl he knew and stranger hasten to make hi acquaint and joyfulli welcom the rich newcom the largest landown of the provinc temptat to pierr s greatest weak the on to which he had confess when admit to the lodg were so strong that he could not resist them again whole dai week and month of hi life pass in as great a rush and were as much occupi with even parti dinner lunch and ball give him no time for reflect as in petersburg instead of the new life he had hope to lead he still live the old life onli in new surround of the three precept of freemasonri pierr realiz that he did not fulfil the on which enjoin everi mason to set an exampl of moral life and that of the seven virtu he lack two moral and the love of death he consol himself with the thought that he fulfil anoth of the precept that of reform the human race and had other virtu love of hi neighbor and especi generos in the spring of he decid to return to petersburg on the wai he intend to visit all hi estat and see for himself how far hi order had been carri out and in what state were the serf whom god had entrust to hi care and whom he intend to benefit the chief steward who consid the young count s attempt almost insan unprofit to himself to the count and to the serf made some concess continu to repres the liber of the serf as impractic he arrang for the erect of larg build school hospit and asylum on all the estat befor the master arriv everywher prepar were made not for ceremoni welcom which he knew pierr would not like but for just such gratefulli religi on with offer of icon and the bread and salt of hospit as accord to hi understand of hi master would touch and delud him the southern spring the comfort rapid travel in a vienna carriag and the solitud of the road all had a gladden effect on pierr the estat he had not befor visit were each more picturesqu than the other the serf everywher seem thrive and touchingli grate for the benefit confer on them everywher were recept which though thei embarrass pierr awaken a joy feel in the depth of hi heart in on place the peasant present him with bread and salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul ask permiss as a mark of their gratitud for the benefit he had confer on them to build a new chantri to the church at their own expens in honor of peter and paul hi patron saint in anoth place the women with infant in arm met him to thank him for releas them from hard work on a third estat the priest bear a cross came to meet him surround by children whom by the count s generos he wa instruct in read write and religion on all hi estat pierr saw with hi own ey brick build erect or in cours of erect all on on plan for hospit school and almshous which were soon to be open everywher he saw the steward account accord to which the serf manori labor had been diminish and heard the touch thank of deput of serf in their fullskirt blue coat what pierr did not know wa that the place where thei present him with bread and salt and wish to build a chantri in honor of peter and paul wa a market villag where a fair wa held on st peter s dai and that the richest peasant who form the deput had begun the chantri long befor but that nine tenth of the peasant in that villag were in a state of the greatest poverti he did not know that sinc the nurs mother were no longer sent to work on hi land thei did still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppress the peasant by hi exact and that the pupil parent wept at have to let him take their children and secur their releas by heavi payment he did not know that the brick build built to plan were be built by serf whose manori labor wa thu increas though lessen on paper he did not know that where the steward had shown him in the account that the serf payment had been diminish by a third their obligatori manori work had been increas by a half and so pierr wa delight with hi visit to hi estat and quit recov the philanthrop mood in which he had left petersburg and wrote enthusiast letter to hi brotherinstructor as he call the grand master how easi it is how littl effort it need to do so much good thought pierr and how littl attent we pai to it he wa pleas at the gratitud he receiv but felt abash at receiv it thi gratitud remind him of how much more he might do for these simpl kindli peopl the chief steward a veri stupid but cun man who saw perfectli through the na ve and intellig count and plai with him as with a toi see the effect these prearrang recept had on pierr

when the old man began to speak too loud sper nski smile and said he could not judg of the advantag or disadvantag of what pleas the sovereign have talk for a littl while in the gener circl sper nski

much improv by the chang probabl princ andrew s thought interest him si vou envisagez la question sou ce point de vue he began pronounc french with evid difficulti and speak even slower than in russian but quit calmli if you regard the question from that point of view sper nski went on to sai that honor l honneur cannot be upheld by privileg harm to the servic that honor l honneur is either a neg concept of not do what is blameworthi or it is a sourc of emul in pursuit of commend and reward which recogn it hi argument were concis simpl and clear an institut uphold honor the sourc of emul is on similar to the l gion d honneur of the great emperor napoleon not harm but help to the success of the servic but not a class or court privileg i do not disput that but it cannot be deni that court privileg have attain the same end return princ andrew everi courtier consid himself bound to maintain hi posit worthili yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privileg princ said sper nski

meet at kochub y s sper nski produc a strong impress on princ andrew on the wednesdai when he receiv him t te t te at hi own hous and talk to him long and confidenti to bolk nski so mani peopl appear contempt and insignific creatur and he so long to find in someon the live ideal of that perfect toward which he strove that he readili believ that in sper nski he had found thi ideal of a perfectli ration and virtuou man had sper nski sprung from the same class as himself and possess the same breed and tradit bolk nski would soon have discov hi weak human unhero side but as it wa sper nski s strang and logic turn of mind inspir him with respect all the more becaus he did not quit understand him moreov sper nski either becaus he appreci the other s capac or becaus he consid it necessari to win him to hi side show off hi dispassion calm reason befor princ andrew and flatter him with that subtl flatteri which goe hand in hand with selfassur and consist in a tacit assumpt that on s

wish to be on who explain all the fact of life reason consid import onli what wa ration and wa capabl of appli the standard of reason to everyth everyth seem so simpl and clear in sper nski s exposit that princ andrew involuntarili agre with him about everyth if he repli and argu it wa onli becaus he wish to maintain hi independ and not submit to sper nski s opinion entir everyth wa right and everyth wa as it should be onli on thing disconcert princ andrew thi wa sper nski s cold mirrorlik look which did not allow on to penetr to hi soul and hi delic white hand which princ andrew involuntarili watch as on doe watch the hand of those who possess power thi mirrorlik gaze and those delic hand irrit princ andrew he knew not why he wa unpleasantli struck too by the excess contempt for other that he observ in sper nski and by the divers of line of argument he us to support hi opinion he made us of everi kind of mental devic except analog and pass too boldli it seem to princ andrew from on to anoth now he would take up the posit of a practic man and condemn dreamer now that of a satirist and laugh iron at hi oppon now grow sever logic or suddenli rise to the realm of metaphys thi last resourc wa on he veri frequent emploi he would transfer a question to metaphys height pass on to definit of space time and thought and have deduc the refut he need would again descend to the level of the origin discuss in gener the trait of sper nski s mental which struck princ andrew most wa hi absolut and unshak belief in the power and author of reason it wa evid that the thought could never occur to him which to princ andrew seem so natur name that it is after all imposs to express all on think and that he had never felt the doubt is not all i think and believ nonsens and it wa just thi peculiar of sper nski s mind that particularli attract princ andrew dure the first period of their acquaint bolk nski felt a passion admir for him similar to that which he had onc felt for bonapart the fact that sper nski wa the son of a villag priest and that stupid peopl might meanli despis him on account of hi humbl origin as in fact mani did caus princ andrew to cherish hi sentiment for him the more and unconsci to strengthen it on that first even bolk nski spent with him have mention the commiss for the revis of the code of law sper nski told him sarcast that the commiss had exist for a hundr and fifti year had cost million and had done noth except that rosenkampf had stuck label on the correspond paragraph of the differ code and that is all the state ha for the million it ha spent said he we want to give the senat new jurid power but we have no law that is why it is a sin for men like you princ not to serv in these time princ andrew said that for that work an educ in jurisprud wa need which he did not possess but nobodi possess it so what would you have it is a viciou circl from which we must break a wai out a week later princ andrew wa a member of the committe on armi regul and what he had not at all expect wa chairman of a section of the committe for the revis of the law at sper nski s request he took the first part of the civil code that wa be drawn up and with the aid of the code napol on and the institut of justinian he work at formul the section on person right chapter vii nearli two year befor thi in pierr on return to petersburg after visit hi estat had involuntarili found himself in a lead posit among the petersburg freemason he arrang dine and funer lodg meet enrol new member and busi himself unit variou lodg and acquir authent charter he gave monei for the erect of templ and supplement as far as he could the collect of alm in regard to which the major of member were stingi and irregular he support almost singlehand a poorhous the order had found in petersburg hi life meanwhil continu as befor with the same infatu and dissip he like to dine and drink well and though he consid it immor and humili could not resist the temptat of the bachelor circl in which he move amid the turmoil of hi activ and distract howev pierr at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmli he tri to rest upon it the more mason ground on which he stood gave wai under him at the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarili becam to the order when he had join the freemason he had experienc the feel of on who confid step onto the smooth surfac of a bog when he put hi foot down it sank in to make quit sure of the firm of the ground he put hi other foot down and sank deeper still becam stuck in it and involuntarili wade kneedeep in the bog joseph alex evich wa not in petersburg he had of late stood asid from the affair of the petersburg lodg and live almost entir in moscow all the member of the lodg were men pierr knew in ordinari life and it wa difficult for him to regard them mere as brother in freemasonri and not as princ b or iv n va levich d whom he knew in societi mostli as weak and insignific men under the mason apron and insignia he saw the uniform and decor at which thei aim in ordinari life often after collect alm and reckon up twenti to thirti rubl receiv for the most part in promis from a dozen member of whom half were as well abl to pai as himself pierr rememb the mason vow in which each brother promis to devot all hi belong to hi neighbor and doubt on which he tri not to dwell aros in hi soul he divid the brother he knew into four categori in the first he put those who did not take an activ part in the affair of the lodg or in human affair but were exclus occupi with the mystic scienc of the order with question of the threefold design of god the three primordi element sulphur mercuri and salt or the mean of the squar and all the variou figur of the templ of solomon pierr respect thi class of brother to which the elder on chiefli belong includ pierr thought joseph alex evich himself but he did not share their interest hi heart wa not in the mystic aspect of freemasonri in the second categori pierr reckon himself and other like him seek and vacil who had not yet found in freemasonri a straight and comprehens path but hope to do so in the third categori he includ those brother the major who saw noth in freemasonri but the extern form and ceremoni and prize the strict perform of these form without troubl about their purport or signific such were willarski and even the grand master of the princip lodg final to the fourth categori also a great mani brother belong particularli those who had late join these accord to pierr s observ were men who had no belief in anyth nor desir for anyth but join the freemason mere to associ with the wealthi young brother who were influenti through their connect or rank and of whom there were veri mani in the lodg pierr began to feel dissatisfi with what he wa do freemasonri at ani rate as he saw it here sometim seem to him base mere on extern he did not think of doubt freemasonri itself but suspect that russian masonri had taken a wrong path and deviat from it origin principl and so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initi into the higher secret of the order in the summer of pierr return to petersburg our freemason knew from correspond with those abroad that bez khov had obtain the confid of mani highli place person had been initi into mani mysteri had been rais to a higher grade and wa bring back with him much that might conduc to the advantag of the mason caus in russia the petersburg freemason all came to see him tri to ingrati themselv with him and it seem to them all that he wa prepar someth for them and conceal it a solemn meet of the lodg of the second degre wa conven at which pierr promis to commun to the petersburg brother what he had to deliv to them from the highest leader of their order the meet wa a full on after the usual ceremoni pierr rose and began hi address dear brother he began blush and stammer with a written speech in hi hand it is not suffici to observ our mysteri in the seclus of our lodg we must act act we ar drows but we must act pierr rais hi notebook and began to read for the dissemin of pure truth and to secur the triumph of virtu he read we must cleans men from prejudic diffus principl in harmoni with the spirit of the time undertak the educ of the young unit ourselv in indissolubl bond with the wisest men boldli yet prudent overcom superstit infidel and folli and form of those devot to us a bodi link togeth by uniti of purpos and possess of author and power to attain thi end we must secur a preponder of virtu over vice and must endeavor to secur that the honest man mai even in thi world receiv a last reward for hi virtu but in these great endeavor we ar grave hamper by the polit institut of todai what is to be done in these circumst to favor revolut overthrow everyth repel forc by forc no we ar veri far from that everi violent reform deserv censur for it quit fail to remedi evil while men remain what thei ar and also becaus wisdom need no violenc the whole plan of our order should be base on the idea of prepar men of firm and virtu bound togeth by uniti of convict aim at the punish of vice and folli and patron talent and virtu rais worthi men from the dust and attach them to our brotherhood onli then will our order have the power unobtrus to bind the hand of the protector of disord and to control them without their be awar of it in a word we must found a form of govern hold univers swai which should be diffus over the whole world without destroi the bond of citizenship and besid which all other govern can continu in their customari cours and do everyth except what imped the great aim of our order which is to obtain for virtu the victori over vice thi aim wa that of christian itself it taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the exampl and instruct of the best and wisest men at that time when everyth wa plung in dark preach alon wa of cours suffici the novelti of truth endow her with special strength but now we need much more power method it is now necessari that man govern by hi sens should find in virtu a charm palpabl to those sens it is imposs to erad the passion but we must strive to direct them to a nobl aim and it is therefor necessari that everyon should be abl to satisfi hi passion within the limit of virtu our order should provid mean to that end as soon as we have a certain number of worthi men in everi state each of them again train two other and all be close unit everyth will be possibl for our order which ha alreadi in secret accomplish much for the welfar of mankind thi speech not onli made a strong impress but creat excit in the lodg the major of the brother see in it danger design of illumin met it with a cold that surpris pierr the grand master began answer him and pierr began develop hi view with more and more warmth it wa long sinc there had been so stormi a meet parti were form some accus pierr of

seem to be on hi side understood him in their own wai with limit and alter he could not agre to as what he alwai want most wa to convei hi thought to other just as he himself understood it the illuminati sought to substitut republican for monarch institut at the end of the meet the grand master with ironi and illwil reprov bez khov for hi vehem and said it wa not love of virtu alon but also a love of strife that had move him in the disput pierr did not answer him and ask briefli whether hi propos would be accept he wa told that it would not and without wait for the usual formal he left the lodg and went home chapter viii again pierr wa overtaken by the depress he so dread for three dai after the deliveri of hi speech at the lodg he lai on a sofa at home receiv no on and go nowher it wa just then that he receiv a letter from hi wife who implor him to see her tell him how griev she wa about him and how she wish to devot her whole life to him at the end of the letter she inform him

he would bring round to the superstiti of old maid or the pet and spoil of children you want to make him littl nichola into an old maid like yourself a piti princ andrew want a son and not an old maid he would sai or turn to mademoisel bourienn he would ask her in princess mari s presenc how she like our villag priest and icon and would joke about them he continu hurt princess mari s feel and torment her but it cost her no effort to forgiv him could he be to blame toward her or could her father whom she knew love her in spite of it all be unjust and what is justic the princess never thought of that proud word justic all the complex law of man center for her in on clear and simpl law the law of love and selfsacrific taught us by him who lovingli suffer for mankind though he himself wa god what had she to do with the justic or injustic of other peopl she had to endur and love and that she did dure the winter princ andrew had come to bald hill and had been gai gentl and more affection than princess mari had known him for a long time past she felt that someth had happen to him but he said noth to her about hi love befor he left he had a long talk with hi father about

other ar call awai to god while cruel useless harm person or such as ar a burden to themselv and to other ar left live the first death i saw and on i shall never forget that of my dear sisterinlaw left that impress on me just as you ask destini why your splendid brother had to die so i ask why that angel lise who not onli never wrong anyon but in whose soul there were never ani unkind thought had to die and what do you think dear friend five year have pass sinc then and alreadi i with my petti understand begin to see clearli why she had to die and in what wai that death wa but an express of the infinit good of the creator whose everi action though gener incomprehens to us is but a manifest of hi infinit love for hi creatur perhap i often think she wa too angel innoc to have the strength to perform all a mother s duti as a young wife she wa irreproach perhap she could not have been so as a mother as it is not onli ha she left us and particularli princ andrew with the purest regret and memori but probabl she will there receiv a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of her alon that earli and terribl death ha had the most benefic influenc on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief then at the moment of our loss these thought could not occur to me i should then have dismiss them with horror but now thei ar veri clear and certain i write all thi to you dear friend onli to convinc you of the gospel truth which ha becom for me a principl of life not a singl hair of our head will fall without hi will and hi will is govern onli by infinit love for us and so whatev befal us is for our good you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of my wish to see you i do not think so and do not want to do so you will be surpris to hear that the reason for thi is buonapart the case is thi my father s health is grow notic wors he cannot stand ani contradict and is becom irrit thi irrit is as you know chiefli direct to polit question he cannot endur the notion that buonapart is negoti on equal term with all the sovereign of europ and particularli with our own the grandson of the great catherin as you know i am quit indiffer to polit but from my father s remark and hi talk with michael iv novich i know all that goe on in the world and especi about the honor confer on buonapart who onli at bald hill in the whole world it seem is not accept as a great man still less as emperor of franc and my father cannot stand thi it seem to me that it is chiefli becaus of hi polit view that my father is reluct to speak of go to moscow for he forese the encount that would result from hi wai of express hi view regardless of anybodi all the benefit he might deriv from a cours of treatment he would lose as a result of the disput about buonapart which would be inevit in ani case it will be decid veri shortli our famili life goe on in the old wai except for my brother andrew s absenc he as i wrote you befor ha chang veri much of late after hi sorrow he onli thi year quit recov hi spirit he ha again becom as i us to know him when a child kind affection with that heart of gold to which i know no equal he ha realiz it seem to me that life is not over for him but togeth with thi mental chang he ha grown physic much weaker he ha becom thinner and more nervou i am anxiou about him and glad he is take thi trip abroad which the doctor recommend long ago i hope it will cure him you write that in petersburg he is spoken of as on of the most activ cultiv and capabl of the young men forgiv my vaniti as a relat but i never doubt it the good he ha done to everybodi here from hi peasant up to the gentri is incalcul on hi arriv in petersburg he receiv onli hi due i alwai wonder at the wai rumor fly from petersburg to moscow especi such fals on as that you write about i mean the report of my brother s betroth to the littl rost va i do not think my brother will ever marri again and certainli not her and thi is why first i know that though he rare speak about the wife he ha lost the grief of that loss ha gone too deep in hi heart for him ever to decid to give her a successor and our littl angel a stepmoth secondli becaus as far as i know that girl is not the kind of girl who could pleas princ andrew i do not think he would choos her for a wife and frankli i do not wish it but i am run on too long and am at the end of my

pierr and despit twentytwo degre of frost fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from hi broad chest and inhal the air with joi it wa clear and frosti abov the dirti illlit street abov the black roof stretch the dark starri sky onli look up at the sky did pierr ceas to feel how sordid and humili were all mundan thing compar with the height to which hi soul had just been rais at the entranc to the arb t squar an immens expans of dark starri sky present itself to hi ey almost in the center of it abov the prech stenka boulevard surround and sprinkl on all side by star but distinguish from them all by it near to the earth it white light and it long uplift tail shone the enorm and brilliant comet of the comet which wa said to portend all kind of woe and the end of the world in pierr howev that comet with it long lumin tail arous no feel of fear on the contrari he gaze joyfulli hi ey moist with tear at thi bright comet which have travel in it orbit with inconceiv veloc through immeasur space seem suddenli like an arrow pierc the earth to remain fix in a chosen spot vigor hold it tail erect shine and displai it white light amid countless other scintil star it seem to pierr that thi comet fulli respond to what wa pass in hi own soften and uplift soul now blossom into a new life book nine chapter i from the close of the year intensifi arm and concentr of the forc of western europ began and in these forc million of men reckon those transport and feed the armi move from the west eastward to the russian frontier toward which sinc russian forc had been similarli drawn on the twelfth of june the forc of western europ cross the russian frontier and war began that is an event took place oppos to human reason and to human natur million of men perpetr against on anoth such innumer crime fraud treacheri theft forgeri issu of fals monei burglari incendiar and murder as in whole centuri ar not record in the annal of all the law court of the world but which those who commit them did not at the time regard as be crime what produc thi extraordinari occurr what were it caus the historian tell us with na ve assur that it caus were the wrong inflict on the duke of oldenburg the nonobserv of the continent system the ambit of napoleon the firm of alexand the mistak of the diplomatist and so on consequ it would onli have been necessari for metternich rumi ntsev or talleyrand between a leve and an even parti to have taken proper pain and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to have written to alexand my respect brother i consent to restor the duchi to the duke of oldenburg and there would have been no war we can understand that the matter seem like that to contemporari it natur seem to napoleon that the war wa caus by england s intrigu as in fact he said on the island of st helena it natur seem to member of the english parliament that the caus of the war wa napoleon s ambit to the duke of oldenburg that the caus of the war wa the violenc done to him to businessmen that the caus of the war wa the continent system which wa ruin europ to the gener and old soldier that the chief reason for the war wa the necess of give them employ to the legitimist of that dai that it wa the need of reestablish le bon princip and to the diplomatist of that time that it all result from the fact that the allianc between russia and austria in had not been suffici well conceal from napoleon and from the awkward word of memorandum no it is natur that these and a countless and infinit quantiti of other reason the number depend on the endless divers of point of view present themselv to the men of that dai but to us to poster who view the thing that happen in all it magnitud and perceiv it plain and terribl mean these caus seem insuffici to us it is incomprehens that million of christian men kill and tortur each other either becaus napoleon wa ambiti or alexand wa firm or becaus england s polici wa astut or the duke of oldenburg wrong we cannot grasp what connect such circumst have with the actual fact of slaughter and violenc why becaus the duke wa wrong thousand of men from the other side of europ kill and ruin the peopl of smol nsk and moscow and were kill by them to us their descend who ar not historian and ar not carri awai by the process of research and can therefor regard the event with uncloud common sens an incalcul number of caus present themselv the deeper we delv in search of these caus the more of them we find and each separ caus or whole seri of caus appear to us equal valid in itself and equal fals by it insignific compar to the magnitud of the event and by it impot apart from the cooper of all the other coincid caus to occas the event to us the wish or object of thi or that french corpor to serv a second term appear as much a caus as napoleon s refus to withdraw hi troop beyond the vistula and to restor the duchi of oldenburg for had he not wish to serv and had a second a third and a thousandth corpor and privat also refus there would have been so mani less men in napoleon s armi and the war could not have occur had napoleon not taken offens at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the vistula and not order hi troop to advanc there would have been no war but had all hi sergeant object to serv a second term then also there could have been no war nor could there have been a war had there been no english intrigu and no duke of oldenburg and had alexand not felt insult and had there not been an autocrat govern in russia or a revolut in franc and a subsequ dictatorship and empir or all the thing that produc the french revolut and so on without each of these caus noth could have happen so all these caus myriad of caus coincid to bring it about and so there wa no on caus for that occurr but it had to occur becaus it had to million of men renounc their human feel and reason had to go from west to east to slai their fellow just as some centuri previous hord of men had come from the east to the west slai their fellow the action of napoleon and alexand on whose word the event seem to hang were as littl voluntari as the action of ani soldier who wa drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscript thi could not be otherwis for in order that the will of napoleon and alexand on whom the event seem to depend should be carri out the concurr of innumer circumst wa need without anyon of which the event could not have taken place it wa necessari that million of men in whose hand lai the real power the soldier who fire or transport provis and gun should consent to carri out the will of these weak individu and should have been induc to do so by an infinit number of divers and complex caus we ar forc to fall back on fatal as an explan of irrat event that is to sai event the reason of which we do not understand the more we try to explain such event in histori reason the more unreason and incomprehens do thei becom to us each man live for himself us hi freedom to attain hi person aim and feel with hi whole be that he can now do or abstain from do thi or that action but as soon as he ha done it that action perform at a certain moment in time becom irrevoc and belong to histori in which it ha not a free but a predestin signific there ar two side to the life of everi man hi individu life which is the more free the more abstract it interest and hi element

in a scienc of war with immut law law of obliqu movement outflank and so forth pfuel and hi adher demand a retir into the depth of the countri in accord with precis law defin by a pseudotheori of war and thei saw onli barbar ignor or evil intent in everi deviat from that theori to thi parti belong the foreign nobl wolzogen wintzingerod and other chiefli german the second parti wa directli oppos to the first on extrem as alwai happen wa met by repres of the other the member of thi parti were those who had demand an advanc from v lna into poland and freedom from all prearrang plan besid be advoc of bold action thi section also repres nation which made them still more onesid in the disput thei were russian bagrati n erm lov who wa begin to come to the front and other at that time a famou joke of erm lov s wa be circul that as a great favor he had petit the emperor to make him a german the men of that parti rememb suv rov said that what on had to do wa not to reason or stick pin into map but to fight beat the enemi keep him out of russia and not let the armi get discourag to the third parti in which the emperor had most confid belong the courtier who tri to arrang compromis between the other two the member of thi parti chiefli civilian and to whom arakch ev belong thought and said what men who have no convict but wish to seem to have some gener sai thei said that undoubtedli war particularli against such a geniu as bonapart thei call him bonapart now need most deepli devis plan and profound scientif knowledg and in that respect pfuel wa a geniu but at the same time it had to be acknowledg that the theorist ar often onesid and therefor on should not trust them absolut but should also listen to what pfuel s oppon and practic men of experi in warfar had to sai and then choos a middl cours thei insist on the retent of the camp at drissa accord to pfuel s plan but on chang the movement of the other armi though by thi cours neither on aim nor the other could be attain yet it seem best to the adher of thi third parti of a fourth opinion the most conspicu repres wa the tsar vich who could not forget hi disillusion at austerlitz where he had ridden out at the head of the guard in hi casqu and cavalri uniform as to a review expect to crush the french gallantli but unexpectedli find himself in the front line had narrowli escap amid the gener confus the men of thi parti had both the qualiti and the defect of frank in their opinion thei fear napoleon recogn hi strength and their own weak and frankli said so thei said noth but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all thi we have abandon v lna and v tebsk and shall abandon drissa the onli reason thing left to do is to conclud peac as soon as possibl befor we ar turn out of petersburg thi view wa veri gener in the upper armi circl and found support also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumi ntsev who for other reason of state wa in favor of peac the fifth parti consist of those who were adher of barclai de tolli not so much as a man but as minist of war and command in chief be he what he mai thei alwai began like that he is an honest practic man and we have nobodi better give him real power for war cannot be conduct successfulli without uniti of command and he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our armi is well organ and strong and ha withdrawn to drissa without suffer ani defeat we ow thi entir to barclai if barclai is now to be supersed by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen show hi incapac alreadi in the sixth parti the bennigsenit said on the contrari that at ani rate there wa no on more activ and experienc than bennigsen and twist about as you mai you will have to come to bennigsen eventu let the other make mistak now said thei argu that our retir to drissa wa a most shame revers and an unbroken seri of blunder the more mistak that ar made the better it will at ani rate be understood all the sooner that thing cannot go on like thi what is want is not some barclai or other but a man like bennigsen who made hi mark in and to whom napoleon himself did justic a man whose author would be willingli recogn and bennigsen is the onli such man the seventh parti consist of the sort of peopl who ar alwai to be found especi around young sovereign and of whom there were particularli mani round alexand gener and imperi aidesdecamp passion devot to the emperor not mere as a monarch but as a man ador him sincer and disinterestedli as rost v had done in and who saw in him not onli all the virtu but all human capabl as well these men though enchant with the sovereign for refus the command of the armi yet blame him for such excess modesti and onli desir and insist that their ador sovereign should abandon hi diffid and openli announc that he would place himself at the

with hi oppon and the dai after mere to avoid respons or to pleas the emperor would declar that he had no opinion at all on the matter anoth who wish to gain some advantag would attract the emperor s attent by loudli advoc the veri thing the emperor had hint at the dai befor and would disput and shout at the council beat hi breast and challeng those who did not agre with him to duel therebi prove that he wa prepar to sacrific himself for the common good a third in the absenc of oppon between two council would simpli solicit a special gratuiti for hi faith servic well know that at that moment peopl would be too busi to refus him a fourth while seemingli overwhelm with work would often come accident under the emperor s ey a fifth to achiev hi longcherish aim of dine with the emperor would stubbornli insist on the correct or falsiti of some newli emerg opinion and for thi object would produc argument more or less forcibl and correct all the men of thi parti were fish for rubl decor and promot and in thi pursuit watch onli the weathercock of imperi favor and directli thei notic it turn in ani direct thi whole drone popul of the armi began blow hard that wai so that it wa all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewher amid the uncertainti of the posit with the menac of seriou danger give a peculiarli threaten charact to everyth amid thi vortex of intrigu egot conflict of view and feel and the divers of race among these peopl thi eighth and largest parti of those preoccupi with person interest impart great confus and obscur to the common task whatev question aros a swarm of these drone without have finish their buzz on a previou theme flew over to the new on and by their hum drown and obscur the voic of those who were disput honestli from among all these parti just at the time princ andrew reach the armi anoth a ninth parti wa be form and wa begin to rais it voic thi wa the parti of the elder reason men experienc and capabl in state affair who without share ani of those conflict opinion were abl to take a detach view of what wa go on at the staff at headquart and to consid mean of escap from thi muddl indecis intricaci and weak the men of thi parti said and thought that what wa wrong result chiefli from the emperor s presenc in the armi with hi militari court and from the consequ presenc there of an indefinit condit and unsteadi fluctuat of relat which is in place at court but harm in an armi that a sovereign should reign but not command the armi and that the onli wai out of the posit would be for the emperor and hi court to leav the armi that the mere presenc of the emperor paralyz the action of fifti thousand men requir to secur hi person safeti and that the worst command in chief if independ would be better than the veri best on trammel by the presenc and author of the monarch just at the time princ andrew wa live unoccupi at drissa shishk v the secretari of state and on of the chief repres of thi parti wrote a letter to the emperor which arakch ev and balash v agre to sign in thi letter avail himself of permiss given him by the emperor to discuss the gener cours of affair he respectfulli suggest on the plea that it wa necessari for the sovereign to arous a warlik spirit in the peopl of the capit that the emperor should leav the armi that arous of the peopl by their sovereign and hi call to them to defend their countri the veri incit which wa the chief caus of russia s triumph in so far as it wa produc by the tsar s person presenc in moscow wa suggest to the emperor and accept by him as a pretext for quit the armi chapter x thi letter had not yet been present to the emperor when barclai on dai at dinner inform bolk nski that the sovereign wish to see him person to question him about turkei and that princ andrew wa to present himself at bennigsen s quarter at six that even new wa receiv at the emperor s quarter that veri dai of a fresh movement by napoleon which might endang the armi new subsequ found to be fals and that morn colonel michaud had ridden round the drissa fortif with the emperor and had point out to him that thi fortifi camp construct by pfuel and till then consid a chefd oeuvr of tactic scienc which would ensur napoleon s destruct wa an absurd threaten the destruct of the russian armi princ andrew arriv at bennigsen s quarter a countri gentleman s hous of moder size situat on the veri bank of the river neither bennigsen nor the emperor wa there but chern shev the emperor s aidedecamp receiv bolk nski and inform him that the emperor accompani by gener bennigsen and marqui paulucci had gone a second time that dai to inspect the fortif of the drissa camp of the suitabl of which seriou doubt were begin to be felt chern shev wa sit at a window in the first room with a french novel in hi hand thi room had probabl been a music room there wa still an organ in it on which some rug were pile and in on corner stood the fold bedstead of bennigsen s adjut thi adjut wa also there and sat doze on the rolledup bed evid exhaust by work or by feast two door led from the room on straight on into what had been the draw room and anoth on the right to the studi through the first door came the sound of voic convers in german and occasion in french in that draw room were gather by the emperor s wish not a militari council the emperor prefer indefinit but certain person whose opinion he wish to know in view of the impend difficulti it wa not a council of war but as it were a council to elucid certain question for the emperor person to thi semicouncil had been invit the swedish gener armfeldt adjut gener wolzogen wintzingerod whom napoleon had refer to as a renegad french subject michaud toll count stein who wa not a militari man at all and pfuel himself who as princ andrew had heard wa the mainspr of the whole affair princ andrew had an opportun of get a good look at him for pfuel arriv soon after himself and in pass through to the draw room stop a minut to speak to chern shev at first sight pfuel in hi illmad uniform of a russian gener which fit him badli like a fanci costum seem familiar to princ andrew though he saw him now for the first time there wa about him someth of weyroth mack and schmidt and mani other german theoristgener whom princ andrew had seen in but he wa more typic than ani of them princ andrew had never yet seen a german theorist in whom all the characterist of those other were unit to such an extent pfuel wa short and veri thin but broadbon of coars robust build broad in the hip and with promin shoulder blade hi face wa much wrinkl and hi ey deep set hi hair had evid been hastili brush smooth in front of the templ but stuck up behind in quaint littl tuft he enter the room look restlessli and angrili around as if afraid of everyth in that larg apart awkwardli hold up hi sword he address chern shev and ask in german where the emperor wa on could see that he wish to pass through the room as quickli as possibl finish with the bow and greet and sit down to busi in front of a map where he would feel at home he nod hurriedli in repli to chern shev and smile iron on hear that the sovereign wa inspect the fortif that he pfuel had plan in accord with hi theori he mutter someth to himself abruptli and in a bass voic as selfassur german do it might have been stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruin or someth absurd will come of it princ andrew did not catch what he said and would have pass on but chern shev introduc him to pfuel remark that princ andrew wa just back from turkei where the war had termin so fortun pfuel bare glanc not so much at princ andrew as past him and said with a laugh that must have been a fine tactic war and laugh contemptu went on into the room from which the sound of voic wa heard pfuel alwai inclin to be irrit sarcast wa particularli disturb that dai evid by the fact that thei had dare to inspect and critic hi camp in hi absenc from thi short interview with pfuel princ andrew thank to hi austerlitz experi wa abl to form a clear concept of the man pfuel wa on of those hopelessli and immut selfconfid men selfconfid to the point of martyrdom as onli german ar becaus onli german ar selfconfid on the basi of an abstract notion scienc that is the suppos knowledg of absolut truth a frenchman is selfassur becaus he regard himself person both in mind and bodi as irresist attract to men and women an englishman is selfassur as be a citizen of the bestorgan state in the world and therefor as an englishman alwai know what he should do and know that all he doe as an englishman is undoubtedli correct an italian is selfassur becaus he is excit and easili forget himself and other peopl a russian is selfassur just becaus he know noth and doe not want to know anyth sinc he doe not believ that anyth can be known the german s selfassur is worst of all stronger and more repuls than ani other becaus he imagin that he know the truth scienc which he himself ha invent but which is for him the absolut truth pfuel wa evid of that sort he had a scienc the theori of obliqu movement deduc by him from the histori of frederick the great s war and all he came across in the histori of more recent warfar seem to him absurd and barbar monstrou collis in which so mani blunder were commit by both side that these war could not be call war thei did not accord with the theori and therefor could not serv as materi for scienc in pfuel had been on of those respons for the plan of campaign that end in jena and auerst dt but he did not see the least proof of the fallibl of hi theori in the disast of that war on the contrari the deviat made from hi theori were in hi opinion the sole caus of the whole disast and with characterist gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair would go to the devil pfuel wa on of those theoretician who so love their theori that thei lose sight of the theori s object it practic applic hi love of theori made him hate everyth practic and he would not listen to it he wa even pleas by failur for failur result from deviat in practic from the theori onli prove to him the accuraci of hi theori he said a few word to princ andrew and chern shev about the present war with the air of a man who know beforehand that all will go wrong and who is not displeas that it should be so the unbrush tuft of hair stick up behind and the hastili brush hair on hi templ express thi most eloqu he pass into the next room and the deep querul sound of hi voic were at onc heard from there chapter xi princ andrew s ey were still follow pfuel out of the room when count bennigsen enter hurriedli and nod to bolk nski but not paus went into the studi give instruct to hi adjut as he went the emperor wa follow him and bennigsen had hasten on to make some prepar and to be readi to receiv the sovereign chern shev and princ andrew went out into the porch where the emperor who look fatigu wa dismount marqui paulucci wa talk to him with particular warmth and the emperor with hi head bent to the left wa listen with a dissatisfi air the emperor move forward evid wish to end the convers but the flush and excit italian oblivi of decorum follow him and continu to speak and as for the man who advis form thi camp the drissa camp said paulucci as the emperor mount the step and notic princ andrew scan hi unfamiliar face as to that person sire continu paulucci desper appar unabl to restrain himself the man who advis the drissa camp i see no altern but the lunat asylum or the gallow without heed the end of the italian s remark and as though not hear them the emperor recogn bolk nski address him gracious i am veri glad to see you go in there where thei ar meet and wait for me the emperor went into the studi he wa follow by princ peter mikh ylovich volk nski and baron stein and the door close behind them princ andrew take advantag of the emperor s permiss accompani paulucci whom he had known in turkei into the draw room where the council wa assembl princ peter mikh ylovich volk nski occupi the posit as it were of chief of the emperor s staff he came out of the studi into the draw room with some map which he spread on a tabl and put question on which he wish to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present what had happen wa that new which afterward prove to be fals had been receiv dure the night of a movement by the french to outflank the drissa camp the first to speak wa gener armfeldt who to meet the difficulti that present itself unexpectedli propos a perfectli new posit awai from the petersburg and moscow road the reason for thi wa inexplic unless he wish to show that he too could have an opinion but he urg that at thi point the armi should unit and there await the enemi it wa plain that armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expound it not so much to answer the question put which in fact hi plan did not answer as to avail himself of the opportun to air it it wa on of the million of propos on as good as anoth that could be made as long as it wa quit unknown what charact the war would take some disput hi argument other defend them young count toll object to the swedish gener s view more warmli than anyon els and in the cours of the disput drew from hi side pocket a wellfil notebook which he ask permiss to read to them in these volumin note toll suggest anoth scheme total differ from armfeldt s or pfuel s plan of campaign in answer to toll paulucci suggest an advanc and an attack which he urg could alon extric us from the present uncertainti and from the trap as he call the drissa camp in which we were situat dure all these discuss pfuel and hi interpret wolzogen hi bridg in court relat were silent pfuel onli snort contemptu and turn awai to show that he would never demean himself by repli to such nonsens as he wa now hear so when princ volk nski who wa in the chair call on him to give hi opinion he mere said why ask me gener armfeldt ha propos a splendid posit with an expos rear or why not thi italian gentleman s attack veri fine or a retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselv know everyth better than i do but when volk nski said with a frown that it wa in the emperor s name that he ask hi opinion pfuel rose and suddenli grow anim began to speak everyth ha been spoil everyth muddl everybodi thought thei knew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matter there is noth to mend the principl laid down by me must be strictli adher to said he drum on the tabl with hi boni finger what is the difficulti nonsens childish he went up to the map and speak rapidli began prove that no eventu could alter the effici of the drissa camp that everyth had been foreseen and that if the enemi were realli go to outflank it the enemi would inevit be destroi paulucci who did not know german began question him in french wolzogen came to the assist of hi chief who spoke french badli and began translat for him hardli abl to keep pace with pfuel who wa rapidli demonstr that not onli all that had happen but all that could happen had been foreseen in hi scheme and that if there were now ani difficulti the whole fault lai in the fact that hi plan had not been precis execut he kept laugh sarcast he demonstr and at last contemptu ceas to demonstr like a mathematician who ceas to prove in variou wai the accuraci of a problem that ha alreadi been prove wolzogen took hi place and continu to explain hi view in french everi now and then turn to pfuel and sai is it not so your excel but pfuel like a man heat in a fight who strike those on hi own side shout angrili at hi own support wolzogen well of cours what more is there to explain paulucci and michaud both attack wolzogen simultan in french armfeldt address pfuel in german toll explain to volk nski in russian princ andrew listen and observ in silenc of all these men princ andrew sympath most with pfuel angri determin and absurdli selfconfid as he wa of all those present evid he alon wa not seek anyth for himself nurs no hatr against anyon and onli desir that the plan form on a theori arriv at by year of toil should be carri out he wa ridicul and unpleasantli sarcast but yet he inspir involuntari respect by hi boundless devot to an idea besid thi the remark of all except pfuel had on common trait that had not been notic at the council of war in there wa now a panic fear of napoleon s geniu which though conceal wa notic in everi rejoind everyth wa assum to be possibl for napoleon thei expect him from everi side and invok hi terribl name to shatter each other s propos pfuel alon seem to consid napoleon a barbarian like everyon els who oppos hi theori but besid thi feel of respect pfuel evok piti in princ andrew from the tone in which the courtier address him and the wai paulucci had allow himself to speak of him to the emperor but abov all from a certain desper in pfuel s own express it wa clear that the other knew and pfuel himself felt that hi fall wa at hand and despit hi selfconfid and grumpi german sarcasm he wa pitiabl with hi hair smoothli brush on the templ and stick up in tuft behind though he conceal the fact under a show of irrit and contempt he wa evid in despair that the sole remain chanc of verifi hi theori by a huge experi and prove it sound to the whole world wa slip awai from him the discuss continu a long time and the longer thei last the more heat becam the disput culmin in shout and person and the less wa it possibl to arriv at ani gener conclus from all that had been said princ andrew listen to thi polyglot talk and to these surmis plan refut and shout felt noth but amaz at what thei were sai a thought that had long sinc and often occur to him dure hi militari activ the idea that there is not and cannot be ani scienc of war and that therefor there can be no such thing as a militari geniu now appear to him an obviou truth what theori and scienc is possibl about a matter the condit and circumst of which ar unknown and cannot be defin especi when the strength of the act forc cannot be ascertain no on wa or is abl to forese in what condit our or the enemi s armi will be in a dai s time and no on can gaug the forc of thi or that detach sometim when there is not a coward at the front to shout we ar cut off and start run but a brave and jolli lad who shout hurrah a detach of five thousand is worth thirti thousand as at sch n grabern while at time fifti thousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what scienc can there be in a matter in which as in all practic matter noth can be defin and everyth depend on innumer condit the signific of which is determin at a particular moment which arriv no on know when armfeldt sai our armi is cut in half and paulucci sai we have got the french armi between two fire michaud sai that the worthless of the drissa camp li in have the river behind it and pfuel sai that is what constitut it strength toll propos on plan armfeldt anoth and thei ar all good and all bad and the advantag of ani suggest can be seen onli at the moment of trial and why do thei all speak of a militari geniu is a man a geniu who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and sai who is to go to the right and who to the left it is onli becaus militari men ar invest with pomp and power and crowd of sychoph flatter power attribut to it qualiti of geniu it doe not possess the best gener i have known were on the contrari stupid or absentmind men bagrati n wa the best napoleon himself admit that and of bonapart himself i rememb hi limit selfsatisfi face on the field of austerlitz not onli doe a good armi command not need ani special qualiti on the contrari he need the absenc of the highest and best human attribut love poetri tender and philosoph inquir doubt he should be limit firmli convinc that what he is do is veri import otherwis he will not have suffici patienc and onli then will he be a brave leader god forbid that he should be human should love or piti or think of what is just and unjust it is understand that a theori of their geniu wa invent for them long ago becaus thei have power the success of a militari action depend not on them but on the man in the rank who shout we ar lost or who shout hurrah and onli in the rank can on serv with assur of be us so thought princ andrew as he listen to the talk and he rous himself onli when paulucci call him and everyon wa leav at the review next dai the emperor ask princ andrew where he would like to serv and princ andrew lost hi stand in court circl forev by not ask to remain attach to the sovereign s person but for permiss to serv in the armi chapter xii befor the begin of the campaign rost v had receiv a letter from hi parent in which thei told him briefli of nat sha s ill and the break off of her engag to princ andrew which thei explain by nat sha s have reject him and again ask nichola to retir from the armi and return home on receiv thi letter nichola did not even make ani attempt to get leav of absenc or to retir from the armi but wrote to hi parent that he wa sorri nat sha wa ill and her engag broken off and that he would do all he could to meet their wish to s nya he wrote separ ador friend of my soul he wrote noth but honor could keep me from return to the countri but now at the commenc of the campaign i should feel dishonor not onli in my comrad ey but in my own if i prefer my own happi to my love and duti to the fatherland but thi shall be our last separ believ me directli the war is over if i am still aliv and still love by you i will throw up everyth and fly to you to press you forev to my ardent breast it wa in fact onli the commenc of the campaign that prevent rost v from return home as he had promis and marri s nya the autumn in otr dnoe with the hunt and the winter with the christma holidai and s nya s love had open out to him a vista of tranquil rural joi and peac such as he had never known befor and which now allur him a splendid wife children a good pack of hound a dozen leash of smart borzoi agricultur neighbor servic by elect thought he but now the campaign wa begin and he had to remain with hi regiment and sinc it had to be so nichola rost v as wa natur to him felt content with the life he led in the regiment and wa abl to find pleasur in that life on hi return from hi furlough nichola have been joyfulli welcom by hi comrad wa sent to obtain remount and brought back from the ukrain excel hors which pleas him and earn him commend from hi command dure hi absenc he had been promot captain and when the regiment wa put on war foot with an increas in number he wa again allot hi old squadron the campaign began the regiment wa move into poland on doubl pai new offic arriv new men and hors and abov all everybodi wa infect with the merrili excit mood that goe with the commenc of a war and rost v consciou of hi advantag posit in the regiment devot himself entir to the pleasur and interest of militari servic though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them the troop retir from v lna for variou complic reason of state polit and strateg each step of the retreat wa accompani by a complic interplai of interest argument and passion at headquart for the p vlograd hussar howev the whole of thi retreat dure the finest period of summer and with suffici suppli wa a veri simpl and agreeabl busi it wa onli at headquart that there wa depress uneasi and intrigu in the bodi of the armi thei did not ask themselv where thei were go or why if thei regret have to retreat it wa onli becaus thei had to leav billet thei had grown accustom to or some pretti young polish ladi if the thought that thing look bad chanc to enter anyon s head he tri to be as cheer as befit a good soldier and not to think of the gener trend of affair but onli of the task nearest to hand first thei camp gaili befor v lna make acquaint with the polish landown prepar for review and be review by the emperor and other high command then came an order to retreat to sventsi ni and destroi ani provis thei could not carri awai with them sventsi ni wa rememb by the hussar onli as the drunken camp a name the whole armi gave to their encamp there and becaus mani complaint were made against the troop who take advantag of the order to collect provis took also hors carriag and carpet from the polish proprietor rost v rememb sventsi ni becaus on the first dai of their arriv at that small town he chang hi sergeant major and wa unabl to manag all the drunken men of hi squadron who unknown to him had appropri five barrel of old beer from sventsi ni thei retir farther and farther to drissa and thenc again beyond drissa draw near to the frontier of russia proper on the thirteenth of juli the p vlograd took part in a seriou action for the first time on the twelfth of juli on the ev of that action there wa a heavi storm of rain and hail in gener the summer of wa remark for it storm the two p vlograd squadron were bivouack on a field of rye which wa alreadi in ear but had been complet trodden down by cattl and hors the rain wa descend in torrent and rost v with a young offic name ili n hi prot g wa sit in a hastili construct shelter an offic of their regiment with long mustach extend onto hi cheek who after ride to the staff had been overtaken by the rain enter rost v s shelter i have come from the staff count have you heard of ra vski s exploit and the offic gave them detail of the salt nov battl which he had heard at the staff rost v smoke hi pipe and turn hi head about as the water trickl down hi neck listen inattent with an occasion glanc at ili n who wa press close to him thi offic a lad of sixteen who had recent join the regiment wa now in the same relat to nichola that nichola had been to den sov seven year befor ili n tri to imit rost v in everyth and ador him as a girl might have done zdrzhinski the offic with the long mustach spoke grandiloqu of the salt nov dam be a russian thermopyla and of how a deed worthi of antiqu had been perform by gener ra vski he recount how ra vski had led hi two son onto the dam under terrif fire and had charg with them besid him rost v heard the stori and not onli said noth to encourag zdrzhinski s enthusiasm but on the contrari look like a man asham of what he wa hear though with no intent of contradict it sinc the campaign of austerlitz and of rost v knew by experi that men alwai lie when describ militari exploit as he himself had done when recount them besid that he had experi enough to know that noth happen in war at all as we can imagin or relat it and so he did not like zdrzhinski s tale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who with hi mustach extend over hi cheek bent low over the face of hi hearer as wa hi habit and crowd rost v in the narrow shanti rost v look at him in silenc in the first place there must have been such a confus and crowd on the dam that wa be attack that if ra vski did lead hi son there it could have had no effect except perhap on some dozen men nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how or with whom ra vski came onto the dam and even those who did see it would not have been much stimul by it for what had thei to do with ra vski s tender patern feel when their own skin were in danger and besid the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether thei took the salt nov dam or not as we ar told wa the case at thermopyla so why should he have made such a sacrific and why expos hi own children in the battl i would not have taken my brother p tya there or even ili n who s a stranger to me but a nice lad but would have tri to put them somewher under cover nichola continu to think as he listen to zdrzhinski but he did not express hi thought for in such matter too he had gain experi

to their steward about the enrol feel amaz themselv at what thei had done book ten chapter i napoleon began the war with russia becaus he could not resist go to dresden could not help have hi head turn by the homag he receiv could not help don a polish uniform and yield to the stimul influenc of a june morn and could not refrain from burst of anger in the presenc of kur kin and then of balash v alexand refus negoti becaus he felt himself to be person insult barclai de tolli tri to command the armi in the best wai becaus he wish to fulfil hi duti and earn fame as a great command rost v charg the french becaus he could not restrain hi wish for a gallop across a level field and in the same wai the innumer peopl who took part in the war act in accord with their person characterist habit circumst and aim thei were move by fear or vaniti rejoic or were indign reason imagin that thei knew what thei were do and did it of their own free will but thei all were involuntari tool of histori carri on a work conceal from them but comprehens to us such is the inevit fate of men of action and the higher thei stand in the social hierarchi the less ar thei free the actor of have long sinc left the stage their person interest have vanish leav no trace and noth remain of that time but it histor result provid compel all these men strive to attain person aim to further the accomplish of a stupend result no on of them at all expect neither napoleon nor alexand nor still less ani of those who did the actual fight the caus of the destruct of the french armi in is clear to us now no on will deni that that caus wa on the on hand it advanc into the heart of russia late in the season without ani prepar for a winter campaign and on the other the charact given to the war by the burn of russian town and the hatr of the foe thi arous among the russian peopl but no on at the time foresaw what now seem so evid that thi wa the onli wai an armi of eight hundr thousand men the best in the world and led by the best gener could be destroi in conflict with a raw armi of half it numer strength and led by inexperienc command as the russian armi wa not onli did no on see thi but on the russian side everi effort wa made to hinder the onli thing that could save russia while on the french side despit napoleon s experi and socal militari geniu everi effort wa direct to push on to moscow at the end of the summer that is to do the veri thing that wa bound to lead to destruct in histor work on the year french writer ar veri fond of sai that napoleon felt the danger of extend hi line that he sought a battl and that hi marshal advis him to stop at smol nsk and of make similar statement to show that the danger of the campaign wa even then understood russian author ar still fonder of tell us that from the commenc of the campaign a scythian war plan wa adopt to lure napoleon into the depth of russia and thi plan some of them attribut to pfuel other to a certain frenchman other to toll and other again to alexand himself point to note project and letter which contain hint of such a line of action but all these hint at what happen both from the french side and the russian ar advanc onli becaus thei fit in with the event had that event not occur these hint would have been forgotten as we have forgotten the thousand and million of hint and expect to the contrari which were current then but have now been forgotten becaus the event falsifi them there ar alwai so mani conjectur as to the issu of ani event that howev it mai end there will alwai be peopl to sai i said then that it would be so quit forget that amid their innumer conjectur mani were to quit the contrari effect conjectur as to napoleon s awar of the danger of extend hi line and on the russian side as to lure the enemi into the depth of russia ar evid of that kind and onli by much strain can historian attribut such concept to napoleon and hi marshal or such plan to the russian command all the fact ar in flat contradict to such conjectur dure the whole period of the war not onli wa there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into the heart of the countri but from their first entri into russia everyth wa done to stop them and not onli wa napoleon not afraid to extend hi line but he welcom everi step forward as a triumph and did not seek battl as eagerli as in former campaign but veri lazili at the veri begin of the war our armi were divid and our sole aim wa to unit them though unit the armi wa no advantag if we meant to retir and lure the enemi into the depth of the countri our emperor join the armi to encourag it to defend everi inch of russian soil and not to retreat the enorm drissa camp wa form on pfuel s plan and there wa no intent of retir farther the emperor reproach the command in chief for everi step thei retir he could not bear the idea of let the enemi even reach smol nsk still less could he contempl the burn of moscow and when our armi did unit he wa displeas that smol nsk wa abandon and burn without a gener engag have been fought under it wall so thought the emperor and the russian command and peopl were still more provok at the thought that our forc were retreat into the depth of the countri napoleon have cut our armi apart advanc far into the countri and miss sever chanc of forc an engag in august he wa at smol nsk and thought onli of how to advanc farther though as we now see that advanc wa evid ruinou to him the fact clearli show that napoleon did not forese the danger of the advanc on moscow nor did alexand and the russian command then think of lure napoleon on but quit the contrari the lure of napoleon into the depth of the countri wa not the result of ani plan for no on believ it to be possibl it result from a most complex interplai of intrigu aim and wish among those who took part in the war and had no percept whatev of the inevit or of the on wai of save russia everyth came about fortuit the armi were divid at the commenc of the campaign we tri to unit them with the evid intent of give battl and check the enemi s advanc and by thi effort to unit them while avoid battl with a much stronger enemi and necessarili withdraw the armi at an acut angl we led the french on to smol nsk but we withdrew at an acut angl not onli becaus the french advanc between our two armi the angl becam still more acut and we withdrew still farther becaus barclai de tolli wa an unpopular foreign dislik by bagrati n who would come under hi command and bagrati n be in command of the second armi tri to postpon join up and come under barclai s command as long as he could bagrati n wa slow in effect the junction though that wa the chief aim of all at headquart becaus as he alleg he expos hi armi to danger on thi march and it wa best for him to retir more to the left and more to the south worri the enemi from flank and rear and secur from the ukrain recruit for hi armi and it look as if he plan thi in order not to come under the command of the detest foreign barclai whose rank wa inferior to hi own the emperor wa with the armi to encourag it but hi presenc and ignor of what step to take and the enorm number of advis and plan destroi the first armi s energi and it retir the intent wa to make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucci aim at becom command in chief unexpectedli emploi hi energi to influenc alexand and pfuel s whole plan wa abandon and the command entrust to barclai but as barclai did not inspir confid hi power wa limit the armi were divid there wa no uniti of command and barclai wa unpopular but from thi confus divis and the unpopular of the foreign command in chief there result on the on hand indecis and the avoid of a battl which we could not have refrain from had the armi been unit and had someon els instead of barclai been in command and on the other an everincreas indign against the foreign and an increas in patriot zeal at last the emperor left the armi and as the most conveni and inde the onli pretext for hi departur it wa decid that it wa necessari for him to inspir the peopl in the capit and arous the nation in gener to a patriot war and by thi visit of the emperor to moscow the strength of the russian armi wa trebl he left in order not to obstruct the command in chief s undivid control of the armi and hope that more decis action would then be taken but the command of the armi becam still more confus and enfeebl bennigsen the tsar vich and a swarm of adjut gener remain with the armi to keep the command in chief under observ and arous hi energi and barclai feel less free than ever under the observ of all these ey of the emperor becam still more cautiou of undertak ani decis action and avoid give battl barclai stood for caution the tsar vich hint at treacheri and demand a gener engag lubom rski bronn tski wlocki and the other of that group stir up so much troubl that barclai under pretext of send paper to the emperor dispatch these polish adjut gener to petersburg and plung into an open struggl with bennigsen and the tsar vich at smol nsk the armi at last reunit much as bagrati n dislik it bagrati n drove up in a carriag to the hous occupi by barclai barclai don hi sash and came out to meet and report to hi senior offic bagrati n despit hi senior in rank bagrati n in thi contest of magnanim took hi order from barclai but have submit agre with him

battl and while we were look for the french have lost touch with them the french stumbl upon nev rovski s divis and reach the wall of smol nsk it wa necessari to fight an unexpect battl at smol nsk to save our line of commun the battl wa fought and thousand were kill on both side smol nsk wa abandon contrari to the wish of the emperor and of the whole peopl but smol nsk wa burn by it own inhabit who had been misl by their governor and these ruin inhabit set an exampl to other russian went to moscow think onli of their own loss but kindl hatr of the foe napoleon advanc farther and we retir thu arriv at the veri result which caus hi destruct chapter ii the dai after hi son had left princ nichola sent for princess mari to come to hi studi well ar you satisfi now said he you ve made me quarrel with my son satisfi ar you that s all you want satisfi it hurt me it hurt i m old and weak and thi is what you want well then gloat over it gloat over it after that princess mari did not see her father for a whole week he wa ill and did not leav hi studi princess mari notic to her surpris that dure thi ill the old princ not onli exclud her from hi room but did not admit mademoisel bourienn either t khon alon attend him at the end of the week the princ reappear and resum hi former wai of life devot himself with special activ to build oper and the arrang of the garden and complet break off hi relat with mademoisel bourienn hi look and cold tone to hi daughter seem to sai there you see you plot against me you li to princ andrew about my relat with that frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him but you see i need neither her nor you princess mari spent half of everi dai with littl nichola watch hi lesson teach him russian and music herself and talk to dessal the rest of the dai she spent over her book with her old nurs or with god s folk who sometim came by the back door to see her of the war princess mari thought as women do think about war she fear for her brother who wa in it wa horrifi by and amaz at the strang cruelti that impel men to kill on anoth but she did not understand the signific of thi war which seem to her like all previou war she did not realiz the signific of thi war though dessal with whom she constantli convers wa passion interest in it progress and tri to explain hi own concept of it to her and though the god s folk who came to see her report in their own wai the rumor current among the peopl of an invas by antichrist and though juli now princess drubetsk ya who had resum correspond with her wrote patriot letter from moscow i write you in russian my good friend wrote juli in her frenchifi russian becaus i have a detest for all the french and the same for their languag which i cannot support to hear spoken we in moscow ar elat by

sophi sit whole dai with me and we unhappi widow of live men make beauti convers over our charpi onli you my friend ar miss and so on the chief reason princess mari did not realiz the full signific of thi war wa that the old princ never spoke of it did not recogn it and laugh at dessal when he mention it at dinner the princ s tone wa so calm and confid that princess mari unhesitatingli believ him all that juli the old princ wa exceedingli activ and even anim he plan anoth garden and began a new build for the domest serf the onli thing that made princess mari anxiou about him wa that he slept

two voic that speak with equal power in the human soul on veri reason tell a man to consid the natur of the danger and the mean of escap it the other still more reason sai that it is too depress and

to himself at the sight of the tortur frenchman and the crowd surround the l bnoe place pierr had so definit made up hi mind that he could no longer remain in moscow and would leav for the armi that veri dai that it seem to him that either he had told the coachman thi or that the man ought to have known it for himself on reach home pierr gave order to evst fei hi head coachman who knew everyth could do anyth and wa known to all moscow that he would leav that night for the armi at mozh ysk and that hi saddl hors should be sent there thi could not all be arrang that dai so on evst fei s represent pierr had to put off hi departur till next dai to allow time for the relai hors to be sent on in advanc on the twentyfourth the weather clear up after a spell of rain and after dinner pierr left moscow when chang hors that night in perkh shkovo he learn that there had been a great battl that even thi wa the battl of shev rdino he wa told that there in perkh shkovo the earth trembl from the fire but nobodi could answer hi question as to who had won at dawn next dai pierr wa approach mozh ysk everi hous in mozh ysk had soldier quarter in it and at the hostel where pierr wa met by hi groom and coachman there wa no room to be had it wa full of offic everywher in mozh ysk and beyond it troop were station or on the march cossack foot and hors soldier wagon caisson and cannon were everywher pierr push forward as fast as he could and the farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plung into that sea of troop the more wa he overcom by restless agit and a new and joy feel he had not experienc befor it wa a feel akin to what he had felt at the slob da palac dure the emperor s visit a sens of the necess of undertak someth and sacrif someth he now experienc a glad conscious that everyth that constitut men s happi the comfort of life wealth even life itself is rubbish it is pleasant to throw awai compar with someth with what pierr could not sai and he did not try to determin for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrif everyth he wa not occupi with the question of what to sacrific for the fact of sacrif in itself afford him a new and joyou sensat chapter xix on the twentyfourth of august the battl of the shev rdino redoubt wa fought on the twentyfifth not a shot wa fire by either side and on the twentysixth the battl of borodin itself took place why and how were the battl of shev rdino and borodin given and accept why wa the battl of borodin fought there wa not the least sens in it for either the french or the russian it immedi result for the russian wa and wa bound to be that we were brought nearer to the destruct of moscow which we fear more than anyth in the world and for the french it immedi result wa that thei were brought nearer to the destruct of their whole armi which thei fear more than anyth in the world what the result must be wa quit obviou and yet napoleon offer and kut zov accept that battl if the command had been guid by reason it would seem that it must have been obviou to napoleon that by advanc thirteen hundr mile and give battl with a probabl of lose a quarter of hi armi he wa advanc to certain destruct and it must have been equal clear to kut zov that by accept battl and risk the loss of a quarter of hi armi he would certainli lose moscow for kut zov thi wa mathemat clear as it is that if when plai draught i have on man less and go on exchang i shall certainli lose and therefor should not exchang when my oppon ha sixteen men and i have fourteen i am onli on eighth weaker than he but when i have exchang thirteen more men he will be three time as strong as i am befor the battl of borodin our strength in proport to the french wa about as five to six but after that battl it wa littl more than on to two previous we had a hundr thousand against a hundr and twenti thousand afterward littl more than fifti thousand against a hundr thousand yet the shrewd and experienc kut zov accept the battl while napoleon who wa said to be a command of geniu gave it lose a quarter of hi armi and lengthen hi line of commun still more if it is said that he expect to end the campaign by occupi moscow as he had end a previou campaign by occupi vienna there is much evid to the contrari napoleon s historian themselv tell us that from smol nsk onward he wish to stop knew the danger of hi extend posit and knew that the occup of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he had seen at smol nsk the state in which russian town were left to him and had not receiv a singl repli to hi repeat announc of hi wish to negoti in give and accept battl at borodin kut zov act involuntarili and irration but later on to fit what had occur the historian provid cunningli devis evid of the foresight and geniu of the gener who of all the blind tool of histori were the most enslav and involuntari the ancient have left us model heroic poem in which the hero furnish the whole interest of the stori and we ar still unabl to accustom ourselv to the fact that for our epoch histori of that kind ar meaningless on the other question how the battl of borodin and the preced battl of shev rdino were fought there also exist a definit and wellknown but quit fals concept all the historian describ the affair as follow the russian armi thei sai in it retreat from smol nsk sought out for itself the best posit for a gener engag and found such a posit at borodin the russian thei sai fortifi thi posit in advanc on the left of the highroad from moscow to smol nsk and almost at a right angl to it from borodin to ut tsa at the veri place where the battl wa fought in front of thi posit thei sai a fortifi outpost wa set up on the shev rdino mound to observ the enemi on the twentyfourth we ar told napoleon attack thi advanc post and took it and on the twentysixth attack the whole russian armi which wa in posit on the field of borodin so the histori sai and it is all quit wrong as anyon who care to look into the matter can easili convinc himself the russian did not seek out the best posit but on the contrari dure the retreat pass mani posit better than borodin thei did not stop at ani on of these posit becaus kut zov did not wish to occupi a posit he had not himself chosen becaus the popular demand for a battl had not yet express itself strongli enough and becaus milor dovich had not yet arriv with the militia and for mani other reason the fact is that other posit thei had pass were stronger and that the posit at borodin the on where the battl wa fought far from be strong wa no more a posit than ani other spot on might find in the russian empir by stick a pin into the map at hazard not onli did the russian not fortifi the posit on the field of borodin to the left of and at a right angl to the highroad that is the posit on which the battl took place but never till the twentyfifth of august did thei think that a battl might be fought there thi wa shown first by the fact that there were no entrench there by the twenti fifth and that those begun on the twentyfifth and twentysixth were not complet and secondli by the posit of the shev rdino redoubt that redoubt wa quit senseless in front of the posit where the battl wa accept why wa it more strongli fortifi than ani other post and why were all effort exhaust and six thousand men sacrif to defend it till late at night on the twentyfourth a cossack patrol would have suffic to observ the enemi thirdli as proof that the posit on which the battl wa fought had not been foreseen and that the shev rdino redoubt wa not an advanc post of that posit we have the fact that up to the twentyfifth barclai de tolli and bagrati n were convinc that the shev rdino redoubt wa the left flank of the posit and that kut zov himself in hi report written in hot hast after the battl speak of the shev rdino redoubt as the left flank of the posit it wa much later when report on the battl of borodin were written at leisur that the incorrect and extraordinari statement wa invent probabl to justifi the mistak of a command in chief who had to be repres as infal that the shev rdino redoubt wa an advanc post wherea in realiti it wa simpli a fortifi point on the left flank and that the battl of borodin wa fought by us on an entrench posit previous select wherea it wa fought on a quit unexpect spot which wa almost unentrench the case wa evid thi a posit wa select along the river koloch which cross the highroad not at a right angl but at an acut angl so that the left flank wa at shev rdino the right flank near the villag of n voe and the center at borodin at the confluenc of the river koloch and v yna to anyon who look at the field of borodin without think of how the battl wa actual fought thi posit protect by the river koloch present itself as obviou for an armi whose object wa to prevent an enemi from advanc along the smol nsk road to moscow napoleon ride to val evo on the twentyfourth did not see as the histori book sai he did the posit of the russian from ut tsa to borodin he could not have seen that posit becaus it did not exist nor did he see an advanc post of the russian armi but while pursu the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the russian posit at the shev rdino redoubt and unexpectedli for the russian move hi armi across the koloch and the russian not have time to begin a gener engag withdrew their left wing from the posit thei had intend to occupi and took up a new posit which had not been foreseen and wa not fortifi by cross to the other side of the koloch to the left of the highroad napoleon shift the whole forthcom battl from right to left look from the russian side and transfer it to the plain between ut tsa sem novsk and borodin a plain no more advantag as a posit than ani other plain in russia and there the whole battl of the twentysixth of august took place had napoleon not ridden out on the even of the twentyfourth to the koloch and had he not then order an immedi attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morn no on would have doubt that the shev rdino redoubt wa the left flank of our posit and the battl would have taken place where we expect it in that case we should probabl have defend the shev rdino redoubt our left flank still more obstin we should have attack napoleon in the center or on the right and the engag would have taken place on the twentyfifth in the posit we intend and had fortifi but as the attack on our left flank took place in the even after the retreat of our rear guard that is immedi after the fight at gridn va and as the russian command did not wish or were not in time to begin a gener engag then on the even of the twentyfourth the first and chief action of the battl of borodin wa alreadi lost on the twentyfourth and obvious led to the loss of the on fought on the twentysixth after the loss of the shev rdino redoubt we found ourselv on the morn of the twentyfifth without a posit for our left flank and were forc to bend it back and hastili entrench it where it chanc to be not onli wa the russian armi on the twentysixth defend by weak unfinish entrench but the disadvantag of that posit wa increas by the fact that the russian command not have fulli realiz what had happen name the loss of our posit on the left flank and the shift of the whole field of the forthcom battl from right to left maintain their extend posit from the villag of n voe to ut tsa and consequ had to move their forc from right to left dure the battl so it happen that throughout the whole battl the russian oppos the entir french armi launch against our left flank with but half as mani men poniatowski s action against ut tsa and uv rov s on the right flank against the french were action distinct from the main cours of the battl so the battl of borodin did not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our command mistak even at the cost of diminish the glori due to the russian armi and peopl it ha been describ the battl of borodin wa not fought on a chosen and entrench posit with forc onli slightli weaker than those of the enemi but as a result of the loss of the shev rdino redoubt the russian fought the battl of borodin on an open and almost unentrench posit with forc onli half as numer as the french that is to sai under condit in which it wa not mere unthink to fight for ten hour and secur an indecis result but unthink to keep an armi even from complet disintegr and flight chapter xx on the morn of the twentyfifth pierr wa leav mozh ysk at the descent of the high steep hill down which a wind road led out of the town past the cathedr on the right where a servic wa be held and the bell were ring pierr got out of hi vehicl and proceed on foot behind him a cavalri regiment wa come down the hill preced by it singer come up toward him wa a train of cart carri men who had been wound in the engag the dai befor the peasant driver shout and lash their hors kept cross from side

understand militari matter listen to bennigsen and the gener critic the posit of the troop behind the hill he quit understood them and share their opinion but for that veri reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpabl a blunder pierr did not know that these troop were not as bennigsen suppos put there to defend the posit

sai your father ha a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfi your father s requir better than you could then it s all right to let him serv but if your father is mortal sick you ll send the valet awai and attend to your father with your own unpract awkward hand and will sooth him better than a skill man who is a stranger could so it ha been with barclai while russia wa well a foreign could serv her and be a splendid minist but as soon as she is in danger she need on of her own kin but in your club thei have been make him out a traitor thei slander him as a traitor and the onli result will be that afterward asham of their fals accus thei will make him out a hero or a geniu instead of a traitor and that will be still more unjust he is an honest and veri punctili german and thei sai he s a skill command rejoin pierr i don t understand what is meant by a skill command repli princ andrew iron a skill command repli pierr why on who forese all conting and forese the adversari s intent but that s imposs said princ andrew as if it were a matter settl long ago pierr look at him in surpris and yet thei sai that war is like a game of chess he remark ye repli princ andrew but with thi littl differ that in chess you mai think over each move as long as you pleas and ar not limit for time and with thi differ too that a knight is alwai stronger than a pawn and two pawn ar alwai stronger than on while in war a battalion is sometim stronger than a divis and sometim weaker than a compani the rel strength of bodi of troop can never be known to anyon believ me he went on if thing depend on arrang made by the staff i should be there make arrang but instead of that i have the honor to serv here in the regiment with these gentlemen and i consid that on us tomorrow s battl will depend and not on those other success never depend and never will depend on posit or equip or even on number and least of all on posit but on what then on the feel that is in me and in him he point to tim khin and in each soldier princ andrew glanc at tim khin who look at hi command in alarm and bewilder in contrast to hi former retic taciturn princ andrew now seem excit he could appar not refrain from express the thought that had suddenli occur to him a battl is won by those who firmli resolv to win it why did we lose the battl at austerlitz the french loss were almost equal to our but veri earli we said to ourselv that we were lose the battl and we did lose it and we said so becaus we had noth to fight for there we want to get awai from the battlefield as soon as we could we ve lost so let us run and we ran if we had not said that till the even heaven know what might not have happen but tomorrow we shan t sai it you talk about our posit the left flank weak and the right flank too extend he went on that s all nonsens there s noth of the kind but what await us tomorrow a hundr million most divers chanc which will be decid on the instant by the fact that our men or their run or do not run and that thi man or that man is kill but all that is be done at present is onli plai the fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the posit not onli do not help matter but hinder thei ar onli concern with their own petti interest at such a moment said pierr reproachfulli at such a moment princ andrew repeat to them it is onli a moment afford opportun to undermin a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon for me tomorrow mean thi a russian armi of a hundr thousand and a french armi of a hundr thousand have met to fight and the thing is that these two hundr thousand men will fight and the side that fight more fierc and spare itself least will win and if you like i will tell you that whatev happen and whatev muddl those at the top mai make we shall win tomorrow s battl tomorrow happen what mai we shall win there now your excel that s the truth the real truth said tim khin who would spare himself now the soldier in my battalion believ me wouldn t drink their vodka it s not the dai for that thei sai all were silent the offic rose princ andrew went out of the shed with them give final order to the adjut after thei had gone pierr approach princ andrew and wa about to start a convers when thei heard the clatter of three hors hoof on the road not far from the shed and look in that direct princ andrew recogn wolzogen and clausewitz accompani by a cossack thei rode close by continu to convers and princ andrew involuntarili heard these word der krieg muss in raum verlegt werden der ansicht kann ich nicht genug prei geben said on of them the war must be extend wide i cannot suffici commend that view oh ja said the other der zweck ist nur den feind zu schw chen so kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der privatpersonen in achtung nehmen oh ye the onli aim is to weaken the enemi so of cours on cannot take into account the loss of privat individu oh no agre the other extend wide said princ andrew with an angri snort when thei had ridden past in that extend were my father son and sister at bald hill that s all the same to him that s what i wa sai to you those german gentlemen won t win the battl tomorrow but will onli make all the mess thei can becaus thei have noth in their german head but theori not worth an empti eggshel and haven t in their heart the on thing need tomorrow that which tim khin ha thei have yield up all europ to him and have now come to teach us fine teacher and again hi voic grew shrill so you think we shall win tomorrow s battl ask pierr ye ye answer princ andrew absent on thing i would do if i had the power he began again i would not take prison why take prison it s chivalri the french have destroi my home and ar on their wai to destroi moscow thei have outrag and ar outrag me everi moment thei ar my enemi in my opinion thei ar all crimin and so think tim khin and the whole armi thei should be execut sinc thei ar my foe thei cannot be my friend whatev mai have been said at tilsit ye ye mutter pierr look with shine ey at princ andrew i quit agre with you the question that had perturb pierr on the mozh ysk hill and all that dai now seem to him quit clear and complet solv he now understood the whole mean and import of thi war and of the impend battl all he had seen that dai all the signific and stern express on the face he had seen in pass were lit up for him by a new light he understood that latent heat as thei sai in physic of patriot which wa present in all these men he had seen and thi explain to him why thei all prepar for death calmli and as it were lightheartedli not take prison princ andrew continu that by itself would quit chang the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we have plai at war that s what s vile we plai at magnanim and all that stuff such magnanim and sensibl ar like the magnanim and sensibl of a ladi who faint when she see a calf be kill she is so kindheart that she can t look at blood but enjoi eat the calf serv up with sauc thei talk to us of the rule of war of chivalri of flag of truce of merci to the unfortun and so on it s all rubbish i saw chivalri and flag of truce in thei humbug us and we humbug them thei plunder other peopl s hous issu fals paper monei and worst of all thei kill my children and my father and then talk of rule of war and magnanim to foe take no prison but kill and be kill he who ha come to thi as i have through the same suffer princ andrew who had thought it wa all the same to him whether or not moscow wa taken as smol nsk had been wa suddenli check in hi speech by an unexpect cramp in hi throat he pace up and down a few time in silenc but hi ey glitter feverishli and hi lip quiver as he began speak if there wa none of thi magnanim in war we should go to war onli when it wa worth while go to certain death as now then there would not be war becaus paul iv novich had offend michael iv novich and when there wa a war like thi on it would be war and then the determin of the troop would be quit differ then all these westphalian and hessian whom napoleon is lead would not follow him into russia and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia without know why war is not courtesi but the most horribl thing in life and we ought to understand that and not plai at war we ought to accept thi terribl necess sternli and serious it all li in that get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game as it is now war is the favorit pastim of the idl and frivol the militari call is the most highli honor but what is war what is need for success in warfar what ar the habit of the militari

meanwhil were busili engag arrang the present he had brought from the empress on two chair directli in front of the entranc but napoleon had dress and come out with such unexpect rapid that he had not time to finish arrang the surpris napoleon notic at onc what thei were about and guess that thei were not readi he did not wish to depriv them of the pleasur of give him a surpris so he pretend not to see de beausset and call fabvier to him listen silent and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him of the heroism and devot of hi troop fight at salamanca at the other end of europ with but on thought to be worthi of their emperor and but on fear to fail to pleas him the result of that battl had been deplor napoleon made iron remark dure fabvier s account as if he had not expect that matter could go otherwis in hi absenc i must make up for that in moscow said napoleon i ll see you later he ad and summon de beausset who by that time had prepar the surpris have place someth on the chair and cover it with a cloth de beausset bow low with that courtli french bow which onli the old retain of the bourbon knew how to make and approach him present an envelop napoleon turn to him gaili and pull hi ear you have hurri here i am veri glad well what is pari sai he ask suddenli chang hi former stern express for a most cordial tone sire all pari regret your absenc repli de beausset as wa

ha what s thi ask napoleon notic that all the courtier were look at someth conceal under a cloth with courtli adroit de beausset half turn and without turn hi back to the emperor retir two step twitch off the cloth at the same time and said a present to your majesti from the empress it wa a portrait paint in bright color by g rard of the son born to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the boi whom for some reason everyon call the king of rome a veri pretti curlyhead boi with a look of the christ in the sistin madonna wa depict plai at stick and ball the ball repres the terrestri globe and the stick in hi other hand a scepter though it wa not clear what the artist meant to express by depict the socal king of rome spike the earth with a stick the allegori appar seem to napoleon as it had done to all who had seen it in pari quit clear and veri pleas the king of rome he said point to the portrait with a grace gestur admir with the natur capac of an italian for chang the express of hi face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assum a look of pensiv tender he felt that what he now said and did would be histor and it seem to him that it would now be best for him whose grandeur enabl hi son to plai stick and ball with the terrestri globe to show in contrast to that grandeur the simplest patern tender hi ey grew dim he move forward glanc round at a chair which seem to place itself under him and sat down on it befor the portrait at a singl gestur from him everyon went out on tipto leav the great man to himself and hi emot have sat still for a while he touch himself not know why the thick spot of paint repres the highest light in the portrait rose and recal de beausset and the offic on duti he order the portrait to be carri outsid hi tent that the old guard station round it might not be depriv of the pleasur of see the king of rome the son and heir of their ador monarch and while he wa do m de beausset the honor of breakfast with him thei heard as napoleon had anticip the raptur cri of the offic and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portrait vive l empereur vive le roi de rome vive l empereur came those ecstat cri after breakfast napoleon in de beausset s presenc dictat hi order of the dai to the armi short and energet he remark when he had read over the proclam which he had dictat straight off without correct it ran soldier thi is the battl you have so long for victori depend on you it is essenti for us it will give us all we need comfort quarter and a speedi return to our countri behav as you did at austerlitz friedland v tebsk and smol nsk let our remotest poster recal your achiev thi dai with pride let it be said of each of you he wa in the great battl befor moscow befor moscow repeat napoleon and invit m de beausset who wa so fond of travel to accompani him on hi ride he went out of the tent to where the hors stood saddl your majesti is too kind repli de beausset to the invit to accompani the emperor he want to sleep did not know how to ride and wa afraid of do so but napoleon nod to the travel and de beausset had to mount when napoleon came out of the tent the shout of the guard befor hi son s portrait grew still louder napoleon frown take him awai he said point with a gracefulli majest gestur to the portrait it is too soon for him to see a field of battl de beausset close hi ey bow hi head and sigh deepli to indic how profoundli he valu and comprehend the emperor s word chapter xxvii on the twentyfifth of august so hi historian tell us napoleon spent the whole dai on horseback inspect the local consid plan submit to him by hi marshal and person give command to hi gener the origin line of the russian forc along the river koloch had been disloc by the captur of the shev rdino redoubt on the twentyfourth and part of the line the left flank had been drawn back that part of the line wa not entrench and in front of it the ground wa more open and level than elsewher it wa evid to anyon militari or not that it wa here the french should attack it would seem that not much consider wa need to reach thi conclus nor ani particular care or troubl on the part of the emperor and hi marshal nor wa there ani need of that special and suprem qualiti call geniu that peopl ar so apt to ascrib to napoleon yet the historian who describ the event later and the men who then surround napoleon and he himself thought otherwis napoleon rode over the plain and survei the local with a profound air and in silenc nod with approv or shook hi head dubious and without commun to the gener around him the profound cours of idea which guid hi decis mere gave them hi final conclus in the form of command have listen to a suggest from davout who wa now call princ d eckm hl to turn the russian left wing napoleon said it should not be done without explain why not to a propos made by gener campan who wa to attack the fl che to lead hi divis through the wood napoleon agre though the socal duke of elchingen nei ventur to remark that a movement through the wood wa danger and might disord the divis have inspect the countri opposit the shev rdino redoubt napoleon ponder a littl in silenc and then indic the spot where two batteri should be set up by the morrow to act against the russian entrench and the place where in line with them the field artilleri should be place after give these and other command he return to hi tent and the disposit for the battl were written down from hi dictat these disposit of which the french historian write with enthusiasm and other historian with profound respect were as follow at dawn the two new batteri establish dure the night on the plain occupi by the princ d eckm hl will open fire on the oppos batteri of the enemi at the same time the command of the artilleri of the st corp gener pernetti with thirti cannon of campan s divis and all the howitz of dessaix s and friant s divis will move forward open fire and overwhelm with shellfir the enemi s batteri against which will oper gun of the artilleri of the guard gun of campan s divis and gun of friant s and dessaix s divis in all gun the command of the artilleri of the rd corp gener fouch will place the howitz of the rd and th corp sixteen in all on the flank of the batteri that is to bombard the entrench on the left which will have forti gun in all direct against it gener sorbier must be readi at the first order to advanc with all the howitz of the guard s artilleri against either on or other of the entrench dure the cannonad princ poniatowski is to advanc through the wood on the villag and turn the enemi s posit gener campan will move through the wood to seiz the first fortif after the advanc ha begun in thi manner order will be given in accord with the enemi s movement the cannonad on the left flank will begin as soon as the gun of the right wing ar heard the sharpshoot of morand s divis and of the vicek s divis will open a heavi fire on see the attack commenc on the right wing the vicek will occupi the villag and cross by it three bridg advanc to the same height as morand s and gibrard s divis which under hi leadership will be direct against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forc all thi must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordr et m thode as far as possibl retain troop in reserv the imperi camp near mozh ysk septemb these disposit which ar veri obscur and confus if on allow oneself to regard the arrang without religi aw of hi geniu relat to napoleon s order to deal with four point four differ order not on of these wa or could be carri out in the disposit it is said first that the batteri place on the spot chosen by napoleon with the gun of pernetti and fouch which were to come in line with them gun in all were to open fire and shower shell on the russian fl che and redoubt thi could not be done as from the spot select by napoleon the projectil did not carri to the russian work and those gun shot into the air until the nearest command contrari to napoleon s instruct move them forward the second order wa that poniatowski move to the villag through the wood should turn the russian left flank thi could not be done and wa not done becaus poniatowski advanc on the villag through the wood met t chkov there bar hi wai and could not and did not turn the russian posit the third order wa gener campan will move through the wood to seiz the first fortif gener campan s divis did not seiz the first fortif but wa driven back for on emerg from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon wa unawar the fourth order wa the vicek will occupi the villag borodin and cross by it three bridg advanc to the same height as morand s and g rard s divis for whose movement no direct ar given which under hi leadership will be direct against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forc as far as on can make out not so much from thi unintellig sentenc as from the attempt the vicek made to execut the order given him he wa to advanc from the left through borodin to the redoubt while the divis of morand and g rard were to advanc simultan from the front all thi like the other part of the disposit wa not and could not be execut after pass through borodin the vicek wa driven back to the koloch and could get no farther while the divis of morand and g rard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and the redoubt wa onli taken at the end of the battl by the cavalri a thing probabl unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon so not on of the order in the disposit wa or could be execut but in the disposit it is said that after the fight ha commenc in thi manner order will be given in accord with the enemi s movement and so it might be suppos that all necessari arrang would be made by napoleon dure the battl but thi wa not and could not be done for dure the whole battl napoleon wa so far awai that as appear later he could not know the cours of the battl and not on of hi order dure the fight could be execut chapter xxviii mani historian sai that the french did not win the battl of borodin becaus napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold the order he gave befor and dure the battl would have been still more full of geniu and russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been chang to historian who believ that russia wa shape by the will of on man peter the great and that franc from a republ becam an empir and french armi went to russia at the will of on man napoleon to sai that russia remain a power becaus napoleon had a bad cold on the twentyfourth of august mai seem logic and convinc if it had depend on napoleon s will to fight or not to fight the battl of borodin and if thi or that other arrang depend on hi will then evid a cold affect the manifest of hi will might have save russia and consequ the valet who omit to bring napoleon hi waterproof boot on the twentyfourth would have been the savior of russia along that line of thought such a deduct is indubit as indubit as the deduct voltair made in jest without know what he wa jest at when he saw that the massacr of st bartholomew wa due to charl ix s stomach be derang but to men who do not admit that russia wa form by the will of on man peter i or that the french empir wa form and the war with russia begun by the will of on man napoleon that argument seem not mere untru and irrat but contrari to all human realiti to the question of what caus histor event anoth answer present itself name that the cours of human event is predetermin from on high depend on the coincid of the will of all who take part in the event and that a napoleon s influenc on the cours of these event is pure extern and fictiti strang as at first glanc it mai seem to suppos that the massacr of st bartholomew wa not due to charl ix s will though he gave the order for it and thought it wa done as a result of that order and strang as it mai seem to suppos that the slaughter of eighti thousand men at borodin wa not due to napoleon s will though he order the commenc and conduct of the battl and thought it wa done becaus he order it strang as these supposit appear yet human digniti which tell me that each of us is if not more at least not less a man than the great napoleon demand the accept of that solut of the question and histor investig abundantli confirm it at the battl of borodin napoleon shot at no on and kill no on that wa all done by the soldier therefor it wa not he who kill peopl the french soldier went to kill and be kill at the battl of borodin not becaus of napoleon s order but by their own volit the whole armi french italian german polish and dutch hungri rag and weari of the campaign felt at the sight of an armi block their road to moscow that the wine wa drawn and must be drunk had napoleon then forbidden them to fight the russian thei would have kill him and have proceed to fight the russian becaus it wa inevit when thei heard napoleon s proclam offer them as compens for mutil and death the word of poster about their have been in the battl befor moscow thei cri vive l empereur just as thei had cri vive l empereur at the sight of the portrait of the boi pierc the terrestri globe with a toi stick and just as thei would have cri vive l empereur at ani nonsens that might be told them there wa noth left for them to do but cry vive l empereur and go to fight in order to get food and rest as conqueror in moscow so it wa not becaus of napoleon s command that thei kill their fellow men and it wa not napoleon who direct the cours of the battl for none of hi order were execut and dure the battl he did not know what wa go on befor him so the wai in which these peopl kill on anoth wa not decid by napoleon s will but occur independ of him in accord with the will of hundr of thousand of peopl who took part in the common action it onli seem to napoleon that it all took place by hi will and so the question whether he had or had not a cold ha no more histor interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldier moreov the assert made by variou writer that hi cold wa the caus of hi disposit not be as wellplan as on former occas and of hi order dure the battl not be as good as previous is quit baseless which again show that napoleon s cold on the twentysixth of august wa unimport the disposit cite abov ar not at all wors but ar even better than previou disposit by which he had won victori hi pseudoord dure the battl were also no wors than formerli but much the same as usual these disposit and order onli seem wors than previou on becaus the battl of borodin wa the first napoleon did not win the profoundest and most excel disposit and order seem veri bad and everi learn militarist critic them with look of import when thei relat to a battl that ha been lost and the veri worst disposit and order seem veri good and seriou peopl fill whole volum to demonstr their merit when thei relat to a battl that ha been won the disposit drawn up by weyroth for the battl of austerlitz were a model of perfect for that kind of composit but still thei were critic critic for their veri perfect for their excess minut napoleon at the battl of borodin fulfil hi offic as repres of author as well as and even better than at other battl he did noth harm to the progress of the battl he inclin to the most reason opinion he made no confus did not contradict himself did not get frighten or run awai from the field of battl but with hi great tact and militari experi carri out hi role of appear to command calmli and with digniti chapter xxix on return from a second inspect of the line napoleon remark the chessmen ar set up the game will begin tomorrow have order punch and summon de beausset he began to talk to him about pari and about some chang he meant to make in the empress household surpris the prefect by hi memori of minut detail relat to the court he show an interest in trifl joke about de beausset s love

some second thei gaze with frighten ey at on anoth s unfamiliar face and both were perplex at what thei had done and what thei were to do next am i taken prison or have i taken him prison each wa

sai someth when just abov their head terribl and low a cannon ball whistl and it seem to pierr that the french offic s head had been torn off so swiftli had he duck it pierr too bent hi head and let hi hand fall without further thought as to who had taken whom prison the frenchman ran back to the batteri and pierr ran down the slope stumbl over the dead and wound who it seem to him caught at hi feet but befor he reach the foot of the knoll he wa met by a dens crowd of russian soldier who stumbl trip up and shout ran merrili and wildli toward the batteri thi wa the attack for which erm lov claim the credit declar that onli hi courag and good luck made such a feat possibl it wa the attack in which he wa said to have thrown some st georg s cross he had in hi pocket into the batteri for the first soldier to take who got there the french who had occupi the batteri fled and our troop shout hurrah pursu them so far beyond the batteri that it wa difficult to call them back the prison were brought down from the batteri and among them wa a wound french gener whom the offic surround crowd of wound some known to pierr and some unknown russian and french with face distort by suffer walk crawl and were carri on stretcher from the batteri pierr again went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hour and of that famili circl which had receiv him as a member he did not find a singl on there were mani dead whom he did not know but some he recogn the young offic still sat in the same wai bent doubl in a pool of blood at the edg of the earth wall the redfac man wa still twitch but thei did not carri him awai pierr ran down the slope onc more now thei will stop it now thei will be horrifi at what thei have done he thought aimlessli go toward a crowd of stretcher bearer move from the battlefield but behind the veil of smoke the sun wa still high and in front and especi to the left near sem novsk someth seem to be seeth in the smoke and the roar of cannon and musketri did not diminish but even increas to desper like a man who strain himself shriek with all hi remain strength chapter xxxiii the chief action of the battl of borodin wa fought within the seven thousand feet between borodin and bagrati n s fl che beyond that space there wa on the on side a demonstr made by the russian with uv rov s cavalri at middai and on the other side beyond ut tsa poniatowski s collis with t chkov but these two were detach and feebl action in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield on the field between borodin and the fl che besid the wood the chief action of the dai took place on an open space visibl from both side and wa fought in the simplest and most artless wai the battl began on both side with a cannonad from sever hundr gun then when the whole field wa cover with smoke two divis campan s and dessaix s advanc from the french right while murat s troop advanc on borodin from their left from the shev rdino redoubt where napoleon wa stand the fl che were two third of a mile awai and it wa more than a mile as the crow fli to borodin so that napoleon could not see what wa happen there especi as the smoke mingl with the mist hid the whole local the soldier of dessaix s divis advanc against the fl che could onli be seen till thei had enter the hollow that lai between them and the fl che as soon as thei had descend into that hollow the smoke of the gun and musketri on the fl che grew so dens that it cover the whole approach on that side of it through the smoke glimps could be caught of someth black probabl men and at time the glint of bayonet but whether thei were move or stationari whether thei were french or russian could not be discov from the shev rdino redoubt the sun had risen brightli and it slant rai struck straight into napoleon s face as shade hi ey with hi hand he look at the fl che the smoke spread out befor them and at time it look as if the smoke were move at time as if the troop move sometim shout were heard through the fire but it wa imposs to tell what wa be done there napoleon stand on the knoll look through a field glass and in it small circlet saw smoke and men sometim hi own and sometim russian but when he look again with the nake ey he could not tell where what he had seen wa he descend the knoll and began walk up and down befor it occasion he stop listen to the fire and gaze intent at the battlefield but not onli wa it imposs to make out what wa happen from where he wa stand down below or from the knoll abov on which some of hi gener had taken their stand but even from the fl che themselv in which by thi time there were now russian and now french soldier altern or togeth dead wound aliv frighten or madden even at those fl che themselv it wa imposs to make out what wa take place there for sever hour amid incess cannon and musketri fire now russian were seen alon now frenchmen alon now infantri and now cavalri thei appear fire fell collid not know what to do with on anoth scream and ran back again from the battlefield adjut he had sent out and orderli from hi marshal kept gallop up to napoleon with report of the progress of the action but all these report were fals both becaus it wa imposs in the heat of battl to sai what wa happen at ani given moment and becaus mani of the adjut did not go to the actual place of conflict but report what thei had heard from other and also becaus while an adjut wa ride more than a mile to napoleon circumst chang and the new he brought wa alreadi becom fals thu an adjut gallop up from murat with tide that borodin had been occupi and the bridg over the koloch wa in the hand of the french the adjut ask whether napoleon wish the troop to cross it napoleon gave order that the troop should form up on the farther side and wait but befor that order wa given almost as soon in fact as the adjut had left borodin the bridg had been retaken by the russian and burn in the veri skirmish at which pierr had been present at the begin of the battl an adjut gallop up from the fl che with a pale and frighten face and report to napoleon that their attack had been repuls campan wound and davout kill yet at the veri time the adjut had been told that the french had been repuls the fl che had in fact been recaptur by other french troop and davout wa aliv and onli slightli bruis on the basi of these necessarili untrustworthi report napoleon gave hi order which had either been execut befor he gave them or could not be and were not execut the marshal and gener who were nearer to the field of battl but like napoleon did not take part in the actual fight and onli occasion went within musket rang made their own arrang without ask napoleon and issu order where and in what direct to fire and where cavalri should gallop and infantri should run but even their order like napoleon s were seldom carri out and then but partial for the most part thing happen contrari to their order soldier order to advanc ran back on meet grapeshot soldier order to remain where thei were suddenli see russian unexpectedli befor them sometim rush back and sometim forward and the cavalri dash without order in pursuit of the fly russian in thi wai two cavalri regiment gallop through the sem novsk hollow and as soon as thei reach the top of the inclin turn round and gallop full speed back again the infantri move in the same wai sometim run to quit other place than those thei were order to go to all order as to where and when to move the gun when to send infantri to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantri all such order were given by the offic on the spot nearest to the unit concern without ask either nei davout or murat much less napoleon thei did not fear get into troubl for not fulfil order or for act on their own initi for in battl what is at stake is what is dearest to man hi own life and it sometim seem that safeti li in run back sometim in run forward and these men who were right in the heat of the battl act accord to the mood of the moment in realiti howev all these movement forward and backward did not improv or alter the posit of the troop all their rush and gallop at on anoth did littl harm the harm of disabl and death wa caus by the ball and bullet that flew over the field on which these men were flounder about as soon as thei left the place where the ball and bullet were fly about their

and thei all shun on anoth s ey onli a de beausset could fail to grasp the mean of what wa happen but napoleon with hi long experi of war well knew the mean of a battl not gain by the attack side in eight hour after all effort had been expend he knew that it wa a lost battl and that the least accid might now with the fight balanc on such a strain center destroi him and hi armi when he ran hi mind over the whole of thi strang russian campaign in which not on battl had been won and in which not a flag or cannon or armi corp had been captur in two month when he look at the conceal depress on the

unnecessari and horribl on of the gener rode up to napoleon and ventur to offer to lead the old guard into action nei and berthier stand near napoleon exchang look and smile contemptu at thi gener s

from both side crush human bodi and that terribl work which wa not done by the will of a man but at the will of him who govern men and world continu anyon look at the disorgan rear of the russian armi would have said that if onli the french made on more slight effort it would disappear and anyon look at the rear of the french armi would have said that the russian need onli make on more slight effort and the french would be destroi but neither the french nor the russian made that effort and the flame of battl burn slowli out the russian did not make that effort becaus thei were not attack the french at the begin of the battl thei stood block the wai to moscow and thei still did so at the end of the battl as at the begin but even had the aim of the russian been to drive the french from their posit thei could not have made thi last effort for all the russian troop had been broken up there wa no part of the russian armi that had not suffer in the battl and though still hold their posit thei had lost on half of their armi the french with the memori of all their former victori dure fifteen year with the assur of napoleon s invinc with the conscious that thei had captur part of the battlefield and had lost onli a quarter of their men and still had their guard intact twenti thousand strong might easili have made that effort the french who had attack the russian armi in order to drive it from it posit ought to have made that effort for as long as the russian continu to block the road to moscow as befor the aim of the french had not been attain and all their effort and loss were in vain but the french did not make that effort some historian sai that napoleon need onli have us hi old guard who were intact and the battl would have been won to speak of what would have happen had napoleon sent hi guard is like talk of what would happen if autumn becam spring it could not be napoleon did not give hi guard not becaus he did not want to but becaus it could not be done all the gener offic and soldier of the french armi knew it could not be done becaus the flag spirit of the troop would not permit it it wa not napoleon alon who had experienc that nightmar feel of the mighti arm be stricken powerless but all the gener and soldier of hi armi whether thei had taken part in the battl or not after all their experi of previou battl when after on tenth of such effort the enemi had fled experienc a similar feel of terror befor an enemi who after lose half hi men stood as threateningli at the end as at the begin of the battl the moral forc of the attack french armi wa exhaust not that sort of victori which is defin by the captur of piec of materi fasten to stick call standard and of the ground on which the troop had stood and were stand but a moral victori that convinc the enemi of the moral superior of hi oppon and of hi own impot wa gain by the russian at borodin the french invad like an infuri anim that ha in it onslaught receiv a mortal wound felt that thei were perish but could not stop ani more than the russian armi weaker by on half could help swerv by impetu gain the french armi wa still abl to roll forward to moscow but there without further effort on the part of the russian it had to perish bleed from the mortal wound it had receiv at borodin the direct consequ of the battl of borodin wa napoleon s senseless flight from moscow hi retreat along the old smol nsk road the destruct of the invad armi of five hundr thousand men and the downfal of napoleon franc on which at borodin for the first time the hand of an oppon of stronger spirit had been laid book eleven chapter i absolut continu of motion is not comprehens to the human mind law of motion of ani kind becom comprehens to man onli when he examin arbitrarili select element of that motion but at the same time a larg proport of human error come from the arbitrari divis of continu motion into discontinu element there is a wellknown socal sophism of the ancient consist in thi that achil could never catch up with a tortois he wa follow in spite of the fact that he travel ten time as fast as the tortois by the time achil ha cover the distanc that separ him from the tortois the tortois ha cover on tenth of that distanc ahead of him when achil ha cover that tenth the tortois ha cover anoth on hundredth and so on forev thi problem seem to the ancient insolubl the absurd answer that achil could never overtak the tortois result from thi that motion wa arbitrarili divid into discontinu element wherea the motion both of achil and of the tortois wa continu by adopt smaller and smaller element of motion we onli approach a solut of the problem but never reach it onli when we have admit the concept of the infinit small and the result geometr progress with a common ratio of on tenth and have found the sum of thi progress to infin do we reach a solut of the problem a modern branch of mathemat have achiev the art of deal with the infinit small can now yield solut in other more complex problem of motion which us to appear insolubl thi modern branch of mathemat unknown to the ancient when deal with problem of motion admit the concept of the infinit small and so conform to the chief condit of motion absolut continu and therebi correct the inevit error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deal with separ element of motion instead of examin continu motion in seek the law of histor movement just the same thing happen the movement of human aris as it doe from innumer arbitrari human will is continu to understand the law of thi continu movement is the aim of histori but to arriv at these law result from the sum of all those human will man s mind postul arbitrari and disconnect unit the first method of histori is to take an arbitrarili select seri of continu event and examin it apart from other though there is and can be no begin to ani event for on event alwai flow uninterruptedli from anoth the second method is to consid the action of some on man a king or a command as equival to the sum of mani individu will wherea the sum of individu will is never express by the activ of a singl histor personag histor scienc in it endeavor to draw nearer to truth continu take smaller and smaller unit for examin but howev small the unit it take we feel that to take ani unit disconnect from other or to assum a begin of ani phenomenon or to sai that the will of mani men is express by the action of ani on histor personag is in itself fals it need no critic exert to reduc utterli to dust ani deduct drawn from histori it is mere necessari to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observ as critic ha everi right to do see that whatev unit histori observ must alwai be arbitrarili select onli by take infinitesim small unit for observ the differenti of histori that is the individu tendenc of men and attain to the art of integr them that is find the sum of these infinitesim can we hope to arriv at the law of histori the first fifteen year of the nineteenth centuri in europ present an extraordinari movement of million of peopl men leav their customari pursuit hasten from on side of europ to the other plunder and slaughter on anoth triumph and ar plung in despair and for some year the whole cours of life is alter and present an intens movement which first increas and then slacken what wa the caus of thi movement by what law wa it govern ask the mind of man the historian repli to thi question lai befor us the sai and do of a few dozen men in a build in the citi of pari call these sai and do the revolut then thei give a detail biographi of napoleon and of certain peopl favor or hostil to him tell of the influenc some of these peopl had on other and sai that is why thi movement took place and those ar it law but the mind of man not onli refus to believ thi explan but plainli sai that thi method of explan is fallaci becaus in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the caus of a stronger the sum of human will produc the revolut and napoleon and onli the sum of those will first toler and then destroi them but everi time there have been conquest there have been conqueror everi time there ha been a revolut in ani state there have been great men sai histori and inde human reason repli everi time conqueror appear there have been war but thi doe not prove that the conqueror caus the war and that it is possibl to find the law of a war in the person activ of a singl man whenev i look at my watch and it hand point to ten i hear the bell of the neighbor church but becaus the bell begin to ring when the hand of the clock reach ten i have no right to assum that the movement of the bell is caus by the posit of the hand of the watch whenev i see the movement of a locomot i hear the whistl and see the valv open and wheel turn but i have no right to conclud that the whistl and the turn of wheel ar the caus of the movement of the engin the peasant sai that a cold wind blow in late spring becaus the oak ar bud and realli everi spring cold wind do blow when the oak is bud but though i do not know what caus the cold wind to blow when the oak bud unfold i cannot agre with the peasant that the unfold of the oak bud is the caus of the cold wind for the forc of the wind is beyond the influenc of the bud i see onli a coincid of occurr such as happen with all the phenomena of life and i see that howev much and howev carefulli i observ the hand of the watch and the valv and wheel of the engin and the oak i shall not discov the caus of the bell ring the engin move or of the wind of spring to that i must entir chang my point of view and studi the law of the movement of steam of the bell and of the wind histori must do the same and attempt in thi direct have alreadi been made to studi the law of histori we must complet chang the subject of our observ must leav asid king minist and gener and studi the common infinitesim small element by which the mass ar move no on can sai in how far it is possibl for man to advanc in thi wai toward an understand of the law of histori but it is evid that onli along that path doe the possibl of discov the law of histori lie and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort ha been appli in thi direct by historian as ha been devot to describ the action of variou king command and minist and propound the historian own reflect concern these action chapter ii the forc of a dozen european nation burst into russia the russian armi and peopl avoid a collis till smol nsk wa reach and again from smol nsk to borodin the french armi push on to moscow it goal it impetu ever increas as it near it aim just as the veloc of a fall bodi increas as it approach the earth behind it were seven hundr mile of hungerstricken hostil countri ahead were a few dozen mile separ it from it goal everi soldier in napoleon s armi felt thi and the invas move on by it own momentum the more the russian armi retreat the more fierc a spirit of hatr of the enemi flare up and while it retreat the armi increas and consolid at borodin a collis took place neither armi wa broken up but the russian armi retreat immedi after the collis as inevit as a ball recoil after collid with anoth have a greater momentum and with equal inevit the ball of invas that had advanc with such momentum roll on for some distanc though the collis had depriv it of all it forc the russian retreat eighti mile to beyond moscow and the french reach moscow and there came to a standstil for five week after that there wa not a singl battl the french did not move as a bleed mortal wound anim lick it wound thei remain inert in moscow for five week and then suddenli with no fresh reason fled back thei made a dash for the kal ga road and after a victori for at m loyarosl vet the field of conflict again remain their without undertak a singl seriou battl thei fled still more rapidli back to smol nsk beyond smol nsk beyond the ber zina beyond v lna and farther still on the even of the twentysixth of august kut zov and the whole russian armi were convinc that the battl of borodin wa a victori kut zov report so to the emperor he gave order to prepar for a fresh conflict to finish the enemi and did thi not to deceiv anyon but becaus he knew that the enemi wa beaten as everyon who had taken part in the battl knew it but all that even and next dai report came in on after anoth of unheardof loss of the loss of half the armi and a fresh battl prove physic imposs it wa imposs to give battl befor inform had been collect the wound gather in the suppli of ammunit replenish the slain reckon up new offic appoint to replac those who had been kill and befor the men had had food and sleep and meanwhil the veri next morn after the battl the french armi advanc of itself upon the russian carri forward by the forc of it own momentum now seemingli increas in invers proport to the squar of the distanc from it aim kut zov s wish wa to attack next dai and the whole armi desir to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not suffici there must also be a possibl of do it and that possibl did not exist it wa imposs not to retreat a dai s march and then in the same wai it wa imposs not to retreat anoth and a third dai s march and at last on the first of septemb when the armi drew near moscow despit the strength of the feel that had arisen in all rank the forc of circumst compel it to retir beyond moscow and the troop retir on more last dai s march and abandon moscow to the enemi for peopl accustom to think that plan of campaign and battl ar made by gener as anyon of us sit over a map in hi studi mai imagin how he would have arrang thing in thi or that battl the question present themselv why did kut zov dure the retreat not do thi or that why did he not take up a posit befor reach fil why did he not retir at onc by the kal ga road abandon moscow and so on peopl accustom to think in that wai forget or do not know the inevit condit which alwai limit the activ of ani command in chief the activ of a command in chief doe not at all resembl the activ we imagin to ourselv when we sit at eas in our studi examin some campaign on the map with a certain number of troop on thi and that side in a certain known local and begin our plan from some given moment a command in chief is never deal with the begin of ani event the posit from which we alwai contempl it the command in chief is alwai in the midst of a seri of shift event and so he never can at ani moment consid the whole import of an event that is occur moment by moment the event is impercept shape itself and at everi moment of thi continu uninterrupt shape of event the command in chief is in the midst of a most complex plai of intrigu worri conting author project counsel threat and decept and is continu oblig to repli to innumer question address to him which constantli conflict with on anoth learn militari author quit serious tell us that kut zov should have move hi armi to the kal ga road long befor reach fil and that somebodi actual submit such a propos to him but a command in chief especi at a difficult moment ha alwai befor him not on propos but dozen simultan and all these propos base on strateg and tactic contradict each other a command in chief s busi it would seem is simpli to choos on of these project but even that he cannot do event and time do not wait for instanc on the twentyeighth it is suggest to him to cross to the kal ga road but just then an adjut gallop up from milor dovich ask whether he is to engag the french or retir an order must be given him at onc that instant and the order to retreat carri us past the turn to the kal ga road and after the adjut come the commissari gener ask where the store ar to be taken and the chief of the hospit ask where the wound ar to go and a courier from petersburg bring a letter from the sovereign which doe not admit of the possibl of abandon moscow and the command in chief s rival the man who is undermin him and there ar alwai not mere on but sever such present a new project diametr oppos to that of turn to the kal ga road and the command in chief himself need sleep and refresh to maintain hi energi and a respect gener who ha been overlook in the distribut of reward come to complain and the inhabit of the district prai to be defend and an offic sent to inspect the local come in and give a report quit contrari to what wa said by the offic previous sent and a spy a prison and a gener who ha been on reconnaiss all describ the posit of the enemi s armi differ peopl accustom to misunderstand or to forget these inevit condit of a command in chief s action describ to us for instanc the posit of the armi at fil and assum that the command in chief could on the first of septemb quit freeli decid whether to abandon moscow or defend it wherea with the russian armi less than four mile from moscow no such question exist when had that question been settl at drissa and at smol nsk and most palpabl of all on the twentyfourth of august at shev rdino and on the twentysixth at borodin and each dai and hour and minut of the retreat from borodin to fil chapter iii when erm lov have been sent by kut zov to inspect the posit told the field marshal that it wa imposs to fight there befor moscow and that thei must retreat kut zov look at him in silenc give me your hand said he and turn it over so as to feel the puls ad you ar not well my dear fellow think what you ar sai kut zov could not yet admit the possibl of retreat beyond moscow without a battl on the pokl nny hill four mile from the dorogom lov gate of moscow kut zov got out of hi carriag and sat down on a bench by the roadsid a great crowd of gener gather round him and count rostopch n who had come out from moscow join them thi brilliant compani separ into sever group who all discuss the advantag and disadvantag of the posit the state of the armi the plan suggest the situat of moscow and militari question gener though thei had not been summon for the purpos and though it wa not so call thei all felt that thi wa realli a council of war the convers all dealt with public question if anyon gave or ask for person new it wa done in a whisper and thei immedi revert to gener matter no joke or laughter or smile even were seen among all these men thei evid all made an effort to hold themselv at the height the situat demand and all these group while talk among themselv tri to keep near the command in chief whose bench form the center of the gather and to speak so that he might overhear them the command in chief listen to what wa be said and sometim ask them to repeat their remark but did not himself take part in the convers or express ani opinion after hear what wa be said by on or other of these group he gener turn awai with an air of disappoint as though thei were not speak of anyth he wish to hear some discuss the posit that had been chosen critic not the posit itself so much as the mental capac of those who had chosen it other argu that a mistak had been made earlier and that a battl should have been fought two dai befor other again spoke of the battl of salamanca which wa describ by crosart a newli arriv frenchman in a spanish uniform thi frenchman and on of the german princ serv with the russian armi were discuss the sieg of saragossa and consid the possibl of defend moscow in a similar manner count rostopch n wa tell a fourth group that he wa prepar to die with the citi train band under the wall of the capit but that he still could not help regret have been left in ignor of what wa happen and that had he known it sooner thing would have been differ a fifth group displai the profund of their strateg percept discuss the direct the troop would now have to take a sixth group wa talk absolut nonsens kut zov s express grew more and more preoccupi and gloomi from all thi talk he saw onli on thing that to defend moscow wa a physic imposs in the full mean of those word that is to sai so utterli imposs that if ani senseless command were to give order to fight confus would result but the battl would still not take place it would not take place becaus the command not mere all recogn the posit to be imposs but in their convers were onli discuss what would happen after it inevit abandon how could the command lead their troop to a field of battl thei consid imposs to hold the lowergrad offic and even the soldier who too reason also consid the posit imposs and therefor could not go to fight fulli convinc as thei were of defeat if bennigsen insist on the posit be defend and other still discuss it the question wa no longer import in itself but onli as a pretext for disput and intrigu thi kut zov knew well bennigsen who had chosen the posit warmli displai hi russian patriot kut zov could not listen to thi without winc by insist that moscow must be defend hi aim wa as clear as daylight to kut zov if the defens fail to throw the blame on kut zov who had brought the armi as far as the sparrow hill without give battl if it succeed to claim the success as hi own or if battl were not given to clear himself of the crime of abandon moscow but thi intrigu did not now occupi the old man s mind on terribl question absorb him and to that question he heard no repli from anyon the question for him now wa have i realli allow napoleon to reach moscow and when did i do so when wa it decid can it have been yesterdai when i order pl tov to retreat or wa it the even befor when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issu order or wa it earlier still when when wa thi terribl affair decid moscow must be abandon the armi must retreat and the order to do so must be given to give that terribl order seem to him equival to resign the command of the armi and not onli did he love power to which he wa accustom the honour award to princ prozor vski under whom he had serv in turkei gall him but he wa convinc that he wa destin to save russia and that that wa why against the emperor s wish and by the will of the peopl he had been chosen command in chief he wa convinc that he alon could maintain command of the armi in these difficult circumst and that in all the world he alon could encount the invinc napoleon without fear and he wa horrifi at the thought of the order he had to issu but someth had to be decid and these convers around him which were assum too free a charact must be stop he call the most import gener to him my head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rise from the bench and he rode to fil where hi carriag were wait chapter iv the council of war began to assembl at two in the afternoon in the better and roomier part of andrew savosti nov s hut the men women and children of the larg peasant famili crowd into the back room across the passag onli mal sha andrew s sixyearold granddaught whom hi seren high had pet and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drink hi tea remain on the top of the brick oven in the larger room mal sha look down from the oven with shy delight at the face uniform and decor of the gener who on after anoth came into the room and sat down on the broad bench in the corner under the icon granddad himself as mal sha in her own mind call kut zov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat sunk deep in a fold armchair and continu clear hi throat and pull at the collar of hi coat which though it wa unbutton still seem to pinch hi neck those who enter went up on by on to the field marshal he press the hand of some and nod to other hi adjut kai rov wa about to draw back the curtain of the window face kut zov but the latter move hi hand angrili and kai rov understood that hi seren high did not wish hi face to be seen round the peasant s deal tabl on which lai map plan pencil and paper so mani peopl gather that the orderli brought in anoth bench and put it besid the tabl erm lov kai rov and toll who had just arriv sat down on thi bench in the foremost place immedi under the icon sat barclai de tolli hi high forehead merg into hi bald crown he had a st georg s cross round hi neck and look pale and ill he had been feverish for two dai and wa now shiver and in pain besid him sat uv rov who with rapid gesticul wa give him some inform speak in low tone as thei all did chubbi littl dokht rov wa listen attent with eyebrow rais and arm fold on hi stomach on the other side sat count ostermanntolst y seemingli absorb in hi own thought hi broad head with it bold featur and glitter ey wa rest on hi hand ra vski twitch forward the black hair on hi templ as wa hi habit glanc now at kut zov and now at the door with a look of impati konovn tsyn s firm handsom and kindli face wa lit up by a tender sly smile hi glanc met mal sha s and the express of hi ey caus the littl girl to smile thei were all wait for bennigsen who on the pretext of inspect the posit wa finish hi savori dinner thei wait for him from four till six o clock and did not begin their deliber all that time but talk in low tone of other matter onli when bennigsen had enter the hut did kut zov leav hi corner and draw toward the tabl but not near enough for the candl that had been place there to light up hi face bennigsen open the council with the question ar we to abandon russia s ancient and sacr capit without a struggl or ar we to defend it a prolong and gener silenc follow there wa a frown on everi face and onli kut zov s angri grunt and occasion cough broke the silenc all ey were gaze at him mal sha too look at granddad she wa nearest to him and saw how hi face pucker he seem about to cry but thi did not last long russia s ancient and sacr capit he suddenli said repeat bennigsen s word in an angri voic and therebi draw attent to the fals note in them allow me to tell you your excel that that question ha no mean for a russian he lurch hi heavi bodi forward such a question cannot be put it is senseless the question i have ask these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a militari on the question is that of save russia is it better to give up moscow without a battl or by accept battl to risk lose the armi as well as moscow that is the question on which i want your opinion and he sank back in hi chair the discuss began bennigsen did not yet consid hi game lost admit the view of barclai and other that a defens battl at fil wa imposs but imbu with russian patriot and the love of moscow he propos to move troop from the right to the left flank dure the night and attack the french right flank the follow dai opinion were divid and argument were advanc for and against that project erm lov dokht rov and ra vski agre with bennigsen whether feel it necessari to make a sacrific befor abandon the capit or guid by other person consider these gener seem not to understand that thi council could not alter the inevit cours of event and that moscow wa in effect alreadi abandon the other gener howev understood it and leav asid the question of moscow spoke of the direct the armi should take in it retreat mal sha who kept her ey fix on what wa go on befor her understood the mean of the council differ it seem to her that it wa onli a person struggl between granddad and longcoat as she term bennigsen she saw that thei grew spite when thei spoke to on anoth and in her heart she side with granddad in the midst of the convers she notic granddad give bennigsen a quick subtl glanc

roof of two penthous thank god there is no more of that he thought cover up hi head again oh what a terribl thing is fear and how shamefulli i yield to it but thei thei were steadi and calm all the time to the end thought he thei in pierr s mind were the soldier those who had been at the batteri those who had given him food and those who had prai befor the icon thei those strang men he had not previous known stood out clearli and sharpli from everyon els to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierr as he fell asleep to enter commun life complet to be imbu by what make them what thei ar but how cast off all the superflu devilish burden of my outer man there wa a time when i could have done it i could have run awai from my father as i want to or i might have been sent to serv as a soldier after the duel with d lokhov and the memori of the dinner at the english club when he had challeng d lokhov flash through pierr s mind and then he rememb hi benefactor at torzh k and now a pictur of a solemn meet of the lodg present itself to hi mind it wa take place at the english club and someon near and dear to him sat at the end of the tabl ye that is he it is my benefactor but he di thought pierr ye he di and i did not know he wa aliv how sorri i am that he di and how glad i am that he is aliv again on on side of the tabl sat anatol d lokhov nesv tski den sov and other like them in hi dream the categori to which these men belong wa as clearli defin in hi mind as the categori of those he term thei and he heard those peopl anatol and d lokhov shout and sing loudli yet through their shout the voic of hi benefactor wa heard speak all the time and the sound of hi word wa as weighti and uninterrupt as the boom on the battlefield but pleasant and comfort pierr did not understand what hi benefactor wa sai but he knew the categori of thought were also quit distinct in hi dream that he wa talk of good and the possibl of be what thei were and thei with their simpl kind firm face surround hi benefactor on all side but though thei were kindli thei did not look at pierr and did not know him wish to speak and to attract their attent he got up but at that moment hi leg grew cold and bare he felt asham and with on arm cover hi leg from which hi cloak had in fact slip for a moment as he wa rearrang hi cloak pierr open hi ey and saw the same penthous roof post and yard but now thei were all bluish lit up and glitter with frost or dew it is dawn thought pierr but that s not what i want i want to hear and understand my benefactor s word again he cover himself up with hi cloak but now neither the lodg nor hi benefactor wa there there were onli thought clearli express in word thought that someon wa utter or that he himself wa formul afterward when he recal those thought pierr wa convinc that someon outsid himself had spoken them though the impress of that dai had evok them he had never it seem to him been abl to think and express hi thought like that when awak to endur war is the most difficult subordin of man s freedom to the law of god the voic had said simplic is submiss to the will of god you cannot escap from him and thei ar simpl thei do not talk but act the spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden man can be master of noth while he fear death but he who doe not fear it possess all if there were no suffer man would not know hi limit would not know himself the hardest thing pierr went on think or hear in hi dream is to be abl in your soul to unit the mean of all to unit all he ask himself no not to unit thought cannot be unit but to har all these thought togeth is what we need ye on must har them must har them he repeat to himself with inward raptur feel that these word and thei alon express what he want to sai and solv the question that torment him ye on must har it is time to har time to har time to har your excel your excel some voic wa repeat we must har it is time to har it wa the voic of the groom try to wake him the sun shone straight into pierr s face he glanc at the dirti innyard in the middl of which soldier were water their lean hors at the pump while cart were pass out of the gate pierr turn awai with repugn and close hi ey quickli fell back on the carriag seat no i don t want that i don t want to see and understand that i want to understand what wa reveal itself to me in my dream on second more and i should have understood it all but what am i to do har but how can i har everyth and pierr felt with horror that the mean of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroi the groom the coachman and the

but by those who had abandon it and not by those who remain in it moscow when occupi by the enemi did not remain intact like berlin vienna and other town simpli becaus it inhabit abandon it and did

with the object of take part among the peopl in the defens of moscow pierr had met the rost vs and nat sha had said to him ar you remain in moscow how splendid the thought flash into hi mind that it realli would be a good thing even if moscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he wa predestin to do next dai with the sole idea of not spare himself and not lag in ani wai behind them pierr went to the three hill gate but when he return to the hous convinc that moscow would not be defend he suddenli felt that what befor had seem to him mere a possibl had now becom absolut necessari

power and strength affirm the exist of a higher nonhuman criterion of life from the veri dai pierr had experienc thi feel for the first time at the slob da palac he had been continu under it influenc but onli now found full satisfact for it moreov at thi moment pierr wa support in hi design and prevent from renounc it by what he had alreadi done in that direct if he were now to leav moscow like everyon els hi flight from home the peasant coat the pistol and hi announc to the rost vs that he would remain in moscow would all becom not mere meaningless but contempt and ridicul and to thi pierr

but instead of act he onli thought about hi undertak go over it minutest detail in hi mind in hi fanci he did not clearli pictur to himself either the strike of the blow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinari vivid and melancholi enjoy imagin hi own destruct and heroic endur ye alon for the sake of all i must do it or perish he thought ye i will approach and then suddenli with pistol or

aloof from everyth earthli and a strang and joyou light of exist without hast or agit he await what wa come that inexor etern distant and unknown the presenc of which he had felt continu all hi life wa now near to him and by the strang light he experienc almost comprehens and palpabl formerli he had fear the end he had twice experienc that terribl torment fear of death the end but now he no longer understood that fear he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top befor him and he look at the fallow field the bush and the sky and knew that he wa face to face with death when he came to himself after be wound and the flower of etern unfett love had instantli unfold itself in hi soul as if freed from the bondag of life that had restrain it he no longer fear death and ceas to think about it dure the hour of solitud suffer and partial delirium he spent after he wa wound the more deepli he penetr into the new principl of etern love reveal to him the more he unconsci detach himself from earthli life to love everyth and everybodi and alwai to sacrific oneself for love meant not to love anyon not to live thi earthli life and the more imbu he becam with that principl of love the more he renounc life and the more complet he destroi that dread barrier which in the absenc of such love stand between life and death when dure those first dai he rememb that he would have to die he said to himself well what of it so much the better but after the night in myt shchi when half deliri he had seen her for whom he long appear befor him and have press her hand to hi lip had shed gentl happi tear love for a particular woman again crept unobserv into hi heart and onc more bound him to life and joy and agit thought began to occupi hi mind recal the moment at the ambul

nat sha refer to when she said thi suddenli happen had occur two dai befor princess mari arriv it wa the last spiritu struggl between life and death in which death gain the victori it wa the unexpect

them togeth again but after that thei never spoke of the futur can it or can it not be he now thought as he look at her and listen to the light click of the steel needl can fate have brought me to her so strang onli for me to die is it possibl that the truth of life ha been reveal to me onli to show me that i have spent my life in falsiti i love her more than anyth in the world but what am i to do if i love her he thought and he involuntarili groan from a habit acquir dure hi suffer on hear that sound nat sha put down the stock lean nearer to him and suddenli notic hi shine ey step lightli up

he press her hand and releas it and she went back to the candl and sat down again in her former posit twice she turn and look at him and her ey met hi beam at her she set herself a task on her stock and resolv not to turn round till it wa finish soon he realli shut hi ey and fell asleep he did not sleep long and suddenli awok with a start and in a cold perspir as he fell asleep he had still been think of the subject that now alwai occupi hi mind about life and death and chiefli about death he felt himself nearer to it love what is love he thought love hinder death love is life all everyth that i understand i understand onli becaus i love everyth is everyth exist onli becaus i love everyth is unit by it alon love is god and to die mean that i a particl of love shall return to the gener and etern sourc these thought seem to him comfort but thei were onli thought someth wa lack in them thei were not clear thei were too onesidedli person and brainspun and there wa the former agit and obscur he fell asleep he dream that he wa ly in the room he realli wa in but that he wa quit well and unwound mani variou indiffer and insignific peopl appear befor him he talk to them and discuss someth trivial thei were prepar to go awai somewher princ andrew dimli realiz that all thi wa trivial and that he had more import care but he continu to speak surpris them by empti wittic gradual unnot all these person began to disappear and a singl question that of the close door supersed all els he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everyth depend on whether he wa or wa not in time to lock it he went and tri to hurri but hi leg refus to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfulli strain all hi power he wa seiz by an agon fear and that fear wa the fear of death it stood behind the door but just when he wa clumsili creep toward the door that dread someth on the other side wa alreadi press against it and forc it wai in someth not human death wa break in through that door and had to be kept out he seiz the door make a final effort to hold it back to lock it wa no longer possibl but hi effort were weak and clumsi and the door push from behind by that terror open and close again onc again it push from outsid hi last superhuman effort were vain and both halv of the door noiselessli open it enter and it wa death and princ andrew di but at the instant he di princ andrew rememb that he wa asleep and at the veri instant he di have made an effort he awok ye it wa death i di and woke up ye death is an awaken and all at onc it grew light in hi soul and the veil that had till then conceal the unknown wa lift from hi spiritu vision he felt as if power till then confin within him had been liber and that strang light did not again leav him when wake in a cold perspir he move on the divan nat sha went up and ask him what wa the matter he did not answer and look at her strang not understand that wa what had happen to him two dai befor princess mari s arriv from that dai as the doctor express it the wast fever assum a malign charact but what the doctor said did not interest nat sha she saw the terribl moral symptom which to her were more convinc from that dai an awaken from life came to princ andrew togeth with hi awaken from sleep and compar to the durat of life it did not seem to him slower than an awaken from sleep compar to the durat of a dream there wa noth terribl or violent in thi compar slow awaken hi last dai and hour pass in an ordinari and simpl wai both princess mari and nat sha who did not leav him felt thi thei did not weep or shudder and dure these last dai thei themselv felt that thei were not attend on him he wa no longer there he had left them but on what remind them most close of him hi bodi both felt thi so strongli that the outward and terribl side of death did not affect them and thei did not feel it necessari to foment their grief neither in hi presenc nor out of it did thei weep nor did thei ever talk to on anoth about him thei felt that thei could not express in word what thei understood thei both saw that he wa sink slowli and quietli deeper and deeper awai from them and thei both knew that thi had to be so and that it wa right he confess and receiv communion everyon came to take leav of him when thei brought hi son to him he press hi lip to the boi s and turn awai not becaus he felt it hard and sad princess mari and nat sha understood that but simpli becaus he thought it wa all that wa requir of him but when thei told him to bless the boi he did what wa demand and look round as if ask whether there wa anyth els he should do when the last convuls of the bodi which the spirit wa leav occur princess mari and nat sha were present is it over said princess mari when hi bodi had for a few minut lain motionless grow cold befor them nat sha went up look at the dead ey and hasten to close them she close them but did not kiss them but clung to that which remind her most nearli of him hi bodi where ha he gone where is he now when the bodi wash and dress lai in the coffin on a tabl everyon came to take leav of him and thei all wept littl nichola cri becaus hi heart wa rent by pain perplex the countess and s nya cri from piti for nat sha and becaus he wa no more the old count cri becaus he felt that befor long he too must take the same terribl step nat sha and princess mari also wept now but not becaus of their own person grief thei wept with a rever and soften emot which had taken possess of their soul at the conscious of the simpl and solemn mysteri of death that had been accomplish in their presenc book thirteen chapter i man s mind cannot grasp the caus of event in their complet but the desir to find those caus is implant in man s soul and without consid the multipl and complex of the condit ani on of which taken separ mai seem to be the caus he snatch at the first approxim to a caus that seem to him intellig and sai thi is the caus in histor event where the action of men ar the subject of observ the first and most primit approxim to present itself wa the will of the god and after that the will of those who stood in the most promin posit the hero of histori but we need onli penetr to the essenc of ani histor event which li in the activ of the gener mass of men who take part in it to be convinc that the will of the histor hero doe not control the action of the mass but is itself continu control it mai seem to be a matter of indiffer whether we understand the mean of histor event thi wai or that yet there is the same differ between a man who sai that the peopl of the west move on the east becaus napoleon wish it and a man who sai that thi happen becaus it had to happen as there is between those who declar that the earth wa stationari and that the planet move round it and those who admit that thei did not know what upheld the earth but knew there were law direct it movement and that of the other planet there is and can be no caus of an histor event except the on caus of all caus but there ar law direct event and some of these law ar known to us while we ar consciou of other we cannot comprehend the discoveri of these law is onli possibl when we have quit abandon the attempt to find the caus in the will of some on man just as the discoveri of the law of the motion of the planet wa possibl onli when men abandon the concept of the fixiti of the earth the historian consid that next to the battl of borodin and the occup of moscow by the enemi and it destruct by fire the most import episod of the war of wa the movement of the russian armi from the ryaz na to the kal ga road and to the tar tino camp the socal flank march across the kr snaya pakhr river thei ascrib the glori of that achiev of geniu to differ men and disput as to whom the honor is due even foreign historian includ the french acknowledg the geniu of the russian command when thei speak of that flank march but it is hard to understand why militari writer and follow them other consid thi flank march to be the profound concept of some on man who save russia and destroi napoleon in the first place it is hard to understand where the profund and geniu of thi movement lai for not much mental effort wa need to see that the best posit for an armi when it is not be attack is where there ar most provis and even a dull boi of thirteen could have guess that the best posit for an armi after it retreat from moscow in wa on the kal ga road so it is imposs to understand by what reason the historian reach the conclus that thi maneuv wa a profound on and it is even more difficult to understand just why thei think that thi maneuv wa calcul to save russia and destroi the french for thi flank march had it been preced accompani or follow by other circumst might have prove ruinou to the russian and salutari for the french if the posit of the russian armi realli began to improv from the time of that march it doe not at all follow that the march wa the caus of it that flank march might not onli have fail to give ani advantag to the russian armi but might in other circumst have led to it destruct what would have happen had moscow not burn down if murat had not lost sight of the russian if napoleon had not remain inact if the russian armi at kr snaya pakhr had given battl as bennigsen and barclai advis what would have happen had the french attack the russian while thei were march beyond the pakhr what would have happen if on approach tar tino napoleon had attack the russian with but a tenth of the energi he had shown when he attack them at smol nsk what would have happen had the french move on petersburg in ani of these eventu the flank march that brought salvat might have prove disastr the third and most incomprehens thing is that peopl studi histori deliber avoid see that thi flank march cannot be attribut to ani on man that no on ever foresaw it and that in realiti like the retreat from fil it did not suggest itself to anyon in it entireti but result moment by moment step by step event by event from an endless number of most divers circumst and wa onli seen in it entireti when it had been accomplish and belong to the past at the council at fil the prevail thought in the mind of the russian command wa the on natur suggest itself name a direct retreat by the n zhni road in proof of thi there is the fact that the major of the council vote for such a retreat and abov all there is the wellknown convers after the council between the command in chief and lansk y who wa in charg of the commissariat depart lansk y inform the command in chief that the armi suppli were for the most part store along the ok in the t la and ryaz n provinc and that if thei retreat on n zhni the armi would be separ from it suppli by the broad river ok which cannot be cross earli in winter thi wa the first indic of the necess of deviat from what had previous seem the most natur cours a direct retreat on n zhnin vgorod the armi turn more to the south along the ryaz n road and nearer to it suppli subsequ the inact of the french who even lost sight of the russian armi concern for the safeti of the arsen at t la and especi the advantag of draw nearer to it suppli caus the armi to turn still further south to the t la road have cross over by a forc march to the t la road beyond the pakhr the russian command intend to remain at pod lsk and had no thought of the tar tino posit but innumer circumst and the reappear of french troop who had for a time lost touch with the russian and project of give battl and abov all the abund of provis in kal ga provinc oblig our armi to turn still more to the south and to cross from the t la to the kal ga road and go to tar tino which wa between the road along which those suppli lai just as it is imposs to sai when it wa decid to abandon moscow so it is imposs to sai precis when or by whom it wa decid to move to tar tino onli when the armi had got there as the result of innumer and vari forc did peopl begin to assur themselv that thei had desir thi movement and long ago foreseen it result chapter ii the famou flank movement mere consist in thi after the advanc of the french had ceas the russian armi which had been continu retreat straight back from the invad deviat from that direct cours and not find itself pursu wa natur drawn toward the district where suppli were abund if instead of imagin to ourselv command of geniu lead the russian armi we pictur that armi without ani leader it could not have done anyth but make a return movement toward moscow describ an arc in the direct where most provis were to be found and where the countri wa richest that movement from the n zhni to the ryaz n t la and kal ga road wa so natur that even the russian maraud move in that direct and demand were sent from petersburg for kut zov to take hi armi that wai at tar tino kut zov receiv what wa almost a reprimand from the emperor for have move hi armi along the ryaz n road and the emperor s letter indic to him the veri posit he had alreadi occupi near kal ga have roll like a ball in the direct of the impetu given by the whole campaign and by the battl of borodin the russian armi when the strength of that impetu wa exhaust and no fresh push wa receiv assum the posit natur to it kut zov s merit lai not in ani strateg maneuv of geniu as it is call but in the fact that he alon understood the signific of what had happen he alon then understood the mean of the french armi s inact he alon continu to assert that the battl of borodin had been a victori he alon who as command in chief might have been expect to be eager to attack emploi hi whole strength to restrain the russian armi from useless engag the beast wound at borodin wa ly where the flee hunter had left him but whether he wa still aliv whether he wa strong and mere ly low the hunter did not know suddenli the beast wa heard to moan the moan of that wound beast the french armi which betrai it calamit condit wa the send of lauriston to kut zov s camp with overtur for peac napoleon with hi usual assur that whatev enter hi head wa right wrote to kut zov the first word that occur to him though thei were meaningless monsieur le princ koutouzov i am send on of my adjutantsgener to discuss sever interest question with you i beg your high to credit what he sai to you especi when he express the

moscow octob kut zov repli i should be curs by poster were i look on as the initi of a settlement of ani sort such is the present spirit of my nation but he continu to exert all hi power to restrain hi troop from attack dure the month that the french troop were pillag in moscow and the russian troop were quietli encamp at tar tino a chang had taken place in the rel strength of the two armi both in spirit and in number as a result of which the superior had pass to the russian side though the condit and number of the french armi were unknown to the russian as soon as that chang occur the need of attack at onc show itself by countless sign these sign were lauriston s mission the abund of provis at tar tino the report come in from all side of the inact and disord of the french the flow of recruit to our regiment the fine weather the long rest the russian soldier had enjoi and the impati to do what thei had been assembl for which usual show itself in an armi that ha been rest curios as

that column he well knew that noth but confus would come of thi battl undertaken against hi will and as far as wa in hi power held the troop back he did not advanc he rode silent on hi small grai hors indol answer suggest that thei should attack the word attack is alwai on your tongu but you don t see that we ar unabl to execut complic maneuv said he to milor dovich who ask permiss to advanc we couldn t take murat prison thi morn or get to the place in time and noth can be done now he repli to someon els when kut zov wa inform that at the french rear where accord to the report of the cossack there had previous been nobodi there were now two battalion of pole he gave a sidelong glanc at erm lov who wa behind him and to whom he had not spoken sinc the previou dai you see thei ar ask to attack and make plan of all kind but as soon as on get to busi noth is readi and the enemi forewarn take measur accordingli erm lov screw up hi ey and smile faintli on hear these word he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kut zov would content himself with that hint he s have a littl fun at my expens said erm lov softli nudg with hi knee ra vski who wa at hi side soon after thi erm lov move up to kut zov and respectfulli remark it is not too late yet your high the enemi ha not gone awai if you were to order an attack if not the guard will not so much as see a littl smoke kut zov did not repli but when thei report to him that murat s troop were in retreat he order an advanc though at everi hundr pace he halt for three quarter of an hour the whole battl consist in what orl vden sov s cossack had done the rest of the armi mere lost some hundr of men uselessli in consequ of thi battl kut zov receiv a diamond decor and bennigsen some diamond and a hundr thousand rubl other also receiv pleasant recognit correspond to their variou grade and follow the battl fresh chang were made in the staff that s how everyth is done with us all topsyturvi said the russian offic and gener after the tar tino battl let it be understood that some fool there is do thing all wrong but that we ourselv should not have done so just as peopl speak todai but peopl who talk like that either do not know what thei ar talk about or deliber deceiv themselv no battl tar tino borodin or austerlitz take place as those who plan it anticip that is an essenti condit a countless number of free forc for nowher is man freer than dure a battl where it is a question of life and death influenc the cours taken by the fight and that cours never can be known in advanc and never coincid with the direct of ani on forc if mani simultan and various direct forc act on a given bodi the direct of it motion cannot coincid with ani on of those forc but will alwai be a mean what in mechan is repres by the diagon of a parallelogram of forc if in the descript given by historian especi french on we find their war and battl carri out in accord with previous form plan the onli conclus to be drawn is that those descript ar fals the battl of tar tino obvious did not attain the aim toll had in view to lead the troop into action in the order prescrib by the disposit nor that which count orl vden sov mai have had in view to take murat prison nor the result of immedi destroi the whole corp which bennigsen and other mai have had in view nor the aim of the offic who wish to go into action to distinguish himself nor that of the cossack who want more booti than he got and so on but if the aim of the battl wa what actual result and what all the russian of that dai desir to drive the french out of russia and destroi their armi it is quit clear that the battl of tar tino just becaus of it incongru wa exactli what wa want at that stage of the campaign it would be difficult and even imposs to imagin ani result more opportun than the actual outcom of thi battl with a minimum of effort and insignific loss despit the greatest confus the most import result of the whole campaign were attain the transit from retreat to advanc an exposur of the weak of the french and the administr of that shock which napoleon s armi had onli await to begin it flight chapter viii napoleon enter moscow after the brilliant victori de la moskowa there can be no doubt about the victori for the battlefield remain in the hand of the french the russian retreat and abandon their ancient capit moscow abound in provis arm munit and incalcul wealth is in napoleon s hand the russian armi onli half the strength of the french doe not make a singl attempt to attack for a whole month napoleon s posit is most brilliant he can either fall on the russian armi with doubl it strength and destroi it negoti an advantag peac or in case of a refus make a menac move on petersburg or even in the case of a revers return to smol nsk or v lna or remain in moscow in short no special geniu would seem to be requir to retain the brilliant posit the french held at that time for that onli veri simpl and easi step were necessari not to allow the troop to loot to prepar winter cloth of which there wa suffici in moscow for the whole armi and method to collect the provis of which accord to the french historian there were enough in moscow to suppli the whole armi for six month yet napoleon that greatest of all genius who the historian declar had control of the armi took none of these step he not mere did noth of the kind but on the contrari he us hi power to select the most foolish and ruinou of all the cours open to him of all that napoleon might have done winter in moscow advanc on petersburg or on n zhnin vgorod or retir by a more northerli or more southerli rout sai by the road kut zov afterward took noth more stupid or disastr can be imagin than what he actual did he remain in moscow till octob let the troop plunder the citi then hesit whether to leav a garrison behind him he quit moscow approach kut zov without join battl turn to the right and reach m loyarosl vet again without attempt to break through and take the road kut zov took but retir instead to mozh ysk along the devast smol nsk road noth more stupid than that could have been devis or more disastr for the armi as the sequel show had napoleon s aim been to destroi hi armi the most skill strategist could hardli have devis ani seri of action that would so complet have accomplish that purpos independ of anyth the russian armi might do napoleon the man of geniu did thi but to sai that he destroi hi armi becaus he wish to or becaus he wa veri stupid would be as unjust as to sai that he had brought hi troop to moscow becaus he wish to and becaus he wa veri clever and a geniu in both case hi person activ have no more forc than the person activ of ani soldier mere coincid with the law that guid the event the historian quit fals repres napoleon s faculti as have weaken in moscow and do so onli becaus the result did not justifi hi action he emploi all hi abil and strength to do the best he could for himself and hi armi as he had done previous and as he did subsequ in hi activ at that time wa no less astound than it wa in egypt in itali in austria and in prussia we do not know for certain in how far hi geniu wa genuin in egypt where forti centuri look down upon hi grandeur for hi great exploit there ar all told us by frenchmen we cannot accur estim hi geniu in austria or prussia for we have to draw our inform from french or german sourc and the incomprehens surrend of whole corp without fight and of fortress without a sieg must inclin german to recogn hi geniu as the onli explan of the war carri on in germani but we thank god have no need to recogn hi geniu in order to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at the matter plainli and simpli and we will not abandon that right hi activ in moscow wa as amaz and as full of geniu as elsewher order after order and plan after plan were issu by him from the time he enter moscow till the time he left it the absenc of citizen and of a deput and even the

that no time must be lost he did not consid or ask himself whether the new wa good or bad that did not interest him he regard the whole busi of the war not with hi intellig or hi reason but by someth els there wa within him a deep unexpress convict that all would be well but that on must not trust to thi and still less speak about it but must onli attend to on s own work and he did hi work give hi whole strength to the task peter petr vich konovn tsyn like dokht rov seem to have been includ mere for proprieti s sake in the list of the socal hero of the barclai ra vski erm lov pl tov and milor

as gener on duti he had alwai slept with hi door open give order that everi messeng should be allow to wake him up in battl he wa alwai under fire so that kut zov reprov him for it and fear to send him to the front and like dokht rov he wa on of those unnot cogwheel that without clatter or nois constitut the most essenti part of the machin come out of the hut into the damp dark night konovn tsyn frown partli from an increas pain in hi head and partli at the unpleas thought that occur to him of how all that nest of influenti men on the staff would be stir up by thi new especi bennigsen who ever sinc tar tino had been at dagger drawn with kut zov and how thei would make suggest quarrel issu order and rescind them and thi premonit wa disagre to him though he knew it could not be help and in fact toll to whom he went to commun the new immedi began to expound hi plan to a gener share hi quarter until konovn tsyn who listen in weari silenc remind him that thei must go to see hi high chapter xvii kut zov like all old peopl did not sleep much at night he often fell asleep unexpectedli in the daytim but at night ly on hi bed without undress he gener remain awak think so he lai now on hi bed support hi larg heavi scar head on hi plump hand with hi on ey open medit and peer into the dark sinc bennigsen who correspond with the emperor and had more influenc than anyon els on the staff had begun to avoid him kut zov wa more at eas as to the possibl of himself and hi troop be oblig to take part in useless aggress movement the lesson of the tar tino battl and of the dai befor it which kut zov rememb with pain must he thought have some effect on other too thei must understand that we can onli lose by take the offens patienc and time ar my warrior my champion thought kut zov he knew that an appl should not be pluck while it is green it will fall of itself when ripe but if pick unrip the appl is spoil the tree is harm and your teeth ar set on edg like an experienc sportsman he knew that the beast wa wound and wound as onli the whole strength of russia could have wound it but whether it wa mortal wound or not wa still an undecid question now by the fact of lauriston and barth lemi have been sent and by the report of the guerrilla kut zov wa almost sure that the wound wa mortal but he need further proof and it wa necessari to wait thei want to run to see how thei have wound it wait and we shall see continu maneuv continu advanc thought he what for onli to distinguish themselv as if fight were fun thei ar like children from whom on can t get ani sensibl account of what ha happen becaus thei all want to show how well thei can fight but that s not what is need now and what ingeni maneuv thei all propos to me it seem to them that when thei have thought of two or three conting he rememb the gener plan sent him from petersburg thei have foreseen everyth but the conting ar endless the undecid question as to whether the wound inflict at borodin wa mortal or not had hung over kut zov s head for a whole month on the on hand the french had occupi moscow on the other kut zov felt assur with all hi be that the terribl blow into which he and all the russian had put their whole strength must have been mortal but in ani case proof were need he had wait a whole month for them and grew more impati the longer he wait ly on hi bed dure those sleepless night he did just what he reproach those younger gener for do he imagin all sort of possibl conting just like the younger men but with thi differ that he saw thousand of conting instead of two or three and base noth on them the longer he thought the more conting present themselv he imagin all sort of movement of the napoleon armi as a whole or in section against petersburg or against him or to outflank him he thought too of the possibl which he fear most of all that napoleon might fight him with hi own weapon and remain in moscow await him kut zov even imagin that napoleon s armi might turn back through med n and yukhn v but the on thing he could not forese wa what happen the insan convuls stamped of napoleon s armi dure it first eleven dai after leav moscow a stamped which made possibl what kut zov had not yet even dare to think of the complet extermin of the french d rokhov s report about broussier s divis the guerrilla report of distress in napoleon s armi rumor of prepar for leav moscow all confirm the supposit that the french armi wa beaten and prepar for flight but these were onli supposit which seem import to the younger men but not to kut zov with hi sixti year experi he knew what valu to attach to rumor knew how apt peopl who desir anyth ar to group all new so that it appear to confirm what thei desir and he knew how readili in such case thei omit all that make for the contrari and the more he desir it the less he allow himself to believ it thi question absorb all hi mental power all els wa to him onli life s customari routin to such customari routin belong hi convers with the staff the letter he wrote from tar tino to madam de sta l the read of novel the distribut of award hi correspond with petersburg and so on but the destruct of the french which he alon foresaw wa hi heart s on desir on the night of the eleventh of octob he lai lean on hi arm and think of that there wa a stir in the next room and he heard the step of toll konovn tsyn and bolkhov tinov eh who s there come in come in what new the field marshal call out to them while a footman wa light a candl toll commun the substanc of the new who brought it ask kut zov with a look which when the candl wa lit struck toll by it cold sever there can be no doubt about it your high call him in call him here kut zov sat up with on leg hang down from the bed and hi big paunch rest against the other which wa doubl under him he screw up hi see ey to scrutin the messeng more carefulli as if wish to read in hi face what preoccupi hi own mind tell me tell me friend said he to bolkhov tinov in hi low ag voic as he pull togeth the shirt which gape open on hi chest come nearer nearer what new have you brought me eh that napoleon ha left moscow ar you sure eh bolkhov tinov gave a detail account from the begin of all he had been told to report speak quicker quicker don t tortur me kut zov interrupt him bolkhov tinov told him everyth and wa then silent await instruct toll wa begin to sai someth but kut zov check him he tri to sai someth but hi face suddenli pucker and wrinkl he wave hi arm at toll and turn to the opposit side of the room to the corner darken by the icon that hung there o lord my creator thou ha heard our prayer said he in a tremul voic with fold hand russia is save i thank thee o lord and he wept chapter xviii from the time he receiv thi new to the end of the campaign all kut zov s activ wa direct toward restrain hi troop by author by guil and by entreati from useless attack maneuv or encount with the perish enemi dokht rov went to m loyarosl vet but kut zov linger with the main armi and gave order for the evacu of kal ga a retreat beyond which town seem to him quit possibl everywher kut zov retreat but the enemi without wait for hi retreat fled in the opposit direct napoleon s historian describ to us hi skill maneuv at tar tino and m loyarosl vet and make conjectur as to what would have happen had napoleon been in time to penetr into the rich southern provinc but not to speak of the fact that noth prevent him from advanc into those southern provinc for the russian armi did not bar hi wai the historian forget that noth could have save hi armi for then alreadi it bore within itself the germ of inevit ruin how could that armi which had found abund suppli in moscow and had trampl them underfoot instead of keep them and on arriv at smol nsk had loot provis instead of store them how could that armi recuper in kal ga provinc which wa inhabit by russian such as those who live in moscow and where fire had the same properti of consum what wa set ablaz that armi could not recov anywher sinc the battl of borodin and the pillag of moscow it had born within itself as it were the chemic element of dissolut the member of what had onc been an armi napoleon himself and all hi soldier fled without know whither each concern onli to make hi escap as quickli as possibl from thi posit of the hopeless of which thei were all more or less vagu consciou so it came about that at the council at m loyarosl vet when the gener pretend to confer togeth express variou opinion all mouth were close by the opinion utter by the simplemind soldier mouton who speak last said what thei all felt that the on thing need wa to get awai as quickli as possibl and no on not even napoleon could sai anyth against that truth which thei all recogn but though thei all realiz that it wa necessari to get awai there still remain a feel of shame at admit that thei must flee an extern shock wa need to overcom that shame and thi shock came in due time it wa what the french call le hourra de l empereur the dai after the council at m loyarosl vet napoleon rode out earli in the morn amid the line of hi armi with hi suit of marshal and an escort on the pretext of inspect the armi and the scene of the previou and of the impend battl some cossack on the prowl for booti fell in with the emperor and veri nearli captur him if the cossack did not captur napoleon then what save him wa the veri thing that wa destroi the french armi the booti on which the cossack fell here as at tar tino thei went after plunder leav the men disregard napoleon thei rush after the plunder and napoleon manag to escap when le enfant du don might so easili have taken the emperor himself in the midst of hi armi it wa clear that there wa noth for it but to fly as fast as possibl along the nearest familiar road napoleon with hi fortyyearold stomach understood that hint not feel hi former agil and bold and under the influenc of the fright the cossack had given him he at onc agre with mouton and issu order as the historian tell us to retreat by the smol nsk road that napoleon agre with mouton and that the armi retreat doe not prove that napoleon caus it to retreat but that the forc which influenc the whole armi and direct it along the mozh ysk that is the smol nsk road act simultan on him also chapter xix a man in motion alwai devis an aim for that motion to be abl to go a thousand mile he must imagin that someth good await him at the end of those thousand mile on must have the prospect of a promis land to have the strength to move the promis land for the french dure their advanc had been moscow dure their retreat it wa their nativ land but that nativ land wa too far off and for a man go a thousand mile it is absolut necessari to set asid hi final goal and to sai to himself todai i shall get to a place twentyf mile off where i shall rest and spend the night and dure the first dai s journei that rest place eclips hi ultim goal and attract all hi hope and desir and the impuls felt by a singl person ar alwai magnifi in a crowd for the french retreat along the old smol nsk road the final goal their nativ land wa too remot and their immedi goal wa smol nsk toward which all their desir and hope enorm intensifi in the mass urg them on it wa not that thei knew that much food and fresh troop await them in smol nsk nor that thei were told so on the contrari their superior offic and napoleon himself knew that provis were scarc there but becaus thi alon could give them strength to move on and endur their present privat so both those who knew and those who did not know deceiv themselv and push on to smol nsk as to a promis land come out onto the highroad the french fled with surpris energi and unheardof rapid toward the goal thei had fix on besid the common impuls which bound the whole crowd of french into on mass and suppli them with a certain energi there wa anoth caus bind them togeth their great number as with the physic law of graviti their enorm mass drew the individu human atom to itself in their hundr of thousand thei move like a whole nation each of them desir noth more than to give himself up as a prison to escap from all thi horror and miseri but on the on hand the forc of thi common attract to smol nsk their goal drew each of them in the same direct on the other hand an armi corp could not surrend to a compani and though the french avail themselv of everi conveni opportun to detach themselv and to surrend on the slightest decent pretext such pretext did not alwai occur their veri number and their crowd and swift movement depriv them of that possibl and render it not onli difficult but imposs for the russian to stop thi movement to which the french were direct all their energi beyond a certain limit no mechan disrupt of the bodi could hasten the process of decomposit a lump of snow cannot be melt instantan there is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow on the contrari the greater the heat the more solidifi the remain snow becom of the russian command kut zov alon understood thi when the flight of the french armi along the smol nsk road becam well defin what konovn tsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of octob began to occur the superior offic all want to distinguish themselv to cut off to seiz to captur and to overthrow the french and all clamor for action kut zov alon us all hi power and such power is veri limit in the case of ani command in chief to prevent an attack he could not tell them what we sai now why fight why block the road lose our own men and inhumanli slaughter unfortun wretch what is the us of that when a third of their armi ha melt awai on the road from moscow to vy zma without ani battl but draw from hi ag wisdom what thei could understand he told them of the golden bridg and thei laugh at and slander him fling themselv on rend and exult over the dy beast erm lov milor dovich pl tov and other in proxim to the french near vy zma could not resist their desir to cut off and break up two french corp and by wai of report their intent to kut zov thei sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelop and try as kut zov might to restrain the troop our men attack try to bar the road infantri regiment we ar told advanc to the attack with music and with drum beat and kill and lost thousand of men but thei did not cut off or overthrow anybodi and the french armi close up more firmli at the danger continu while steadili melt awai to pursu it fatal path to smol nsk book fourteen chapter i the battl of borodin with the occup of moscow that follow it and the flight of the french without further conflict is on of the most instruct phenomena in histori all historian agre that the extern activ of state and nation in their conflict with on anoth is express in war and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the polit strength of state and nation increas or decreas strang as mai be the histor account of how some king or emperor have quarrel with anoth collect an armi fight hi enemi s armi gain a victori by kill three five or ten thousand men and subjug a kingdom and an entir nation of sever million all the fact of histori as far as we know it confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of on armi against anoth is the caus or at least an essenti indic of an increas or decreas in the strength of the nation even though it is unintellig why the defeat of an armi a hundredth part of a nation should oblig that whole nation to submit an armi gain a victori and at onc the right of the conquer nation have increas to the detriment of the defeat an armi ha suffer defeat and at onc a peopl lose it right in proport to the sever of the revers and if it armi suffer a complet defeat the nation is quit subjug so accord to histori it ha been found from the most ancient time and so it is to our own dai all napoleon s war serv to confirm thi rule in proport to the defeat of the austrian armi austria lose it right and the right and the strength of franc increas the victori of the french at jena and auerst dt destroi the independ exist of prussia but then in the french gain a victori near moscow moscow is taken and after that with no further battl it is not russia that ceas to exist but the french armi of six hundr thousand and then napoleon franc itself to strain the fact to fit the rule of histori to sai that the field of battl at borodin remain in the hand of the russian or that after moscow there were other battl that destroi napoleon s armi is imposs after the french victori at borodin there wa no gener engag nor ani that were at all seriou yet the french armi ceas to exist what doe thi mean if it were an exampl taken from the histori of china we might sai that it wa not an histor phenomenon which is the historian usual expedi when anyth doe not fit their standard if the matter concern some brief conflict in which onli a small number of troop took part we might treat it as an except but thi event occur befor our father ey and for them it wa a question of the life or death of their fatherland and it happen in the greatest of all known war the period of the campaign of from the battl of borodin to the expuls of the french prove that the win of a battl doe not produc a conquest and is not even an invari indic of conquest it prove that the forc which decid the fate of peopl li not in the conqueror nor even in armi and battl but in someth els the french historian describ the condit of the french armi befor it left moscow affirm that all wa in order in the grand armi except the cavalri the artilleri and the transport there wa no forag for the hors or the cattl that wa a misfortun no on could remedi for the peasant of the district burn their hai rather than let the french have it the victori gain did not bring the usual result becaus the peasant karp and vla who after the french had evacu moscow drove in their cart to pillag the town and in gener person fail to manifest ani heroic feel and the whole innumer multitud of such peasant did not bring their hai to moscow for the high price offer them but burn it instead let us imagin two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapier accord to all the rule of the art of fenc the fenc ha gone on for some time suddenli on of the combat feel himself wound and understand that the matter is no joke but concern hi life throw down hi rapier and seiz the first cudgel that come to hand begin to brandish it then let us imagin that the combat who so sensibl emploi the best and simplest mean to attain hi end wa at the same time influenc by tradit of chivalri and desir to conceal the fact of the case insist that he had gain hi victori with the rapier accord to all the rule of art on can imagin what confus and obscur would result from such an account of the duel the fencer who demand a contest accord to the rule of fenc wa the french armi hi oppon who threw awai the rapier and snatch up the cudgel wa the russian peopl those who try to explain the matter accord to the rule of fenc ar the historian who have describ the event after the burn of smol nsk a war began which did not follow ani previou tradit of war the burn of town and villag the retreat after battl the blow dealt at borodin and the renew retreat the burn of moscow the captur of maraud the seizur of transport and the guerrilla war were all departur from the rule napoleon felt thi and from the time he took up the correct fenc attitud in moscow and instead of hi oppon s rapier saw a cudgel rais abov hi head he did not ceas to complain to kut zov and to the emperor alexand that the war wa be carri on contrari to all the rule as if there were ani rule for kill peopl in spite of the complaint of the french as to the nonobserv of the rule in spite of the fact that to some highli place russian it seem rather disgrac to fight with a cudgel and thei want to assum a pose en quart or en tierc accord to all the rule and to make an adroit thrust en prime and so on the cudgel of the peopl s war wa lift with all it menac and majest strength and without consult anyon s tast or rule and regardless of anyth els it rose and fell with stupid simplic but consist and belabor the french till the whole invas had perish and it is well for a peopl who do not as the french did in salut accord to all the rule of art and present the hilt of their rapier gracefulli and polit hand it to their magnanim conqueror but at the moment of trial without ask what rule other have adopt in similar case simpli and easili pick up the first cudgel that come to hand and strike with it till the feel of resent and reveng in their soul yield to a feel of contempt and compass chapter ii on of the most obviou and advantag departur from the socal law of war is the action of scatter group against men press togeth in a mass such action alwai occur in war that take on a nation charact in such action instead of two crowd oppos each other the men dispers attack singli run awai when attack by stronger forc but again attack when opportun offer thi wa done by the guerrilla in spain by the mountain tribe in the caucasu and by the russian in peopl have call thi kind of war guerrilla warfar and assum that by so call it thei have explain it mean but such a war doe not fit in under ani rule and is directli oppos to a wellknown rule of tactic which is accept as infal that rule sai that an attack should concentr hi forc in order to be stronger than hi oppon at the moment of conflict guerrilla war alwai success as histori show directli infring that rule thi contradict aris from the fact that militari scienc assum the strength of an armi to be ident with it number militari scienc sai that the more troop the greater the strength le gro bataillon ont toujour raison larg battalion ar alwai victori for militari scienc to sai thi is like defin momentum in mechan by refer to the mass onli state that momenta ar equal or unequ to each other simpli becaus the mass involv ar equal or unequ momentum quantiti of motion is the product of mass and veloc in militari affair the strength of an armi is the product of it mass and some unknown x militari scienc see in histori innumer instanc of the fact that the size of ani armi doe not coincid with it strength and that small detach defeat larger on obscur admit the exist of thi unknown factor and tri to discov it now in a geometr format now in the equip emploi now and most usual in the geniu of the command but the assign of these variou mean to the factor doe not yield result which accord with the histor fact yet it is onli necessari to abandon the fals view adopt to gratifi the hero of the efficaci of the direct issu in wartim by command in order to find thi unknown quantiti that unknown quantiti is the spirit of the armi that is to sai the greater or lesser readi to fight and face danger felt by all the men compos an armi quit independ of whether thei ar or ar not fight under the command of a geniu in two or threelin format with cudgel or with rifl that repeat thirti time a minut men who want to fight will alwai put themselv in the most advantag condit for fight the spirit of an armi is the factor which multipli by the mass give the result forc to defin and express the signific of thi unknown factor the spirit of an armi is a problem for scienc thi problem is onli solvabl if we ceas arbitrarili to substitut for the unknown x itself the condit under which that forc becom appar such as the command of the gener the equip emploi and so on mistak these for the real signific of the factor and if we recogn thi unknown quantiti in it entireti as be the greater or lesser desir to fight and to face danger onli then express known histor fact by equat and compar the rel signific of thi factor can we hope to defin the unknown ten men battalion or divis fight fifteen men battalion or divis conquer that is kill or take captiv all the other while themselv lose four so that on the on side four and on the other fifteen were lost consequ the four were equal to the fifteen and therefor x y consequ xy thi equat doe not give us the valu of the unknown factor but give us a ratio between two unknown and by bring various select histor unit battl campaign period of war into such equat a seri of number could be obtain in which certain law should exist and might be discov the tactic rule that an armi should act in mass when attack and in smaller group in retreat unconsci confirm the truth that the strength of an armi depend on it spirit to lead men forward under fire more disciplin obtain onli by movement in mass is need than is need to resist attack but thi rule which leav out of account the spirit of the armi continu prove incorrect and is in particularli strike contrast to the fact when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troop occur as in all nation war the french retreat in though accord to tactic thei should have separ into detach to defend themselv congreg into a mass becaus the spirit of the armi had so fallen that onli the mass held the armi togeth the russian on the contrari ought accord to tactic to have attack in mass but in fact thei split up into small unit becaus their spirit had so risen that separ individu without order dealt blow at the french without need ani compuls to induc them to expos themselv to hardship and danger chapter iii the socal partisan war began with the entri of the french into smol nsk befor partisan warfar had been offici recogn by the govern thousand of enemi straggler maraud and forag had been destroi by the cossack and the peasant who kill them off as instinct as dog worri a strai mad dog to death den s dav dov with hi russian instinct wa the first to recogn the valu of thi terribl cudgel which regardless of the rule of militari scienc destroi the french and to him belong the credit for take the first step toward regular thi method of warfar on august dav dov s first partisan detach wa form and then other were recogn the further the campaign progress the more numer these detach becam the irregular destroi the great armi piecem thei gather the fallen leav that drop of themselv from that wither tree the french armi and sometim shook that tree itself by octob when the french were flee toward smol nsk there were hundr of such compani of variou size and charact there were some that adopt all the armi method and had infantri artilleri staff and the comfort of life other consist sole of cossack cavalri there were also small scratch group of foot and hors and group of peasant and landown that remain unknown a sacristan command on parti which captur sever hundr prison in the cours of a month and there wa va lisa the wife of a villag elder who slew hundr of the french the partisan warfar flame up most fierc in the latter dai of octob it first period had pass when the partisan themselv amaz at their own bold fear everi minut to be surround and captur by the french and hid in the forest without unsaddl hardli dare to dismount and alwai expect to be pursu by the end of octob thi kind of warfar had taken definit shape it had becom clear to all what could be ventur against the french and what could not now onli the command of detach with staff and move accord to rule at a distanc from the french still regard mani thing as imposs the small band that had start their activ long befor and had alreadi observ the french close consid thing possibl which the command of the big detach did not dare to contempl the cossack and peasant who crept in among the french now consid everyth possibl on octob den sov who wa on of the irregular wa with hi group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm sinc earli morn he and hi parti had been on the move all dai long he had been watch from the forest that skirt the highroad a larg french convoi of cavalri baggag and russian prison separ from the rest of the armi which as wa learn from spi and prison wa move under a strong escort to smol nsk besid den sov and d lokhov who also led a small parti and move in den sov s vicin the command of some larg divis with staff also knew of thi convoi and as den sov express it were sharpen their teeth for it two of the command of larg parti on a pole and the other a german sent invit to den sov almost simultan request him to join up with their divis to attack the convoi no bwother i have gwown mustach myself said den sov on read these document and he wrote to the german that despit hi heartfelt desir to serv under so valiant and renown a gener he had to forgo that pleasur becaus he wa alreadi under the command of the polish gener to the polish gener he repli to the same effect inform him that he wa alreadi under the command of the german have arrang matter thu den sov and d lokhov intend without report matter to the higher command to attack and seiz that convoi with their own small forc on octob it wa move from the villag of mik lino to that of sh mshevo to the left of the road between mik lino and sh mshevo there were larg forest extend in some place up to the road itself though in other a mile or more back from it through these forest den sov and hi parti rode all dai sometim keep well back in them and sometim come to the veri edg but never lose sight of the move french that morn cossack of den sov s parti had seiz and carri off into the forest two wagon load with cavalri saddl which had stuck in the mud not far from mik lino where the forest ran close to the road sinc then and until even the parti had watch the movement of the french without attack it wa necessari to let the french reach sh mshevo quietli without alarm them and then after join d lokhov who wa to come that even to a consult at a watchman s hut in the forest less than a mile from sh mshevo to surpris the french at dawn fall like an avalanch on their head from two side and rout and captur them all at on blow in their rear more than a mile from mik lino where the forest came right up to the road six cossack were post to report if ani fresh column of french should show themselv beyond sh mshevo d lokhov wa to observ the road in the same wai to find out at what distanc there were other french troop thei reckon that the convoi had fifteen hundr men den sov had two hundr and d lokhov might have as mani more but the dispar of number did not deter den sov all that he now want to know wa what troop these were and to learn that he had to captur a tongu that is a man from the enemi column that morn s attack on the wagon had been made so hastili that the frenchmen with the wagon had all been kill onli a littl drummer boi had been taken aliv and as he wa a straggler he could tell them noth definit about the troop in that column den sov consid it danger to make a second attack for fear of put the whole column on the alert so he sent t khon shcherb ty a peasant of hi parti to sh mshevo to try and seiz at least on of the french quartermast who had been sent on in advanc chapter iv it wa a warm raini autumn dai the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddi water at time a sort of mist descend

thei ll cweep up to the garden you ll wide up fwom there with the cossack he point to a spot in the forest beyond the villag and i with my hussar fwom here and at the signal shot the hollow is impass there s a swamp there said the esaul the hors would sink we must ride round more to the left while thei were talk in underton the crack of a shot sound from the low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appear then anoth and the sound of hundr of seemingli merri french voic shout togeth came up from the slope for a moment den sov and the esaul drew back thei were so near that thei thought thei were the caus of the fire and shout but the fire and shout did not relat to them down below a man wear someth red wa run through the marsh the french were evid fire and shout at him why that s our t khon said the esaul so it is it is the wascal said den sov he ll get awai said the esaul screw up hi ey the man whom thei call t khon have run to the stream plung in so that the water splash in the air and have disappear for an instant scrambl out on all four all black with the wet and ran on the french who had been pursu him stop smart that said the esaul what a beast said den sov with hi former look of vexat what ha he been do all thi time who is he ask p tya he s our plast n i sent him to captur a tongu oh ye said p tya nod at the first word den sov utter as if he understood it all though he realli did not understand anyth of it t khon shcherb ty wa on of the most indispens men in their band he wa a peasant from pokr vsk near the river gzhat when den sov had come to pokr vsk at the begin of hi oper and had as usual summon the villag elder and ask him what he knew about the french the elder as though shield himself had repli as all villag elder did that he had neither seen nor heard anyth of them but when den sov explain that hi purpos wa to kill the french and ask if no french had strai that wai the elder repli that some moreorder had realli been at their villag but that t khon shcherb ty wa the onli man who dealt with such matter den sov had t khon call and have prais him for hi activ said a few word in the elder s presenc about loyalti to the tsar and the countri and the hatr of the french that all son of the fatherland should cherish we don t do the french ani harm said t khon evid frighten by den sov s word we onli fool about with the lad for fun you know we kill a score or so of moreorder but we did no harm els next dai when den sov had left pokr vsk have quit forgotten about thi peasant it wa report to him that t khon had attach himself to their parti and ask to be allow to remain with it den sov gave order to let him do so t khon who at first did rough work lai campfir fetch water flai dead hors and so on soon show a great like and aptitud for partisan warfar at night he would go out for booti and alwai brought back french cloth and weapon and when told to would bring in french captiv also den sov then reliev him from drudgeri and began take him with him when he went out on expedit and had him enrol among the cossack t khon did not like ride and alwai went on foot never lag behind the cavalri he wa arm with a musketoon which he carri rather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he us as a wolf us it teeth with equal eas pick flea out of it fur or crunch thick bone t khon with equal accuraci would split log with blow at arm s length or hold the head of the ax would cut thin littl peg or carv spoon in den sov s parti he held a peculiar and except posit when anyth particularli difficult or nasti had to be done to push a cart out of the mud with on s shoulder pull a hors out of a swamp by it tail skin it slink in among the french or walk more than thirti mile in a dai everybodi point laughingli at t khon it won t hurt that devil he s as strong as a hors thei said of him onc a frenchman t khon wa try to captur fire a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshi part of the back that wound which t khon treat onli with intern and extern applic of vodka wa the subject of the liveliest joke by the whole detach joke in which t khon readili join hallo mate never again gave you a twist the cossack would banter him and t khon purpos writh and make face pretend to be angri and swore at the french with the funniest curs the onli effect of thi incid on t khon wa that after be wound he seldom brought in prison he wa the bravest and most us man in the parti no on found more opportun for attack no on captur or kill more frenchmen and consequ he wa made the buffoon of all the cossack and hussar and willingli accept that role now he had been sent by den sov overnight to sh mshevo to captur a tongu but whether becaus he had not been content to take onli on frenchman or becaus he had slept through the night he had crept by dai into some bush right among the french and as den sov had wit from abov had been detect by them chapter vi after talk for some time with the esaul about next dai s attack which now see how near thei were to the french he seem to have definit decid on den sov turn hi hors and rode back now my lad we ll go and get dwy he said to p tya as thei approach the watchhous den sov stop peer into the forest among the tree a man with long leg and long swing arm wear a short jacket bast shoe and a kaz n hat wa approach with long light step he had a musketoon over hi shoulder and an ax stuck in hi

selfsatisfi merriment he lift hi head high and gaze at den sov as if repress a laugh well where did you disappear to inquir den sov where did i disappear to i went to get frenchmen answer t khon boldli and hurriedli in a huski but melodi bass voic why did you push yourself in there by daylight you ass well why haven t you taken on oh i took on all right said t khon where is he you see i took him first thing at dawn t khon continu spread out hi flat feet with outturn toe in their bast shoe i took him into the forest then i see he s no good and think i ll go and fetch a likeli on you see what a wogu it s just as i thought said den sov to the esaul why didn t you bwing that on what wa the good of bring him t khon interrupt hastili and angrili that on wouldn t have done for you as if i don t know what sort you want what a bwute you ar well i went for anoth on t khon continu and i crept like thi through the wood and lai down he suddenli lai down on hi stomach with a suppl movement to show how he had done it on turn up and i grab him like thi he jump up quickli and lightli come along to the colonel i said he start yell and suddenli there were four of them thei rush at me with their littl sword so i went for them with my ax thi wai what ar you up to sai i christ be with you shout t khon wave hi arm with an angri scowl and throw out hi chest ye we saw from the hill how you took to your heel through the puddl said the esaul screw up hi glitter ey p tya badli want to laugh but notic that thei all refrain from laugh he turn hi ey rapidli from t khon s face to the esaul s and den sov s unabl to make out what it all meant don t plai the fool said den sov cough angrili why didn t you bwing the first on t khon scratch hi back with on hand and hi head with the other then suddenli hi whole face expand into a beam foolish grin disclos a gap where he had lost a tooth that wa why he wa call shcherb ty the gaptooth den sov smile and p tya burst into a peal of merri laughter in which t khon himself join oh but he wa a regular goodfornoth said t khon the cloth on him poor stuff how could i bring him and so rude your honor why he sai i m a gener s son myself i won t go he sai you ar a bwute said den sov i want to question but i question him said t khon he said he didn t know much there ar a lot of us he sai but all poor stuff onli soldier in name he sai shout loud at them he sai and you ll take them all t khon conclud look cheerfulli and resolut into den sov s ey i ll give you a hundw sharp lash that ll teach you to plai the fool said den sov sever but why ar you angri remonstr t khon just as if i d never seen your frenchmen onli wait till it get dark and i ll fetch you ani of them you want three if you like well let s go said den sov and rode all the wai to the watchhous in silenc and frown angrili t khon follow behind and p tya heard the cossack laugh with him and at him about some pair of boot he had thrown into the bush when the fit of laughter that had seiz him at t khon s word and smile had pass and p tya realiz for a moment that thi t khon had kill a man he felt uneasi he look round at the captiv drummer boi and felt a pang in hi heart but thi uneasi last onli a moment he felt it necessari to hold hi head higher to brace himself and to question the esaul with an air of import about tomorrow s undertak that he might not be unworthi of the compani in which he found himself the offic who had been sent to inquir met den sov on the wai with the new that d lokhov wa soon come and that all wa well with him den sov at onc cheer up and call p tya to him said well tell me about yourself chapter vii p tya have left hi peopl after their departur from moscow join hi regiment and wa soon taken as orderli by a gener command a larg guerrilla detach from the time he receiv hi commiss and especi sinc he had join the activ armi and taken part in the battl of vy zma p tya had been in a constant state of bliss excit at be grownup and in a perpetu ecstat hurri not to miss ani chanc to do someth realli heroic he wa highli delight with what he saw and experienc in the armi but at the same time it alwai seem to him that the realli heroic exploit were be perform just where he did not happen to be and he wa alwai in a hurri to get where he wa not when on the twentyfirst of octob hi gener express a wish to send somebodi to den sov s detach p tya beg so piteous to be sent that the gener could not refus but when dispatch him he recal p tya s mad action at the battl of vy zma where instead of ride by the road to the place to which he had been sent he had gallop to the advanc line under the fire of the french and had there twice fire hi pistol so now the gener explicitli forbad hi take part in ani action whatev of den sov s that wa why p tya had blush and grown confus when den sov ask him whether he could stai befor thei had ridden to the outskirt of the forest p tya had consid he must carri out hi instruct strictli and return at onc but when he saw the french and saw t khon and learn that there would certainli be an attack that night he decid with the rapid with which young peopl chang their view that the gener whom he had greatli respect till then wa a rubbishi german that den sov wa a hero the esaul a hero and t khon a hero too and that it would be shame for him to leav them at a moment of difficulti it wa alreadi grow dusk when den sov p tya and the esaul rode up to the watchhous in the twilight saddl hors could be seen and cossack and hussar who had rig up rough shelter in the glade and were kindl

karat ev and the grayblu bandyleg dog that had chosen karat ev for it master on the third dai after leav moscow karat ev again fell ill with the fever he had suffer from in the hospit in moscow and as he grew gradual weaker pierr kept awai from him pierr did not know why but sinc karat ev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him when he did so and heard the subdu moan with which karat ev gener lai down at the halt place and when he smell the odor eman from him which wa now stronger than befor pierr move farther awai and did not think about him while imprison in the shed pierr had learn not with hi intellect but with hi whole be by life itself that man is creat for happi that happi is within him in the satisfact of simpl human need and that all unhappi aris not from privat but from superflu and now dure these last three week of the march he had learn still anoth new consolatori truth that noth in thi world is terribl he had learn that as there is no condit in which man can be happi and entir free so there is no condit in which he need be unhappi and lack freedom he learn that suffer and freedom have their limit and that those limit ar veri near togeth that the person in a bed of rose with on crumpl petal suffer as keenli as he now sleep on the bare damp earth with on side grow chill while the other wa warm and that when he had put on tight danc shoe he had suffer just as he did now when he walk with bare feet that were cover with sore hi footgear have long sinc fallen to piec he discov that when he had marri hi wife of hi own free will as it had seem to him he had been no more free than now when thei lock him up at night in a stabl of all that he himself subsequ term hi suffer but which at the time he scarc felt the worst wa the state of hi bare raw and scabcov feet the horseflesh wa appet and nourish the saltpet flavor of the gunpowd thei us instead of salt wa even pleasant there wa no great cold it wa alwai warm walk in the daytim and at night there were the campfir the lice that devour him warm hi bodi the on thing that wa at first hard to bear wa hi feet after the second dai s march pierr have examin hi feet by the campfir thought it would be imposs to walk on them but when everybodi got up he went along limp and when he had warm up walk without feel the pain though at night hi feet were more terribl to look at than befor howev he did not look at them now but thought of other thing onli now did pierr realiz the full strength of life in man and the save power he ha of transfer hi attent from on thing to anoth which is like the safeti valv of a boiler that allow superflu steam to blow off when the pressur exce a certain limit he did not see and did not hear how thei shot the prison who lag behind though more than a hundr perish in that wai he did not think of karat ev who grew weaker everi dai and evid would soon have to share that fate still less did pierr think about himself the harder hi posit becam and the more terribl the futur the more independ of that posit in which he found himself were the joy and comfort thought memori and imagin that came to him chapter xiii at middai on the twentysecond of octob pierr wa go uphil along the muddi slipperi road look at hi feet and at the rough of the wai occasion he glanc at the familiar crowd around him and then again at hi feet the former and the latter were alik familiar and hi own the bluegrai bandi leg dog ran merrili along the side of the road sometim in proof of it agil and selfsatisfact lift on hind leg and hop along on three and then again go on all four and rush to bark at the crow that sat on the carrion the dog wa merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around lai the flesh of differ anim from men to hors in variou stage of decomposit and as the wolv were kept off by the pass men the dog could eat all it want it had been rain sinc morn and had seem as if at ani moment it might ceas and the sky clear but after a short break it began rain harder than befor the satur road no longer absorb the water which ran along the rut in stream pierr walk along look from side to side count hi step in three and reckon them off on hi finger mental address the rain he repeat now then now then go on pelt harder it seem to him that he wa think of noth but far down and deep within him hi soul wa occupi with someth import and comfort thi someth wa a most subtl spiritu deduct from a convers with karat ev the dai befor at their yesterdai s halt place feel chilli by a dy campfir pierr had got up and gone to the next on which wa burn better there plat n karat ev wa sit cover up head and all with hi greatcoat as if it were a vestment tell the soldier in hi effect and pleasant though now feebl voic a stori pierr knew it wa alreadi past midnight the hour when karat ev wa usual free of hi fever and particularli live when pierr reach the fire and heard plat n s voic enfeebl by ill and saw hi pathet face brightli lit up by the blaze he felt a pain prick at hi heart hi feel of piti for thi man frighten him and he wish to go awai but there wa no other fire and pierr sat down try not to look at plat n well how ar you he ask how am i if we grumbl at sick god won t grant us death repli plat n and at onc resum the stori he had begun and so brother he continu with a smile on hi pale emaci face and a particularli happi light in hi ey you see brother pierr had long been familiar with that stori karat ev had told it to him alon some halfdozen time and alwai with a special joy emot but well as he

carri awai the properti that had been stolen by the emperor king and duke but the process of the flight and disintegr of the french armi went on essenti as befor from moscow to vy zma the french armi of seventythre thousand men not reckon the guard who did noth dure the whole war but pillag wa reduc to thirtysix thousand though not more than five thousand had fallen in battl from thi begin the succeed term of the progress could be determin mathemat the french armi melt awai and perish at the same rate from moscow to vy zma from vy zma to smol nsk from smol nsk to the ber zina and from the

said i deem it my duti to report to your majesti the condit of the variou corp i have had occas to observ dure differ stage of the last two or three dai march thei ar almost disband scarc a quarter of the soldier remain with the standard of their regiment the other go off by themselv in differ direct hope to find food and escap disciplin in gener thei regard smol nsk as the place where thei hope to recov dure the last few dai mani of the men have been seen to throw awai their cartridg and their arm in such a state of affair whatev your ultim plan mai be the interest of your majesti s servic demand that the armi should be ralli at smol nsk and should first of all be freed from ineffect such as dismount cavalri unnecessari baggag and artilleri materi that is no longer in proport to the present forc the soldier who ar worn out with hunger and fatigu need these suppli as well as a few dai rest mani have di these last dai on the road or at the bivouac thi state of thing is continu becom wors and make on fear that unless a prompt remedi is appli the troop will no longer be under control in case of an engag novemb twenti mile from smol nsk after stagger into smol nsk which seem to them a promis land the french search for food kill on anoth sack their own store and when everyth had been plunder fled farther thei all went without know whither or why thei were go still less did that geniu napoleon know it for no on issu ani order to him but still he and those about him retain their old habit wrote command letter report and order of the dai call on anoth sire mon cousin princ d eckm hl roi de napl and so on but these order and report were onli on paper noth in them wa act upon for thei could not be carri out and though thei entitl on anoth majesti high or cousin thei all felt that thei were miser wretch who had done much evil for which thei had now to pai and though thei pretend to be concern about the armi each wa think onli of himself and of how to get awai quickli and save himself chapter xvii the movement of the russian and french armi dure the campaign from moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian blindman s bluff in which two player ar blindfold and on of them occasion ring a littl bell to inform the catcher of hi whereabout first he ring hi bell fearlessli but when he get into a tight place he run awai as quietli as he can and often think to escap run straight into hi oppon s arm at first while thei were still move along the kal ga road napoleon s armi made their presenc known but later when thei reach the smol nsk road thei ran hold the clapper of their bell tight and often think thei were escap ran right into the russian ow to the rapid of the french flight and the russian pursuit and the consequ exhaust of the hors the chief mean of approxim ascertain the enemi s posit by cavalri scout wa not avail besid as a result of the frequent and rapid chang of posit by each armi even what inform wa obtain could not be deliv in time if new wa receiv on dai that the enemi had been in a certain posit the dai befor by the third dai when someth could have been done that armi wa alreadi two dai march farther on and in quit anoth posit on armi fled and the other pursu beyond smol nsk there were sever differ road avail for the french and on would have thought that dure their stai of four dai thei might have learn where the enemi wa might have arrang some more advantag plan and undertaken someth new but after a four dai halt the mob with no maneuv or plan again began run along the beaten track neither to the right nor to the left but along the old the worst road through kr snoe and orsh expect the enemi from behind and not in front the french separ in their flight and spread out over a distanc of twentyfour hour in front of them all fled the emperor then the king then the duke the russian armi expect napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the dnieper which wa the onli reason thing for him to do themselv turn to the right and came out onto the highroad at kr snoe and here as in a game of blindman s buff the french ran into our vanguard see their enemi unexpectedli the french fell into confus and stop short from the sudden fright but then thei resum their flight abandon their comrad who were farther behind then for three dai separ portion of the french armi first murat s the vicek s then davout s and then nei s ran as it were the gauntlet of the russian armi thei abandon on anoth abandon all their heavi baggag their artilleri and half their men and fled get past the russian by night by make semicircl to the right nei who came last had been busi himself blow up the wall of smol nsk which were in nobodi s wai becaus despit the unfortun plight of the french or becaus of it thei wish to punish the floor against which thei had hurt themselv nei who had had a corp of ten thousand men reach napoleon at orsh with onli on thousand men left have abandon all the rest and all hi cannon and have cross the dnieper at night by stealth at a wood spot from orsh thei fled farther along the road to v lna still plai at blindman s buff with the pursu armi at the ber zina thei again becam disorgan mani were drown and mani surrend but those who got across the river fled farther their suprem chief don a fur coat and have seat himself in a sleigh gallop on alon abandon hi companion the other who could do so drove awai too leav those who could not to surrend or die chapter xviii thi campaign consist in a flight of the french dure which thei did all thei could to destroi themselv from the time thei turn onto the kal ga road to the dai their leader fled from the armi none of the movement of the crowd had ani sens so on might have thought that regard thi period of the campaign the historian who attribut the action of the mass to the will of on man would have found it imposs to make the stori of the retreat fit their theori but no mountain of book have been written by the historian about thi campaign and everywher ar describ napoleon s arrang the maneuv and hi profound plan which guid the armi as well as the militari geniu shown by hi marshal the retreat from m loyarosl vet when he had a free road into a wellsuppli district and the parallel road wa open to him along which kut zov afterward pursu him thi unnecessari retreat along a devast road is explain to us as be due to profound consider similarli profound consider ar given for hi retreat from smol nsk to orsh then hi heroism at kr snoe is describ where he is report to have been prepar to accept battl and take person command and to have walk about with a birch stick and said j ai assez fait l empereur il est temp de fair le g n ral but nevertheless immedi ran awai again abandon to it fate the scatter fragment of the armi he left behind i have act the emperor long enough it is time to act the gener then we ar told of the great of soul of the marshal especi of nei a great of soul consist in thi that he made hi wai by night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escap to orsh abandon standard artilleri and nine tenth of hi men and lastli the final departur of the great emperor from hi heroic armi is present to us by the historian as someth great and characterist of geniu even that final run awai describ in ordinari languag as the lowest depth of base which everi child is taught to be asham of even that act find justif in the historian languag when it is imposs to stretch the veri elast thread of histor ratiocin ani farther when action ar clearli contrari to all that human call right or even just the historian produc a save concept of great great it seem exclud the standard of right and wrong for the great man noth is wrong there is no atroc for which a great man can be blame c est grand sai the historian and there no longer exist either good or evil but onli grand and not grand grand is good not grand is bad grand is the characterist in their concept of some special anim call hero and napoleon escap home in a warm fur coat and leav to perish those who were not mere hi comrad but were in hi opinion men he had brought there feel que c est grand and hi soul is tranquil it is great that it is great du sublim he saw someth sublim in himself au ridicul il n y a qu un pa said he and the whole world for fifti year ha been repeat sublim grand napol on le grand du sublim au ridicul il n y a qu un pa from the sublim to the ridicul is but a step and it occur to no on that to admit a great not commensur with the standard of right and wrong is mere to admit on s own nothing and immeasur mean for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ no human action ar incommensur and there is no great where simplic good and truth ar absent chapter xix what russian read the account of the last part of the campaign of ha not experienc an uncomfort feel of regret dissatisfact and perplex who ha not ask himself how it is that the french were not all captur or destroi when our three armi surround them in superior number when the disord french hungri and freez surrend in crowd and when as the historian relat the aim of the russian wa to stop the french to cut them off and captur them all how wa it that the russian armi which when numer weaker than the french had given battl at borodin did not achiev it purpos when it had surround the french on three side and when it aim wa to captur them can the french be so enorm superior to us that when we had surround them with superior forc we could not beat them how could that happen histori or what is call by that name repli to these question sai that thi occur becaus kut zov and torm sov and chichag v and thi man and that man did not execut such and such maneuv but why did thei not execut those maneuv and why if thei were guilti of not carri out a prearrang plan were thei not tri and punish but even if we admit that kut zov chichag v and other were the caus of the russian failur it is still incomprehens why the posit of the russian armi be what it wa at kr snoe and at the ber zina in both case we had superior forc the french armi with it marshal king and emperor wa not captur if that wa what the russian aim at the explan of thi strang fact given by russian militari historian to the effect that kut zov hinder an attack is unfound for we know that he could not restrain the troop from attack at vy zma and tar tino why wa the russian armi which with inferior forc had withstood the enemi in full strength at borodin defeat at kr snoe and the ber zina by the disorgan crowd of the french when it wa numer superior if the aim of the russian consist in cut off and captur napoleon and hi marshal and that aim wa not mere frustrat but all attempt to attain it were most shamefulli baffl then thi last period of the campaign is quit rightli consid by the french to be a seri of victori and quit wrongli consid victori by russian historian the russian militari historian in so far as thei submit to claim of logic must admit that conclus and in spite of their lyric rhapsodi about valor devot and so forth must reluctantli admit that the french retreat from moscow wa a seri of victori for napoleon and defeat for kut zov but put nation vaniti entir asid on feel that such a conclus involv a contradict sinc the seri of french victori brought the french complet destruct while the seri of russian defeat led to the total destruct of their enemi and the liber of their countri the sourc of thi contradict li in the fact that the historian studi the event from the letter of the sovereign and the gener from memoir report project and so forth have attribut to thi last period of the war of an aim that never exist name that of cut off and captur napoleon with hi marshal and hi armi there never wa or could have been such an aim for it would have been senseless and it attain quit imposs it would have been senseless first becaus napoleon s disorgan armi wa fly from russia with all possibl speed that is to sai wa do just what everi russian desir so what wa the us of perform variou oper on the french who were run awai as fast as thei possibl could secondli it would have been senseless to block the passag of men whose whole energi wa direct to flight thirdli it would have been senseless to sacrific on s own troop in order to destroi the french armi which without extern interfer wa destroi itself at such a rate that though it path wa not block it could not carri across the frontier more than it actual did in decemb name a hundredth part of the origin armi fourthli it would have been senseless to wish to take captiv the emperor king and duke whose captur would have been in the highest degre embarrass for the russian as the most adroit diplomatist of the time joseph de maistr and other recogn still more senseless would have been the wish to captur armi corp of the french when our own armi had melt awai to half befor reach kr snoe and a whole divis would have been need to convoi the corp of prison and when our men were not alwai get full ration and the prison alreadi taken were perish of hunger all the profound plan about cut off and captur napoleon and hi armi were like the plan of a market garden who when drive out of hi garden a cow that had trampl down the bed he had plant should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head the onli thing to be said in excus of that garden would be that he wa veri angri but not even that could be said for those who drew up thi project for it wa not thei who had suffer from the trampl bed but besid the fact that cut off napoleon with hi armi would have been senseless it wa imposs it wa imposs first becaus as experi show that a threemil movement of column on a battlefield never coincid with the plan the probabl of chichag v kut zov and wittgenstein effect a junction on time at an appoint place wa so remot as to be tantamount to imposs as in fact thought kut zov who when he receiv the plan remark that divers plan over great distanc do not yield the desir result secondli it wa imposs becaus to paralyz the momentum with which napoleon s armi wa retir incompar greater forc than the russian possess would have been requir thirdli it wa imposs becaus the militari term to cut off ha no mean on can cut off a slice of bread but not an armi to cut off an armi to bar it road is quit imposs for there is alwai plenti of room to avoid captur and there is the night when noth can be seen as the militari scientist might convinc themselv by the exampl of kr snoe and of the ber zina it is onli possibl to captur prison if thei agre to be captur just as it is onli possibl to catch a swallow if it settl on on s hand men can onli be taken prison if thei surrend accord to the rule of strategi and tactic as the german did but the french troop quit rightli did not consid that thi suit them sinc death by hunger and cold await them in flight or captiv alik fourthli and chiefli it wa imposs becaus never sinc the world began ha a war been fought under such condit as those that obtain in and the russian armi in it pursuit of the french strain it strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroi itself dure the movement of the russian armi from tar tino to kr snoe it lost fifti thousand sick or straggler that is a number equal to the popul of a larg provinci town half the men fell out of the armi without a battl and it is of thi period of the campaign when the armi lack boot and sheepskin coat wa short of provis and without vodka and wa camp out at night for month in the snow with fifteen degre of frost when there were onli seven or eight hour of daylight and the rest wa night in which the influenc of disciplin cannot be maintain when men were taken into that region of death where disciplin fail not for a few hour onli as in a battl but for month where thei were everi moment fight death from hunger and cold when half the armi perish in a singl month it is of thi period of the campaign that the historian tell us how milor dovich should have made a flank march to such and such a place torm sov to anoth place and chichag v should have cross more than kneedeep in snow to somewher els and how soandso rout and cut off the french and so on and so on the russian half of whom di did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthi of the nation and thei ar not to blame becaus other russian sit in warm room propos that thei should do what wa imposs all that strang contradict now difficult to understand between the fact and the histor account onli aris becaus the historian deal with the matter have written the histori of the beauti word and sentiment of variou gener and not the histori of the event to them the word of milor dovich seem veri interest and so do their surmis and the reward thi or that gener receiv but the question of those fifti thousand men who were left in hospit and in grave doe not even interest them for it doe not come within the rang of their investig yet on need onli discard the studi of the report and gener plan and consid the movement of those hundr of thousand of men who took a direct part in the event and all the question that seem insolubl easili and simpli receiv an immedi and certain solut the aim of cut off napoleon and hi armi never exist except in the imagin of a dozen peopl it could not exist becaus it wa senseless and unattain the peopl had a singl aim to free their land from invas that aim wa attain in the first place of itself as the french ran awai and so it wa onli necessari not to stop their flight secondli it wa attain by the guerrilla warfar which wa destroi the french and thirdli by the fact that a larg russian armi wa follow the french readi to us it strength in case their movement stop the russian armi had to act like a whip to a run anim and the experienc driver knew it wa better to hold the whip rais as a menac than to strike the run anim on the head book fifteen chapter i when see a dy anim a man feel a sens of horror substanc similar to hi own is perish befor hi ey but when it is a belov and intim human be that is dy besid thi horror

did not think of appli submiss and selfabneg to her own life for she wa accustom to seek other joi but she understood and love in anoth those previous incomprehens virtu for princess mari listen to nat sha s tale of childhood and earli youth there also open out a new and hitherto uncomprehend side of life belief in life and it enjoy just as befor thei never mention him so as not to lower as thei

again though she could hear duni sha come call her in the deep chest tone in which she had been wont to sing and listen attent to herself she did not know and would not have believ it but beneath the layer of slime that cover her soul and seem to her impenetr delic young shoot of grass were alreadi sprout which take root would so cover with their live verdur the grief that weigh her down that it would soon no longer be seen or notic the wound had begun to heal from within at the end of januari princess mari left for moscow and the count insist on nat sha s go with her to consult the doctor chapter iv after the encount at vy zma where kut zov had been unabl to hold back hi troop in their anxieti to overwhelm and cut off the enemi and so on the farther movement of the flee french and of the russian who pursu them continu as far as kr snoe without a battl the flight wa so rapid that the russian armi pursu the french could not keep up with them cavalri and artilleri hors broke down and the inform receiv of the movement of the french wa never reliabl the men in the russian armi were so worn out by thi continu march at the rate of twentyseven mile a dai that thei could not go ani faster to realiz the degre of exhaust of the russian armi it is onli necessari to grasp clearli the mean of the fact that while not lose more than five thousand kill and wound after tar tino and less than a hundr prison the russian armi which left that place a hundr thousand strong reach kr snoe with onli fifti thousand the rapid of the russian pursuit wa just as destruct to our armi as the flight of the french wa to their the onli differ wa that the russian armi move voluntarili with no such threat of destruct as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in enemi hand while the sick russian left behind were among their own peopl the chief caus of the wastag of napoleon s armi wa the rapid of it movement and a convinc proof of thi is the correspond decreas of the russian armi kut zov as far as wa in hi power instead of try to check the movement of the french as wa desir in petersburg and by the russian armi gener direct hi whole activ here as he had done at tar tino and vy zma to hasten it on while eas the movement of our armi but besid thi sinc the exhaust and enorm diminut of the armi caus by the rapid of the advanc had becom evid anoth reason for slacken the pace and delai present itself to kut zov the aim of the russian armi wa to pursu the french the road the french would take wa unknown and so the closer our troop trod on their heel the greater distanc thei had to cover onli by follow at some distanc could on cut across the zigzag path of the french all the art maneuv suggest by our gener meant fresh movement of the armi and a lengthen of it march wherea the onli reason aim wa to shorten those march to that end kut zov s activ wa direct dure the whole campaign from moscow to v lna not casual or intermitt but so consist that he never onc deviat from it kut zov felt and knew not by reason or scienc but with the whole of hi russian be what everi russian soldier felt that the french were beaten that the enemi wa fly and must be driven out but at the same time he like the soldier realiz all the hardship of thi march the rapid of which wa unparallel for such a time of the year but to the gener especi the foreign on in the russian armi who wish to distinguish themselv to astonish somebodi and for some reason to captur a king or a duke it seem that now when ani battl must be horribl and senseless wa the veri time to fight and conquer somebodi kut zov mere shrug hi shoulder when on after anoth thei present project of maneuv to be made with those soldier illshod insuffici clad and half starv who within a month and without fight a battl had dwindl to half their number and who at the best if the flight continu would have to go a greater distanc than thei had alreadi travers befor thei reach the frontier thi long to distinguish themselv to maneuv to overthrow and to cut off show itself particularli whenev the russian stumbl on the french armi so it wa at kr snoe where thei expect to find on of the three french column and stumbl instead on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men despit all kut zov s effort to avoid that ruinou encount and to preserv hi troop the massacr of the broken mob of french soldier by wornout russian continu at kr snoe for three dai toll wrote a disposit the first column will march to so and so etc and as usual noth happen in accord with the disposit princ eug ne of w rttemberg fire from a hill over the french crowd that were run past and demand reinforc which did not arriv the french avoid the russian dispers and hid themselv in the forest by night make their wai round as best thei could and continu their flight milor dovich who said he did not want to know anyth about the commissariat affair of hi detach and could never be found when he wa want that chevali san peur et san reproch as he style himself who wa fond of parlei with the french sent envoi demand their surrend wast time and did not do what he wa order to do knight without fear and without reproach i give you that column lad he said ride up to the troop and point out the french to the cavalri and the cavalri with spur and saber urg on hors that could scarc move trot with much effort to the column present to them that is to sai to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold frostbitten and starv and the column that had been present to them threw down it arm and surrend as it had long been anxiou to do at kr snoe thei took twentysix thousand prison sever hundr cannon and a stick call a marshal s staff and disput as to who had distinguish himself and were pleas with their achiev though thei much regret not have taken napoleon or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort and reproach on anoth and especi kut zov for have fail to do so these men carri awai by their passion were but blind tool of the most melancholi law of necess but consid themselv hero and imagin that thei were accomplish a most nobl and honor deed thei blame kut zov and said that from the veri begin of the campaign he had prevent their vanquish napoleon that he thought of noth but satisfi hi passion and would not advanc from the linen factori becaus he wa comfort there that at kr snoe he check the advanc becaus on learn that napoleon wa there he had quit lost hi head and that it wa probabl that he had an understand with napoleon and had been bribe by him and so on and so on not onli did hi contemporari carri awai by their passion talk in thi wai but poster and histori have acclaim napoleon as grand while kut zov is describ by foreign as a crafti dissolut weak old courtier and by russian as someth indefinit a sort of puppet us onli becaus he had a russian name chapter v in and kut zov wa openli accus of blunder the emperor wa dissatisfi with him and in a histori recent written by order of the highest author it is said that kut zov wa a cun court liar frighten of the name of napoleon and that by hi blunder at kr snoe and the ber zina he depriv the russian armi of the glori of complet victori over the french histori of the year the charact of kut zov and reflect on the unsatisfactori result of the battl at kr snoe by bogd novich such is the fate not of great men grand homm whom the russian mind doe not acknowledg but of those rare and alwai solitari individu who discern the will of provid submit their person will to it the hatr and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discern the higher law for russian historian strang and terribl to sai napoleon that most insignific tool of histori who never anywher even in exil show human digniti napoleon is the object of adul and enthusiasm he is grand but kut zov the man who from the begin to the end of hi activ in never onc swerv by word or deed from borodin to v lna present an exampl except in histori of selfsacrific and a present conscious of the futur import of what wa happen kut zov seem to them someth indefinit and piti and when speak of him and of the year thei alwai seem a littl asham and yet it is difficult to imagin an histor charact whose activ wa so unswervingli direct to a singl aim and it would be difficult to imagin ani aim more worthi or more conson with the will of the whole peopl still more difficult would it be to find an instanc in histori of the aim of an histor personag be so complet accomplish as that to which all kut zov s effort were direct in kut zov never talk of forti centuri look down from the pyramid of the sacrific he offer for the fatherland or of what he intend to accomplish or had accomplish in gener he said noth about himself adopt no pose alwai appear to be the simplest and most ordinari of men and said the simplest and most ordinari thing he wrote letter to hi daughter and to madam de sta l read novel like the societi of pretti women jest with gener offic and soldier and never contradict those who tri to prove anyth to him when count rostopch n at the ya za bridg gallop up to kut zov with person reproach for have caus the destruct of moscow and said how wa it you promis not to abandon moscow without a battl kut zov repli and i shall not abandon moscow without a battl though moscow wa then alreadi abandon when arakch ev come to him from the emperor said that erm lov ought to be appoint chief of the artilleri kut zov repli ye i wa just sai so myself though a moment befor he had said quit the contrari what did it matter to him who then alon amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremend signific of what wa happen what did it matter to him whether rostopch n attribut the calam of moscow to him or to himself still less could it matter to him who wa appoint chief of the artilleri not mere in these case but continu did that old man who by experi of life had reach the convict that thought and the word serv as their express ar not what move peopl us quit meaningless word that happen to enter hi head but that man so heedless of hi word did not onc dure the whole time of hi activ utter on word inconsist with the singl aim toward which he move throughout the whole war obvious in spite of himself in veri divers circumst he repeatedli express hi real thought with the bitter convict that he would not be understood begin with the battl of borodin from which time hi disagr with those about him began he alon said that the battl of borodin wa a victori and repeat thi both verbal and in hi dispatch and report up to the time of hi death he alon said that the loss of moscow is not the loss of russia in repli to lauriston s propos of peac he said there can be no peac for such is the peopl s will he alon dure the retreat of the french said that all our maneuv ar useless everyth is be accomplish of itself better than we could desir that the enemi must be offer a golden bridg that neither the tar tino the vy zma nor the kr snoe battl were necessari that we must keep some forc to reach the frontier with and that he would not sacrific a singl russian for ten frenchmen and thi courtier as he is describ to us who li to arakch ev to pleas the emperor he alon incur therebi the emperor s displeasur said in v lna that to carri the war beyond the frontier is useless and harm nor do word alon prove that onli he understood the mean of the event hi action without the smallest deviat were all direct to on and the same threefold end to brace all hi strength for conflict with the french to defeat them and to drive them out of russia minim as far as possibl the suffer of our peopl and of our armi thi procrastin kut zov whose motto wa patienc and time thi enemi of decis action gave battl at borodin invest the prepar for it with unparallel solemn thi kut zov who befor the battl of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alon in contradict to everyon els declar till hi death that borodin wa a victori despit the assur of gener that the battl wa lost and despit the fact that for an armi to have to retir after win a battl wa unpreced he alon dure the whole retreat insist that battl which were useless then should not be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontier of russia cross it is easi now to understand the signific of these event if onli we abstain from attribut to the activ of the mass aim that exist onli in the head of a dozen individu for the event and result now lie befor us but how did that old man alon in opposit to the gener opinion so truli discern the

french side thi is onli becaus at the broken bridg across that river the calam their armi had been previous endur were suddenli concentr at on moment into a tragic spectacl that remain in everi memori and on the russian side mere becaus in petersburg far from the seat of war a plan again on of pfuel s had been devis to catch napoleon in a strateg trap at the ber zina river everyon assur himself that all would happen accord to plan and therefor insist that it wa just the cross of the ber zina that destroi the french armi in realiti the result of the cross were much less disastr to the french in gun and men lost than kr snoe had been as the figur show the sole import of the cross of the ber zina li in the fact that it plainli and indubit prove the fallaci of all the plan for cut off the enemi s retreat and the sound of the onli possibl line of action the on kut zov and the gener mass of the armi demand name simpli to follow the enemi up the french crowd fled at a continu increas speed and all it energi wa direct to reach it goal it fled like a wound anim and it wa imposs to block it path thi wa shown not so much by the arrang it made for cross as by what took place at the bridg when the bridg broke down unarm soldier peopl from moscow and women with children who were with the french transport all carri on by vi inerti press forward into boat and into the icecov water and did not surrend that impuls wa reason the condit of fugit and of pursuer wa equal bad as long as thei remain with their own peopl each might hope for help from hi fellow and the definit place he held among them but those who surrend while remain in the same piti plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necess of life the french did not need to be inform of the fact that half the prison with whom the russian did not know what to do perish of cold and hunger despit their captor desir to save them thei felt that it could not be otherwis the most compassion russian command those favor to the french and even the frenchmen in the russian servic could do noth for the prison the french perish from the condit to which the russian armi wa itself expos it wa imposs to take bread and cloth from our hungri and indispens soldier to give to the french who though not harm or hate or guilti were simpli unnecessari some russian even did that but thei were except certain destruct lai behind the french but in front there wa hope their ship had been burn there wa no salvat save in collect flight and on that the whole strength of the french wa concentr the farther thei

for hi sanction thei appear to be fulfil a regrett formal but thei wink behind hi back and tri to mislead him at everi turn becaus thei could not understand him all these peopl assum that it wa useless to talk to the old man that he would never grasp the profund of their plan that he would answer with hi phrase which thei thought were mere phrase about a golden bridg about the imposs of cross the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalion and so forth thei had heard all that befor and all he said that it wa necessari to await provis or that the men had no boot wa so simpl while what

all as pleas as he wa himself and mere tri to hide that pleasur by pretend to be busi with other interest in everi word and gestur he saw allus to hi happi he often surpris those he met by hi significantli happi look and smile which seem to express a secret understand between him and them and when he realiz that peopl might not be awar of hi happi he piti them with hi whole heart and felt a desir somehow to explain to them that all that occupi them wa a mere frivol trifl unworthi of attent when it wa suggest to him that he should enter the civil servic or when the war or ani gener polit affair were discuss on the assumpt that everybodi s welfar depend on thi or that issu of event he would listen with a mild and piti smile and surpris peopl by hi strang comment but at thi time he saw everybodi both those who as he imagin understood the real mean of life that is what he wa feel and those unfortun who evid did not understand it in the bright light of the emot that shone

or inwardli at varianc he refer to the view he had held at thi time of hi mad and thei alwai prove correct i mai have appear strang and queer then he thought but i wa not so mad as i seem on the contrari i wa then wiser and had more insight than at ani other time and understood all that is worth understand in life becaus becaus i wa happi pierr s insan consist in not wait as he us to do to discov person attribut which he term good qualiti in peopl befor love them hi heart wa now overflow with love and by love peopl without caus he discov indubit caus for love them chapter xx after pierr s departur that first even when nat sha had said to princess mari with a gaili mock smile he look just ye just as if he had come out of a russian bath in a short coat and with hi hair crop someth hidden and unknown to herself but irrepress awok in nat sha s soul everyth her face walk look and voic wa suddenli alter to her own surpris a power of life and hope of happi rose to the surfac and demand satisfact from that even she seem to have forgotten all that had happen to her she no longer complain of her posit did not sai a word about the past and no longer fear to make happi plan for the futur she spoke littl of pierr but when princess mari mention him a longextinguish light onc more kindl in her ey and her lip curv with a strang smile the chang that took place in nat sha at first surpris princess mari but when she understood it mean it griev her can she have love my brother so littl as to be abl to forget him so soon she thought when she reflect on the chang but when she wa with nat sha she wa not vex with her and did not reproach her the reawaken power of life that had seiz nat sha wa so evid irrepress and unexpect by her that in her presenc princess mari felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart nat sha gave herself up so fulli and frankli to thi new feel that she did not try to hide the fact that she wa no longer sad but bright and cheer when princess mari return to her room after her nocturn talk with pierr nat sha met her on the threshold he ha spoken ye he ha spoken she repeat and a joy yet pathet express which seem to beg forgiv for her joi settl on nat sha s face i want to listen at the door but i knew you would tell me understand and touch as the look with which nat sha gaze at her seem to princess mari and sorri as she wa to see her agit these word pain her for a moment she rememb her brother and hi love but what s to be done she can t help it thought the princess and with a sad and rather stern look she told nat sha all that pierr had said on hear that he wa go to petersburg nat sha wa astound to petersburg she repeat as if unabl to understand but notic the griev express on princess mari s face she guess the reason of that sad and suddenli began to cry mari said she tell me what i should do i am afraid of be bad whatev you tell me i will do tell me you love him ye whisper nat sha then why ar you cry i am happi for your sake said princess mari who becaus of those tear quit forgav nat sha s joi it won t be just yet somedai think what fun it will be when i am hi wife and you marri nichola nat sha i have ask you not to speak of that let us talk about you thei were silent awhil but why go to petersburg nat sha suddenli ask and hastili repli to her own question but no no he must ye mari he must first epilogu chapter i seven year had pass the stormtoss sea of european histori had subsid within it shore and seem to have becom calm but the mysteri forc that move human mysteri becaus the law of their motion ar unknown to us continu to oper though the surfac of the sea of histori seem motionless the movement of human went on as unceasingli as the flow of time variou group of peopl form and dissolv the come format and dissolut of kingdom and displac of peopl wa in cours of prepar the sea of histori wa not driven spasmod from shore to shore as previous it wa seeth in it depth histor figur were not born by the wave from on shore to anoth as befor thei now seem to rotat on on spot the histor figur at the head of armi who formerli reflect the movement of the mass by order war campaign and battl now reflect the restless movement by polit and diplomat combin law and treati the historian call thi activ of the histor figur the reaction in deal with thi period thei sternli condemn the histor personag who in their opinion caus what thei describ as the reaction all the wellknown peopl of that period from alexand and napoleon to madam de sta l photiu schell ficht chateaubriand and the rest pass befor their stern judgment seat and ar acquit or condemn accord to whether thei conduc to progress or to reaction accord to their account a reaction took place at that time in russia also and the chief culprit wa alexand i the same man who accord to them wa the chief caus of the liber movement at the commenc of hi reign be the savior of russia there is no on in russian literatur now from schoolboi essayist to learn historian who doe not throw hi littl stone at alexand for thing he did wrong at thi period of hi reign he ought to have act in thi wai and in that wai in thi case he did well and in that case badli he behav admir at the begin of hi reign and dure but act badli by give a constitut to poland form the holi allianc entrust power to arakch ev favor gol tsyn and mystic and afterward shishk v and photiu he also act badli by concern himself with the activ armi and disband the sem nov regiment it would take a dozen page to enumer all the reproach the historian address to him base on their knowledg of what is good for human what do these reproach mean do not the veri action for which the historian prais alexand i the liber attempt at the begin of hi reign hi struggl with napoleon the firm he displai in and the campaign of flow from the same sourc the circumst of hi birth educ and life that made hi person what it wa and from which the action for which thei blame him the holi allianc the restor of poland and the reaction of and later also flow in what doe the substanc of those reproach lie it li in the fact that an histor charact like alexand i stand on the highest possibl pinnacl of human power with the blind light of histori focus upon him a charact expos to those strongest of all influenc the intrigu flatteri and selfdecept insepar from power a charact who at everi moment of hi life felt a respons for all that wa happen in europ and not a fictiti but a live charact who like everi man had hi person habit passion and impuls toward good beauti and truth that thi charact though not lack in virtu the historian do not accus him of that had not the same concept of the welfar of human fifti year ago as a presentdai professor who from hi youth upward ha been occupi with learn that is with book and lectur and with take note from them but even if we assum that fifti year ago alexand i wa mistaken in hi view of what wa good for the peopl we must inevit assum that the historian who judg alexand will also after the laps of some time turn out to be mistaken in hi view of what is good for human thi assumpt is all the more natur and inevit becaus watch the movement of histori we see that everi year and with each new writer opinion as to what is good for mankind chang so that what onc seem good ten year later seem bad and vice versa and what is more we find at on and the same time quit contradictori view as to what is bad and what is good in histori some peopl regard give a constitut to poland and form the holi allianc as praiseworthi in alexand while other regard it as blameworthi the activ of alexand or of napoleon cannot be call us or harm for it is imposs to sai for what it wa us or harm if that activ displeas somebodi thi is onli becaus it doe not agre with hi limit understand of what is good whether the preserv of my father s hous in moscow or the glori of the russian arm or the prosper of the petersburg and other univers or the freedom of poland or the great of russia or the balanc of power in europ or a certain kind of european cultur call progress appear to me to be good or bad i must admit that besid these thing the action of everi histor charact ha other more gener purpos inaccess to me but let us assum that what is call scienc can harmon all contradict and possess an unchang standard of good and bad by which to try histor charact and event let us sai that alexand could have done everyth differ let us sai that with guidanc from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultim aim of the movement of human he might have arrang matter accord to the program hi present accus would have given him of nation freedom equal and progress these i think cover the ground let us assum that thi program wa possibl and had then been formul and that alexand had act on it what would then have becom of the activ of all those who oppos the tendenc that then prevail in the govern an activ that in the opinion of the historian wa good and benefic their activ would not have exist there would have been no life there would have been noth if we admit that human life can be rule by reason the possibl of life is destroi chapter ii if we assum as the historian do that great men lead human to the attain of certain end the great of russia or of franc the balanc of power in europ the diffus of the idea of the revolut gener progress or anyth els then it is imposs to explain the fact of histori without introduc the concept of chanc and geniu if the aim of the european war at the begin of the nineteenth centuri had been the aggrandiz of russia that aim might have been accomplish without all the preced war and without the invas if the aim wa the aggrandiz of franc that might have been attain without the revolut and without the empir if the aim wa the dissemin of idea the print press could have accomplish that much better than warfar if the aim wa the progress of civil it is easi to see that there ar other wai of diffus civil more expedi than by the destruct of wealth and of human live why did it happen in thi and not in some other wai becaus it happen so chanc creat the situat geniu util it sai histori but what is chanc what is geniu the word chanc and geniu do not denot ani realli exist thing and therefor cannot be defin those word onli denot a certain stage of understand of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occur i think that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk about chanc i see a forc produc effect beyond the scope of ordinari human agenc i do not understand why thi occur and i talk of geniu to a herd of ram the ram the herdsman drive each even into a special enclosur to feed and that becom twice as fat as the other must seem to be a geniu and it must appear an astonish conjunct of geniu with a whole seri of extraordinari chanc that thi ram who instead of get into the gener fold everi even goe into a special enclosur where there ar oat that thi veri ram swell with fat is kill for meat but the ram need onli ceas to suppos that all that happen to them happen sole for the attain of their sheepish aim thei need onli admit that what happen to them mai also have purpos beyond their ken and thei will at onc perceiv a uniti and coher in what happen to the ram that wa fatten even if thei do not know for what purpos thei ar fatten thei will at least know that all that happen to the ram did not happen accident and will no longer need the concept of chanc or geniu onli by renounc our claim to discern a purpos immedi intellig to us and admit the ultim purpos to be beyond our ken mai we discern the sequenc of experi in the live of histor charact and perceiv the caus of the effect thei produc incommensur with ordinari human capabl and then the word chanc and geniu becom superflu we need onli confess that we do not know the purpos of the european convuls and that we know onli the fact that is the murder first in franc then in itali in africa in prussia in austria in spain and in russia and that the movement from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essenc and purpos of these event and not onli shall we have no need to see except abil and geniu in napoleon and alexand but we shall be unabl to consid them to be anyth but like other men and we shall not be oblig to have recours to chanc for an explan of those small event which made these peopl what thei were but it will be clear that all those small event were inevit by discard a claim to knowledg of the ultim purpos we shall clearli perceiv that just as on cannot imagin a blossom or seed for ani singl plant better suit to it than those it produc so it is imposs to imagin ani two peopl more complet adapt down to the smallest detail for the purpos thei had to fulfil than napoleon and alexand with all their anteced chapter iii the fundament and essenti signific of the european event of the begin of the nineteenth centuri li in the movement of the mass of the european peopl from west to east and afterward from east to west the commenc of that movement wa the movement from west to east for the peopl

nat sha of former dai her featur were more defin and had a calm soft and seren express in her face there wa none of the everglow anim that had formerli burn there and constitut it charm now her face and bodi were often all that on saw and her soul wa not visibl at all all that struck the ey wa a strong handsom and fertil woman the old fire veri rare kindl in her face now that happen onli when as wa the case that dai her husband return home or a sick child wa convalesc or when she and countess mari spoke of princ andrew she never mention him to her husband who she imagin wa jealou of princ andrew s memori or on the rare occas when someth happen to induc her to sing a practic she had quit abandon sinc her marriag at the rare moment when the old fire did kindl in her handsom fulli develop bodi she wa even more attract than in former dai sinc their marriag nat sha and her husband had live in moscow in petersburg on their estat near moscow or with her mother that is to sai in nichola hous the young countess bez khova wa not often seen in societi and those who met her there were not pleas with her and found her neither attract nor amiabl not that nat sha like solitud she did not

which could be satisfi onli by renounc societi all who had known nat sha befor her marriag wonder at the chang in her as at someth extraordinari onli the old countess with her matern instinct had realiz that all nat sha s outburst had been due to her need of children and a husband as she herself had onc exclaim at otr dnoe not so much in fun as in earnest and her mother wa now surpris at the surpris express by those who had never understood nat sha and she kept sai that she had alwai known that nat sha would make an exemplari wife and mother onli she let her love of her husband and children overflow all bound said the countess so that it even becom absurd nat sha did not follow the golden rule advoc by clever folk especi by the french which sai that a girl should not let herself go when she marri should not neglect her accomplish should be even more care of her appear than when she wa unmarri and should fascin her husband as much as she did befor he becam her husband nat sha on the contrari had at onc abandon all her witcheri of which her sing had been an unusu power part she gave it up just becaus it wa so powerfulli seduct she took no pain with her manner or with delicaci of speech or with her toilet or to show herself to her husband in her most becom attitud or to avoid inconvenienc him by be too exact she act in contradict to all those rule she felt that the allur instinct had formerli taught her to us would now be mere ridicul in the ey of her husband to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entir that is with her whole soul leav no corner of it hidden from him she felt that her uniti with her husband wa not maintain by the poetic feel that had attract him to her but by someth els indefinit but firm as the bond between her own bodi and soul to fluff out her curl put on fashion dress and sing romant song to fascin her husband would have seem as strang as to adorn herself to attract herself to adorn herself for other might perhap have been agreeabl she did not know but she had no time at all for it the chief reason for devot no time either to sing to dress or to choos her word wa that she realli had no time to spare for these thing we know that man ha the faculti of becom complet absorb in a subject howev trivial it mai be and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinit proport if on s entir attent is devot to it the subject which wholli engross nat sha s attent wa her famili that is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entir to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bear bring into the world nurs and bring up and the deeper she penetr not with her mind onli but with her whole soul her whole be into the subject that absorb her the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequ did her power appear so that she concentr them wholli on that on thing and yet wa unabl to accomplish all that she consid necessari there were then as now convers and

the notion that hi father had love nat sha and when dy had left her to hi friend but the father whom the boi did not rememb appear to him a divin who could not be pictur and of whom he never thought without a swell heart and tear of sad and raptur so the boi also wa happi that pierr had arriv the guest welcom pierr becaus he alwai help to enliven and unit ani compani he wa in the grownup member of the famili not to mention hi wife were pleas to have back a friend whose presenc made life run more smoothli and peacefulli the old ladi were pleas with the present he brought them and especi that nat sha would now be herself again pierr felt the differ outlook of these variou world and made hast to satisfi all their expect though the most absentmind and forget of men pierr with the aid of a list hi wife drew up had now bought everyth not forget hi mother and brotherinlaw s commiss nor the dress materi for a present to bel va nor toi for hi wife s nephew in the earli dai of hi marriag it had seem strang to him that hi wife should expect him not to forget to procur all the thing he undertook to bui and he had been taken aback by her seriou annoy when on hi first trip he forgot everyth but in time he grew us to thi demand know that nat sha ask noth for herself and gave him commiss for other onli when he himself had offer to undertak them he now found an unexpect and childlik pleasur in thi purchas of present for everyon in the hous and never forgot anyth if he now incur nat sha s censur it wa onli for bui too mani and too expens thing to her other defect as most peopl thought them but which to pierr were qualiti of untidi and neglect of herself she now ad stingi from the time that pierr began life as a famili man on a foot entail heavi expenditur he had notic to hi surpris that he spent onli half as much as befor and that hi affair which had been in disord of late chiefli becaus of hi first wife s debt had begun to improv life wa cheaper becaus it wa circumscrib that most expens luxuri the kind of life that can be chang at ani moment wa no longer hi nor did he wish for it he felt that hi wai of life had now been settl onc for all till death and that to chang it wa not in hi power and so that wai of life prove econom with a merri smile face pierr wa sort hi purchas what do you think of thi said he unrol a piec of stuff like a shopman nat sha who wa sit opposit to him with her eldest daughter on her lap turn her sparkl ey swiftli from her husband to the thing he show her that s for bel va excel she felt the qualiti of the materi it wa a rubl an arshin i suppos pierr told her the price too dear nat sha remark how pleas the children will be and mamma too onli you need not have bought me thi she ad unabl to suppress a smile as she gaze admiringli at a

and left without aim or object for her exist she at drank slept or kept awak but did not live life gave her no new impress she want noth from life but tranquil and that tranquil onli death could give her but until death came she had to go on live that is to us her vital forc a peculiar on see in veri young children and veri old peopl wa particularli evid in her her life had no extern aim onli a need to exercis her variou function and inclin wa appar she had to eat sleep think speak weep work give vent to her anger and so on mere becaus she had a stomach a brain muscl nerv and a liver she did these thing not under ani extern impuls as peopl in the full vigor of life do when behind the purpos for which thei strive that of exercis their function remain unnot she talk onli becaus she physic need to exercis her tongu and lung she cri as a child doe becaus her nose had to be clear and so on what for peopl in their full vigor is an aim wa for her evid mere a pretext thu in the morn especi if she had eaten anyth rich the dai befor she felt a need of be angri and would choos as the handiest pretext bel va s deaf she would begin to sai someth to her in a low tone from the other end of the room it seem a littl warmer todai my dear she would murmur and when bel va repli oh ye thei ve come she would mutter angrili o lord how stupid and deaf she is anoth pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too damp or not rub fine enough after these fit of irrit her face would grow yellow and her maid knew by infal symptom when bel va would again be deaf the snuff damp and the

all thi nonsens out of them fanci give the command of the sem nov wegiment to a fellow like that schwa tz he cri nichola though free from den sov s readi to find fault with everyth also thought that discuss of the govern wa a veri seriou and weighti matter and the fact that a had been appoint minist of thi and b governor gener of that and that the emperor had said soandso and thi minist soandso seem to him veri import and so he thought it necessari to take an interest in these thing and to question pierr the question put by these two kept the convers from chang it ordinari charact of gossip about the higher govern circl but nat sha know all her husband s wai and idea saw that he had long been wish but had been unabl to divert the convers to anoth channel and express hi own deepli felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to petersburg to consult with hi new friend princ theodor and she help him by ask how hi affair with princ theodor had gone what wa it about ask nichola alwai the same thing said pierr look round at hi listen everybodi see that thing ar go so badli that thei cannot be allow to go on so and that it is the duti of all decent men to counteract it as far as

her and went to the nurseri countess mari follow her the men went into the studi and littl nichola bolk nski follow them unnot by hi uncl and sat down at the write tabl in a shadi corner by the window well what would you do ask den sov alwai some fantast scheme said nichola why thi began pierr not sit down but pace the room sometim stop short gesticul and lisp the posit in petersburg is thi the emperor doe not look into anyth he ha abandon himself altogeth to thi mystic pierr could not toler mystic in anyon now he seek onli for peac and onli these peopl san foi ni loi can give it him peopl who recklessli hack at and strangl everyth magn tski arakch ev and tutti quanti you will agre that if you did not look after your estat yourself but onli want a quiet life the harsher your steward wa the more readili your object might be attain he said to nichola without faith or law well what doe that lead up to said nichola well everyth is go to ruin robberi in the law court in the armi noth but flog drill and militari settlement the peopl ar tortur enlighten is suppress all that is young and honest is crush everyon see that thi cannot go on everyth is strain to such a degre that it will certainli break said pierr as those who examin the action of ani govern have alwai said sinc govern began i told them just on thing in petersburg told whom well you know whom said pierr with a mean glanc from under hi brow princ theodor and all those to encourag cultur and philanthropi is all veri well of cours the aim is excel but in the present circumst someth els is need at that moment nichola notic the presenc of hi nephew hi face darken and he went up to the boi why ar you here why let him be said pierr take nichola by the arm and continu that is not enough i told them someth els is need when you stand expect the overstrain string to snap at ani moment when everyon is expect the inevit catastroph as mani as possibl must join hand as close as thei can to withstand the gener calam everyth that is young and strong is be entic awai and deprav on is lure by women anoth by honor a third by ambit or monei and thei go over to that camp no independ men such as you or i ar left what i sai is widen the scope of our societi let the mot d ordr be not virtu alon but independ and action as well nichola who had left hi nephew irrit push up an armchair sat down in it and listen to pierr cough discontentedli and frown more and more but action with what aim he cri and what posit will you adopt toward the govern why the posit of assist the societi need not be secret if the govern allow it not mere is it not hostil to govern but it is a societi of true conserv a societi of gentlemen in the full mean of that word it is onli to prevent some pugach v or other from kill my children and your and arakch ev from send me off to some militari settlement we join hand onli for the public welfar and the gener safeti ye but it s a secret societi and therefor a hostil and harm on which can onli caus harm why did the tugendbund which save europ thei did not then ventur to suggest that russia had save europ do ani harm the tugendbund is an allianc of virtu it is love mutual help it is what christ preach on the cross nat sha who had come in dure the convers look joyfulli at her husband it wa not what he wa sai that pleas her that did not even interest her for it seem to her that wa all extrem simpl and that she had known it a long time it seem so to her becaus she knew that it sprang from pierr s whole soul but it wa hi anim and enthusiast appear that made her glad the boi with the thin neck stretch out from the turndown collar whom everyon had forgotten gaze at pierr with even greater and more raptur joi everi word of pierr s burn into hi heart and with a nervou movement of hi finger he unconsci broke the seal wax and quill pen hi hand came upon on hi uncl s tabl it is not at all what you suppos but that is what the german tugendbund wa and what i am propos no my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewi well for the sausag eater but i don t understand it and can t even pwonounc it interpos den sov in a loud and resolut voic i agwe that evewyth here is wotten and howwibl but the tugendbund i don t understand if we re not satisfi let us have a bunt of our own that s all wight je sui vot e homm i m your man pierr smile nat sha began to laugh but nichola knit hi brow still more and began prove to pierr that there wa no prospect of ani great chang and that all the danger he spoke of exist onli in hi imagin pierr maintain the contrari and as hi mental faculti were greater and more resourc nichola felt himself corner thi made him still angrier for he wa fulli convinc not by reason but by someth within him stronger than reason of the justic of hi opinion i will tell you thi he said rise and try with nervous twitch finger to prop up hi pipe in a corner but final abandon the attempt i can t prove it to you you sai that everyth here is rotten and that an overthrow is come i don t see it but you also sai that our oath of allegi is a condit matter and to that i repli you ar my best friend as you know but if you form a secret societi and began work against the govern be it what it mai i know it is my duti to obei the govern and if arakch ev order me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down i should not hesit an instant but should do it and you mai argu about that as you like an awkward silenc follow these word nat sha wa the first to speak defend her husband and attack her brother her defens wa weak and inapt but she attain her object the convers wa resum and no longer in the unpleasantli hostil tone of nichola last remark when thei all got up to go in to supper littl nichola bolk nski went up to pierr pale and with shine radiant ey uncl pierr you no if papa were aliv would he agre with you he ask and pierr suddenli realiz what a special independ complex and power process of thought and feel must have been go on in thi boi dure that convers and rememb all he had said he regret that the lad should have heard him he had howev to give him an answer ye i think so he said reluctantli and left the studi the lad look down and seem now for the first time to notic what he had done to the thing on the tabl he flush and went up to nichola uncl forgiv me i did that unintention he said point to the broken seal wax and pen nichola start angrili all right all right he said throw the bit under the tabl and evid suppress hi vexat with difficulti he turn awai from the boi you ought not to have been here at all he said chapter xv the convers at supper wa not about polit or societi but turn on the subject nichola like best recollect of den sov start these and pierr wa particularli agreeabl and amus about them the famili separ on the most friendli term after supper nichola have undress in hi studi and given instruct to the steward who had been wait for him went to the bedroom in hi dress gown where he found hi wife still at her tabl write what ar you write mari nichola ask countess mari blush she wa afraid that what she wa write would not be understood or approv by her husband she had want to conceal what she wa write from him but at the same time wa glad he had surpris her at it and that she would now have to tell him a diari nichola she repli hand him a blue exercis book fill with her firm bold write a diari nichola repeat with a shade of ironi and he took up the book it wa in french decemb todai when andr sha her eldest boi woke up he did not wish to dress and mademoisel louis sent for me he wa naughti and obstin i tri threat but he onli grew angrier then i took the matter in hand i left him alon and began with nurs s help to get the other children up tell him that i did not love him for a long time he wa silent as if astonish then he jump out of bed ran to me in hi shirt and sob so that i could not calm him for a long time it wa plain that what troubl him most wa that he had griev me afterward in the even when i gave him hi ticket he again began cry piteous and kiss me on can do anyth with him by tender what is a ticket nichola inquir i have begun give the elder on mark everi even show how

mother as show their charact or suggest gener reflect on educ method thei were for the most part quit insignific trifl but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either now that he read thi diari about hi children for the first time under the date wa enter m tya wa naughti at tabl papa said he wa to have no pud he had none but look so unhappili and greedili at the other while thei were eat i think that punish by depriv children of sweet onli develop their greedi must tell nichola thi nichola put down the book and look at hi wife the radiant ey gaze at him questioningli would he approv or disapprov of her diari there could be no doubt not onli of hi approv but also of hi admir for hi wife perhap it need not be done so pedant thought nichola or even done at all but thi untir continu spiritu effort of which the sole aim wa the children s moral welfar delight him had nichola been abl to analyz hi feel he would have found that hi steadi tender and proud love of hi wife rest on hi feel of wonder at her spiritu and at the lofti moral world almost beyond hi reach in which she had her be he wa proud of her intellig and good recogn hi own insignific besid her in the spiritu world and rejoic all the more that she with such a soul not onli belong to him but wa part of himself i quit quit approv my dearest said he with a signific look and after a short paus he ad and i

me that it is everi honest man s duti to go against the govern and that the oath of allegi and duti i am sorri you weren t there thei all fell on me den sov and nat sha nat sha is absurd how she rule over him and yet there need onli be a discuss and she ha no word of her own but onli repeat hi sai ad nichola yield to that irresist inclin which tempt us to judg those nearest and dearest to us he forgot that what he wa sai about nat sha could have been appli word for word to himself in relat to hi wife ye i have notic that said countess mari when i told him that duti and the oath were abov everyth he start prove good know what a piti you were not there what would you have said as i see it you were quit right and i told nat sha so pierr sai everybodi is suffer tortur and be corrupt and that it is our duti to help our neighbor of cours he is right there said countess mari but he forget that we have other duti nearer to us duti indic to us by god himself and that though we might expos ourselv to risk we must not risk our children ye that s it that s just what i said to him put in nichola who fanci he realli had said it but thei insist on their own view love of on s neighbor and

epilogu chapter i histori is the life of nation and of human to seiz and put into word to describ directli the life of human or even of a singl nation appear imposs the ancient historian all emploi on and the same method to describ and seiz the appar elus the life of a peopl thei describ the activ of individu who rule the peopl and regard the activ of those men as repres the activ of the whole nation the question how did individu make nation act as thei wish and by what wa the will of these individu themselv guid the ancient met by recogn a divin which subject the nation to the will of a chosen man and guid the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish end that were predestin for the ancient these question were solv by a belief in the direct particip of the deiti in human affair modern histori in theori reject both these principl it would seem that have reject the belief of the ancient in man s subject to the deiti and in a predetermin aim toward which nation ar led modern histori should studi not the manifest of power but the caus that produc it but modern histori ha not done thi have in theori reject the view held by the ancient it still follow them in practic instead of men endow with divin author and directli guid by the will of god modern histori ha given us either hero endow with extraordinari superhuman capac or simpli men of veri variou kind from monarch to journalist who lead the mass instead of the former divin appoint aim of the jewish greek or roman nation which ancient historian regard as repres the progress of human modern histori ha postul it own aim the welfar of the french german or english peopl or in it highest abstract the welfar and civil of human in gener by which is usual meant that of the peopl occupi a small northwesterli portion of a larg contin modern histori ha reject the belief of the ancient without replac them by a new concept and the logic of the situat ha oblig the historian after thei had appar reject the divin author of the king and the fate of the ancient to reach the same conclus by anoth road that is to recogn nation guid by individu men and the exist of a known aim to which these nation and human at larg ar tend at the basi of the work of all the modern historian from gibbon to buckl despit their seem disagr and the appar novelti of their outlook lie those two old unavoid assumpt in the first place the historian describ the activ of individu who in hi opinion have direct human on historian consid onli monarch gener and minist as be such men while anoth includ also orat learn men reform philosoph and poet secondli it is assum that the goal toward which human is be led is known to the historian to on of them thi goal is the great of the roman spanish or french realm to anoth it is liberti equal and a certain kind of civil of a small corner of the world call europ in a ferment aris in pari it grow spread and is express by a movement of peopl from west to east sever time it move eastward and collid with a countermov from the east westward in it reach it extrem limit moscow and then with remark symmetri a countermov occur from east to west attract to it as the first movement had done the nation of middl europ the counter movement reach the start point of the first movement in the west pari and subsid dure that twentyyear period an immens number of field were left until hous were burn trade chang it direct million of men migrat were impoverish or were enrich and million of christian men profess the law of love of their fellow slew on anoth what doe all thi mean why did it happen what made those peopl burn hous and slai their fellow men what were the caus of these event what forc made men act so these ar the instinct plain and most legitim question human ask itself when it encount the monument and tradit of that period for a repli to these question the common sens of mankind turn to the scienc of histori whose aim is to enabl nation and human to know themselv if histori had retain the concept of the ancient it would have said that god to reward or punish hi peopl gave napoleon power and direct hi will to the fulfil of the divin end and that repli would have been clear and complet on might believ or disbeliev in the divin signific of napoleon but for anyon believ in it there would have been noth unintellig in the histori of that period nor would there have been ani contradict but modern histori cannot give that repli scienc doe not admit the concept of the ancient as to the direct particip of the deiti in human affair and therefor histori ought to give other answer modern histori repli to these question sai you want to know what thi movement mean what caus it and what forc produc these event then listen loui xiv wa a veri proud and selfconfid man he had such and such mistress and such and such minist and he rule franc badli hi descend were weak men and thei too rule franc badli and thei had such and such favorit and such and such mistress moreov certain men wrote some book at that time at the end of the eighteenth centuri there were a coupl of dozen men in pari who began to talk about all men be free and equal thi caus peopl all over franc to begin to slash at and drown on anoth thei kill the king and mani other peopl at that time there wa in franc a man of geniu napoleon he conquer everybodi everywher that is he kill mani peopl becaus he wa a great geniu and for some reason he went to kill african and kill them so well and wa so cun and wise that when he return to franc he order everybodi to obei him and thei all obei him have becom an emperor he again went out to kill peopl in itali austria and prussia and there too he kill a great mani in russia there wa an emperor alexand who decid to restor order in europ and therefor fought against napoleon in he suddenli made friend with him but in thei again quarrel and again began kill mani peopl napoleon led six hundr thousand men into russia and captur moscow then he suddenli ran awai from moscow and the emperor alexand help by the advic of stein and other unit europ to arm against the disturb of it peac all napoleon s alli suddenli becam hi enemi and their forc advanc against the fresh forc he rais the alli defeat napoleon enter pari forc napoleon to abdic and sent him to the island of elba not depriv him of the titl of emperor and show him everi respect though five year befor and on year later thei all regard him as an outlaw and a brigand then loui xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of the french and the alli began to reign and napoleon shed tear befor hi old guard renounc the throne and went into exil then the skill statesmen and diplomatist especi talleyrand who manag to sit down in a particular chair befor anyon els and therebi extend the frontier of franc talk in vienna and by these convers made the nation happi or unhappi suddenli the diplomatist and monarch nearli quarrel and were on the point of again order their armi to kill on anoth but just then napoleon arriv in franc with a battalion and the french who had been hate him immedi all submit to him but the alli monarch were angri at thi and went to fight the french onc more and thei defeat the geniu napoleon and suddenli recogn him as a brigand sent him to the island of st helena and the exil separ from the belov franc so dear to hi heart di a linger death on that rock and bequeath hi great deed to poster but in europ a reaction occur and the sovereign onc again all began to oppress their subject it would be a mistak to think that thi is iron a caricatur of the histor account on the contrari it is a veri mild express of the contradictori repli not meet the question which all the historian give from the compil of memoir and the histori of separ state to the writer of gener histori and the new histori of the cultur of that period the strang and absurd of these repli aris from the fact that modern histori like a deaf man answer question no on ha ask if the purpos of histori be to give a descript of the movement of human and of the peopl the first question in the absenc of a repli to which all the rest will be incomprehens is what is the power that move peopl to thi modern histori labori repli either that napoleon wa a great geniu or that loui xiv wa veri proud or that certain writer wrote certain book all that mai be so and mankind is readi to agre with it but it is not what wa ask all that would be interest if we recogn a divin power base on itself and alwai consist direct it nation through napoleon louis and writer but we do not acknowledg such a power and therefor befor speak about napoleon louis and author we ought to be shown the connect exist between these men and the movement of the nation if instead of a divin power some other forc ha appear it should be explain in what thi new forc consist for the whole interest of histori li precis in that forc histori seem to assum that thi forc is selfevid and known to everyon but in spite of everi desir to regard it as known anyon read mani histor work cannot help doubt whether thi new forc so various understood by the historian themselv is realli quit well known to everybodi chapter ii what forc move the nation biograph historian and historian of separ nation understand thi forc as a power inher in hero and ruler in their narrat event occur sole by the will of a napoleon and alexand or in gener of the person thei describ the answer given by thi kind of historian to the question of what forc caus event to happen ar satisfactori onli as long as there is but on historian to each event as soon as historian of differ nation and tendenc begin to describ the same event the repli thei give immedi lose all mean for thi forc is understood by them all not onli differ but often in quit contradictori wai on historian sai that an event wa produc by napoleon s power anoth that it wa produc by alexand s a third that it wa due to the power of some other person besid thi historian of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the forc on which the author of some particular person wa base thier a bonapartist sai that napoleon s power wa base on hi virtu and geniu lanfrei a republican sai it wa base on hi trickeri and decept of the peopl so the historian of thi class by mutual destroi on anoth s posit destroi the understand of the forc which produc event and furnish no repli to histori s essenti question writer of univers histori who deal with all the nation seem to recogn how erron is the specialist historian view of the forc which produc event thei do not recogn it as a power inher in hero and ruler but as the result of a multipl of various direct forc in describ a war or the subjug of a peopl a gener historian look for the caus of the event not in the power of on man but in the interact of mani person connect with the event accord to thi view the power of histor personag repres as the product of mani forc can no longer it would seem be regard as a forc that itself produc event yet in most case univers historian still emploi the concept of power as a forc that itself produc event and treat it as their caus in their exposit an histor charact is first the product of hi time and hi power onli the result of variou forc and then hi power is itself a forc produc event gervinu schlosser and other for instanc at on time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolut of the idea of and so forth and at anoth plainli sai that the campaign of and other thing thei do not like were simpli the product of napoleon s misdirect will and that the veri idea of were arrest in their develop by napoleon s capric the idea of the revolut and the gener temper of the ag produc napoleon s power but napoleon s power suppress the idea of the revolut and the gener temper of the ag thi curiou contradict is not accident not onli doe it occur at everi step but the univers historian account ar all made up of a chain of such contradict thi contradict occur becaus after enter the field of analysi the univers historian stop halfwai to find compon forc equal to the composit or result forc the sum of the compon must equal the result thi condit is never observ by the univers historian and so to explain the result forc thei ar oblig to admit in addit to the insuffici compon anoth unexplain forc affect the result action specialist historian describ the campaign of or the restor of the bourbon plainli assert that these event were produc by the will of alexand but the univers historian gervinu refut thi opinion of the specialist historian tri to prove that the campaign of and the restor of the bourbon were due to other thing besid alexand s will such as the activ of stein metternich madam de sta l talleyrand ficht chateaubriand and other the historian evid decompos alexand s power into the compon talleyrand chateaubriand and the rest but the sum of the compon that is the interact of chateaubriand talleyrand madam de sta l and the other evid doe not equal the result name the phenomenon of million of frenchmen submit to the bourbon that chateaubriand madam de sta l and other spoke certain word to on anoth onli affect their mutual relat but doe not account for the submiss of million and therefor to explain how from these relat of their the submiss of million of peopl result that is how compon forc equal to on a gave a result equal to a thousand time a the historian is again oblig to fall back on power the forc he had deni and to recogn it as the result of the forc that is he ha to admit an unexplain forc act on the result and that is just what the univers historian do and consequ thei not onli contradict the specialist historian but contradict themselv peasant have no clear idea of the caus of rain sai accord to whether thei want rain or fine weather the wind ha blown the cloud awai or the wind ha brought up the cloud and in the same wai the univers historian sometim when it pleas them and fit in with their theori sai that power is the result of event and sometim when thei want to prove someth els sai that power produc event a third class of historian the socal historian of cultur follow the path laid down by the univers historian who sometim accept writer and ladi as forc produc event again take that forc to be someth quit differ thei see it in what is call cultur in mental activ the historian of cultur ar quit consist in regard to their progenitor the writer of univers histori for if histor event mai be explain by the fact that certain person treat on anoth in such and such wai why not explain them by the fact that such and such peopl wrote such and such book of the immens number of indic accompani everi vital phenomenon these historian select the indic of intellectu activ and sai that thi indic is the caus but despit their endeavor to prove that the caus of event li in intellectu activ onli by a great stretch can on admit that there is ani connect between intellectu activ and the movement of peopl and in no case can on admit that intellectu activ control peopl s action for that view is not confirm by such fact as the veri cruel murder of the french revolut result from the doctrin of the equal of man or the veri cruel war and execut result from the preach of love but even admit as correct all the cunningli devis argument with which these histori ar fill admit that nation ar govern by some undefin forc call an idea histori s essenti question still remain unansw and to the former power of monarch and to the influenc of advis and other peopl introduc by the univers historian anoth newer forc the idea is ad the connect of which with the mass need explan it is possibl to understand that napoleon had power and so event occur with some effort on mai even conceiv that napoleon togeth with other influenc wa the caus of an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of make frenchmen begin to drown on anoth cannot be understood without an explan of the causal nexu of thi new forc with the event undoubtedli some relat exist between all who live contemporan and so it is possibl to find some connect between the intellectu activ of men and their histor movement just as such a connect mai be found between the movement of human and commerc handicraft garden or anyth els you pleas but why intellectu activ is consid by the historian of cultur to be the caus or express of the whole histor movement is hard to understand onli the follow consider can have led the historian to such a conclus that histori is written by learn men and so it is natur and agreeabl for them to think that the activ of their class suppli the basi of the movement of all human just as a similar belief is natur and agreeabl to trader agriculturist and soldier if thei do not express it that is mere becaus trader and soldier do not write histori and that spiritu activ enlighten civil cultur idea ar all indistinct indefinit concept under whose banner it is veri easi to us word have a still less definit mean and which can therefor be readili introduc into ani theori but not to speak of the intrins qualiti of histori of thi kind which mai possibl even be of us to someon for someth the histori of cultur to which all gener histori tend more and more to approxim ar signific from the fact that after serious and minut examin variou religi philosoph and polit doctrin as caus of event as soon as thei have to describ an actual histor event such as the campaign of for instanc thei involuntarili describ it as result from an exercis of power and sai plainli that that wa the result of napoleon s will speak so the historian of cultur involuntarili contradict themselv and show that the new forc thei have devis doe not account for what happen in histori and that histori can onli be explain by introduc a power which thei appar do not recogn chapter iii a locomot is move someon ask what move it a peasant sai the devil move it anoth man sai the locomot move becaus it wheel go round a third assert that the caus of it movement li in the smoke which the wind carri awai the peasant is irrefut he ha devis a complet explan to refut him someon would have to prove to him that there is no devil or anoth peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german who move the locomot onli then as a result of the contradict will thei see that thei ar both wrong but the man who sai that the movement of the wheel is the caus refut himself for have onc begun to analyz he ought to go on and explain further why the wheel go round and till he ha reach the ultim caus of the movement of the locomot in the pressur of steam in the boiler he ha no right to stop in hi search for the caus the man who explain the movement of the locomot by the smoke that is carri back ha notic that the wheel do not suppli an explan and ha taken the first sign that occur to him and in hi turn ha offer that as an explan the onli concept that can explain the movement of the locomot is that of a forc commensur with the movement observ the onli concept that can explain the movement of the peopl is that of some forc commensur with the whole movement of the peopl yet to suppli thi concept variou historian take forc of differ kind all of which ar incommensur with the movement observ some see it as a forc directli inher in hero as the peasant see the devil in the locomot other as a forc result from sever other forc like the movement of the wheel other again as an intellectu influenc like the smoke that is blown awai so long as histori ar written of separ individu whether caesar alexand luther or voltair and not the histori of all absolut all those who take part in an event it is quit imposs to describ the movement of human without the concept of a forc compel men to direct their activ toward a certain end and the onli such concept known to historian is that of power thi concept is the on handl by mean of which the materi of histori as at present expound can be dealt with and anyon who break that handl off as buckl did without find some other method of treat histor materi mere depriv himself of the on possibl wai of deal with it the necess of the concept of power as an explan of histor event is best demonstr by the univers historian and historian of cultur themselv for thei professedli reject that concept but inevit have recours to it at everi step in deal with human s inquiri the scienc of histori up to now is like monei in circul paper monei and coin the biographi and special nation histori ar like paper monei thei can be us and can circul and fulfil their purpos without harm to anyon and even advantag as long as no on ask what is the secur behind them you need onli forget to ask how the will of hero produc event and such histori as thier will be interest and instruct and mai perhap even possess a ting of poetri but just as doubt of the real valu of paper monei aris either becaus be easi to make too much of it get made or becaus peopl try to exchang it for gold so also doubt concern the real valu of such histori aris either becaus too mani of them ar written or becaus in hi simplic of heart someon inquir by what forc did napoleon do thi that is want to exchang the current paper monei for the real gold of actual comprehens the writer of univers histori and of the histori of cultur ar like peopl who recogn the defect of paper monei decid to substitut for it monei made of metal that ha not the specif graviti of gold it mai inde make jingl coin but will do no more than that paper monei mai deceiv the ignor but nobodi is deceiv by token of base metal that have no valu but mere jingl as gold is gold onli if it is servic not mere for exchang but also for us so univers historian will be valuabl onli when thei can repli to histori s essenti question what is power the univers historian give contradictori repli to that question while the historian of cultur evad it and answer someth quit differ and as counter of imit gold can be us onli among a group of peopl who agre to accept them as gold or among those who do not know the natur of gold so univers historian and historian of cultur not answer human s essenti question serv as currenc for some purpos of their own onli in univers and among the mass of reader who have a tast for what thei call seriou read chapter iv have abandon the concept of the ancient as to the divin subject of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subject of that man s will to the deiti histori cannot without contradict take a singl step till it ha chosen on of two thing either a return to the former belief in the direct intervent of the deiti in human affair or a definit explan of the mean of the forc produc histor event and term power a return to the first is imposs the belief ha been destroi and so it is essenti to explain what is meant by power napoleon order an armi to be rais and go to war we ar so accustom to that idea and have becom so us to it that the question why did six hundr thousand men go to fight when napoleon utter certain word seem to us senseless he had the power and so what he order wa done thi repli is quit satisfactori if we believ that the power wa given him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becom essenti to determin what is thi power of on man over other it cannot be the direct physic power of a strong man over a weak on a domin base on the applic or threat of physic forc like the power of hercul nor can it be base on the effect of moral forc as in their simplic some historian think who sai that the lead figur in histori ar hero that is men gift with a special strength of soul and mind call geniu thi power cannot be base on the predomin of moral strength for not to mention hero such as napoleon about whose moral qualiti opinion differ wide histori show us that neither a loui xi nor a metternich who rule over million of peopl had ani particular moral qualiti but on the contrari were gener moral weaker than ani of the million thei rule over if the sourc of power li neither in the physic nor in the moral qualiti of him who possess it it must evid be look for elsewher in the relat to the peopl of the man who wield the power and that is how power is understood by the scienc of jurisprud that exchang bank of histori which offer to exchang histori s understand of power for true gold power is the collect will of the peopl transfer by express or tacit consent to their chosen ruler in the domain of jurisprud which consist of discuss of how a state and power might be arrang were it possibl for all that to be arrang it is all veri clear but when appli to histori that definit of power need explan the scienc of jurisprud regard the state and power as the ancient regard fire name as someth exist absolut but for histori the state and power ar mere phenomena just as for modern physic fire is not an element but a phenomenon from thi fundament differ between the view held by histori and that held by jurisprud it follow that jurisprud can tell minut how in it opinion power should be constitut and what power exist immut outsid time is but to histori s question about the mean of the mutat of power in time it can answer noth if power be the collect will of the peopl transfer to their ruler wa pugach v a repres of the will of the peopl if not then why wa napoleon i why wa napoleon iii a crimin when he wa taken prison at boulogn and why later on were those crimin whom he arrest do palac revolut in which sometim onli two or three peopl take part transfer the will of the peopl to a new ruler in intern relat is the will of the peopl also transfer to their conqueror wa the will of the confeder of the rhine transfer to napoleon in wa the will of the russian peopl transfer to napoleon in when our armi in allianc with the french went to fight the austrian to these question three answer ar possibl either to assum that the will of the peopl is alwai uncondition transfer to the ruler or ruler thei have chosen and that therefor everi emerg of a new power everi struggl against the power onc appoint should be absolut regard as an infring of the real power or that the will of the peopl is transfer to the ruler condition under definit and known condit and to show that all limit conflict and even destruct of power result from a nonobserv by the ruler of the condit under which their power wa entrust to them or that the will of the peopl is deleg to the ruler condition but that the condit ar unknown and indefinit and that the appear of sever author their struggl and their fall result sole from the greater or lesser fulfil by the ruler of these unknown condit on which the will of the peopl is transfer from some peopl to other and these ar the three wai in which the historian do explain the relat of the peopl to their ruler some historian those biograph and specialist historian alreadi refer to in their simplic fail to understand the question of the mean of power seem to consid that the collect will of the peopl is uncondition transfer to histor person and therefor when describ some singl state thei assum that particular power to be the on absolut and real power and that ani other forc oppos thi is not a power but a violat of power mere violenc their theori suitabl for primit and peac period of histori ha the inconveni in applic to complex and stormi period in the life of nation dure which variou power aris simultan and struggl with on anoth that a legitimist historian will prove that the nation convent the directori and bonapart were mere infring of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will prove the on that the convent and the other that the empir wa the real power and that all the other were violat of power evid the explan furnish by these historian be mutual contradictori can onli satisfi young children recogn the falsiti of thi view of histori anoth set of historian sai that power rest on a condit deleg of the will of the peopl to their ruler and that histor leader have power onli condition on carri out the program that the will of the peopl ha by tacit agreement prescrib to them but what thi program consist in these historian do not sai or if thei do thei continu contradict on anoth each historian accord to hi view of what constitut a nation s progress look for these condit in the great wealth freedom or enlighten of citizen of franc or some other countri but not to mention the historian contradict as to the natur of thi program or even admit that some on gener program of these condit exist the fact of histori almost alwai contradict that theori if the condit under which power is entrust consist in the wealth freedom and enlighten of the peopl how is it that loui xiv and iv n the terribl end their reign tranquilli while loui xvi and charl i ar execut by their peopl to thi question historian repli that loui xiv s activ contrari to the program react on loui xvi but why did it not react on loui xiv or on loui xv why should it react just on loui xvi and what is the time limit for such reaction to these question there ar and can be no answer equal littl doe thi view explain why for sever centuri the collect will is not withdrawn from certain ruler and their heir and then suddenli dure a period of fifti year is transfer to the convent to the directori to napoleon to alexand to loui xviii to napoleon again to charl x to loui philipp to a republican govern and to napoleon iii when explain these rapid transfer of the peopl s will from on individu to anoth especi in view of intern relat conquest and allianc the historian ar oblig to admit that some of these transfer ar not normal deleg of the peopl s will but ar accid depend on cun on mistak on craft or on the weak of a diplomatist a ruler or a parti leader so that the greater part of the event of histori civil war revolut and conquest ar present by these historian not as the result of free transfer of the peopl s will but as result of the illdirect will of on or more individu that is onc again as usurp of power and so these historian also see and admit histor event which ar except to the theori these historian resembl a botanist who have notic that some plant grow from seed produc two cotyledon should insist that all that grow doe so by sprout into two leav and that the palm the mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer resembl two leav ar deviat from the theori historian of the third class assum that the will of the peopl is transfer to histor personag condition but that the condit ar unknown to us thei sai that histor personag have power onli becaus thei fulfil the will of the peopl which ha been deleg to them but in that case if the forc that move nation li not in the histor leader but in the nation themselv what signific have those leader the leader these historian tell us express the will of the peopl the activ of the leader repres the activ of the peopl but in that case the question aris whether all the activ of the leader serv as an express of the peopl s will or onli some part of it if the whole activ of the leader serv as the express of the peopl s will as some historian suppos then all the detail of the court scandal contain in the biographi of a napoleon or a catherin serv to express the life of the nation which is evid nonsens but if it is onli some particular side of the activ of an histor leader which serv to express the peopl s life as other socal philosoph historian believ then to determin which side of the activ of a leader express the nation s life we have first of all to know in what the nation s life consist met by thi difficulti historian of that class devis some most obscur impalp and gener abstract which can cover all conceiv occurr and declar thi abstract to be the aim of human s movement the most usual gener adopt by almost all the historian ar freedom equal enlighten progress civil and cultur postul some gener as the goal of the movement of human the historian studi the men of whom the greatest number of monument have remain king minist gener author reform pope and journalist to the extent to which in their opinion these person have promot or hinder that abstract but as it is in no wai prove that the aim of human doe consist in freedom equal enlighten or civil and as the connect of the peopl with the ruler and enlighten of human is onli base on the arbitrari assumpt that the collect will of the peopl is alwai transfer to the men whom we have notic it happen that the activ of the million who migrat burn hous abandon agricultur and destroi on anoth never is express in the account of the activ of some dozen peopl who did not burn hous practic agricultur or slai their fellow creatur histori prove thi at everi turn is the ferment of the peopl of the west at the end of the eighteenth centuri and their drive eastward explain by the activ of loui xiv xv and xvi their mistress and minist and by the live of napoleon rousseau diderot beaumarchai and other is the movement of the russian peopl eastward to kaz n and siberia express by detail of the morbid charact of iv n the terribl and by hi correspond with k rbski is the movement of the peopl at the time of the crusad explain by the life and activ of the godfrei and the louis and their ladi for us that movement of the peopl from west to east without leader with a crowd of vagrant and with peter the hermit remain incomprehens and yet more incomprehens is the cessat of that movement when a ration and sacr aim for the crusad the deliver of jerusalem had been clearli defin by histor leader pope king and knight incit the peopl to free the holi land but the peopl did not go for the unknown caus which had previous impel them to go no longer exist the histori of the godfrei and the minnesing can evid not cover the life of the peopl and the histori of the godfrei and the minnesing ha remain the histori of godfrei and minnesing but the histori of the life of the peopl and their impuls ha remain unknown still less doe the histori of author and reform explain to us the life of the peopl the histori of cultur explain to us the impuls and condit of life and thought of a writer or a reform we learn that luther had a hot temper and said such and such thing we learn that rousseau wa suspici and wrote such and such book but we do not learn why after the reform the peopl massacr on anoth nor why dure the french revolut thei guillotin on anoth if we unit both these kind of histori as is done by the newest historian we shall have the histori of monarch and writer but not the histori of the life of the peopl chapter v the life of the nation is not contain in the live of a few men for the connect between those men and the nation ha not been found the theori that thi connect is base on the transfer of the collect will of a peopl to certain histor personag is an hypothesi unconfirm by the experi of histori the theori of the transfer of the collect will of the peopl to histor person mai perhap explain much in the domain of jurisprud and be essenti for it purpos but in it applic to histori as soon as revolut conquest or civil war occur that is as soon as histori begin that theori explain noth the theori seem irrefut just becaus the act of transfer of the peopl s will cannot be verifi for it never occur whatev happen and whoever mai stand at the head of affair the theori can alwai sai that such and such a person took the lead becaus the collect will wa transfer to him the repli thi theori give to histor question ar like the repli of a man who watch the movement of a herd of cattl and pai no attent to the vari qualiti of the pasturag in differ part of the field or to the drive of the herdsman should attribut the direct the herd take to what anim happen to be at it head the herd goe in that direct becaus the anim in front lead it and the collect will of all the other anim is vest in that leader thi is what historian of the first class sai those who assum the uncondit transfer of the peopl s will if the anim lead the herd chang thi happen becaus the collect will of all the anim is transfer from on leader to anoth accord to whether the anim is or is not lead them in the direct select by the whole herd such is the repli historian who assum that the collect will of the peopl is deleg to ruler under condit which thei regard as known with thi method of observ it often happen that the observ influenc by the direct he himself prefer regard those as leader who ow to the peopl s chang of direct ar no longer in front but on on side or even in the rear if the anim in front ar continu chang and the direct of the whole herd is constantli alter thi is becaus in order to follow a given direct the anim transfer their will to the anim that have attract our attent and to studi the movement of the herd we must watch the movement of all the promin anim move on all side of the herd so sai the third class of historian who regard all histor person from monarch to journalist as the express of their ag the theori of the transfer of the will of the peopl to histor person is mere a paraphras a restat of the question in other word what caus histor event power what is power power is the collect will of the peopl transfer to on person under what condit is the will of the peopl deleg to on person on condit that that person express the will of the whole peopl that is power is power in other word power is a word the mean of which we do not understand if the realm of human knowledg were confin to abstract reason then have subject to critic the explan of power that jurid scienc give us human would conclud that power is mere a word and ha no real exist but to understand phenomena man ha besid abstract reason experi by which he verifi hi reflect and experi tell us that power is not mere a word but an actual exist phenomenon not to speak of the fact that no descript of the collect activ of men can do without the concept of power the exist of power is prove both by histori and by observ contemporari event whenev an event occur a man appear or men appear by whose will the event seem to have taken place napoleon iii issu a decre and the french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issu decre and an armi enter bohemia napoleon i issu a decre and an armi enter russia alexand i give a command and the french submit to the bourbon experi show us that whatev event occur it is alwai relat to the will of on or of sever men who have decre it the historian in accord with the old habit of acknowledg divin intervent in human affair want to see the caus of event in the express of the will of someon endow with power but that supposit is not confirm either by reason or by experi on the on side reflect show that the express of a man s will hi word ar onli part of the gener activ express in an event as for instanc in a war or a revolut and so without assum an incomprehens supernatur forc a miracl on cannot admit that word can be the immedi caus of the movement of million of men on the other hand even if we admit that word could be the caus of event histori show that the express of the will of histor personag doe not in most case produc ani effect that is to sai their command ar often not execut and sometim the veri opposit of what thei order occur without admit divin intervent in the affair of human we cannot regard power as the caus of event power from the standpoint of experi is mere the relat that exist between the express of someon s will and the execut of that will by other to explain the condit of that relationship we must first establish a concept of the express of will refer it to man and not to the deiti if the deiti issu a command express hi will as ancient histori tell us the express of that will is independ of time and is not caus by anyth for the divin is not control by an event but speak of command that ar the express of the will of men act in time and in relat to on anoth to explain the connect of command with event we must restor the condit of all that take place the continu of movement in time both of the event and of the person who command and the inevit of the connect between the person command and those who execut hi command chapter vi onli the express of the will of the deiti not depend on time can relat to a whole seri of event occur over a period of year or centuri and onli the deiti independ of everyth can by hi sole will determin the direct of human s movement but man act in time and himself take part in what occur reinstat the first condit omit that of time we see that no command can be execut without some preced order have been given render the execut of the last command possibl no command ever appear spontan or itself cover a whole seri of occurr but each command follow from anoth and never refer to a whole seri of event but alwai to on moment onli of an event when for instanc we sai that napoleon order armi to go to war we combin in on simultan express a whole seri of consecut command depend on on anoth napoleon could not have command an invas of russia and never did so todai he order such and such paper to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrow such and such decre and order to the armi the fleet the commissariat and so on and so on million of command which form a whole seri correspond to a seri of event which brought the french armi into russia if throughout hi reign napoleon gave command concern an invas of england and expend on no other undertak so much time and effort and yet dure hi whole reign never onc attempt to execut that design but undertook an expedit into russia with which countri he consid it desir to be in allianc a convict he repeatedli express thi came about becaus hi command did not correspond to the cours of event in the first case but did so correspond in the latter for an order to be certainli execut it is necessari that a man should order what can be execut but to know what can and what cannot be execut is imposs not onli in the case of napoleon s invas of russia in which million particip but even in the simplest event for in either case million of obstacl mai aris to prevent it execut everi order execut is alwai on of an immens number unexecut all the imposs order inconsist with the cours of event remain unexecut onli the possibl on get link up with a consecut seri of command correspond to a seri of event and ar execut our fals concept that an event is caus by a command which preced it is due to the fact that when the event ha taken place and out of thousand of other those few command which were consist with that event have been execut we forget about the other that were not execut becaus thei could not be apart from that the chief sourc of our error in thi matter is due to the fact that in the histor account a whole seri of innumer divers and petti event such for instanc as all those which led the french armi to russia is gener into on event in accord with the result produc by that seri of event and correspond with thi gener the whole seri of command is also gener into a singl express of will we sai that napoleon wish to invad russia and invad it in realiti in all napoleon s activ we never find anyth resembl an express of that wish but find a seri of order or express of hi will veri various and indefinit direct amid a long seri of unexecut order of napoleon s on seri for the campaign of wa carri out not becaus those order differ in ani wai from the other unexecut order but becaus thei coincid with the cours of event that led the french armi into russia just as in stencil work thi or that figur come out not becaus the color wa laid on from thi side or in that wai but becaus it wa laid on from all side over the figur cut in the stencil so that examin the relat in time of the command to the event we find that a command can never be the caus of the event but that a certain definit depend exist between the two to understand in what thi depend consist it is necessari to reinstat anoth omit condit of everi command proceed not from the deiti but from a man which is that the man who give the command himself take part in the event thi relat of the command to those he command is just what is call power thi relat consist in the follow for common action peopl alwai unit in certain combin in which regardless of the differ of the aim set for the common action the relat between those take part in it is alwai the same men unit in these combin alwai assum such relat toward on anoth that the larger number take a more direct share and the smaller number a less direct share in the collect action for which thei have combin of all the combin in which men unit for collect action on of the most strike and definit exampl is an armi everi armi is compos of lower grade of the servic the rank and file of whom there ar alwai the greatest number of the next higher militari rank corpor and noncommiss offic of whom there ar fewer and of stillhigh offic of whom there ar still fewer and so on to the highest militari command which is concentr in on person a militari organ mai be quit correctli compar to a cone of which the base with the largest diamet consist of the rank and file the next higher and smaller section of the cone consist of the next higher grade of the armi and so on to the apex the point of which will repres the command in chief the soldier of whom there ar the most form the lower section of the cone and it base the soldier himself doe the stab hack burn and pillag and alwai receiv order for these action from men abov him he himself never give an order the noncommiss offic of whom there ar fewer perform the action itself less frequent than the soldier but thei alreadi give command an offic still less often act directli himself but command still more frequent a gener doe noth but command the troop indic the object and hardli ever us a weapon himself the command in chief never take direct part in the action itself but onli give gener order concern the movement of the mass of the troop a similar relat of peopl to on anoth is seen in everi combin of men for common activ in agricultur trade and everi administr and so without particularli analyz all the contigu section of a cone and of the rank of an armi or the rank and posit in ani administr or public busi whatev from the lowest to the highest we see a law by which men to take associ action combin in such relat that the more directli thei particip in perform the action the less thei can command and the more numer thei ar while the less their direct particip in the action itself the more thei command and the fewer of them there ar rise in thi wai from the lowest rank to the man at the top who take the least direct share in the action and direct hi activ chiefli to command thi relat of the men who command to those thei command is what constitut the essenc of the concept call power have restor the condit of time under which all event occur we find that a command is execut onli when it is relat to a correspond seri of event restor the essenti condit of relat between those who command and those who execut we find that by the veri natur of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activ is exclus direct to command chapter vii when an event is take place peopl express their opinion and wish about it and as the event result from the collect activ of mani peopl some on of the opinion or wish express is sure to be fulfil if but approxim when on of the opinion express is fulfil that opinion get connect with the event as a command preced it men ar haul a log each of them express hi opinion as to how and where to haul it thei haul the log awai and it happen that thi is done as on of them said he order it there we have command and power in their primari form the man who work most with hi hand could not think so much about what he wa do or reflect on or command what would result from the common activ while the man who command more would evid work less with hi hand on account of hi greater verbal activ when some larger concours of men direct their activ to a common aim there is a yet sharper divis of those who becaus their activ is given to direct and command take less part in the direct work when a man work alon he alwai ha a certain set of reflect which as it seem to him direct hi past activ justifi hi present activ and guid him in plan hi futur action just the same is done by a concours of peopl allow those who do not take a direct part in the activ to devis consider justif and surmis concern their collect activ for reason known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill on anoth and correspond to the event it justif appear in peopl s belief that thi wa necessari for the welfar of franc for liberti and for equal peopl ceas to kill on anoth and thi event wa accompani by it justif in the necess for a central of power resist to europ and so on men went from the west to the east kill their fellow men and the event wa accompani by phrase about the glori of franc the base of england and so on histori show us that these justif of the event have no common sens and ar all contradictori as in the case of kill a man as the result of recogn hi right and the kill of million in russia for the humili of england but these justif have a veri necessari signific in their own dai these justif releas those who produc the event from moral respons these temporari aim ar like the broom fix in front of a locomot to clear the snow from the rail in front thei clear men s moral respons from their path without such justif there would be no repli to the simplest question that present itself when examin each histor event how is it that million of men commit collect crime make war commit murder and so on with the present complex form of polit and social life in europ can ani event that is not prescrib decre or order by monarch minist parliament or newspap be imagin is there ani collect action which cannot find it justif in polit uniti in patriot in the balanc of power or in civil so that everi event that occur inevit coincid with some express wish and receiv a justif present itself as the result of the will of on man or of sever men in whatev direct a ship move the flow of the wave it cut will alwai be notic ahead of it to those on board the ship the movement of those wave will be the onli percept motion onli by watch close moment by moment the movement of that flow and compar it with the movement of the ship do we convinc ourselv that everi bit of it is occas by the forward movement of the ship and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselv were impercept move we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of histor charact that is reestablish the inevit condit of all that occur the continu of movement in time and do not lose sight of the essenti connect of histor person with the mass when the ship move in on direct there is on and the same wave ahead of it when it turn frequent the wave ahead of it also turn frequent but wherev it mai turn there alwai will be the wave anticip it movement whatev happen it alwai appear that just that event wa foreseen and decre wherev the ship mai go the rush of water which neither direct nor increas it movement foam ahead of it and at a distanc seem to us not mere to move of itself but to govern the ship s movement also examin onli those express of the will of histor person which as command were relat to event historian have assum that the event depend on those command but examin the event themselv and the connect in which the histor person stood to the peopl we have found that thei and their order were depend on event the incontest proof of thi deduct is that howev mani command were issu the event doe not take place unless there ar other caus for it but as soon as an event occur be it what it mai then out of all the continu express wish of differ peopl some will alwai be found which by their mean and their time of utter ar relat as command to the event arriv at thi conclus we can repli directli and posit to these two essenti question of histori what is power what forc produc the movement of the nation power is the relat of a given person to other individu in which the more thi person express opinion predict and justif of the collect action that is perform the less is hi particip in that action the movement of nation is caus not by power nor by intellectu activ nor even by a combin of the two as historian have suppos but by the activ of all the peopl who particip in the event and who alwai combin in such a wai that those take the largest direct share in the event take on themselv the least respons and vice versa moral the wielder of power appear to caus the event physic it is those who submit to the power but as the moral activ is inconceiv without the physic the caus of the event is neither in the on nor in the other but in the union of the two or in other word the concept of a caus is inapplic to the phenomena we ar examin in the last analysi we reach the circl of infin that final limit to which in everi domain of thought man s reason arriv if it is not plai with the subject electr produc heat heat produc electr atom attract each other and atom repel on anoth speak of the interact of heat and electr and of atom we cannot sai why thi occur and we sai that it is so becaus it is inconceiv otherwis becaus it must be so and that it is a law the same appli to histor event why war and revolut occur we do not know we onli know that to produc the on or the other action peopl combin in a certain format in which thei all take part and we sai that thi is so becaus it is unthink otherwis or in other word that it is a law chapter viii if histori dealt onli with extern phenomena the establish of thi simpl and obviou law would suffic and we should have finish our argument but the law of histori relat to man a particl of matter cannot tell us that it doe not feel the law of attract or repuls and that that law is untru but man who is the subject of histori sai plainli i am free and am therefor not subject to the law the presenc of the problem of man s free will though unexpress is felt at everi step of histori all serious think historian have involuntarili encount thi question all the contradict and obscur of histori and the fals path histor scienc ha follow ar due sole to the lack of a solut of that question if the will of everi man were free that is if each man could act as he pleas all histori would be a seri of disconnect incid if in a thousand year even on man in a million could act freeli that is as he chose it is evid that on singl free act of that man s in violat of the law govern human action would destroi the possibl of the exist of ani law for the whole of human if there be a singl law govern the action of men free will cannot exist for then man s will is subject to that law in thi contradict li the problem of free will which from most ancient time ha occupi the best human mind and from most ancient time ha been present in it whole tremend signific the problem is that regard man as a subject of observ from whatev point of view theolog histor ethic or philosoph we find a gener law of necess to which he like all that exist is subject but regard him from within ourselv as what we ar consciou of we feel ourselv to be free thi conscious is a sourc of selfcognit quit apart from and independ of reason through hi reason man observ himself but onli through conscious doe he know himself apart from conscious of self no observ or applic of reason is conceiv to understand observ and draw conclus man must first of all be consciou of himself as live a man is onli consciou of himself as a live be by the fact that he will that is is consciou of hi volit but hi will which form the essenc of hi life man recogn and can but recogn as free if observ himself man see that hi will is alwai direct by on and the same law whether he observ the necess of take food us hi brain or anyth els he cannot recogn thi nevervari direct of hi will otherwis than as a limit of it were it not free it could not be limit a man s will seem to him to be limit just becaus he is not consciou of it except as free you sai i am not free but i have lift my hand and let it fall everyon understand that thi illog repli is an irrefut demonstr of freedom that repli is the express of a conscious that is not subject to reason if the conscious of freedom were not a separ and independ sourc of selfconsci it would be subject to reason and to experi but in fact such subject doe not exist and is inconceiv a seri of experi and argument prove to everi man that he as an object of observ is subject to certain law and man submit to them and never resist the law of graviti or imperm onc he ha becom acquaint with them but the same seri of experi and argument prove to him that the complet freedom of which he is consciou in himself is imposs and that hi everi action depend on hi organ hi charact and the motiv act upon him yet man never submit to the deduct of these experi and argument have learn from experi and argument that a stone fall downward a man indubit believ thi and alwai expect the law that he ha learn to be fulfil but learn just as certainli that hi will is subject to law he doe not and cannot believ thi howev often experi and reason mai show a man that under the same condit and with the same charact he will do the same thing as befor yet when under the same condit and with the same charact he approach for the thousandth time the action that alwai end in the same wai he feel as certainli convinc as befor the experi that he can act as he pleas everi man savag or sage howev incontest reason and experi mai prove to him that it is imposs to imagin two differ cours of action in precis the same condit feel that without thi irrat concept which constitut the essenc of freedom he cannot imagin life he feel that howev imposs it mai be it is so for without thi concept of freedom not onli would he be unabl to understand life but he would be unabl to live for a singl moment he could not live becaus all man s effort all hi impuls to life ar onli effort to increas freedom wealth and poverti fame and obscur power and subordin strength and weak health and diseas cultur and ignor work and leisur replet and hunger virtu and vice ar onli greater or lesser degre of freedom a man have no freedom cannot be conceiv of except as depriv of life if the concept of freedom appear to reason to be a senseless contradict like the possibl of perform two action at on and the same instant of time or of an effect without a caus that onli prove that conscious is not subject to reason thi unshak irrefut conscious of freedom uncontrol by experi or argument recogn by all thinker and felt by everyon without except thi conscious without which no concept of man is possibl constitut the other side of the question man is the creation of an allpow allgood and allse god what is sin the concept of which aris from the conscious of man s freedom that is a question for theologi the action of men ar subject to gener immut law express in statist what is man s respons to societi the concept of which result from the concept of freedom that is a question for jurisprud man s action proce from hi innat charact and the motiv act upon him what is conscienc and the percept of right and wrong in action that follow from the conscious of freedom that is a question for ethic man in connect with the gener life of human appear subject to law which determin that life but the same man apart from that connect appear to be free how should the past life of nation and of human be regard as the result of the free or as the result of the constrain activ of man that is a question for histori onli in our selfconfid dai of the popular of knowledg thank to that most power engin of ignor the diffus of print matter ha the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist in our time the major of socal advanc peopl that is the crowd of ignoramus have taken the work of the naturalist who deal with on side of the question for a solut of the whole problem thei sai and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist for the life of man is express by muscular movement and muscular movement ar condit by the activ of the nerv the soul and free will do not exist becaus at an unknown period of time we sprang from the ap thei sai thi not at all suspect that thousand of year ago that same law of necess which with such ardor thei ar now try to prove by physiolog and compar zoologi wa not mere acknowledg by all the religion and all the thinker but ha never been deni thei do not see that the role of the natur scienc in thi matter is mere to serv as an instrument for the illumin of on side of it for the fact that from the point of view of observ reason and the will ar mere secret of the brain and that man follow the gener law mai have develop from lower anim at some unknown period of time onli explain from a fresh side the truth admit thousand of year ago by all the religi and philosoph theori that from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of necess but it doe not advanc by a hair s breadth the solut of the question which ha anoth opposit side base on the conscious of freedom if men descend from the ap at an unknown period of time that is as comprehens as that thei were made from a hand of earth at a certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantiti is the time in the second case it is the origin and the question of how man s conscious of freedom is to be reconcil with the law of necess to which he is subject cannot be solv by compar physiolog and zoologi for in a frog a rabbit or an ap we can observ onli the muscular nervou activ but in man we observ conscious as well as the muscular and nervou activ the naturalist and their follow think thei can solv thi question ar like plaster set to plaster on side of the wall of a church who avail themselv of the absenc of the chief superintend of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over the window icon woodwork and still unbuttress wall and should be delight that from their point of view as plaster everyth is now so smooth and regular chapter ix for the solut of the question of free will or inevit histori ha thi advantag over other branch of knowledg in which the question is dealt with that for histori thi question doe not refer to the essenc of man s free will but it manifest in the past and under certain condit in regard to thi question histori stand to the other scienc as experiment scienc stand to abstract scienc the subject for histori is not man s will itself but our present of it and so for histori the insolubl mysteri present by the incompat of free will and inevit doe not exist as it doe for theologi ethic and philosophi histori survei a present of man s life in which the union of these two contradict ha alreadi taken place in actual life each histor event each human action is veri clearli and definit understood without ani sens of contradict although each event present itself as partli free and partli compulsori to solv the question of how freedom and necess ar combin and what constitut the essenc of these two concept the philosophi of histori can and should follow a path contrari to that taken by other scienc instead of first defin the concept of freedom and inevit in themselv and then rang the phenomena of life under those definit histori should deduc a definit of the concept of freedom and inevit themselv from the immens quantiti of phenomena of which it is cogniz and that alwai appear depend on these two element whatev present of the activ of mani men or of an individu we mai consid we alwai regard it as the result partli of man s free will and partli of the law of inevit whether we speak of the migrat of the peopl and the incurs of the barbarian or of the decre of napoleon iii or of someon s action an hour ago in choos on direct out of sever for hi walk we ar unconsci of ani contradict the degre of freedom and inevit govern the action of these peopl is clearli defin for us our concept of the degre of freedom often vari accord to differ in the point of view from which we regard the event but everi human action appear to us as a certain combin of freedom and inevit in everi action we examin we see a certain measur of freedom and a certain measur of inevit and alwai the more freedom we see in ani action the less inevit do we perceiv and the more inevit the less freedom the proport of freedom to inevit decreas and increas accord to the point of view from which the action is regard but their relat is alwai on of invers proport a sink man who clutch at anoth and drown him or a hungri mother exhaust by feed her babi who steal some food or a man train to disciplin who on duti at the word of command kill a defenseless man seem less guilti that is less free and more subject to the law of necess to on who know the circumst in which these peopl were place and more free to on who doe not know that the man wa himself drown that the mother wa hungri that the soldier wa in the rank and so on similarli a man who commit a murder twenti year ago and ha sinc live peaceabl and harmlessli in societi seem less guilti and hi action more due to the law of inevit to someon who consid hi action after twenti year have elaps than to on who examin it the dai after it wa commit and in the same wai everi action of an insan intox or highli excit man appear less free and more inevit to on who know the mental condit of him who commit the action and seem more free and less inevit to on who doe not know it in all these case the concept of freedom is increas or diminish and the concept of compuls is correspondingli decreas or increas accord to the point of view from which the action is regard so that the greater the concept of necess the smaller the concept of freedom and vice versa religion the common sens of mankind the scienc of jurisprud and histori itself understand alik thi relat between necess and freedom all case without except in which our concept of freedom and necess is increas and diminish depend on three consider the relat to the extern world of the man who commit the deed hi relat to time hi relat to the caus lead to the action the first consider is the clear of our percept of the man s relat to the extern world and the greater or lesser clear of our understand of the definit posit occupi by the man in relat to everyth coexist with him thi is what make it evid that a drown man is less free and more subject to necess than on stand on dry ground and that make the action of a man close connect with other in a thickli popul district or of on bound by famili offici or busi duti seem certainli less free and more subject to necess than those of a man live in solitud and seclus if we consid a man alon apart from hi relat to everyth around him each action of hi seem to us free but if we see hi relat to anyth around him if we see hi connect with anyth whatev with a man who speak to him a book he read the work on which he is engag even with the air he breath or the light that fall on the thing about him we see that each of these circumst ha an influenc on him and control at least some side of hi activ and the more we perceiv of these influenc the more our concept of hi freedom diminish and the more our concept of the necess that weigh on him increas the second consider is the more or less evid time relat of the man to the world and the clear of our percept of the place the man s action occupi in time that is the ground which make the fall of the first man result in the product of the human race appear evid less free than a man s entri into marriag todai it is the reason why the life and activ of peopl who live centuri ago and ar connect with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporari the consequ of which ar still unknown to me the degre of our concept of freedom or inevit depend in thi respect on the greater or lesser laps of time between the perform of the action and our judgment of it if i examin an act i perform a moment ago in approxim the same circumst as those i am in now my action appear to me undoubtedli free but if i examin an act perform a month ago then be in differ circumst i cannot help recogn that if that act had not been commit much that result from it good agreeabl and even essenti would not have taken place if i reflect on an action still more remot ten year ago or more then the consequ of my action ar still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagin what would have happen had that action not been perform the farther i go back in memori or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my judgment the more doubt becom my belief in the freedom of my action in histori we find a veri similar progress of convict concern the part plai by free will in the gener affair of human a contemporari event seem to us to be indubit the do of all the known particip but with a more remot event we alreadi see it inevit result which prevent our consid anyth els possibl and the farther we go back in examin event the less arbitrari do thei appear the austroprussian war appear to us undoubtedli the result of the crafti conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleon war still seem to us though alreadi question to be the outcom of their hero will but in the crusad we alreadi see an event occupi it definit place in histori and without which we cannot imagin the modern histori of europ though to the chronicl of the crusad that event appear as mere due to the will of certain peopl in regard to the migrat of the peopl it doe not enter anyon s head todai to suppos that the renov of the european world depend on attila s capric the farther back in histori the object of our observ li the more doubt doe the free will of those concern in the event becom and the more manifest the law of inevit the third consider is the degre to which we apprehend that endless chain of causat inevit demand by reason in which each phenomenon comprehend and therefor man s everi action must have it definit place as a result of what ha gone befor and as a caus of what will follow the better we ar acquaint with the physiolog psycholog and histor law deduc by observ and by which man is control and the more correctli we perceiv the physiolog psycholog and histor caus of the action and the simpler the action we ar observ and the less complex the charact and mind of the man in question the more subject to inevit and the less free do our action and those of other appear when we do not at all understand the caus of an action whether a crime a good action or even on that is simpli nonmor we ascrib a greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgent demand the punish for such an act in the case of a virtuou act we rate it merit most highli in an indiffer case we recogn in it more individu origin and independ but if even on of the innumer caus of the act is known to us we recogn a certain element of necess and ar less insist on punish for the crime or the acknowledg of the merit of the virtuou act or the freedom of the appar origin action that a crimin wa rear among male factor mitig hi fault in our ey the selfsacrific of a father or mother or selfsacrific with the possibl of a reward is more comprehens than gratuit selfsacrific and therefor seem less deserv of sympathi and less the result of free will the founder of a sect or parti or an inventor impress us less when we know how or by what the wai wa prepar for hi activ if we have a larg rang of exampl if our observ is constantli direct to seek the correl of caus and effect in peopl s action their action appear to us more under compuls and less free the more correctli we connect the effect with the caus if we examin simpl action and had a vast number of such action under observ our concept of their inevit would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad compani a drunkard s relaps into drunken and so on ar action that seem to us less free the better we understand their caus if the man whose action we ar consid is on a veri low stage of mental develop like a child a madman or a simpleton then know the caus of the act and the simplic of the charact and intellig in question we see so larg an element of necess and so littl free will that as soon as we know the caus prompt the action we can foretel the result on these three consider alon is base the concept of irrespons for crime and the extenu circumst admit by all legisl code the respons appear greater or less accord to our greater or lesser knowledg of the circumst in which the man wa place whose action is be judg and accord to the greater or lesser interv of time between the commiss of the action and it investig and accord to the greater or lesser understand of the caus that led to the action chapter x thu our concept of free will and inevit gradual diminish or increas accord to the greater or lesser connect with the extern world the greater or lesser remot of time and the greater or lesser depend on the caus in relat to which we contempl a man s life so that if we examin the case of a man whose connect with the extern world is well known where the time between the action and it examin is great and where the caus of the action ar most access we get the concept of a maximum of inevit and a minimum of free will if we examin a man littl depend on extern condit whose action wa perform veri recent and the caus of whose action ar beyond our ken we get the concept of a minimum of inevit and a maximum of freedom in neither case howev we mai chang our point of view howev plain we mai make to ourselv the connect between the man and the extern world howev inaccess it mai be to us howev long or short the period of time howev intellig or incomprehens the caus of the action mai be can we ever conceiv either complet freedom or complet necess to whatev degre we mai imagin a man to be exempt from the influenc of the extern world we never get a concept of freedom in space everi human action is inevit condit by what surround him and by hi own bodi i lift my arm and let it fall my action seem to me free but ask myself whether i could rais my arm in everi direct i see that i rais it in the direct in which there wa least obstruct to that action either from thing around me or from the construct of my own bodi i chose on out of all the possibl direct becaus in it there were fewest obstacl for my action to be free it wa necessari that it should encount no obstacl to conceiv of a man be free we must imagin him outsid space which is evid imposs howev much we approxim the time of judgment to the time of the deed we never get a concept of freedom in time for if i examin an action commit a second ago i must still recogn it as not be free for it is irrevoc link to the moment at which it wa commit can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i have abstain from lift my arm at the moment that ha alreadi pass to convinc myself of thi i do not lift it the next moment but i am not now abstain from do so at the first moment when i ask the question time ha gone by which i could not detain the arm i then lift is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lift nor is the air in which i lift it the same that now surround me the moment in which the first movement wa made is irrevoc and at that moment i could make onli on movement and whatev movement i made would be the onli on that i did not lift my arm a moment later doe not prove that i could have abstain from lift it then and sinc i could make onli on movement at that singl moment of time it could not have been ani other to imagin it as free it is necessari to imagin it in the present on the boundari between the past and the futur that is outsid time which is imposs howev much the difficulti of understand the caus mai be increas we never reach a concept of complet freedom that is an absenc of caus howev inaccess to us mai be the caus of the express of will in ani action our own or anoth s the first demand of reason is the assumpt of and search for a caus for without a caus no phenomenon is conceiv i rais my arm to perform an action independ of ani caus but my wish to perform an action without a caus is the caus of my action but even if imagin a man quit exempt from all influenc examin onli hi momentari action in the present unevok by ani caus we were to admit so infinit small a remaind of inevit as equal zero we should even then not have arriv at the concept of complet freedom in man for a be uninfluenc by the extern world stand outsid of time and independ of caus is no longer a man in the same wai we can never imagin the action of a man quit devoid of freedom and entir subject to the law of inevit howev we mai increas our knowledg of the condit of space in which man is situat that knowledg can never be complet for the number of those condit is as infinit as the infin of space and therefor so long as not all the condit influenc men ar defin there is no complet inevit but a certain measur of freedom remain howev we mai prolong the period of time between the action we ar examin and the judgment upon it that period will be finit while time is infinit and so in thi respect too there can never be absolut inevit howev access mai be the chain of causat of ani action we shall never know the whole chain sinc it is endless and so again we never reach absolut inevit but besid thi even if admit the remain minimum of freedom to equal zero we assum in some given case as for instanc in that of a dy man an unborn babe or an idiot complet absenc of freedom by so do we should destroi the veri concept of man in the case we ar examin for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man and so the concept of the action of a man subject sole to the law of inevit without ani element of freedom is just as imposs as the concept of a man s complet free action and so to imagin the action of a man entir subject to the law of inevit without ani freedom we must assum the knowledg of an infinit number of space relat an infinit long period of time and an infinit seri of caus to imagin a man perfectli free and not subject to the law of inevit we must imagin him all alon beyond space beyond time and free from depend on caus in the first case if inevit were possibl without freedom we should have reach a definit of inevit by the law of inevit itself that is a mere form without content in the second case if freedom were possibl without inevit we should have arriv at uncondit freedom beyond space time and caus which by the fact of it be uncondit and unlimit would be noth or mere content without form we should in fact have reach those two fundament of which man s whole outlook on the univers is construct the incomprehens essenc of life and the law defin that essenc reason sai space with all the form of matter that give it visibl is infinit and cannot be imagin otherwis time is infinit motion without a moment of rest and is unthink otherwis the connect between caus and effect ha no begin and can have no end conscious sai i alon am and all that exist is but me consequ i includ space i measur flow time by the fix moment of the present in which alon i am consciou of myself as live consequ i am outsid time i am beyond caus for i feel myself to be the caus of everi manifest of my life reason give express to the law of inevit conscious give express to the essenc of freedom freedom not limit by anyth is the essenc of life in man s conscious inevit without content is man s reason in it three form freedom is the thing examin inevit is what examin freedom is the content inevit is the form onli by separ the two sourc of cognit relat to on anoth as form to content do we get the mutual exclus and separ incomprehens concept of freedom and inevit onli by unit them do we get a clear concept of man s life apart from these two concept which in their union mutual defin on anoth as form and content no concept of life is possibl all that we know of the life of man is mere a certain relat of free will to inevit that is of conscious to the law of reason all that we know of the extern world of natur is onli a certain relat of the forc of natur to inevit or of the essenc of life to the law of reason the great natur forc lie outsid us and we ar not consciou of them we call those forc gravit inertia electr anim forc and so on but we ar consciou of the forc of life in man and we call that freedom but just as the forc of gravit incomprehens in itself but felt by everi man is understood by us onli to the extent to which we know the law of inevit to which it is subject from the first knowledg that all bodi have weight up to newton s law so too the forc of free will incomprehens in itself but of which everyon is consciou is intellig to us onli in as far as we know the law of inevit to which it is subject from the fact that everi man di up to the knowledg of the most complex econom and histor law all knowledg is mere a bring of thi essenc of life under the law of reason man s free will differ from everi other forc in that man is directli consciou of it but in the ey of reason it in no wai differ from ani other forc the forc of gravit electr or chemic affin ar onli distinguish from on anoth in that thei ar differ defin by reason just so the forc of man s free will is distinguish by reason from the other forc of natur onli by the definit reason give it freedom apart from necess that is apart from the law of reason that defin it differ in no wai from gravit or heat or the forc that make thing grow for reason it is onli a momentari undefin sensat of life and as the undefin essenc of the forc move the heavenli bodi the undefin essenc of the forc of heat and electr or of chemic affin or of the vital forc form the content of astronomi physic chemistri botani zoologi and so on just in the same wai doe the forc of free will form the content of histori but just as the subject of everi scienc is the manifest of thi unknown essenc of life while that essenc itself can onli be the subject of metaphys even the manifest of the forc of free will in human be in space in time and in depend on caus form the subject of histori while free will itself is the subject of metaphys in the experiment scienc what we know we call the law of inevit what is unknown to us we call vital forc vital forc is onli an express for the unknown remaind over and abov what we know of the essenc of life so also in histori what is known to us we call law of inevit what is unknown we call free will free will is for histori onli an express for the unknown remaind of what we know about the law of human life chapter xi histori examin the manifest of man s free will in connect with the extern world in time and in depend on caus that is it defin thi freedom by the law of reason and so histori is a scienc onli in so far as thi free will is defin by those law the recognit of man s free will as someth capabl of influenc histor event that is as not subject to law is the same for histori as the recognit of a free forc move the heavenli bodi would be for astronomi that assumpt would destroi the possibl of the exist of law that is of ani scienc whatev if there is even a singl bodi move freeli then the law of kepler and newton ar negativ and no concept of the movement of the heavenli bodi ani longer exist if ani singl action is due to free will then not a singl histor law can exist nor ani concept of histor event for histori line exist of the movement of human will on end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a conscious of man s will in the present move in space time and depend on caus the more thi field of motion spread out befor our ey the more evid ar the law of that movement to discov and defin those law is the problem of histori from the standpoint from which the scienc of histori now regard it subject on the path it now follow seek the caus of event in man s free will a scientif enunci of those law is imposs for howev man s free will mai be restrict as soon as we recogn it as a forc not subject to law the exist of law becom imposs onli by reduc thi element of free will to the infinitesim that is by regard it as an infinit small quantiti can we convinc ourselv of the absolut inaccess of the caus and then instead of seek caus histori will take the discoveri of law as it problem the search for these law ha long been begun and the new method of thought which histori must adopt ar be work out simultan with the selfdestruct toward which ever dissect and dissect the caus of phenomena the old method of histori is move all human scienc have travel along that path arriv at infinitesim mathemat the most exact of scienc abandon the process of analysi and enter on the new process of the integr of unknown infinit small quantiti abandon the concept of caus mathemat seek law that is the properti common to all unknown infinit small element in anoth form but along the same path of reflect the other scienc have proceed when newton enunci the law of graviti he did not sai that the sun or the earth had a properti of attract he said that all bodi from the largest to the smallest have the properti of attract on anoth that is leav asid the question of the caus of the movement of the bodi he express the properti common to all bodi from the infinit larg to the infinit small the same is done by the natur scienc leav asid the question of caus thei seek for law histori stand on the same path and if histori ha for it object the studi of the movement of the nation and of human and not the narrat of episod in the live of individu it too set asid the concept of caus should seek the law common to all the insepar interconnect infinitesim element of free will chapter xii from the time the law of copernicu wa discov and prove the mere recognit of the fact that it wa not the sun but the earth that move suffic to destroi the whole cosmographi of the ancient by disprov that law it might have been possibl to retain the old concept of the movement of the bodi but without disprov it it would seem imposs to continu studi the ptolema world but even after the discoveri of the law of copernicu the ptolema world were still studi for a long time from the time the first person said and prove that the number of birth or of crime is subject to mathemat law and that thi or that mode of govern is determin by certain geograph and econom condit and that certain relat of popul to soil produc migrat of peopl the foundat on which histori had been built were destroi in their essenc by refut these new law the former view of histori might have been retain but without refut them it would seem imposs to continu studi histor event as the result of man s free will for if a certain mode of govern wa establish or certain migrat of peopl took place in consequ of such and such geograph ethnograph or econom condit then the free will of those individu who appear to us to have establish that mode of govern or occas the migrat can no longer be regard as the caus and yet the former histori continu to be studi side by side with the law of statist geographi polit economi compar philolog and geologi which directli contradict it assumpt the struggl between the old view and the new wa long and stubbornli fought out in physic philosophi theologi stood on guard for the old view and accus the new of violat revel but when truth conquer theologi establish itself just as firmli on the new foundat just as prolong and stubborn is the struggl now proceed between the old and the new concept of histori and theologi in the same wai stand on guard for the old view and accus the new view of subvert revel in the on case as in the other on both side the struggl provok passion and stifl truth on the on hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole edific construct through the ag on the other is the passion for destruct to the men who fought against the rise truth of physic philosophi it seem that if thei admit that truth it would destroi faith in god in the creation of the firmament and in the miracl of joshua the son of nun to the defend of the law of copernicu and newton to voltair for exampl it seem that the law of astronomi destroi religion and he util the law of gravit as a weapon against religion just so it now seem as if we have onli to admit the law of inevit to destroi the concept of the soul of good and evil and all the institut of state and church that have been built up on those concept so too like voltair in hi time uninvit defend of the law of inevit todai us that law as a weapon against religion though the law of inevit in histori like the law of copernicu in astronomi far from destroi even strengthen the foundat on which the institut of state and church ar erect as in the question of astronomi then so in the question of histori now the whole differ of opinion is base on the recognit or nonrecognit of someth absolut serv as the measur of visibl phenomena in astronomi it wa the immov of the earth in histori it is the independ of person free will as with astronomi the difficulti of recogn the motion of the earth lai in abandon the immedi sensat of the earth s fixiti and of the motion of the planet so in histori the difficulti of recogn the subject of person to the law of space time and caus li in renounc the direct feel of the independ of on s own person but as in astronomi the new view said it is true that we do not feel the movement of the earth but by admit it immobl we arriv at absurd while by admit it motion which we do not feel we arriv at law so also in histori the new view sai it is true that we ar not consciou of our depend but by admit our free will we arriv at absurd while by admit our depend on the extern world on time and on caus we arriv at law in the first case it wa necessari to renounc the conscious of an unreal immobl in space and to recogn a motion we did not feel in the present case it is similarli necessari to renounc a freedom that doe not exist and to recogn a depend of which we ar not consciou end of the project gutenberg ebook of war and peac by leo tolstoi end of thi project
