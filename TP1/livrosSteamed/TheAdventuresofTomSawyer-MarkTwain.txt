had a mind not to sai them at all but thei were afraid to proce to such length as that lest thei might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven then at onc thei reach and hover upon the immin verg of sleepbut an intrud came now that would not down it wa conscienc thei began to feel a vagu fear that thei had been do wrong to run awai and next thei thought of the stolen meat and then the real tortur came thei tri to argu it awai by remind conscienc that thei had purloin sweetmeat and appl score of time but conscienc wa not to be appeas by such thin plausibl it seem to them in the end that there wa no get around the stubborn fact that take sweetmeat wa onli hook while take bacon and ham and such valuabl wa plain simpl stealingand there wa a command against that in the bibl so thei inwardli resolv that so long as thei remain in the busi their piraci should not again be sulli with the crime of steal then conscienc grant a truce and these curious inconsist pirat fell peacefulli to sleep chapter xiv when tom awok in the morn he wonder where he wa he sat up and rub hi ey and look around then he comprehend it wa the cool grai dawn and there wa a delici sens of repos

nowher in particular and went about their labor on struggl manfulli by with a dead spider five time as big as itself in it arm and lug it straight up a treetrunk a brown spot ladybug climb the dizzi height of a grass blade and tom bent down close to it and said ladybug ladybug fly awai home your hous is on fire your children s alon and she took wing and went off to see about itwhich did not surpris the boi for he knew of old that thi insect wa credul about conflagr and he had practis upon it simplic more than onc a tumblebug came next heav sturdili at it ball and tom touch the creatur to see it shut it leg against it bodi and pretend to be dead the bird were fairli riot by thi time a catbird the northern mocker lit in a tree over tom s head and trill out her imit of her neighbor in a raptur of enjoy then a shrill jai swept down a flash of blue flame and stop on a twig almost within the boi s reach cock hi head to on side and ei the stranger with a consum curios a grai squirrel and a big fellow of the fox kind came skurri along sit up at interv to inspect and chatter at the boi for the wild thing had probabl never seen a human be befor and scarc knew whether to be afraid or not all natur wa wide awak and stir now long lanc of sunlight pierc down through the dens foliag far and near and a few butterfli came flutter upon the scene tom stir up the other pirat and thei all clatter awai with a shout and in a minut or two were strip and chase after and tumbl over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar thei felt no long for the littl villag sleep in the distanc beyond the majest wast of water a vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carri off their raft but thi onli gratifi them sinc it go wa someth like burn the bridg between them and civil thei came back to camp wonderfulli refresh gladheart and raven and thei soon had the campfir blaze up again huck found a spring of clear cold water close by and the boi made cup of broad oak or hickori leav and felt that water sweeten with such a wildwood charm as that would be a good enough substitut for coffe while joe wa slice bacon for breakfast tom and huck ask him to hold on a minut thei step to a promis nook in the riverbank and threw in their line almost immedi thei had reward joe had not had time to get impati befor thei were back again with some handsom bass a coupl of sunperch and a small catfishprovis enough for quit a famili thei fri the fish with the bacon and were astonish for no fish had ever seem so delici befor thei did not know that the quicker a freshwat fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is and thei reflect littl upon what a sauc openair sleep openair exercis bath and a larg ingredi of hunger make too thei lai around in the shade after breakfast while huck had a smoke and then went off through the wood on an explor expedit thei tramp gayli along over decai log through tangl underbrush among solemn monarch of the forest hung from their crown to the ground with a droop regalia of grapevin now and then thei came upon snug nook carpet with grass and jewel with flower thei found plenti of thing to be delight with but noth to be astonish at thei discov that the island wa about three mile long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lai closest to wa onli separ from it by a narrow channel hardli two hundr yard wide thei took a swim about everi hour so it wa close upon the middl of the afternoon when thei got back to camp thei were too hungri to stop to fish but thei fare sumptuous upon cold ham and then threw themselv down in the shade to talk but the talk soon began to drag and then di the still the solemn that brood in the wood and the sens of loneli began to tell upon the spirit of the boi thei fell to think a sort of undefin long crept upon them thi took dim shape presentlyit wa bud homesick even finn the redhand wa dream of hi doorstep and empti hogshead but thei were all asham of their weak and none wa brave enough to speak hi thought for some time now the boi had been dulli consciou of a peculiar sound in the distanc just as on sometim is of the tick of a clock which he take no distinct note of but now thi mysteri sound becam more pronounc and forc a recognit the boi start glanc at each other and then each assum a listen attitud there wa a long silenc profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came float down out of the distanc what is it exclaim joe under hi breath i wonder said tom in a whisper tain t thunder said huckleberri in an aw tone becuz thunder hark said tom listendon t talk thei wait a time that seem an ag and then the same muffl boom troubl the solemn hush let s go and see thei sprang to their feet and hurri to the shore toward the town thei part the bush on the bank and peer out over the water the littl steam ferryboat wa about a mile below the villag drift with the current her broad deck seem crowd with peopl there were a great mani skiff row about or float with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat but the boi could not determin what the men in them were do present a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat s side and as it expand and rose in a lazi cloud that same dull throb of sound wa born to the listen again i know now exclaim tom somebodi s drownd that s it said huck thei done that last summer when bill turner got drownd thei shoot a cannon over the water and that make him come up to the top ye and thei take loav of bread and put quicksilv in em and set em afloat and wherev there s anybodi that s drownd thei ll float right there and stop ye i ve heard about that said joe i wonder what make the bread do that oh it ain t the bread so much said tom i reckon it s mostli what thei sai over it befor thei start it out but thei don t sai anyth over it said huck i ve seen em and thei don t well that s funni said tom but mayb thei sai it to themselv of cours thei do anybodi might know that the other boi agre that there wa reason in what tom said becaus an ignor lump of bread uninstruct by an incant could not be expect to act veri intellig when set upon an errand of such graviti by jing i wish i wa over there now said joe i do too said huck i d give heap to know who it is the boi still listen and watch present a reveal thought flash through tom s mind and he exclaim boi i know who s drowndedit s us thei felt like hero in an instant here wa a gorgeou triumph thei were miss thei were mourn heart were break on their account tear were be shed accus memori of unkind to these poor lost lad were rise up and unavail regret and remors were be indulg and best of all the depart were the talk of the whole town and the envi of all the boi as far as thi dazzl notorieti wa concern thi wa fine it wa worth while to be a pirat after all as twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustom busi and the skiff disappear the pirat return to camp thei were jubil with vaniti over their new grandeur and the illustri troubl thei were make thei caught fish cook supper and at it and then fell to guess at what the villag wa think and sai about them and the pictur thei drew of the public distress on their account were gratifi to look uponfrom their point of view but when the shadow of night close them in thei gradual ceas to talk and sat gaze into the fire with their mind evid wander elsewher the excit wa gone now and tom and joe could not keep back thought of certain person at home who were not enjoi thi fine frolic as much as thei were misgiv came thei grew troubl and unhappi a sigh or two escap unawar by and by joe timidli ventur upon a roundabout feeler as to how the other might look upon a return to civilizationnot right now but tom wither him with deris huck be uncommit as yet join in with tom and the waver quickli explain and wa glad to get out of the scrape with as littl taint of chickenheart homesick cling to hi garment as he could mutini wa effectu laid to rest for the moment as the night deepen huck began to nod and present to snore joe follow next tom lai upon hi elbow motionless for some time watch the two intent at last he got up cautious on hi knee and went search among the grass and the flicker reflect flung by the campfir he pick up and inspect sever larg semicylind of the thin white bark of a sycamor and final chose two which seem to suit him then he knelt by the fire and painfulli wrote someth upon each of these with hi red keel on he roll up and put in hi jacket pocket and the other he put in joe s hat and remov it to a littl distanc from the owner and he also put into the hat certain schoolboi treasur of almost inestim valueamong them a lump of chalk an indiarubb ball three fishhook and on of that kind of marbl known as a sure nough crystal then he tipto hi wai cautious among the tree till he felt that he wa out of hear and straightwai broke into a keen run in the direct of the sandbar chapter xv a few minut later tom wa in the shoal water of the bar wade toward the illinoi shore befor the depth reach hi middl he wa halfwai over the current would permit no more wade now so he struck out confid to swim the remain hundr yard he swam quarter upstream but still wa swept downward rather faster than he had expect howev he reach the shore final and drift along till he found a low place and drew himself out he put hi hand on hi jacket pocket found hi piec of bark safe and then struck through the wood follow the shore with stream garment shortli befor ten o clock he came out into an open place opposit the villag and saw the ferryboat ly in the shadow of the tree and the high bank everyth wa quiet under the blink star he crept down the bank watch with all hi ey slip into the water swam three or four stroke and climb into the skiff that did yawl duti at the boat s stern he laid himself down under the thwart and wait pant present the crack bell tap and a voic gave the order to cast off a minut or two later the skiff s head wa stand high up against the boat s swell and the voyag wa begun tom felt happi in hi success for he knew it wa the boat s last trip for the night at the end of a long twelv or fifteen minut the wheel stop and tom slip overboard and swam ashor in the dusk land fifti yard downstream out of danger of possibl straggler he flew along unfrequ allei and shortli found himself at hi aunt s

than anybodi els he could hear mari cry and put in a kindli word for him from time to time he began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever befor still he wa suffici touch by hi aunt s grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joyand the theatric gorgeous of the thing appeal strongli to hi natur too but he resist and lai still he went on listen and gather by odd and end that it wa conjectur at first that the boi had got drown while take a swim then the small raft had been miss next certain boi said the miss lad had promis that the villag should hear someth soon the wisehead had put thi and that togeth and decid that the lad had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below present but toward noon the raft had been found lodg against the missouri shore some five or six mile below the villageand then hope perish thei must be drown els hunger would have driven them home by nightfal if not sooner it wa believ that the search for the bodi had been a fruitless effort mere becaus the drown must have occur in midchannel sinc the boi be good swimmer would otherwis have escap to shore thi wa wednesdai night if the bodi continu miss until sundai all hope would be given over and the funer would be preach on that morn tom shudder mr harper gave a sob goodnight and turn to go then with a mutual impuls the two bereav women flung themselv

and he linger consid hi face light with a happi solut of hi thought he put the bark hastili in hi pocket then he bent over and kiss the fade lip and straightwai made hi stealthi exit latch the door behind him he thread hi wai back to the ferri land found nobodi at larg there and walk boldli on board the boat for he knew she wa tenantless except that there wa a watchman who alwai turn in and slept like a graven imag he unti the skiff at the stern slip into it and wa soon row cautious upstream when he had pull a mile abov the villag he start quarter across and bent himself stoutli to hi work he hit the land on the other side neatli for thi wa a familiar bit of work to him he wa move to captur the skiff argu that it might be consid a ship and therefor legitim prei for a pirat but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revel so he step ashor and enter the wood he sat down and took a long rest tortur himself meanwhil to keep awak and then start warili
