mr sherlock holm who wa usual veri late in the morn save upon those not infrequ occas when he wa up all night wa seat at the breakfast tabl i stood upon the hearthrug and pick up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night befor it wa a fine thick piec of wood bulboushead of the sort which is known as a penang lawyer just under the head wa a broad silver band nearli an inch across to jame mortim mrc from hi friend of the cch wa engrav upon it with the date it wa just such a stick as the oldfashion famili practition us to carrydignifi solid and reassur well watson what do you make of it holm wa sit with hi back to me and i had given him no sign of my occup how did you know what i wa do i believ you have ey in the back of your head i have at least a wellpolish silverpl coffeepot in front of me said he but tell me watson what do you make of our visitor s stick sinc we have been so unfortun as to miss him and have no notion of hi errand thi accident souvenir becom of import let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examin of it i think said i follow as far as i could the method of my companion that dr mortim is a success elderli medic man wellesteem sinc those who know him give him thi mark of their appreci good said holm excel i think also that the probabl is in favour of hi be a countri practition who doe a great deal of hi visit on foot why so becaus thi stick though origin a veri handsom on ha been so knock about that i can hardli imagin a town practition carri it the thickiron ferrul is worn down so it is evid that he ha done a great amount of walk with it perfectli sound said holm and then again there is the friend of the cch i should guess that to be the someth hunt the local hunt to whose member he ha possibl given some surgic assist and which ha made him a small present in return realli watson you excel yourself said holm push back hi chair and light a cigarett i am bound to sai that in all the account which you have been so good as to give of my own small achiev you have habitu underr your own abil it mai be that you ar not yourself lumin but you ar a conductor of light some peopl without possess geniu have a remark power of stimul it i confess my dear fellow that i am veri much in your debt he had never said as much befor and i must admit that hi word gave me keen pleasur for i had often been piqu by hi indiffer to my admir and to the attempt which i had made to give public to hi method i wa proud too to think that i had so far master hi system as to appli it in a wai which earn hi approv he now took the stick from my hand and examin it for a few minut with hi nake ey then with an express of interest he laid down hi cigarett and carri the cane to the window he look over it again with a convex len interest though elementari said he as he return to hi favourit corner of the sette there ar certainli on or two indic upon the stick it give us the basi for sever deduct ha anyth escap me i ask with some selfimport i trust that there is noth of consequ which i have overlook i am afraid my dear watson that most of your conclus were erron when i said that you stimul me i meant to be frank that in note your fallaci i wa occasion guid toward the truth not that you ar entir wrong in thi instanc the man is certainli a countri practition and he walk a good deal then i wa right to that extent but that wa all no no my dear watson not allbi no mean all i would suggest for exampl that a present to a doctor is more like to come from a hospit than from a hunt and that when the initi cc ar place befor that hospit the word chare cross veri natur suggest themselv you mai be right the probabl li in that direct and if we take thi as a work hypothesi we have a fresh basi from which to start our construct of thi unknown visitor well then suppos that cch doe stand for chare cross hospit what further infer mai we draw do none suggest themselv you know my method appli them i can onli think of the obviou conclus that the man ha practis in town befor go to the countri i think that we might ventur a littl farther than thi look at it in thi light on what occas would it be most probabl that such a present would be made when would hi friend unit to give him a pledg of their good will obvious at the moment when dr mortim withdrew from the servic of the hospit in order to start a practic for himself we know there ha been a present we believ there ha been a chang from a town hospit to a countri practic is it then stretch our infer too far to sai that the present wa on the occas of the chang it certainli seem probabl now you will observ that he could not have been on the staff of the hospit sinc onli a man wellestablish in a london practic could hold such a posit and such a on would not drift into the countri what wa he then if he wa in the hospit and yet not on the staff he could onli have been a housesurgeon or a housephysicianlittl more than a senior student and he left five year agoth date is on the stick so your grave middleag famili practition vanish into thin air my dear watson and there emerg a young fellow under thirti amiabl unambiti absentmind and the possessor of a favourit dog which i should describ roughli as be larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff i laugh incredul as sherlock holm lean back in hi sette and blew littl waver ring of smoke up to the ceil as to the latter part i have no mean of check you said i but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particular about the man s ag and profession career from my small medic shelf i took down the medic directori and turn up the name there were sever mortim but onli on who could be our visitor i read hi record aloud mortim jame mrc grimpen dartmoor devon housesurgeon from to at chare cross

of psycholog march medic offic for the parish of grimpen thorslei and high barrow no mention of that local hunt watson said holm with a mischiev smile but a countri doctor as you veri astut observ i think that i am fairli justifi in my infer as to the adject i said if i rememb right amiabl unambiti and absentmind it is my experi that it is onli an amiabl man in thi world who receiv testimoni onli an unambiti on who abandon a london career for the countri and onli an absentmind on who leav hi stick and not hi visitingcard after wait an hour in your room and the dog ha been in the habit of carri thi stick behind hi master be a heavi stick the dog ha held it tightli by the middl and the mark of hi teeth ar veri plainli visibl the dog s jaw as shown in the space between these mark is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff it mai have beeny by jove it is a curlyhair spaniel he had risen and pace the room as he spoke now he halt in the recess of the window there wa such a ring of convict in hi voic that i glanc up in surpris my dear fellow how can you possibl be so sure of that for the veri simpl reason that i see the dog himself on our veri doorstep

it is on of sever indic which enabl me to fix the date i look over hi shoulder at the yellow paper and the fade script at the head wa written baskervil hall and below in larg scrawl figur it appear to be a statement of some sort ye it is a statement of a certain legend which run in the baskervil famili but i understand that it is someth more modern and practic upon which you wish to consult me most modern a most practic press matter which must be decid within twentyfour hour but the manuscript is short and is intim connect with the affair with your permiss i will read it to you holm lean back in hi chair place hi fingertip togeth and close hi ey with an air of resign dr mortim turn the manuscript to the light and read in a high crack voic the follow curiou oldworld narr of the origin of the hound of the baskervil there have been mani statement yet as i come in a direct line from hugo baskervil and as i had the stori from my father who also had it from hi i have set it down with all belief that it occur even as is here set forth and i would have you believ my son that the same justic which punish sin mai also most gracious forgiv it and that no ban is so heavi but that by prayer and repent it mai be remov learn then from thi stori not to fear the fruit of the past but rather to be circumspect in the futur that those foul passion wherebi our famili ha suffer so grievous mai not again be loos to our undo know then that in the time of the great rebellion the histori of which by the learn lord clarendon i most earnestli commend to your attent thi manor of baskervil wa held by hugo of that name nor can it be gainsaid that he wa a most wild profan and godless man thi in truth hi neighbour might have pardon see that saint have never flourish in those part but there wa in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made hi name a byword through the west it chanc that thi hugo came to love if inde so dark a passion mai be known under so bright a name the daughter of a yeoman who held land near the baskervil estat but the young maiden be discreet and of good reput would ever avoid him for she fear hi evil name so it came to pass that on michaelma thi hugo with five or six of hi idl and wick companion stole down upon the farm and carri off the maiden her father and brother be from home as he well knew when thei had brought her to the hall the maiden wa place in an upper chamber while hugo and hi friend sat down to a long carous as wa their nightli custom now the poor lass upstair wa like to have her wit turn at the sing and shout and terribl oath which came up to her from below for thei sai that the word us by hugo baskervil when he wa in wine were such as might blast the man who said them at last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunt the bravest or most activ man for by the aid of the growth of ivi which cover and still cover the south wall she came down from under the eav and so homeward across the moor there be three leagu betwixt the hall and her father s farm it chanc that some littl time later hugo left hi guest to carri food and drinkwith other wors thing perchanceto hi captiv and so found the cage empti and the bird escap then as it would seem he becam as on that hath a devil for rush down the stair into the dininghal he sprang upon the great tabl flagon and trencher fly befor him and he cri aloud befor all the compani that he would that veri night render hi bodi and soul to the power of evil if he might but overtak the wench and while the revel stood aghast at the furi of the man on more wick or it mai be more drunken than the rest cri out that thei should put the hound upon her whereat hugo ran from the hous cry to hi groom that thei should saddl hi mare and unkennel the pack and give the hound a kerchief of the maid s he swung them to the line and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor now for some space the revel stood agap unabl to understand all that had been done in such hast but anon their bemus wit awok to the natur of the deed which wa like to be done upon the moorland everyth wa now in an uproar some call for their pistol some for their hors and some for anoth flask of wine but at length some sens came back to their craze mind and the whole of them thirteen in number took hors and start in pursuit the moon shone clear abov them and thei rode swiftli abreast take that cours which the maid must need have taken if she were to reach her own home thei had gone a mile or two when thei pass on of the night shepherd upon the moorland and thei cri to him to know if he had seen the hunt and the man as the stori goe wa so craze with fear that he could scarc speak but at last he said that he had inde seen the unhappi maiden with the hound upon her track but i have seen more than that said he for hugo baskervil pass me upon hi black mare and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heel so the drunken squir curs the shepherd and rode onward but soon their skin turn cold for there came a gallop across the moor and the black mare dabbl with white froth went past with trail bridl and empti saddl then the revel rode close togeth for a great fear wa on them but thei still follow over the moor though each had he been alon would have been right glad to have turn hi hors s head ride slowli in thi fashion thei came at last upon the hound these though known for their valour and their breed were whimper in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal as we call it upon the moor some slink awai and some with start hackl and stare ey gaze down the narrow vallei befor them the compani had come to a halt more sober men as you mai guess than when thei start the most of them would by no mean advanc but three of them the boldest or it mai be the most drunken rode forward down the goyal now it open into a broad space in which stood two of those great stone still to be seen there which were set by certain forgotten peopl in the dai of old the moon wa shine bright upon the clear and there in the centr lai the unhappi maid where she had fallen dead of fear and of fatigu but it wa not the sight of her bodi nor yet wa it that of the bodi of hugo baskervil ly near her which rais the hair upon the head of these three daredevil royster but it wa that stand over hugo and pluck at hi throat there stood a foul thing a great black beast shape like a hound yet larger than ani hound that ever mortal ey ha rest upon and even as thei look the thing tore the throat out of hugo baskervil on which as it turn it blaze ey and drip jaw upon them the three shriek with fear and rode for dear life still scream across the moor on it is said di that veri night of what he had seen and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their dai such is the tale my son of the come of the hound which is said to have plagu the famili so sore ever sinc if i have set it down it is becaus that which is clearli known hath less terror than that which is but hint at and guess nor can it be deni that mani of the famili have been unhappi in their death which have been sudden bloodi and mysteri yet mai we shelter ourselv in the infinit good of provid which would not forev punish the innoc beyond that third or fourth gener which is threaten in holi writ to that provid my son i herebi commend you and i counsel you by wai of caution to forbear from cross the moor in those dark hour when the power of evil ar exalt thi from hugo baskervil to hi son rodger and john with instruct that thei sai noth thereof to their sister elizabeth when dr mortim had finish read thi singular narr he push hi spectacl up on hi forehead and stare across at mr sherlock holm the latter yawn and toss the end of hi cigarett into the fire well said he do you not find it interest to a collector of fairi tale dr mortim drew a fold newspap out of hi pocket now mr holm we will give you someth a littl more recent thi is the devon counti chronicl of mai th of thi year it is a short account of the fact elicit at the death of sir charl baskervil which occur a few dai befor that date my friend lean a littl forward and hi express becam intent our visitor readjust hi glass and began the recent sudden death of sir charl baskervil whose name ha been mention as the probabl liber candid for middevon at the next elect ha cast a gloom over the counti though sir charl had resid at baskervil hall for a compar short period hi amiabl of charact and extrem generos had won the affect and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him in these dai of nouveaux rich it is refresh to find a case where the scion of an old counti famili which ha fallen upon evil dai is abl to make hi own fortun and to bring it back with him to restor the fallen grandeur of hi line sir charl as is well known made larg sum of monei in south african specul more wise than those who go on until the wheel turn against them he realiz hi gain and return to england with them it is onli two year sinc he took up hi resid at baskervil hall and it is common talk how larg were those scheme of reconstruct and improv which have been interrupt by hi death be himself childless it wa hi openli express desir that the whole countrysid should within hi own lifetim profit by hi good fortun and mani will have person reason for bewail hi untim end hi gener donat to local and counti chariti have been frequent chronicl in these column the circumst connect with the death of sir charl cannot be said to have been entir clear up by the inquest but at least enough ha been done to dispos of those rumour to which local superstit ha given rise there is no reason whatev to suspect foul plai or to imagin that death could be from ani but natur caus sir charl wa a widow and a man who mai be said to have been in some wai of an eccentr habit of mind in spite of hi consider wealth he wa simpl in hi person tast and hi indoor servant at baskervil hall consist of a marri coupl name barrymor the husband act as butler and the wife as housekeep their evid corrobor by that of sever friend tend to show that sir charl s health ha for some time been impair and point especi to some affect of the heart manifest itself in chang of colour breathless and acut attack of nervou depress dr jame mortim the friend and medic attend of the deceas ha given evid to the same effect the fact of the case ar simpl sir charl baskervil wa in the habit everi night befor go to bed of walk down the famou yew allei of baskervil hall the evid of the barrymor show that thi had been hi custom on the fourth of mai sir charl had declar hi intent of start next dai for london and had order barrymor to prepar hi luggag that night he went out as usual for hi nocturn walk in the cours of which he wa in the habit of smoke a cigar he never return at twelv o clock barrymor find the hall door still open becam alarm and light a lantern went in search of hi master the dai had been wet and sir charl s footmark were easili trace down the allei halfwai down thi walk there is a gate which lead out on to the moor there were indic that sir charl had stood for some littl time here he then proceed down the allei and it wa at the far end of it that hi bodi wa discov on fact which ha not been explain is the statement of barrymor that hi master s footprint alter their charact from the time that he pass the moorgat and that he appear from thenc onward to have been walk upon hi toe on murphi a gipsi horsedeal wa on the moor at no great distanc at the time but he appear by hi own confess to have been the wors for drink he declar that he heard cri but is unabl to state from what direct thei came no sign of violenc were to be discov upon sir charl s person and though the doctor s evid point to an almost incred facial distortionso great that dr mortim refus at first to believ that it wa inde hi friend and patient who lai befor himit wa explain that that is a symptom which is not unusu in case of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaust thi explan wa born out by the postmortem examin which show longstand organ diseas and the coron s juri return a verdict in accord with the medic evid it is well that thi is so for it is obvious of the utmost import that sir charl s heir should settl at the hall and continu the good work which ha been so sadli interrupt had the prosaic find of the coron not final put an end to the romant stori which have been whisper in connect with the affair it might have been difficult to find a tenant for baskervil hall it is understood that the next of kin is mr henri baskervil if he be still aliv the son of sir charl baskervil s younger brother the young man when last heard of wa in america and inquiri ar be institut with a view to inform him of hi good fortun dr mortim refold hi paper and replac it in hi pocket those ar the public fact mr holm in connect with the death of sir charl baskervil i must thank you said sherlock holm for call my attent to a case which certainli present some featur of interest i had observ some newspap comment at the time but i wa exceedingli preoccupi by that littl affair of the vatican cameo and in my anxieti to oblig the pope i lost touch with sever interest english case thi articl you sai contain all the public fact it doe then let me have the privat on he lean back put hi fingertip togeth and assum hi most impass and judici express in do so said dr mortim who had begun to show sign of some strong emot i am tell that which i have not confid to anyon my motiv for withhold it from the coron s inquiri is that a man of scienc shrink from place himself in the public posit of seem to indors a popular superstit i had the further motiv that baskervil hall as the paper sai would certainli remain unten if anyth were done to increas it alreadi rather grim reput for both these reason i thought that i wa justifi in tell rather less than i knew sinc no practic good could result from it but with you there is no reason why i should not be perfectli frank the moor is veri spars inhabit and those who live near each other ar thrown veri much togeth for thi reason i saw a good deal of sir charl baskervil with the except of mr frankland of lafter hall and mr stapleton the naturalist there ar no other men of educ within mani mile sir charl wa a retir man but the chanc of hi ill brought us togeth and a commun of interest in scienc kept us so he had brought back much scientif inform from south africa and mani a charm even we have spent togeth discuss the compar anatomi of the bushman and the hottentot within the last few month it becam increasingli plain to me that sir charl s nervou system wa strain to the break point he had taken thi legend which i have read you exceedingli to heartso much so that although he would walk in hi own ground noth would induc him to go out upon the moor at night incred as it mai appear to you mr holm he wa honestli convinc that a dread fate overhung hi famili and certainli the record which he wa abl to give of hi ancestor were not encourag the idea of some ghastli presenc constantli haunt him and on more than on occas he ha ask me whether i had on my medic journei at night ever seen ani strang creatur or heard the bai of a hound the latter question he put to me sever time and alwai with a voic which vibrat with excit i can well rememb drive up to hi hous in the even some three week befor the fatal event he chanc to be at hi hall door i had descend from my gig and wa stand in front of him when i saw hi ey fix themselv over my shoulder and stare past me with an express of the most dread horror i whisk round and had just time to catch a glimps of someth which i took to be a larg black calf pass at the head of the drive so excit and alarm wa he that i wa compel to go down to the spot where the anim had been and look around for it it wa gone howev and the incid appear to make the worst impress upon hi mind i stai with him all the even and it wa on that occas to explain the emot which he had shown that he confid to my keep that narr which i read to you when first i came i mention thi small episod becaus it assum some import in view of the tragedi which follow but i wa convinc at the time that the matter wa entir trivial and that hi excit had no justif it wa at my advic that sir charl wa about to go to london hi heart wa i knew affect and the constant anxieti in which he live howev chimer the caus of it might be wa evid have a seriou effect upon hi health i thought that a few month among the distract of town would send him back a new man mr stapleton a mutual friend who wa much concern at hi state of health wa of the same opinion at the last instant came thi terribl catastroph on the night of sir charl s death barrymor the butler who made the discoveri sent perkin the groom on horseback to me and as i wa sit up late i wa abl to reach baskervil hall within an hour of the event i check and corrobor all the fact which were mention at the inquest i follow the footstep down the yew allei i saw the spot at the moorgat where he seem to have wait i remark the chang in the shape of the print after that point i note that there were no other footstep save those of barrymor on the soft gravel and final i carefulli examin the bodi which had not been touch until my arriv sir charl lai on hi face hi arm out hi finger dug into the ground and hi featur convuls with some strong emot to such an extent that i could hardli have sworn to hi ident there wa certainli no physic injuri of ani kind but on fals statement wa made by barrymor at the inquest he said that there were no trace upon the ground round the bodi he did not observ ani but i didsom littl distanc off but fresh and clear footprint footprint a man s or a woman s dr mortim look strang at us for an instant and hi voic sank almost to a whisper as he answer mr holm thei were the footprint of a gigant hound chapter the problem i confess at these word a shudder pass through me there wa a thrill in the doctor s voic which show that he wa himself deepli move by that which he told us holm lean forward in hi excit and hi ey had the hard dry glitter which shot from them when he wa keenli interest you saw thi as clearli as i see you and you said noth what wa the us how wa it that no on els saw it the mark were some twenti yard from the bodi and no on gave them a thought i don t suppos i should have done so had i not known thi legend there ar mani sheepdog on the moor no doubt but thi wa no sheepdog you sai it wa larg enorm but it had not approach the bodi no what sort of night wa it damp and raw but not actual rain no what is the allei like there ar two line of old yew hedg twelv feet high and impenetr the walk in the centr is about eight feet across is there anyth between the hedg and the walk ye there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side i understand that the yew hedg is penetr at on point by a gate ye the wicketg which lead on to the moor is there ani other open none so that to reach the yew allei on either ha to come down it from the hous or els to enter it by the moorgat there is an exit through a summerhous at the far end had sir charl reach thi no he lai about fifti yard from it now tell me dr mortimerand thi is importantth mark which you saw were on the path and not on the grass no mark could show on the grass were thei on the same side of the path as the moorgat ye thei were on the edg of the path on the same side as the moorgat you interest me exceedingli anoth point wa the wicketg close close and padlock how high wa it about four feet high then anyon could have got over it ye and what mark did you see by the wicketg none in particular good heaven did no on examin ye i examin myself and found noth it wa all veri confus sir charl had evid stood there for five or ten minut how do you know that becaus the ash had twice drop from hi cigar excel thi is a colleagu watson after our own heart but the mark he had left hi own mark all over that small patch of gravel i could discern no other sherlock holm struck hi hand against hi knee with an impati gestur if i had onli been there he cri it is evid a case of extraordinari interest and on which present immens opportun to the scientif expert that gravel page upon which i might have read so much ha been long er thi smudg by the rain and defac by the clog of curiou peasant oh dr mortim dr mortim to think that you should not have call me in you have inde much to answer for i could not call you in mr holm without disclos these fact to the world and i have alreadi given my reason for not wish to do so besid besid why do you hesit there is a realm in which the most acut and most experienc of detect is helpless you mean that the thing is supernatur i did not posit sai so no but you evid think it sinc the tragedi mr holm there have come to my ear sever incid which ar hard to reconcil with the settl order of natur for exampl i find that befor the terribl event occur sever peopl had seen a creatur upon the moor which correspond with thi baskervil demon and which could not possibl be ani anim known to scienc thei all agre that it wa a huge creatur lumin ghastli and spectral i have crossexamin these men on of them a hardhead countryman on a farrier and on a moorland farmer who all tell the same stori of thi dread apparit exactli correspond to the hellhound of the legend i assur you that there is a reign of terror in the district and that it is a hardi man who will cross the moor at night and you a train man of scienc believ it to be supernatur i do not know what to believ holm shrug hi shoulder i have hitherto confin my investig to thi world said he in a modest wai i have combat evil but to take on the father of evil himself would perhap be too ambiti a task yet you must admit that the footmark is materi the origin hound wa materi enough to tug a man s throat out and yet he wa diabol as well i see that you have quit gone over to the supernaturalist but now dr mortim tell me thi if you hold these view why have you come to consult me at all you tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investig sir charl s death and that you desir me to do it i did not sai that i desir you to do it then how can i assist you by advis me as to what i should do with sir henri baskervil who arriv at waterloo station dr mortim look at hi watch in exactli on hour and a quarter he be the heir ye on the death of sir charl we inquir for thi young gentleman and found that he had been farm in canada from the account which have reach us he is an excel fellow in everi wai i speak now not as a medic man but as a truste and executor of sir charl s will there is no other claimant i presum none the onli other kinsman whom we have been abl to trace wa rodger baskervil the youngest of three brother of whom poor sir charl wa the elder the second brother who di young is the father of thi lad henri the third rodger wa the black sheep of the famili he came of the old master baskervil strain and wa the veri imag thei tell me of the famili pictur of old hugo he made england too hot to hold him fled to central america and di there in of yellow fever henri is the last of the baskervil in on hour and five minut i meet him at waterloo station i have had a wire that he arriv at southampton thi morn now mr holm what would you advis me to do with him why should he not go to the home of hi father it seem natur doe it not and yet consid that everi baskervil who goe there meet with an evil fate i feel sure that if sir charl could have spoken with me befor hi death he would have warn me against bring thi the last of the old race and the heir to great wealth to that deadli place and yet it cannot be deni that the prosper of the whole poor bleak countrysid depend upon hi presenc all the good work which ha been done by sir charl will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the hall i fear lest i should be swai too much by my own obviou interest in the matter and that is why i bring the case befor you and ask for your advic holm consid for a littl time put into plain word the matter is thi said he in your opinion there is a diabol agenc which make dartmoor an unsaf abod for a baskervillethat is your opinion at least i might go the length of sai that there is some evid that thi mai be so exactli but sure if your supernatur theori be correct it could work the young man evil in london as easili as in devonshir a devil with mere local power like a parish vestri would be too inconceiv a thing you put the matter more flippantli mr holm than you would probabl do if you were brought into person contact with these thing your advic then as i understand it is that the young man will be as safe in devonshir as in london he come in fifti minut what would you recommend i recommend sir that you take a cab call off your spaniel who is scratch at my front door and proce to waterloo to meet sir henri baskervil and then and then you will sai noth to him at all until i have made up my mind about the matter how long will it take you to make up your mind twentyfour hour at ten o clock tomorrow dr mortim i will be much oblig to you if you will call upon me here and it will be of help to me in my plan for the futur if you will bring sir henri baskervil with you i will do so mr holm he scribbl the appoint on hi shirtcuff and hurri off in hi strang peer absentmind fashion holm stop him at the head of the stair onli on more question dr mortim you sai that befor sir charl baskervil s death sever peopl saw thi apparit upon the moor three peopl did did ani see it after i have not heard of ani thank you goodmorn holm return to hi seat with that quiet look of inward satisfact which meant that he had a congeni task befor him go out watson unless i can help you no my dear fellow it is at the hour of action that i turn to you for aid but thi is splendid realli uniqu from some point of view when you pass bradlei s would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco thank you it would be as well if you could make it conveni not to return befor even then i should be veri glad to compar impress as to thi most interest problem which ha been submit to us thi morn i knew that seclus and solitud were veri necessari for my friend in those hour of intens mental concentr dure which he weigh everi particl of evid construct altern theori balanc on against the other and made up hi mind as to which point were essenti and which immateri i therefor spent the dai at my club and did not return to baker street until even it wa nearli nine o clock when i found myself in the sittingroom onc more my first impress as i open the door wa that a fire had broken out for the room wa so fill with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the tabl wa blur by it as i enter howev my fear were set at rest for it wa the acrid fume of strong coars tobacco which took me by the throat and set me cough through the haze i had a vagu vision of holm in hi dressinggown coil up in an armchair with hi black clai pipe between hi lip sever roll of paper lai around him caught cold watson said he no it s thi poison atmospher i suppos it is pretti thick now that you mention it thick it is intoler open the window then you have been at your club all dai i perceiv my dear holm am i right certainli but how he laugh at my bewild express there is a delight fresh about you watson which make it a pleasur to exercis ani small power which i possess at your expens a gentleman goe forth on a showeri and miri dai he return immacul in the even with the gloss still on hi hat and hi boot he ha been a fixtur therefor all dai he is not a man with intim friend where then could he have been is it not obviou well it is rather obviou the world is full of obviou thing which nobodi by ani chanc ever observ where do you think that i have been a fixtur also on the contrari i have been to devonshir in spirit exactli my bodi ha remain in thi armchair and ha i regret to observ consum in my absenc two larg pot of coffe and an incred amount of tobacco after you left i sent down to stamford s for the ordnanc map of thi portion of the moor and my spirit ha hover over it all dai i flatter myself that i could find my wai about a largescal map i presum veri larg he unrol on section and held it over hi knee here you have the particular district which concern us that is baskervil hall in the middl with a wood round it exactli i fanci the yew allei though not mark under that name must stretch along thi line with the moor as you perceiv upon the right of it thi small clump of build here is the hamlet of grimpen where our friend dr mortim ha hi headquart within a radiu of five mile there ar as you see onli a veri few scatter dwell here is lafter hall which wa mention in the narr there is a hous indic here which mai be the resid of the naturaliststapleton if i rememb right wa hi name here ar two moorland farmhous high tor and foulmir then fourteen mile awai the great convict prison of princetown between and around these scatter point extend the desol lifeless moor thi then is the stage upon which tragedi ha been plai and upon which we mai help to plai it again it must be a wild place ye the set is a worthi on if the devil did desir to have a hand in the affair of men then you ar yourself inclin to the supernatur explan the devil s agent mai be of flesh and blood mai thei not there ar two question wait for us at the outset the on is whether ani crime ha been commit at all the second is what is the crime and how wa it commit of cours if dr mortim s surmis should be correct and we ar deal with forc outsid the ordinari law of natur there is an end of our investig but we ar bound to exhaust all other hypothes befor fall back upon thi on i think we ll shut that window again if you don t mind it is a singular thing but i find that a concentr atmospher help a concentr of thought i have not push it to the length of get into a box to think but that is the logic outcom of my convict have you turn the case over in your mind ye i have thought a good deal of it in the cours of the dai what do you make of it it is veri bewild it ha certainli a charact of it own there ar point of distinct about it that chang in the footprint for exampl what do you make of that mortim said that the man had walk on tipto down that portion of the allei he onli repeat what some fool had said at the inquest why should a man walk on tipto down the allei what then he wa run watsonrun desper run for hi life run until he burst hi heartand fell dead upon hi face run from what there li our problem there ar indic that the man wa craze with fear befor ever he began to run how can you sai that i am presum that the caus of hi fear came to him across the moor if that were so and it seem most probabl onli a man who had lost hi wit would have run from the hous instead of toward it if the gipsi s evid mai be taken as true he ran with cri for help in the direct where help wa least like to be then again whom wa he wait for that night and why wa he wait for him in the yew allei rather than in hi own hous you think that he wa wait for someon the man wa elderli and infirm we can understand hi take an even stroll but the ground wa damp and the night inclement is it natur that he should stand for five or ten minut as dr mortim with more practic sens than i should have given him credit for deduc from the cigar ash but he went out everi even i think it unlik that he wait at the moorgat everi even on the contrari the evid is that he avoid the moor that night he wait there it wa the night befor he made hi departur for london the thing take shape watson it becom coher might i ask you to hand me my violin and we will postpon all further thought upon thi busi until we have had the advantag of meet dr mortim and sir henri baskervil in the morn chapter sir henri baskervil our breakfast tabl wa clear earli and holm wait in hi dressinggown for the promis interview our client were punctual to their appoint for the clock had just struck ten when dr mortim wa shown up follow by the young baronet the latter wa a small alert darkei man about thirti year of ag veri sturdili built with thick black eyebrow and a strong pugnaci face he wore a ruddytint tweed suit and had the weatherbeaten appear of on who ha spent most of hi time in the open air and yet there wa someth in hi steadi ey and the quiet assur of hi bear which indic the gentleman thi is sir henri baskervil said dr mortim why ye said he and the strang thing is mr sherlock holm that if my friend here had not propos come round to you thi morn i should have come on my own account i understand that you think out littl puzzl and i ve had on thi morn which want more think out than i am abl to give it prai take a seat sir henri do i understand you to sai that you have yourself had some remark experi sinc you arriv in london noth of much import mr holm onli a joke as like as not it wa thi letter if you can call it a letter which reach me thi morn he laid an envelop upon the tabl and we all bent over it it wa of common qualiti grayish in colour the address sir henri baskervil northumberland hotel wa print in rough charact the postmark chare cross and the date of post the preced even who knew that you were go to the northumberland hotel ask holm glanc keenli across at our visitor no on could have known we onli decid after i met dr mortim but dr mortim wa no doubt alreadi stop there no i had been stai with a friend said the doctor there wa no possibl indic that we intend to go to thi hotel hum someon seem to be veri deepli interest in your movement out of the envelop he took a halfsheet of foolscap paper fold into four thi he open and spread flat upon the tabl across the middl of it a singl sentenc had been form by the expedi of past print word upon it it ran as you valu your life or your reason keep awai from the moor the word moor onli wa print in ink now said sir henri baskervil perhap you will tell me mr holm what in thunder is the mean of that and who it is that take so much interest in my affair what do you make of it dr mortim you must allow that there is noth supernatur about thi at ani rate no sir but it might veri well come from someon who wa convinc that the busi is supernatur what busi ask sir henri sharpli it seem to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affair you shall share our knowledg befor you leav thi room sir henri i promis you that said sherlock holm we will confin ourselv for the present with your permiss to thi veri interest document which must have been put togeth and post yesterdai even have you yesterdai s time watson it is here in the corner might i troubl you for itth insid page pleas with the lead articl he glanc swiftli over it run hi ey up and down the column capit articl thi on free trade permit me to give you an extract from it you mai be cajol into imagin that your own special trade or your own industri will be encourag by a protect tariff but it stand to reason that such legisl must in the long run keep awai wealth from the countri diminish the valu of our import and lower the gener condit of life in thi island what do you think of that watson cri holm in high glee rub hi hand togeth with satisfact don t you think that is an admir sentiment dr mortim look at holm with an air of profession interest and sir henri baskervil turn a pair of puzzl dark ey upon me i don t know much about the tariff and thing of that kind said he but it seem to me we ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concern on the contrari i think we ar particularli hot upon the trail sir henri watson here know more about my method than you do but i fear that even he ha not quit grasp the signific of thi sentenc no i confess that i see no connect and yet my dear watson there is so veri close a connect that the on is extract out of the other you your your life reason valu keep awai from the don t you see now whenc these word have been taken by thunder you re right well if that isn t smart cri sir henri if ani possibl doubt remain it is settl by the fact that keep awai and from the ar cut out in on piec well nowso it is realli mr holm thi exce anyth which i could have imagin said dr mortim gaze at my friend in amaz i could understand anyon sai that the word were from a newspap but that you should name which and add that it came from the lead articl is realli on of the most remark thing which i have ever known how did you do it i presum doctor that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an esquimau most certainli but how becaus that is my special hobbi the differ ar obviou the supraorbit crest the facial angl the maxillari curv the but thi is my special hobbi and the differ ar equal obviou there is as much differ to my ey between the lead bourgeoi type of a time articl and the slovenli print of an even halfpenni paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau the detect of type is on of the most elementari branch of knowledg to the special expert in crime though i confess that onc when i wa veri young i confus the leed mercuri with the western morn new but a time leader is entir distinct and these word could have been taken from noth els as it wa done yesterdai the strong probabl wa that we should find the word in yesterdai s issu so far as i can follow you then mr holm said sir henri baskervil someon cut out thi messag with a scissor nailscissor said holm you can see that it wa a veri shortblad scissor sinc the cutter had to take two snip over keep awai that is so someon then cut out the messag with a pair of shortblad scissor past it with past gum said holm with gum on to the paper but i want to know why the word moor should have been written becaus he could not find it in print the other word were all simpl and might be found in ani issu but moor would be less common why of cours that would explain it have you read anyth els in thi messag mr holm there ar on or two indic and yet the utmost pain have been taken to remov all clue the address you observ is print in rough charact but the time is a paper which is seldom found in ani hand but those of the highli educ we mai take it therefor that the letter wa compos by an educ man who wish to pose as an uneduc on and hi effort to conceal hi own write suggest that that write might be known or come to be known by you again you will observ that the word ar not gum on in an accur line but that some ar much higher than other life for exampl is quit out of it proper place that mai point to careless or it mai point to agit and hurri upon the part of the cutter on the whole i inclin to the latter view sinc the matter wa evid import and it is unlik that the compos of such a letter would be careless if he were in a hurri it open up the interest question why he should be in a hurri sinc ani letter post up to earli morn would reach sir henri befor he would leav hi hotel did the compos fear an interruptionand from whom we ar come now rather into the region of guesswork said dr mortim sai rather into the region where we balanc probabl and choos the most like it is the scientif us of the imagin but we have alwai some materi basi on which to start our specul now you would call it a guess no doubt but i am almost certain that thi address ha been written in a hotel how in the world can you sai that if you examin it carefulli you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer troubl the pen ha splutter twice in a singl word and ha run dry three time in a short address show that there wa veri littl ink in the bottl now a privat pen or inkbottl is seldom allow to be in such a state and the combin of the two must be quit rare but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen where it is rare to get anyth els ye i have veri littl hesit in sai that could we examin the wastepap basket of the hotel around chare cross until we found the remain of the mutil time leader we could lai our hand straight upon the person who sent thi singular messag halloa halloa what s thi he wa carefulli examin the foolscap upon which the word were past hold it onli an inch or two from hi ey well noth said he throw it down it is a blank halfsheet of paper without even a watermark upon it i think we have drawn as much as we can from thi curiou letter and now sir henri ha anyth els of interest happen to you sinc you have been in london why no mr holm i think not you have not observ anyon follow or watch you i seem to have walk right into the thick of a dime novel said our visitor why in thunder should anyon follow or watch me we ar come to that you have noth els to report to us befor we go into thi matter well it depend upon what you think worth report i think anyth out of the ordinari routin of life well worth report sir henri smile i don t know much of british life yet for i have spent nearli all my time in the state and in canada but i hope that to lose on of your boot is not part of the ordinari routin of life over here you have lost on of your boot my dear sir cri dr mortim it is onli mislaid you will find it when you return to the hotel what is the us of troubl mr holm with trifl of thi kind well he ask me for anyth outsid the ordinari routin exactli said holm howev foolish the incid mai seem you have lost on of your boot you sai well mislaid it anyhow i put them both outsid my door last night and there wa onli on in the morn i could get no sens out of the chap who clean them the worst of it is that i onli bought the pair last night in the strand and i have never had them on if you have never worn them why did you put them out to be clean thei were tan boot and had never been varnish that wa why i put them out then i understand that on your arriv in london yesterdai you went out at onc and bought a pair of boot i did a good deal of shop dr mortim here went round with me you see if i am to be squir down there i must dress the part and it mai be that i have got a littl careless in my wai out west among other thing i bought these brown bootsgav six dollar for themand had on stolen befor ever i had them on my feet it seem a singularli useless thing to steal said sherlock holm i confess that i share dr mortim s belief that it will not be long befor the miss boot is found and now gentlemen said the baronet with decis it seem to me that i have spoken quit enough about the littl that i know it is time that you kept your promis and gave me a full account of what we ar all drive at your request is a veri reason on holm answer dr mortim i think you could not do better than to tell your stori as you told it to us thu encourag our scientif friend drew hi paper from hi pocket and present the whole case as he had done upon the morn befor sir henri baskervil listen with the deepest attent and with an occasion exclam of surpris well i seem to have come into an inherit with a vengeanc said he when the long narr wa finish of cours i ve heard of the hound ever sinc i wa in the nurseri it s the pet stori of the famili though i never thought of take it serious befor but as to my uncl s deathwel it all seem boil up in my head and i can t get it clear yet you don t seem quit to have made up your mind whether it s a case for a policeman or a clergyman precis and now there s thi affair of the letter to me at the hotel i suppos that fit into it place it seem to show that someon know more than we do about what goe on upon the moor said dr mortim and also said holm that someon is not illdispos toward you sinc thei warn you of danger or it mai be that thei wish for their own purpos to scare me awai well of cours that is possibl also i am veri much indebt to you dr mortim for introduc me to a problem which present sever interest altern but the practic point which we now have to decid sir henri is whether it is or is not advis for you to go to baskervil hall why should i not go there seem to be danger do you mean danger from thi famili fiend or do you mean danger from human be well that is what we have to find out whichev it is my answer is fix there is no devil in hell mr holm and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from go to the home of my own peopl and you mai take that to be my final answer hi dark brow knit and hi face flush to a duski red as he spoke it wa evid that the fieri temper of the baskervil wa not extinct in thi their last repres meanwhil said he i have hardli had time to think over all that you have told me it s a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decid at on sit i should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind now look here mr holm it s halfpast eleven now and i am go back right awai to my hotel suppos you and your friend dr watson come round and lunch with us at two i ll be abl to tell you more clearli then how thi thing strike me is that conveni to you watson perfectli then you mai expect us shall i have a cab call i d prefer to walk for thi affair ha flurri me rather i ll join you in a walk with pleasur said hi companion then we meet again at two o clock au revoir and goodmorn we heard the step of our visitor descend the stair and the bang of the front door in an instant holm had chang from the languid dreamer to the man of action your hat and boot watson quick not a moment to lose he rush into hi room in hi dressinggown and wa back again in a few second in a frockcoat we hurri togeth down the stair and into the street dr mortim and baskervil were still visibl about two hundr yard ahead of us in the direct of oxford street shall i run on and stop them not for the world my dear watson i am perfectli satisfi with your compani if you will toler mine our friend ar wise for it is certainli a veri fine morn for a walk he quicken hi pace until we had decreas the distanc which divid us by about half then still keep a hundr yard behind we follow into oxford street and so down regent street onc our friend stop and stare into a shop window upon which holm did the same an instant afterward he gave a littl cry of satisfact and follow the direct of hi eager ey i saw that a hansom cab with a man insid which had halt on the other side of the street wa now proceed slowli onward again there s our man watson come along we ll have a good look at him if we can do no more at that instant i wa awar of a bushi black beard and a pair of pierc ey turn upon us through the side window of the cab instantli the trapdoor at the top flew up someth wa scream to the driver and the cab flew madli off down regent street holm look eagerli round for anoth but no empti on wa in sight then he dash in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic but the start wa too great and alreadi the cab wa out of sight there now said holm bitterli as he emerg pant and white with vexat from the tide of vehicl wa ever such bad luck and such bad manag too watson watson if you ar an honest man you will record thi also and set it against my success who wa the man i have not an idea a spy well it wa evid from what we have heard that baskervil ha been veri close shadow by someon sinc he ha been in town how els could it be known so quickli that it wa the northumberland hotel which he had chosen if thei had follow him the first dai i argu that thei would follow him also the second you mai have observ that i twice stroll over to the window while dr mortim wa read hi legend ye i rememb i wa look out for loiter in the street but i saw none we ar deal with a clever man watson thi matter cut veri deep and though i have not final made up my mind whether it is a benevol or a malevol agenc which is in touch with us i am consciou alwai of power and design when our friend left i at onc follow them in the hope of mark down their invis attend so wili wa he that he had not trust himself upon foot but he had avail himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escap their notic hi method had the addit advantag that if thei were to take a cab he wa all readi to follow them it ha howev on obviou disadvantag it put him in the power of the cabman exactli what a piti we did not get the number my dear watson clumsi as i have been you sure do not serious imagin that i neglect to get the number no is our man but that is no us to us for the moment i fail to see how you could have done more on observ the cab i should have instantli turn and walk in the other direct i should then at my leisur have hire a second cab and follow the first at a respect distanc or better still have driven to the northumberland hotel and wait there when our unknown had follow baskervil home we should have had the opportun of plai hi own game upon himself and see where he made for as it is by an indiscreet eager which wa taken advantag of with extraordinari quick and energi by our oppon we have betrai ourselv and lost our man we had been saunter slowli down regent street dure thi convers and dr mortim with hi companion had long vanish in front of us there is no object in our follow them said holm the shadow ha depart and will not return we must see what further card we have in our hand and plai them with decis could you swear to that man s face within the cab i could swear onli to the beard and so could ifrom which i gather that in all probabl it wa a fals on a clever man upon so delic an errand ha no us for a beard save to conceal hi featur come in here watson he turn into on of the district messeng offic where he wa warmli greet by the manag ah wilson i see you have not forgotten the littl case in which i had the good fortun to help you no sir inde i have not

avoid the moor in those hour of dark when the power of evil ar exalt i look back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the tall auster figur of holm stand motionless and gaze after us the journei wa a swift and pleasant on and i spent it in make the more intim acquaint of my two companion and in plai with dr mortim s spaniel in a veri few hour the brown earth had becom ruddi the brick had chang to granit and red cow graze in wellhedg field where the lush grass and more luxuri veget spoke of a richer if a damper climat young baskervil stare eagerli out of the window and cri aloud with delight as he recogn the familiar featur of the devon sceneri i ve been over a good part of the world sinc i left it dr watson said he but i have never seen a place to compar with it i never saw a devonshir man who did not swear by hi counti i remark it depend upon the breed of men quit as much as on the counti said dr mortim a glanc at our friend here reveal the round head of the celt which carri insid it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attach poor sir charl s head wa of a veri rare type half gaelic half ivernian in it characterist but you were veri young when you last saw baskervil hall were you not i wa a boi in my teen at the time of my father s death and had never seen the hall for he live in a littl cottag on the south coast thenc i went straight to a friend in america i tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr watson and i m as keen as possibl to see the moor ar you then your wish is easili grant for there is your first sight of the moor said dr mortim point out of the carriag window over the green squar of the field and the low curv of a wood there rose in the distanc a grai melancholi hill with a strang jag summit dim and vagu in the distanc like some fantast landscap in a dream baskervil sat for a long time hi ey fix upon it and i read upon hi eager face how much it meant to him thi first sight of that strang spot where the men of hi blood had held swai so long and left their mark so deep there he sat with hi tweed suit and hi american accent in the corner of a prosaic railwaycarriag and yet as i look at hi dark and express face i felt more than ever how true a descend he wa of that long line of highblood fieri and master men there were pride valour and strength in hi thick brow hi sensit nostril and hi larg hazel ey if on that forbid moor a difficult and danger quest should lie befor us thi wa at least a comrad for whom on might ventur to take a risk with the certainti that he would brave share it the train pull up at a small waysid station and we all descend outsid beyond the low white fenc a wagonett with a pair of cob wa wait our come wa evid a great event for stationmast and porter cluster round us to carri out our luggag it wa a sweet simpl countri spot but i wa surpris to observ that by the gate there stood two soldierli men in dark uniform who lean upon their short rifl and glanc keenli at us as we pass the coachman a hardfac gnarl littl fellow salut sir henri baskervil and in a few minut we were fly swiftli down the broad white road roll pastur land curv upward on either side of us and old gabl hous peep out from amid the thick green foliag but behind the peac and sunlit countrysid there rose ever dark against the even sky the long gloomi curv of the moor broken by the jag and sinist hill the wagonett swung round into a side road and we curv upward through deep lane worn by centuri of wheel high bank on either side heavi with drip moss and fleshi hart stongu fern bronz bracken and mottl brambl gleam in the light of the sink sun still steadili rise we pass over a narrow granit bridg and skirt a noisi stream which gush swiftli down foam and roar amid the grai boulder both road and stream wound up through a vallei dens with scrub oak and fir at everi turn baskervil gave an exclam of delight look eagerli about him and ask countless question to hi ey all seem beauti but to me a ting of melancholi lai upon the countrysid which bore so clearli the mark of the wane year yellow leav carpet the lane and flutter down upon us as we pass the rattl of our wheel di awai as we drove through drift of rot vegetationsad gift as it seem to me for natur to throw befor the carriag of the return heir of the baskervil halloa cri dr mortim what is thi a steep curv of heathclad land an outli spur of the moor lai in front of us on the summit hard and clear like an equestrian statu upon it pedest wa a mount soldier dark and stern hi rifl pois readi over hi forearm he wa watch the road along which we travel what is thi perkin ask dr mortim our driver half turn in hi seat there s a convict escap from princetown sir he s been out three dai now and the warder watch everi road and everi station but thei ve had no sight of him yet the farmer about here don t like it sir and that s a fact well i understand that thei get five pound if thei can give inform ye sir but the chanc of five pound is but a poor thing compar to the chanc of have your throat cut you see it isn t like ani ordinari convict thi is a man that would stick at noth who is he then it is selden the not hill murder i rememb the case well for it wa on in which holm had taken an interest on account of the peculiar feroc of the crime and the wanton brutal which had mark all the action of the assassin the commut of hi death sentenc had been due to some doubt as to hi complet saniti so atroci wa hi conduct our wagonett had top a rise and in front of us rose the huge expans of the moor mottl with gnarl and craggi cairn and tor a cold wind swept down from it and set us shiver somewher there on that desol plain wa lurk thi fiendish man hide in a burrow like a wild beast hi heart full of malign against the whole race which had cast him out it need but thi to complet the grim suggest of the barren wast the chill wind and the darkl sky even baskervil fell silent and pull hi overcoat more close around him we had left the fertil countri behind and beneath us we look back on it now the slant rai of a low sun turn the stream to thread of gold and glow on the red earth new turn by the plough and the broad tangl of the woodland the road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and oliv slope sprinkl with giant boulder now and then we pass a moorland cottag wall and roof with stone with no creeper to break it harsh outlin suddenli we look down into a cuplik depress patch with stunt oak and fir which had been twist and bent by the furi of year of storm two high narrow tower rose over the tree the driver point with hi whip baskervil hall said he it master had risen and wa stare with flush cheek and shine ey a few minut later we had reach the lodgeg a maze of fantast traceri in wrought iron with weatherbitten pillar on either side blotch with lichen and surmount by the boar head of the baskervil the lodg wa a ruin of black granit and bare rib of rafter but face it wa a new build half construct the first fruit of sir charl s south african gold through the gatewai we pass into the avenu where the wheel were again hush amid the leav and the old tree shot their branch in a sombr tunnel over our head baskervil shudder as he look up the long dark drive to where the hous glimmer like a ghost at the farther end wa it here he ask in a low voic no no the yew allei is on the other side the young heir glanc round with a gloomi face it s no wonder my uncl felt as if troubl were come on him in such a place as thi said he it s enough to scare ani man i ll have a row of electr lamp up here insid of six month and you won t know it again with a thousand candlepow swan and edison right here in front of the hall door the avenu open into a broad expans of turf and the hous lai befor us in the fade light i could see that the centr wa a heavi block of build from which a porch project the whole front wa drape in ivi with a patch clip bare here and there where a window or a coat of arm broke through the dark veil from thi central block rose the twin tower ancient crenel and pierc with mani loophol to right and left of the turret were more modern wing of black granit a dull light shone through heavi mullion window and from the high chimnei which rose from the steep highangl roof there sprang a singl black column of smoke welcom sir henri welcom to baskervil hall a tall man had step from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonett the figur of a woman wa silhouet against the yellow light of the hall she came out and help the man to hand down our bag you don t mind my drive straight home sir henri said dr mortim my wife is expect me sure you will stai and have some dinner no i must go i shall probabl find some work await me i would stai to show you over the hous but barrymor will be a better guid than i goodby and never hesit night or dai to send for me if i can be of servic the wheel di awai down the drive while sir henri and i turn into the hall and the door clang heavili behind us it wa a fine apart in which we found ourselv larg lofti and heavili rafter with huge baulk of ageblacken oak in the great oldfashion fireplac behind the high iron dog a logfir crackl and snap sir henri and i held out our hand to it for we were numb from our long drive then we gaze round us at the high thin window of old stain glass the oak panel the stag head the coat of arm upon the wall all dim and sombr in the subdu light of the central lamp it s just as i imagin it said sir henri is it not the veri pictur of an old famili home to think that thi should be the same hall in which for five hundr year my peopl have live it strike me solemn to think of it i saw hi dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gaze about him the light beat upon him where he stood but long shadow trail down the wall and hung like a black canopi abov him barrymor had return from take our luggag to our room he stood in front of us now with the subdu manner of a welltrain servant he wa a remarkablelook man tall handsom with a squar black beard and pale distinguish featur would you wish dinner to be serv at onc sir is it readi in a veri few minut sir you will find hot water in your room my wife and i will be happi sir henri to stai with you until you have made your fresh arrang but you will understand that under the new condit thi hous will requir a consider staff what new condit i onli meant sir that sir charl led a veri retir life and we were abl to look after hi want you would natur wish to have more compani and so you will need chang in your household do you mean that your wife and you wish to leav onli when it is quit conveni to you sir but your famili have been with us for sever gener have thei not i should be sorri to begin my life here by break an old famili connect i seem to discern some sign of emot upon the butler s white face i feel that also sir and so doe my wife but to tell the truth sir we were both veri much attach to sir charl and hi death gave us a shock and made these surround veri pain to us i fear that we shall never again be easi in our mind at baskervil hall but what do you intend to do i have no doubt sir that we shall succe in establish ourselv in some busi sir charl s generos ha given us the mean to do so and now sir perhap i had best show you to your room a squar balustrad galleri ran round the top of the old hall approach by a doubl stair from thi central point two long corridor extend the whole length of the build from which all the bedroom open my own wa in the same wing as baskervil s and almost next door to it these room appear to be much more modern than the central part of the hous and the bright paper and numer candl did someth to remov the sombr impress which our arriv had left upon my mind but the diningroom which open out of the hall wa a place of shadow and gloom it wa a long chamber with a step separ the dai where the famili sat from the lower portion reserv for their depend at on end a minstrel s galleri overlook it black beam shot across abov our head with a smokedarken ceil beyond them with row of flare torch to light it up and the colour and rude hilar of an oldtim banquet it might have soften but now when two blackcloth gentlemen sat in the littl circl of light thrown by a shade lamp on s voic becam hush and on s spirit subdu a dim line of ancestor in everi varieti of dress from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regenc stare down upon us and daunt us by their silent compani we talk littl and i for on wa glad when the meal wa over and we were abl to retir into the modern billiardroom and smoke a cigarett my word it isn t a veri cheer place said sir henri i suppos on can tone down to it but i feel a bit out of the pictur at present i don t wonder that my uncl got a littl jumpi if he live all alon in such a hous as thi howev if it suit you we will retir earli tonight and perhap thing mai seem more cheer in the morn i drew asid my curtain befor i went to bed and look out from my window it open upon the grassi space which lai in front of the hall door beyond two cops of tree moan and swung in a rise wind a half moon broke through the rift of race cloud in it cold light i saw beyond the tree a broken fring of rock and the long low curv of the melancholi moor i close the curtain feel that my last impress wa in keep with the rest and yet it wa not quit the last i found myself weari and yet wake toss restlessli from side to side seek for the sleep which would not come far awai a chime clock struck out the quarter of the hour but otherwis a deathli silenc lai upon the old hous and then suddenli in the veri dead of the night there came a sound to my ear clear reson and unmistak it wa the sob of a woman the muffl strangl gasp of on who is torn by an uncontrol sorrow i sat up in bed and listen intent the nois could not have been far awai and wa certainli in the hous for half an hour i wait with everi nerv on the alert but there came no other sound save the chime clock and the rustl of the ivi on the wall chapter the stapleton of merripit hous the fresh beauti of the follow morn did someth to effac from our mind the grim and grai impress which had been left upon both of us by our first experi of baskervil hall as sir henri and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flood in through the high mullion window throw wateri patch of colour from the coat of arm which cover them the dark panel glow like bronz in the golden rai and it wa hard to realiz that thi wa inde the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our soul upon the even befor i guess it is ourselv and not the hous that we have to blame said the baronet we were tire with our journei and chill by our drive so we took a grai view of the place now we ar fresh and well so it is all cheer onc more and yet it wa not entir a question of imagin i answer did you for exampl happen to hear someon a woman i think sob in the night that is curiou for i did when i wa half asleep fanci that i heard someth of the sort i wait quit a time but there wa no more of it so i conclud that it wa all a dream i heard it distinctli and i am sure that it wa realli the sob of a woman we must ask about thi right awai he rang the bell and ask barrymor whether he could account for our experi it seem to me that the pallid featur of the butler turn a shade paler still as he listen to hi master s question there ar onli two women in the hous sir henri he answer on is the scullerymaid who sleep in the other wing the other is my wife and i can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her and yet he li as he said it for it chanc that after breakfast i met mr barrymor in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face she wa a larg impass heavyfeatur woman with a stern set express of mouth but her telltal ey were red and glanc at me from between swollen lid it wa she then who wept in the night and if she did so her husband must know it yet he had taken the obviou risk of discoveri in declar that it wa not so why had he done thi and why did she weep so bitterli alreadi round thi palefac handsom blackbeard man there wa gather an atmospher of mysteri and of gloom it wa he who had been the first to discov the bodi of sir charl and we had onli hi word for all the circumst which led up to the old man s death wa it possibl that it wa barrymor after all whom we had seen in the cab in regent street the beard might well have been the same the cabman had describ a somewhat shorter man but such an impress might easili have been erron how could i settl the point forev obvious the first thing to do wa to see the grimpen postmast and find whether the test telegram had realli been place in barrymor s own hand be the answer what it might i should at least have someth to report to sherlock holm sir henri had numer paper to examin after breakfast so that the time wa propiti for my excurs it wa a pleasant walk of four mile along the edg of the moor lead me at last to a small grai hamlet in which two larger build which prove to be the inn and the hous of dr mortim stood high abov the rest the postmast who wa also the villag grocer had a clear recollect of the telegram certainli sir said he i had the telegram deliv to mr barrymor exactli as direct who deliv it my boi here jame you deliv that telegram to mr barrymor at the hall last week did you not ye father i deliv it into hi own hand i ask well he wa up in the loft at the time so that i could not put it into hi own hand but i gave it into mr barrymor s hand and she promis to deliv it at onc did you see mr barrymor no sir i tell you he wa in the loft if you didn t see him how do you know he wa in the loft well sure hi own wife ought to know where he is said the postmast testili didn t he get the telegram if there is ani mistak it is for mr barrymor himself to complain it seem hopeless to pursu the inquiri ani farther but it wa clear that in spite of holm s ruse we had no proof that barrymor had not been in london all the time suppos that it were sosuppos that the same man had been the last who had seen sir charl aliv and the first to dog the new heir when he return to england what then wa he the agent of other or had he some sinist design of hi own what interest could he have in persecut the baskervil famili i thought of the strang warn clip out of the lead articl of the time wa that hi work or wa it possibl the do of someon who wa bent upon counteract hi scheme the onli conceiv motiv wa that which had been suggest by sir henri that if the famili could be scare awai a comfort and perman home would be secur for the barrymor but sure such an explan as that would be quit inadequ to account for the deep and subtl scheme which seem to be weav an invis net round the young baronet holm himself had said that no more complex case had come to him in all the long seri of hi sensat investig i prai as i walk back along the grai lone road that my friend might soon be freed from hi preoccup and abl to come down to take thi heavi burden of respons from my shoulder suddenli my thought were interrupt by the sound of run feet behind me and by a voic which call me by name i turn expect to see dr mortim but to my surpris it wa a stranger who wa pursu me he wa a small slim cleanshaven primfac man flaxenhair and leanjaw between thirti and forti year of ag dress in a grai suit and wear a straw hat a tin box for botan specimen hung over hi shoulder and he carri a green butterflynet in on of hi hand you will i am sure excus my presumpt dr watson said he as he came pant up to where i stood here on the moor we ar home folk and do not wait for formal introduct you mai possibl have heard my name from our mutual friend mortim i am stapleton of merripit hous your net and box would have told me as much said i for i knew that mr stapleton wa a naturalist but how did you know me i have been call on mortim and he point you out to me from the window of hi surgeri as you pass as our road lai the same wai i thought that i would overtak you and introduc myself i trust that sir henri is none the wors for hi journei he is veri well thank you we were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir charl the new baronet might refus to live here it is ask much of a wealthi man to come down and buri himself in a place of thi kind but i need not tell you that it mean a veri great deal to the countrysid sir henri ha i suppos no superstiti fear in the matter i do not think that it is like of cours you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunt the famili i have heard it it is extraordinari how credul the peasant ar about here ani number of them ar readi to swear that thei have seen such a creatur upon the moor he spoke with a smile but i seem to read in hi ey that he took the matter more serious the stori took a great hold upon the imagin of sir charl and i have no doubt that it led to hi tragic end but how hi nerv were so work up that the appear of ani dog might have had a fatal effect upon hi diseas heart i fanci that he realli did see someth of the kind upon that last night in the yew allei i fear that some disast might occur for i wa veri fond of the old man and i knew that hi heart wa weak how did you know that my friend mortim told me you think then that some dog pursu sir charl and that he di of fright in consequ have you ani better explan i have not come to ani conclus ha mr sherlock holm the word took awai my breath for an instant but a glanc at the placid face and steadfast ey of my companion show that no surpris wa intend it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you dr watson said he the record of your detect have reach us here and you could not celebr him without be known yourself when mortim told me your name he could not deni your ident if you ar here then it follow that mr sherlock holm is interest himself in the matter and i am natur curiou to know what view he mai take i am afraid that i cannot answer that question mai i ask if he is go to honour us with a visit himself he cannot leav town at present he ha other case which engag hi attent what a piti he might throw some light on that which is so dark to us but as to your own research if there is ani possibl wai in which i can be of servic to you i trust that you will command me if i had ani indic of the natur of your suspicion or how you propos to investig the case i might perhap even now give you some aid or advic i assur you that i am simpli here upon a visit to my friend sir henri and that i need no help of ani kind excel said stapleton you ar perfectli right to be wari and discreet i am justli reprov for what i feel wa an unjustifi intrus and i promis you that i will not mention the matter again we had come to a point where a narrow grassi path struck off from the road and wound awai across the moor a steep bouldersprinkl hill lai upon the right which had in bygon dai been cut into a granit quarri the face which wa turn toward us form a dark cliff with fern and brambl grow in it nich from over a distant rise there float a grai plume of smoke a moder walk along thi moorpath bring us to merripit hous said he perhap you will spare an hour that i mai have the pleasur of introduc you to my sister my first thought wa that i should be by sir henri s side but then i rememb the pile of paper and bill with which hi studi tabl wa litter it wa certain that i could not help with those and holm had expressli said that i should studi the neighbour upon the moor i accept stapleton s invit and we turn togeth down the path it is a wonder place the moor said he look round over the undul down long green roller with crest of jag granit foam up into fantast surg you never tire of the moor you cannot think the wonder secret which it contain it is so vast and so barren and so mysteri you know it well then i have onli been here two year the resid would call me a newcom we came shortli after sir charl settl but my tast led me to explor everi part of the countri round and i should think that there ar few men who know it better than i do is it hard to know veri hard you see for exampl thi great plain to the north here with the queer hill break out of it do you observ anyth remark about that it would be a rare place for a gallop you would natur think so and the thought ha cost sever their live befor now you notic those bright green spot scatter thickli over it ye thei seem more fertil than the rest stapleton laugh that is the great grimpen mire said he a fals step yonder mean death to man or beast onli yesterdai i saw on of the moor poni wander into it he never came out i saw hi head for quit a long time crane out of the boghol but it suck him down at last even in dry season it is a danger to cross it but after these autumn rain it is an aw place and yet i can find my wai to the veri heart of it and return aliv by georg there is anoth of those miser poni someth brown wa roll and toss among the green sedg then a long agon writh neck shot upward and a dread cry echo over the moor it turn me cold with horror but my companion s nerv seem to be stronger than mine it s gone said he

chanc of your come back aliv it is onli by rememb certain complex landmark that i am abl to do it halloa i cri what is that a long low moan indescrib sad swept over the moor it fill the whole air and yet it wa imposs to sai whenc it came from a dull murmur it swell into a deep roar and then sank back into a melancholi throb murmur onc again stapleton look at me with a curiou express in hi face queer place the moor said he but what is it the peasant sai it is the hound of the baskervil call for it prei i ve heard it onc or twice befor but never quit so loud i look round with a chill of fear in my heart at the huge swell plain mottl with the green patch of rush noth stir over the vast expans save a pair of raven which croak loudli from a tor behind us you ar an educ man you don t believ such nonsens as that said i what do you think is the caus of so strang a sound bog make queer nois sometim it s the mud settl or the water rise or someth no no that wa a live voic well perhap it wa did you ever hear a bittern boom no i never did it s a veri rare birdpract extinctin england now but all thing ar possibl upon the moor ye i should not be surpris to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bittern it s the weirdest strangest thing that ever i heard in my life ye it s rather an uncanni place altogeth look at the hillsid yonder what do you make of those the

great trench in the opposit hill that is hi mark ye you will find some veri singular point about the moor dr watson oh excus me an instant it is sure cyclopid a small fly or moth had flutter across our path and in an instant stapleton wa rush with extraordinari energi and speed in pursuit of it to my dismai the creatur flew straight for the great mire and my acquaint never paus for an instant bound from tuft to tuft behind it hi green net wave in the air hi grai cloth and jerki zigzag irregular progress made him not unlik some huge moth himself i wa stand watch hi pursuit with a mixtur of admir for hi extraordinari activ and fear lest he should lose hi foot in the treacher mire when i heard the sound of step and turn round found a woman near me upon the path she had come from the direct in which the plume of smoke indic the posit of merripit hous but the dip of the moor had hid her until she wa quit close i could not doubt that thi wa the miss stapleton of whom i had been told sinc ladi of ani sort must be few upon the moor and i rememb that i had heard someon describ her as be a beauti the woman who approach me wa certainli that and of a most uncommon type there could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister for stapleton wa neutral tint with light hair and grai ey while she wa darker than ani brunett whom i have seen in englandslim eleg and tall she had a proud fine cut face so regular that it might have seem impass were it not for the sensit mouth and the beauti dark eager ey with her perfect figur and eleg dress she wa inde a strang apparit upon a lone moorland path her ey were on her brother as i turn and then she quicken her pace toward me i had rais my hat and wa about to make some explanatori remark when her own word turn all my thought into a new channel go back she said go straight back to london instantli i could onli stare at her in stupid surpris her ey blaze at me and she tap the ground impati with her foot why should i go back i ask i cannot explain she spoke in a low eager voic with a curiou lisp in her utter but for god s sake do what i ask you go back and never set foot upon the moor again but i have onli just come man man she cri can you not tell when a warn is for your own good go back to london start tonight get awai from thi place at all cost hush my brother is come not a word of what i have said would you mind get that orchid for me among the mare stail yonder we ar veri rich in orchid on the moor though of cours you ar rather late to see the beauti of the place stapleton had abandon the chase and came back to us breath hard and flush with hi exert halloa beryl said he and it seem to me that the tone of hi greet wa not altogeth a cordial on well jack you ar veri hot ye i wa chase a cyclopid he

common but hi friend my name is dr watson a flush of vexat pass over her express face we have been talk at cross purpos said she why you had not veri much time for talk her brother remark with the same question ey i talk as if dr watson were a resid instead of be mere a visitor said she it cannot much matter to him whether it is earli or late for the orchid but you will come on will you not and see merripit hous a short walk brought us to it a bleak moorland hous onc the farm of some grazier in the old prosper dai but now put into repair and turn into a modern dwell an orchard surround it but the tree as is usual upon the moor were stunt and nip and the effect of the whole place wa mean and melancholi we were admit by a strang wizen rustyco old manserv who seem in keep with the hous insid howev there were larg room furnish with an eleg in which i seem to recogn the tast of the ladi as i look from their window at the intermin granitefleck moor roll unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel at what could have brought thi highli educ man and thi beauti woman to live in such a place queer spot to choos is it not said he as if in answer to my thought and yet we manag to make ourselv fairli happi do we not beryl quit happi said she but there wa no ring of convict in her word i had a school said stapleton it wa in the north countri the work to a man of my tempera wa mechan and uninterest but the privileg of live with youth of help to mould those young mind and of impress them with on s own charact and ideal wa veri dear to me howev the fate were against us a seriou epidem broke out in the school and three of the boi di it never recov from the blow and much of my capit wa irretriev swallow up and yet if it were not for the loss of the charm companionship of the boi i could rejoic over my own misfortun for with my strong tast for botani and zoologi i find an unlimit field of work here and my sister is as devot to natur as i am all thi dr watson ha been brought upon your head by your express as you survei the moor out of our window it certainli did cross my mind that it might be a littl dullless for you perhap than for your sister no no i am never dull said she quickli we have book we have our studi and we have interest neighbour dr mortim is a most learn man in hi own line poor sir charl wa also an admir companion we knew him well and miss him more than i can tell do you think that i should intrud if i were to call thi afternoon and make the acquaint of sir henri i am sure that he would be delight then perhap you would mention that i propos to do so we mai in our humbl wai do someth to make thing more easi for him until he becom accustom to hi new surround will you come upstair dr watson and inspect my collect of lepidoptera i think it is the most complet on in the southwest of england by the time that you have look through them lunch will be almost readi but i wa eager to get back to my charg the melancholi of the moor the death of the unfortun poni the weird sound which had been associ with the grim legend of the baskervil all these thing ting my thought with sad then on the top of these more or less vagu impress there had come the definit and distinct warn of miss stapleton deliv with such intens earnest that i could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lai behind it i resist all pressur to stai for lunch and i set off at onc upon my return journei take the grassgrown path by which we had come it seem howev that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it for befor i had reach the road i wa astound to see miss stapleton sit upon a rock by the side of the track her face wa beautifulli flush with her exert and she held her hand to her side i have run all the wai in order to cut you off dr watson said she i had not even time to put on my hat i must not stop or my brother mai miss me i want to sai to you how sorri i am about the stupid mistak i made in think that you were sir henri pleas forget the word i said which have no applic whatev to you but i can t forget them miss stapleton said i i am sir henri s friend and hi welfar is a veri close concern of mine tell me why it wa that you were so eager that sir henri should return to london a woman s whim dr watson when you know me better you will understand that i cannot alwai give reason for what i sai or do no no i rememb the thrill in your voic i rememb the look in your ey pleas pleas be frank with me miss stapleton for ever sinc i have been here i have been consciou of shadow all round me life ha becom like that great grimpen mire with littl green patch everywher into which on mai sink and with no guid to point the track tell me then what it wa that you meant and i will promis to convei your warn to sir henri an express of irresolut pass for an instant over her face but her ey had harden again when she answer me you make too much of it dr watson said she my brother and i were veri much shock by the death of sir charl we knew him veri intim for hi favourit walk wa over the moor to our hous he wa deepli impress with the curs which hung over the famili and when thi tragedi came i natur felt that there must be some ground for the fear which he had express i wa distress therefor when anoth member of the famili came down to live here and i felt that he should be warn of the danger which he will run that wa all which i intend to convei but what is the danger you know the stori of the hound i do not believ in such nonsens but i do if you have ani influenc with sir henri take him awai from a place which ha alwai been fatal to hi famili the world is wide why should he wish to live at the place of danger becaus it is the place of danger that is sir henri s natur i fear that unless you can give me some more definit inform than thi it would be imposs to get him to move i cannot sai anyth definit for i do not know anyth definit i would ask you on more question miss stapleton if you meant no more than thi when you first spoke to me why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said there is noth to which he or anyon els could object my brother is veri anxiou to have the hall inhabit for he think it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor he would be veri angri if he knew that i have said anyth which might induc sir henri to go awai but i have done my duti now and i will sai no more i must go back or he will miss me and suspect that i have seen you goodby she turn and had disappear in a few minut among the scatter boulder while i with my soul full of vagu fear pursu my wai to baskervil hall chapter first report of dr watson from thi point onward i will follow the cours of event by transcrib my own letter to mr sherlock holm which lie befor me on the tabl on page is miss but otherwis thei ar exactli as written and show my feel and suspicion of the moment more accur than my memori clear as it is upon these tragic event can possibl do baskervil hall octob th my dear holm my previou letter and telegram have kept you pretti well up to date as to all that ha occur in thi most godforsaken corner of the world the longer on stai here the more doe the spirit of the moor sink into on s soul it vast and also it grim charm when you ar onc out upon it bosom you have left all trace of modern england behind you but on the other hand you ar consciou everywher of the home and the work of the prehistor peopl on all side of you as you walk ar the hous of these forgotten folk with their grave and the huge monolith which ar suppos to have mark their templ as you look at their grai stone hut against the scar hillsid you leav your own ag behind you and if you were to see a skinclad hairi man crawl out from the low door fit a flinttip arrow on to the string of hi bow you would feel that hi presenc there wa more natur than your own the strang thing is that thei should have live so thickli on what must alwai have been most unfruit soil i am no antiquarian but i could imagin that thei were some unwarlik and harri race who were forc to accept that which none other would occupi all thi howev is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probabl be veri uninterest to your sever practic mind i can still rememb your complet indiffer as to whether the sun move round the earth or the earth round the sun let me therefor return to the fact concern sir henri baskervil if you have not had ani report within the last few dai it is becaus up to todai there wa noth of import to relat then a veri surpris circumst occur which i shall tell you in due cours but first of all i must keep you in touch with some of the other factor in the situat on of these concern which i have said littl is the escap convict upon the moor there is strong reason now to believ that he ha got right awai which is a consider relief to the lone household of thi district a fortnight ha pass sinc hi flight dure which he ha not been seen and noth ha been heard of him it is sure inconceiv that he could have held out upon the moor dure all that time of cours so far as hi conceal goe there is no difficulti at all ani on of these stone hut would give him a hidingplac but there is noth to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter on of the moor sheep we think therefor that he ha gone and the outli farmer sleep the better in consequ we ar four ablebodi men in thi household so that we could take good care of ourselv but i confess that i have had uneasi moment when i have thought of the stapleton thei live mile from ani help there ar on maid an old manserv the sister and the brother the latter not a veri strong man thei would be helpless in the hand of a desper fellow like thi not hill crimin if he could onc effect an entranc both sir henri and i were concern at their situat and it wa suggest that perkin the groom should go over to sleep there but stapleton would not hear of it the fact is that our friend the baronet begin to displai a consider interest in our fair neighbour it is not to be wonder at for time hang heavili in thi lone spot to an activ man like him and she is a veri fascin and beauti woman there is someth tropic and exot about her which form a singular contrast to her cool and unemot brother yet he also give the idea of hidden fire he ha certainli a veri mark influenc over her for i have seen her continu glanc at him as she talk as if seek approb for what she said i trust that he is kind to her there is a dry glitter in hi ey and a firm set of hi thin lip which goe with a posit and possibl a harsh natur you would find him an interest studi he came over to call upon baskervil on that first dai and the veri next morn he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wick hugo is suppos to have had it origin it wa an excurs of some mile across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggest the stori we found a short vallei between rug tor which led to an open grassi space fleck over with the white cotton grass in the middl of it rose two great stone worn and sharpen at the upper end until thei look like the huge corrod fang of some monstrou beast in everi wai it correspond with the scene of the old tragedi sir henri wa much interest and ask stapleton more than onc whether he did realli believ in the possibl of the interfer of the supernatur in the affair of men he spoke lightli but it wa evid that he wa veri much in earnest stapleton wa guard in hi repli but it wa easi to see that he said less than he might and that he would not express hi whole opinion out of consider for the feel of the baronet he told us of similar case where famili had suffer from some evil influenc and he left us with the impress that he share the popular view upon the matter on our wai back we stai for lunch at merripit hous and it wa there that sir henri made the acquaint of miss stapleton from the first moment that he saw her he appear to be strongli attract by her and i am much mistaken if the feel wa not mutual he refer to her again and again on our walk home and sinc then hardli a dai ha pass that we have not seen someth of the brother and sister thei dine here tonight and there is some talk of our go to them next week on would imagin that such a match would be veri welcom to stapleton and yet i have more than onc caught a look of the strongest disapprob in hi face when sir henri ha been pai some attent to hi sister he is much attach to her no doubt and would lead a lone life without her but it would seem the height of selfish if he were to stand in the wai of her make so brilliant a marriag yet i am certain that he doe not wish their intimaci to ripen into love and i have sever time observ that he ha taken pain to prevent them from be teteatet by the wai your instruct to me never to allow sir henri to go out alon will becom veri much more oner if a love affair were to be ad to our other difficulti my popular would soon suffer if i were to carri out your order to the letter the other daythursdai to be more exactdr mortim lunch with us he ha been excav a barrow at long down and ha got a prehistor skull which fill him with great joi never wa there such a singlemind enthusiast as he the stapleton came in afterward and the good doctor took us all to the yew allei at sir henri s request to show us exactli how everyth occur upon that fatal night it is a long dismal walk the yew allei between two high wall of clip hedg with a narrow band of grass upon either side at the far end is an old tumbledown summerhous halfwai down is the moorgat where the old gentleman left hi cigarash it is a white wooden gate with a latch beyond it li the wide moor i rememb your theori of the affair and tri to pictur all that had occur as the old man stood there he saw someth come across the moor someth which terrifi him so that he lost hi wit and ran and ran until he di of sheer horror and exhaust there wa the long gloomi tunnel down which he fled and from what a sheepdog of the moor or a spectral hound black silent and monstrou wa there a human agenc in the matter did the pale watch barrymor know more than he care to sai it wa all dim and vagu but alwai there is the dark shadow of crime behind it on other neighbour i have met sinc i wrote last thi is mr frankland of lafter hall who live some four mile to the south of us he is an elderli man redfac whitehair and choler hi passion is for the british law and he ha spent a larg fortun in litig he fight for the mere pleasur of fight and is equal readi to take up either side of a question so that it is no wonder that he ha found it a costli amus sometim he will shut up a right of wai and defi the parish to make him open it at other he will with hi own hand tear down some other man s gate and declar that a path ha exist there from time immemori defi the owner to prosecut him for trespass he is learn in old manori and commun right and he appli hi knowledg sometim in favour of the villag of fernworthi and sometim against them so that he is period either carri in triumph down the villag street or els burn in effigi accord to hi latest exploit he is said to have about seven lawsuit upon hi hand at present which will probabl swallow up the remaind of hi fortun and so draw hi sting and leav him harmless for the futur apart from the law he seem a kindli goodnatur person and i onli mention him becaus you were particular that i should send some descript of the peopl who surround us he is curious emploi at present for be an amateur astronom he ha an excel telescop with which he li upon the roof of hi own hous and sweep the moor all dai in the hope of catch a glimps of the escap convict if he would confin hi energi to thi all would be well but there ar rumour that he intend to prosecut dr mortim for open a grave without the consent of the next of kin becaus he dug up the neolith skull in the barrow on long down he help to keep our live from be monoton and give a littl comic relief where it is badli need and now have brought you up to date in the escap convict the stapleton dr mortim and frankland of lafter hall let me end on that which is most import and tell you more about the barrymor and especi about the surpris develop of last night first of all about the test telegram which you sent from london in order to make sure that barrymor wa realli here i have alreadi explain that the testimoni of the postmast show that the test wa worthless and that we have no proof on wai or the other i told sir henri how the matter stood and he at onc in hi downright fashion had barrymor up and ask him whether he had receiv the telegram himself barrymor said that he had did the boi deliv it into your own hand ask sir henri barrymor look surpris and consid for a littl time no said he i wa in the boxroom at the time and my wife brought it up to me did you answer it yourself no i told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it in the even he recur to the subject of hi own accord i could not quit understand the object of your question thi morn sir henri said he i trust that thei do not mean that i have done anyth to forfeit your confid sir henri had to assur him that it wa not so and pacifi him by give him a consider part of hi old wardrob the london outfit have now all arriv mr barrymor is of interest to me she is a heavi solid person veri limit intens respect and inclin to be puritan you could hardli conceiv a less emot subject yet i have told you how on the first night here i heard her sob bitterli and sinc then i have more than onc observ trace of tear upon her face some deep sorrow gnaw ever at her heart sometim i wonder if she ha a guilti memori which haunt her and sometim i suspect barrymor of be a domest tyrant i have alwai felt that there wa someth singular and question in thi man s charact but the adventur of last night bring all my suspicion to a head and yet it mai seem a small matter in itself you ar awar that i am not a veri sound sleeper and sinc i have been on guard in thi hous my slumber have been lighter than ever last night about two in the morn i wa arous by a stealthi step pass my room i rose open my door and peep out a long black shadow wa trail down the corridor it wa thrown by a man who walk softli down the passag with a candl held in hi hand he wa in shirt and trouser with no cover to hi feet i could mere see the outlin but hi height told me that it wa barrymor he walk veri slowli and circumspectli and there wa someth indescrib guilti and furtiv in hi whole appear i have told you that the corridor is broken by the balconi which run round the hall but that it is resum upon the farther side i wait until he had pass out of sight and then i follow him when i came round the balconi he had reach the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had enter on of the room now all these room ar unfurnish and unoccupi so that hi expedit becam more mysteri than ever the light shone steadili as if he were stand motionless i crept down the passag as noiselessli as i could and peep round the corner of the door barrymor wa crouch at the window with the candl held against the glass hi profil wa half turn toward me and hi face seem to be rigid with expect as he stare out into the black of the moor for some minut he stood watch intent then he gave a deep groan and with an impati gestur he put out the light instantli i made my wai back to my room and veri shortli came the stealthi step pass onc more upon their return journei long afterward when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a kei turn somewher in a lock but i could not tell whenc the sound came what it all mean i cannot guess but there is some secret busi go on in thi hous of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of i do not troubl you with my theori for you ask me to furnish you onli with fact i have had a long talk with sir henri thi morn and we have made a plan of campaign found upon my observ of last night i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interest read chapter the light upon the moor second report of dr watson baskervil hall oct th my dear holm if i wa compel to leav you without much new dure the earli dai of my mission you must acknowledg that i am make up for lost time and that event ar now crowd thick and fast upon us in my last report i end upon my top note with barrymor at the window and now i have quit a budget alreadi which will unless i am much mistaken consider surpris you thing have taken a turn which i could not have anticip in some wai thei have within the last fortyeight hour becom much clearer and in some wai thei have becom more complic but i will tell you all and you shall judg for yourself befor breakfast on the morn follow my adventur i went down the corridor and examin the room in which barrymor had been on the night befor the western window through which he had stare so intent ha i notic on peculiar abov all other window in the houseit command the nearest outlook on to the moor there is an open between two tree which enabl on from thi point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other window it is onli a distant glimps which can be obtain it follow therefor that barrymor sinc onli thi window would serv the purpos must have been look out for someth or somebodi upon the moor the night wa veri dark so that i can hardli imagin how he could have hope to see anyon it had struck me that it wa possibl that some love intrigu wa on foot that would have account for hi stealthi movement and also for the uneasi of hi wife the man is a strikinglook fellow veri well equip to steal the heart of a countri girl so that thi theori seem to have someth to support it that open of the door which i had heard after i had return to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestin appoint so i reason with myself in the morn and i tell you the direct of my suspicion howev much the result mai have shown that thei were unfound but whatev the true explan of barrymor s movement might be i felt that the respons of keep them to myself until i could explain them wa more than i could bear i had an interview with the baronet in hi studi after breakfast and i told him all that i had seen he wa less surpris than i had expect i knew that barrymor walk about night and i had a mind to speak to him about it said he two or three time i have heard hi step in the passag come and go just about the hour you name perhap then he pai a visit everi night to that particular window i suggest perhap he doe if so we should be abl to shadow him and see what it is that he is after i wonder what your friend holm would do if he were here i believ that he would do exactli what you now suggest said i he would follow barrymor and see what he did then we shall do it togeth but sure he would hear us the man is rather deaf and in ani case we must take our chanc of that we ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pass sir henri rub hi hand with pleasur and it wa evid that he hail the adventur as a relief to hi somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet ha been in commun with the architect who prepar the plan for sir charl and with a contractor from london so that we mai expect great chang to begin here soon there have been decor and furnish up from plymouth and it is evid that our friend ha larg idea and mean to spare no pain or expens to restor the grandeur of hi famili when the hous is renov and refurnish all that he will need will be a wife to make it complet between ourselv there ar pretti clear sign that thi will not be want if the ladi is will for i have seldom seen a man more infatu with a woman than he is with our beauti neighbour miss stapleton and yet the cours of true love doe not run quit as smoothli as on would under the circumst expect todai for exampl it surfac wa broken by a veri unexpect rippl which ha caus our friend consider perplex and annoy after the convers which i have quot about barrymor sir henri put on hi hat and prepar to go out as a matter of cours i did the same what ar you come watson he ask look at me in a curiou wai that depend on whether you ar go on the moor said i ye i am well you know what my instruct ar i am sorri to intrud but you heard how earnestli holm insist that i should not leav you and especi that you should not go alon upon the moor sir henri put hi hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile my dear fellow said he holm with all hi wisdom did not forese some thing which have happen sinc i have been on the moor you understand me i am sure that you ar the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoilsport i must go out alon it put me in a most awkward posit i wa at a loss what to sai or what to do and befor i had made up my mind he pick up hi cane and wa gone but when i came to think the matter over my conscienc reproach me bitterli for have on ani pretext allow him to go out of my sight i imagin what my feel would be if i had to return to you and to confess that some misfortun had occur through my disregard for your instruct i assur you my cheek flush at the veri thought it might not even now be too late to overtak him so i set off at onc in the direct of merripit hous i hurri along the road at the top of my speed without see anyth of sir henri until i came to the point where the moor path branch off there fear that perhap i had come in the wrong direct after all i mount a hill from which i could command a viewth same hill which is cut into the dark quarri thenc i saw him at onc he wa on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off and a ladi wa by hi side who could onli be miss stapleton it wa clear that there wa alreadi an understand between them and that thei had met by appoint thei were walk slowli along in deep convers and i saw her make quick littl movement of her hand as if she were veri earnest in what she wa sai while he listen intent and onc or twice shook hi head in strong dissent i stood among the rock watch them veri much puzzl as to what i should do next to follow them and break into their intim convers seem to be an outrag and yet my clear duti wa never for an instant to let him out of my sight to act the spy upon a friend wa a hate task still i could see no better cours than to observ him from the hill and to clear my conscienc by confess to him afterward what i had done it is true that if ani sudden danger had threaten him i wa too far awai to be of us and yet i am sure that you will agre with me that the posit wa veri difficult and that there wa noth more which i could do our friend sir henri and the ladi had halt on the path and were stand deepli absorb in their convers when i wa suddenli awar that i wa not the onli wit of their interview a wisp of green float in the air caught my ey and anoth glanc show me that it wa carri on a stick by a man who wa move among the broken ground it wa stapleton with hi butterflynet he wa veri much closer to the pair than i wa and he appear to be move in their direct at thi instant sir henri suddenli drew miss stapleton to hi side hi arm wa round her but it seem to me that she wa strain awai from him with her face avert he stoop hi head to her and she rais on hand as if in protest next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedli round stapleton wa the caus of the interrupt he wa run wildli toward them hi absurd net dangl behind him he gesticul and almost danc with excit in front of the lover what the scene meant i could not imagin but it seem to me that stapleton wa abus sir henri who offer explan which becam more angri as the other refus to accept them the ladi stood by in haughti silenc final stapleton turn upon hi heel and beckon in a peremptori wai to hi sister who after an irresolut glanc at sir henri walk off by the side of her brother the naturalist s angri gestur show that the ladi wa includ in hi displeasur the baronet stood for a minut look after them and then he walk slowli back the wai that he had come hi head hang the veri pictur of deject what all thi meant i could not imagin but i wa deepli asham to have wit so intim a scene without my friend s knowledg i ran down the hill therefor and met the baronet at the bottom hi face wa flush with anger and hi brow were wrinkl like on who is at hi wit s end what to do halloa watson where have you drop from said he you don t mean to sai that you came after me in spite of all i explain everyth to him how i had found it imposs to remain behind how i had follow him and how i had wit all that had occur for an instant hi ey blaze at me but my frank disarm hi anger and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh you would have thought the middl of that prairi a fairli safe place for a man to be privat said he but by thunder the whole countrysid seem to have been out to see me do my wooingand a mighti poor woo at that where had you engag a seat i wa on that hill quit in the back row eh but her brother wa well up to the front did you see him come out on us ye i did did he ever strike you as be crazythi brother of her i can t sai that he ever did i dare sai not i alwai thought him sane enough until todai but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket what s the matter with me anyhow you ve live near me for some week watson tell me straight now is there anyth that would prevent me from make a good husband to a woman that i love i should sai not he can t object to my worldli posit so it must be myself that he ha thi down on what ha he against me i never hurt man or woman in my life that i know of and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tip of her finger did he sai so that and a deal more i tell you watson i ve onli known her these few week but from the first i just felt that she wa made for me and she toosh wa happi when she wa with me and that i ll swear there s a light in a woman s ey that speak louder than word but he ha never let us get togeth and it wa onli todai for the first time that i saw a chanc of have a few word with her alon she wa glad to meet me but when she did it wa not love that she would talk about and she wouldn t have let me talk about it either if she could have stop it she kept come back to it that thi wa a place of danger and that she would never be happi until i had left it i told her that sinc i had seen her i wa in no hurri to leav it and that if she realli want me to go the onli wai to work it wa for her to arrang to go with me with that i offer in as mani word to marri her but befor she could answer down came thi brother of her run at us with a face on him like a madman he wa just white with rage and those light ey of hi were blaze with furi what wa i do with the ladi how dare i offer her attent which were distast to her did i think that becaus i wa a baronet i could do what i like if he had not been her brother i should have known better how to answer him as it wa i told him that my feel toward hi sister were such as i wa not asham of and that i hope that she might honour me by becom my wife that seem to make the matter no better so then i lost my temper too and i answer him rather more hotli than i should perhap consid that she wa stand by so it end by hi go off with her as you saw and here am i as badli puzzl a man as ani in thi counti just tell me what it all mean watson and i ll ow you more than ever i can hope to pai i tri on or two explan but inde i wa complet puzzl myself our friend s titl hi fortun hi ag hi charact and hi appear ar all in hi favour and i know noth against him unless it be thi dark fate which run in hi famili that hi advanc should be reject so brusqu without ani refer to the ladi s own wish and that the ladi should accept the situat without protest is veri amaz howev our conjectur were set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that veri afternoon he had come to offer apolog for hi rude of the morn and after a long privat interview with sir henri in hi studi the upshot of their convers wa that the breach is quit heal and that we ar to dine at merripit hous next fridai as a sign of it i don t sai now that he isn t a crazi man said sir henri i can t forget the look in hi ey when he ran at me thi morn but i must allow that no man could make a more handsom apolog than he ha done did he give ani explan of hi conduct hi sister is everyth in hi life he sai that is natur enough and i am glad that he should understand her valu thei have alwai been togeth and accord to hi account he ha been a veri lone man with onli her as a companion so that the thought of lose her wa realli terribl to him he had not understood he said that i wa becom attach to her but when he saw with hi own ey that it wa realli so and that she might be taken awai from him it gave him such a shock that for a time he wa not respons for what he said or did he wa veri sorri for all that had pass and he recogn how foolish and how selfish it wa that he should imagin that he could hold a beauti woman like hi sister to himself for her whole life if she had to leav him he had rather it wa to a neighbour like myself than to anyon els but in ani case it wa a blow to him and it would take him some time befor he could prepar himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposit upon hi part if i would promis for three month to let the matter rest and to be content with cultiv the ladi s friendship dure that time without claim her love thi i promis and so the matter rest so there is on of our small mysteri clear up it is someth to have touch bottom anywher in thi bog in which we ar flounder we know now why stapleton look with disfavour upon hi sister s suitoreven when that suitor wa so elig a on as sir henri and now i pass on to anoth thread which i have extric out of the tangl skein the mysteri of the sob in the night of the tearstain face of mr barrymor of the secret journei of the butler to the western lattic window congratul me my dear holm and tell me that i have not disappoint you as an agentthat you do not regret the confid which you show in me when you sent me down all these thing have by on night s work been thoroughli clear i have said by on night s work but in truth it wa by two night work for on the first we drew entir blank i sat up with sir henri in hi room until nearli three o clock in the morn but no sound of ani sort did we hear except the chime clock upon the stair it wa a most melancholi vigil and end by each of us fall asleep in our chair fortun we were not discourag and we determin to try again the next night we lower the lamp and sat smoke cigarett without make the least sound it wa incred how slowli the hour crawl by and yet we were help through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watch the trap into which he hope the game mai wander on struck and two and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chair with all our weari sens keenli on the alert onc more we had heard the creak of a step in the passag veri stealthili we heard it pass along until it di awai in the distanc then the baronet gentli open hi door and we set out in pursuit alreadi our man had gone round the galleri and the corridor wa all in dark softli we stole along until we had come into the other wing we were just in time to catch a glimps of the tall blackbeard figur hi shoulder round as he tipto down the passag then he pass through the same door as befor and the light of the candl frame it in the dark and shot on singl yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor we shuffl cautious toward it try everi plank befor we dare to put our whole weight upon it we had taken the precaut of leav our boot behind us but even so the old board snap and creak beneath our tread sometim it seem imposs that he should fail to hear our approach howev the man is fortun rather deaf and he wa entir preoccupi in that which he wa do when at last we reach the door and peep through we found him crouch at the window candl in hand hi white intent face press against the pane exactli as i had seen him two night befor we had arrang no plan of campaign but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct wai is alwai the most natur he walk into the room and as he did so barrymor sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of hi breath and stood livid and trembl befor us hi dark ey glare out of the white mask of hi face were full of horror and astonish as he gaze from sir henri to me what ar you do here barrymor noth sir hi agit wa so great that he could hardli speak and the shadow sprang up and down from the shake of hi candl it wa the window sir i go round at night to see that thei ar fasten on the second floor ye sir all the window look here barrymor said sir henri sternli we have made up our mind to have the truth out of you so it will save you troubl to tell it sooner rather than later come now no li what were you do at that window the fellow look at us in a helpless wai and he wrung hi hand togeth like on who is in the last extrem of doubt and miseri i wa do no harm sir i wa hold a candl to the window and why were you hold a candl to the window don t ask me sir henrydon t ask me i give you my word sir that it is not my secret and that i cannot tell it if it concern no on but myself i would not try to keep it from you a sudden idea occur to me and i took the candl from the trembl hand of the butler he must have been hold it as a signal said i let us see if there is ani answer i held it as he had done and stare out into the dark of the night vagu i could discern the black bank of the tree and the lighter expans of the moor for the moon wa behind the cloud and then i gave a cry of exult for a tini pinpoint of yellow light had suddenli transfix the dark veil and glow steadili in the centr of the black squar frame by the window there it is i cri no no sir it is nothingnoth at all the butler broke in i assur you sir move your light across the window watson cri the baronet see the other move also now you rascal do you deni that it is a signal come speak up who is your confeder out yonder and what is thi conspiraci that is go on the man s face becam openli defiant it is my busi and not your i will not tell then you leav my employ right awai veri good sir if i must i must and you go in disgrac by thunder you mai well be asham of yourself your famili ha live with mine for over a hundr year under thi roof and here i find you deep in some dark plot against me no no sir no not against you it wa a woman s voic and mr barrymor paler and more horrorstruck than her husband wa stand at the door her bulki figur in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intens of feel upon her face we have to go eliza thi is the end of it you can pack our thing said the butler oh john john have i brought you to thi it is my do sir henryal mine he ha done noth except for my sake and becaus i ask him speak out then what doe it mean my unhappi brother is starv on the moor we cannot let him perish at our veri gate the light is a signal to him that food is readi for him and hi light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it then your brother is the escap convict sirselden the crimin that s the truth sir said barrymor i said that it wa not my secret and that i could not tell it to you but now you have heard it and you will see that if there wa a plot it wa not against you thi then wa the explan of the stealthi expedit at night and the light at the window sir henri and i both stare at the woman in amaz wa it possibl that thi stolidli respect person wa of the same blood as on of the most notori crimin in the countri ye sir my name wa selden and he is my younger brother we humour him too much when he wa a lad and gave him hi own wai in everyth until he came to think that the world wa made for hi pleasur and that he could do what he like in it then as he grew older he met wick companion and the devil enter into him until he broke my mother s heart and drag our name in the dirt from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is onli the merci of god which ha snatch him from the scaffold but to me sir he wa alwai the littl curlyhead boi that i had nurs and plai with as an elder sister would that wa why he broke prison sir he knew that i wa here and that we could not refus to help him when he drag himself here on night weari and starv with the warder hard at hi heel what could we do we took him in and fed him and care for him then you return sir and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywher els until the hue and cry wa over so he lai in hide there but everi second night we made sure if he wa still there by put a light in the window and if there wa an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him everi dai we hope that he wa gone but as long as he wa there we could not desert him that is the whole truth as i am an honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it doe not lie with my husband but with me for whose sake he ha done all that he ha the woman s word came with an intens earnest which carri convict with them is thi true barrymor ye sir henri everi word of it well i cannot blame you for stand by your own wife forget what i have said go to your room you two and we shall talk further about thi matter in the morn when thei were gone we look out of the window again sir henri had flung it open and the cold night wind beat in upon our face far awai in the black distanc there still glow that on tini point of yellow light i wonder he dare said sir henri it mai be so place as to be onli visibl from here veri like how far do you think it is out by the cleft tor i think not more than a mile or two off hardli that well it cannot be far if barrymor had to carri out the food to it and he is wait thi villain besid that candl by thunder watson i am go out to take that man the same thought had cross my own mind it wa not as if the barrymor had taken us into their confid their secret had been forc from them the man wa a danger to the commun an unmitig scoundrel for whom there wa neither piti nor excus we were onli do our duti in take thi chanc of put him back where he could do no harm with hi brutal and violent natur other would have to pai the price if we held our hand ani night for exampl our neighbour the stapleton might be attack by him and it mai have been the thought of thi which made sir henri so keen upon the adventur i will come said i then get your revolv and put on your boot the sooner we start the better as the fellow mai put out hi light and be off in five minut we were outsid the door start upon our expedit we hurri through the dark shrubberi amid the dull moan of the autumn wind and the rustl of the fall leav the night air wa heavi with the smell of damp and decai now and again the moon peep out for an instant but cloud were drive over the face of the sky and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall the light still burn steadili in front ar you arm i ask i have a huntingcrop we must close in on him rapidli for he is said to be a desper fellow we shall take him by surpris and have him at our merci befor he can resist i sai watson said the baronet what would holm sai to thi how about that hour of dark in which the power of evil is exalt as if in answer to hi word there rose suddenli out of the vast gloom of the moor that strang cry which i had alreadi heard upon the border of the great grimpen mire it came with the wind through the silenc of the night a long deep mutter then a rise howl and then the sad moan in which it di awai again and again it sound the whole air throb with it strident wild and menac the baronet caught my sleev and hi face glimmer white through the dark my god what s that watson i don t know it s a sound thei have on the moor i heard it onc befor it di awai and an absolut silenc close in upon us we stood strain our ear but noth came watson said the baronet it wa the cry of a hound my blood ran cold in my vein for there wa a break in hi voic which told of the sudden horror which had seiz him what do thei call thi sound he ask who the folk on the countrysid oh thei ar ignor peopl why should you mind what thei call it tell me watson what do thei sai of it i hesit but could not escap the question thei sai it is the cry of the hound of the baskervil he groan and wa silent for a few moment a hound it wa he said at last but it seem to come from mile awai over yonder i think it wa hard to sai whenc it came it rose and fell with the wind isn t that the direct of the great grimpen mire ye it is well it wa up there come now watson didn t you think yourself that it wa the cry of a hound i am not a child you need not fear to speak the truth stapleton wa with me when i heard it last he said that it might be the call of a strang bird no no it wa a hound my god can there be some truth in all these stori is it possibl that i am realli in danger from so dark a caus you don t believ it do you watson no no and yet it wa on thing to laugh about it in london and it is anoth to stand out here in the dark of the moor and to hear such a cry as that and my uncl there wa the footprint of the hound besid him as he lai it all fit togeth i don t think that i am a coward watson but that sound seem to freez my veri blood feel my hand it wa as cold as a block of marbl you ll be all right tomorrow i don t think i ll get that cry out of my head what do you advis that we do now shall we turn back no by thunder we have come out to get our man and we will do it we after the convict and a hellhound as like as not after us come on we ll see it through if all the fiend of the pit were loos upon the moor we stumbl slowli along in the dark with the black loom of the craggi hill around us and the yellow speck of light burn steadili in front there is noth so decept as the distanc of a light upon a pitchdark night and sometim the glimmer seem to be far awai upon the horizon and sometim it might have been within a few yard of us but at last we could see whenc it came and then we knew that we were inde veri close a gutter candl wa stuck in a crevic of the rock which flank it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from be visibl save in the direct of baskervil hall a boulder of granit conceal our approach and crouch behind it we gaze over it at the signal light it wa strang to see thi singl candl burn there in the middl of the moor with no sign of life near itjust the on straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it what shall we do now whisper sir henri wait here he must be near hi light let us see if we can get a glimps of him the word were hardli out of my mouth when we both saw him over the rock in the crevic of which the candl burn there wa thrust out an evil yellow face a terribl anim face all seam and score with vile passion foul with mire with a bristl beard and hung with mat hair it might well have belong to on of those old savag who dwelt in the burrow on the hillsid the light beneath him wa reflect in hi small cun ey which peer fierc to right and left through the dark like a crafti and savag anim who ha heard the step of the hunter someth had evid arous hi suspicion it mai have been that barrymor had some privat signal which we had neglect to give or the fellow mai have had some other reason for think that all wa not well but i could read hi fear upon hi wick face ani instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the dark i sprang forward therefor and sir henri did the same at the same moment the convict scream out a curs at us and hurl a rock which splinter up against the boulder which had shelter us i caught on glimps of hi short squat strongli built figur as he sprang to hi feet and turn to run at the same moment by a lucki chanc the moon broke through the cloud we rush over the brow of the hill and there wa our man run with great speed down the other side spring over the stone in hi wai with the activ of a mountain goat a lucki long shot of my revolv might have crippl him but i had brought it onli to defend myself if attack and not to shoot an unarm man who wa run awai we were both swift runner and in fairli good train but we soon found that we had no chanc of overtak him we saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he wa onli a small speck move swiftli among the boulder upon the side of a distant hill we ran and ran until we were complet blown but the space between us grew ever wider final we stop and sat pant on two rock while we watch him disappear in the distanc and it wa at thi moment that there occur a most strang and unexpect thing we had risen from our rock and were turn to go home have abandon the hopeless chase the moon wa low upon the right and the jag pinnacl of a granit tor stood up against the lower curv of it silver disc there outlin as black as an eboni statu on that shine background i saw the figur of a man upon the tor do not think that it wa a delus holm i assur you that i have never in my life seen anyth more clearli as far as i could judg the figur wa that of a tall thin man he stood with hi leg a littl separ hi arm fold hi head bow as if he were brood over that enorm wilder of peat and granit which lai befor him he might have been the veri spirit of that terribl place it wa not the convict thi man wa far from the place where the latter had disappear besid he wa a much taller man with a cry of surpris i point him out to the baronet but in the instant dure which i had turn to grasp hi arm the man wa gone there wa the sharp pinnacl of granit still cut the lower edg of the moon but it peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figur i wish to go in that direct and to search the tor but it wa some distanc awai the baronet s nerv were still quiver from that cry which recal the dark stori of hi famili and he wa not in the mood for fresh adventur he had not seen thi lone man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which hi strang presenc and hi command attitud had given to me a warder no doubt said he the moor ha been thick with them sinc thi fellow escap well perhap hi explan mai be the right on but i should like to have some further proof of it todai we mean to commun to the princetown peopl where thei should look for their miss man but it is hard line that we have not actual had the triumph of bring him back as our own prison such ar the adventur of last night and you must acknowledg my dear holm that i have done you veri well in the matter of a report much of what i tell you is no doubt quit irrelev but still i feel that it is best that i should let you have all the fact and leav you to select for yourself those which will be of most servic to you in help you to your conclus we ar certainli make some progress so far as the barrymor go we have found the motiv of their action and that ha clear up the situat veri much but the moor with it mysteri and it strang inhabit remain as inscrut as ever perhap in my next i mai be abl to throw some light upon thi also best of all would it be if you could come down to us in ani case you will hear from me again in the cours of the next few dai chapter extract from the diari of dr watson so far i have been abl to quot from the report which i have forward dure these earli dai to sherlock holm now howev i have arriv at a point in my narr where i am compel to abandon thi method and to trust onc more to my recollect aid by the diari which i kept at the time a few extract from the latter will carri me on to those scene which ar indel fix in everi detail upon my memori i proce then from the morn which follow our abort chase of the convict and our other strang experi upon the moor octob th a dull and foggi dai with a drizzl of rain the hous is bank in with roll cloud which rise now and then to show the dreari curv of the moor with thin silver vein upon the side of the hill and the distant boulder gleam where the light strike upon their wet face it is melancholi outsid and in the baronet is in a black reaction after the excit of the night i am consciou myself of a weight at my heart and a feel of impend dangerev present danger which is the more terribl becaus i am unabl to defin it and have i not caus for such a feel consid the long sequenc of incid which have all point to some sinist influenc which is at work around us there is the death of the last occup of the hall fulfil so exactli the condit of the famili legend and there ar the repeat report from peasant of the appear of a strang creatur upon the moor twice i have with my own ear heard the sound which resembl the distant bai of a hound it is incred imposs that it should realli be outsid the ordinari law of natur a spectral hound which leav materi footmark and fill the air with it howl is sure not to be thought of stapleton mai fall in with such a superstit and mortim also but if i have on qualiti upon earth it is common sens and noth will persuad me to believ in such a thing to do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasant who ar not content with a mere fiend dog but must need describ him with hellfir shoot from hi mouth and ey holm would not listen to such fanci and i am hi agent but fact ar fact and i have twice heard thi cry upon the moor suppos that there were realli some huge hound loos upon it that would go far to explain everyth but where could such a hound lie conceal where did it get it food where did it come from how wa it that no on saw it by dai it must be confess that the natur explan offer almost as mani difficulti as the other and alwai apart from the hound there is the fact of the human agenc in london the man in the cab and the letter which warn sir henri against the moor thi at least wa real but it might have been the work of a protect friend as easili as of an enemi where is that friend or enemi now ha he remain in london or ha he follow us down here could hecould he be the stranger whom i saw upon the tor it is true that i have had onli the on glanc at him and yet there ar some thing to which i am readi to swear he is no on whom i have seen down here and i have now met all the neighbour the figur wa far taller than that of stapleton far thinner than that of frankland barrymor it might possibl have been but we had left him behind us and i am certain that he could not have follow us a stranger then is still dog us just as a stranger dog us in london we have never shaken him off if i could lai my hand upon that man then at last we might find ourselv at the end of all our difficulti to thi on purpos i must now devot all my energi my first impuls wa to tell sir henri all my plan my second and wisest on is to plai my own game and speak as littl as possibl to anyon he is silent and distrait hi nerv have been strang shaken by that sound upon the moor i will sai noth to add to hi anxieti but i will take my own step to attain my own end we had a small scene thi morn after breakfast barrymor ask leav to speak with sir henri and thei were closet in hi studi some littl time sit in the billiardroom i more than onc heard the sound of voic rais and i had a pretti good idea what the point wa which wa under discuss after a time the baronet open hi door and call for me barrymor consid that he ha a grievanc he said he think that it wa unfair on our part to hunt hi brotherinlaw down when he of hi own free will had told us the secret the butler wa stand veri pale but veri collect befor us i mai have spoken too warmli sir said he and if i have i am sure that i beg your pardon at the same time i wa veri much surpris when i heard you two gentlemen come back thi morn and learn that you had been chase selden the poor fellow ha enough to fight against without my put more upon hi track if you had told us of your own free will it would have been a differ thing said the baronet you onli told us or rather your wife onli told us when it wa forc from you and you could not help yourself i didn t think you would have taken advantag of it sir henryinde i didn t the man is a public danger there ar lone hous scatter over the moor and he is a fellow who would stick at noth you onli want to get a glimps of hi face to see that look at mr stapleton s hous for exampl with no on but himself to defend it there s no safeti for anyon until he is under lock and kei he ll break into no hous sir i give you my solemn word upon that but he will never troubl anyon in thi countri again i assur you sir henri that in a veri few dai the necessari arrang will have been made and he will be on hi wai to south america for god s sake sir i beg of you not to let the polic know that he is still on the moor thei have given up the chase there and he can lie quiet until the ship is readi for him you can t tell on him without get my wife and me into troubl i beg you sir to sai noth to the polic what do you sai watson i shrug my shoulder if he were safe out of the countri it would reliev the taxpay of a burden but how about the chanc of hi hold someon up befor he goe he would not do anyth so mad sir we have provid him with all that he can want to commit a crime would be to show where he wa hide that is true said sir henri well barrymor god bless you sir and thank you from my heart it would have kill my poor wife had he been taken again i guess we ar aid and abet a feloni watson but after what we have heard i don t feel as if i could give the man up so there is an end of it all right barrymor you can go with a few broken word of gratitud the man turn but he hesit and then came back you ve been so kind to us sir that i should like to do the best i can for you in return i know someth sir henri and perhap i should have said it befor but it wa long after the inquest that i found it out i ve never

shelterless moor poor devil whatev hi crime he ha suffer someth to aton for them and then i thought of that other oneth face in the cab the figur against the moon wa he also out in that delugedth unseen watcher the man of dark in the even i put on my waterproof and i walk far upon the sodden moor full of dark imagin the rain beat upon my face and the wind whistl about my ear god help those who wander into the great mire now for even the firm upland ar becom a morass i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitari watcher and from it craggi summit i look out myself across the melancholi down rain squall drift across their russet face and the heavi slatecolour cloud hung low over the landscap trail in grai wreath down the side of the fantast hill in the distant hollow on the left half hidden by the mist the two thin tower of baskervil hall rose abov the tree thei were the onli sign of human life which i could see save onli those prehistor hut which lai thickli upon the slope of the hill nowher wa there ani trace of that lone man whom i had seen on the same spot two night befor as i walk back i wa overtaken by dr mortim drive in hi dogcart over a rough moorland track which led from the outli farmhous of foulmir he ha been veri attent to us and hardli a dai ha pass that he ha not call at the hall to see how we were get on he insist upon my climb into hi dogcart and he gave me a lift homeward i found him much troubl over the disappear of hi littl spaniel it had wander on to the moor and had never come back i gave him such consol as i might but i thought of the poni on the grimpen mire and i do not fanci that he will see hi littl dog again by the wai mortim said i as we jolt along the rough road i suppos there ar few peopl live within drive distanc of thi whom you do not know hardli ani i think can you then tell me the name of ani woman whose initi ar l l he thought for a few minut no said he there ar a few gipsi and labour folk for whom

to set her up in a typewrit busi he want to know the object of my inquiri but i manag to satisfi hi curios without tell him too much for there is no reason why we should take anyon into our confid tomorrow morn i shall find my wai to coomb tracei and if i can see thi mr laura lyon of equivoc reput a long step will have been made toward clear on incid in thi chain of mysteri i am certainli develop the wisdom of the serpent for when mortim press hi question to an inconveni extent i ask him casual to what type frankland s skull belong and so heard noth but craniolog for the rest of our drive i have not live for year with sherlock holm for noth i have onli on other incid to record upon thi tempestu and melancholi dai thi wa my convers with barrymor just now which give me on more strong card which i can plai in due time mortim had stai to dinner and he and the baronet plai ecart afterward the butler brought me my coffe into the librari and i took the chanc to ask him a few question well said i ha thi preciou relat of your depart or is he still lurk out yonder i don t know sir i hope to heaven that he ha gone for he ha brought noth but troubl here i ve not heard of him sinc i left out food for him last and that wa three dai ago did you see him then no sir but the food wa gone when next i went that wai then he wa certainli there so you would think sir unless it wa the other man who took it i sat with my coffeecup halfwai to my lip and stare at barrymor you know that there is anoth man then ye sir there is anoth man upon the moor have you seen him no sir how do you know of him then selden told me of him sir a week ago or more he s in hide too but he s not a convict as far as i can make out i don t like it dr watsoni tell you straight sir that i don t like it he spoke with a sudden passion of earnest now listen to me barrymor i have no interest in thi matter but that of your master i have come here with no object except to help him tell me frankli what it is that you don t like barrymor hesit for a moment as if he regret hi outburst or found it difficult to express hi own feel in word it s all these goingson sir he cri at last wave hi hand toward the rainlash window which face the moor there s foul plai somewher and there s black villaini brew to that i ll swear veri glad i should be sir to see sir henri on hi wai back to london again but what is it that alarm you look at sir charl s death that wa bad enough for all that the coron said look at the nois on the moor at night there s not a man would cross it after sundown if he wa paid for it look at thi stranger hide out yonder and watch and wait what s he wait for what doe it mean it mean no good to anyon of the name of baskervil and veri glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the dai that sir henri s new servant ar readi to take over the hall but about thi stranger said i can you tell me anyth about him what did selden sai did he find out where he hid or what he wa do he saw him onc or twice but he is a deep on and give noth awai at first he thought that he wa the polic but soon he found that he had some lai of hi own a kind of gentleman he wa as far as he could see but what he wa do he could not make out and where did he sai that he live among the old hous on the hillsideth stone hut where the old folk us to live but how about hi food selden found out that he ha got a lad who work for him and bring all he need i dare sai he goe to coomb tracei for what he want veri good barrymor we mai talk further of thi some other time when the butler had gone i walk over to the black window and i look through a blur pane at the drive cloud and at the toss outlin of the windswept tree it is a wild night indoor and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor what passion of hatr can it be which lead a man to lurk in such a place at such a time and what deep and earnest purpos can he have which call for such a trial there in that hut upon the moor seem to lie the veri centr of that problem which ha vex me so sore i swear that anoth dai shall not have pass befor i have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mysteri chapter the man on the tor the extract from my privat diari which form the last chapter ha brought my narr up to the eighteenth of octob a time when these strang event began to move swiftli toward their terribl conclus the incid of the next few dai ar indel graven upon my recollect and i can tell them without refer to the note made at the time i start them from the dai which succeed that upon which i had establish two fact of great import the on that mr laura lyon of coomb tracei had written to sir charl baskervil and made an appoint with him at the veri place and hour that he met hi death the other that the lurk man upon the moor wa to be found among the stone hut upon the hillsid with these two fact in my possess i felt that either my intellig or my courag must be defici if i could not throw some further light upon these dark place i had no opportun to tell the baronet what i had learn about mr lyon upon the even befor for dr mortim remain with him at card until it wa veri late at breakfast howev i inform him about my discoveri and ask him whether he would care to accompani me to coomb tracei at first he wa veri eager to come but on second thought it seem to both of us that if i went alon the result might be better the more formal we made the visit the less inform we might obtain i left sir henri behind therefor not without some prick of conscienc and drove off upon my new quest when i reach coomb tracei i told perkin to put up the hors and i made inquiri for the ladi whom i had come to interrog i had no difficulti in find her room which were central and well appoint a maid show me in without ceremoni and as i enter the sittingroom a ladi who wa sit befor a remington typewrit sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcom her face fell howev when she saw that i wa a stranger and she sat down again and ask me the object of my visit the first impress left by mr lyon wa on of extrem beauti her ey and hair were of the same rich hazel colour and her cheek though consider freckl were flush with the exquisit bloom of the brunett the dainti pink which lurk at the heart of the sulphur rose admir wa i repeat the first impress but the second wa critic there wa someth subtli wrong with the face some coars of express some hard perhap of ey some loos of lip which mar it perfect beauti but these of cours ar afterthought at the moment i wa simpli consciou that i wa in the presenc of a veri handsom woman and that she wa ask me the reason for my visit i had not quit understood until that instant how delic my mission wa i have the pleasur said i of know your father it wa a clumsi introduct and the ladi made me feel it there is noth in common between my father and me she said i ow him noth and hi friend ar not mine if it were not for the late sir charl baskervil and some other kind heart i might have starv for all that my father care it wa about the late sir charl baskervil that i have come here to see you the freckl start out on the ladi s face what can i tell you about him she ask and her finger plai nervous over the stop of her typewrit you knew him did you not i have alreadi said that i ow a great deal to hi kind if i am abl to support myself it is larg due to the interest which he took in my unhappi situat did you correspond with him the ladi look quickli up with an angri gleam in her hazel ey what is the object of these question she ask sharpli the object is to avoid a public scandal it is better that i should ask them here than that the matter should pass outsid our control she wa silent and her face wa still veri pale at last she look up with someth reckless and defiant in her manner well i ll answer she said what ar your question did you correspond with sir charl i certainli wrote to him onc or twice to acknowledg hi delicaci and hi generos have you the date of those letter no have you ever met him ye onc or twice when he came into coomb tracei he wa a veri retir man and he prefer to do good by stealth but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom how did he know enough about your affair to be abl to help you as you sai that he ha done she met my difficulti with the utmost readi there were sever gentlemen who knew my sad histori and unit to help me on wa mr stapleton a neighbour and intim friend of sir charl s he wa exceedingli kind and it wa through him that sir charl learn about my affair i knew alreadi that sir charl baskervil had made stapleton hi almon upon sever occas so the ladi s statement bore the impress of truth upon it did you ever write to sir charl ask him to meet you i continu mr lyon flush with anger again realli sir thi is a veri extraordinari question i am sorri madam but i must repeat it then i answer certainli not not on the veri dai of sir charl s death the flush had fade in an instant and a deathli face wa befor me her dry lip could not speak the no which i saw rather than heard sure your memori deceiv you said i i could even quot a passag of your letter it ran pleas pleas as you ar a gentleman burn thi letter and be at the gate by ten o clock i thought that she had faint but she recov herself by a suprem effort is there no such thing as a gentleman she gasp you do sir charl an injustic he did burn the letter but sometim a letter mai be legibl even when burn you acknowledg now that you wrote it ye i did write it she cri pour out her soul in a torrent of word i did write it why should i deni it i have no reason to be asham of it i wish him to help me i believ that if i had an interview i could gain hi help so i ask him to meet me but why at such an hour becaus i had onli just learn that he wa go to london next dai and might be awai for month there were reason why i could not get there earlier but why a rendezv in the garden instead of a visit to the hous do you think a woman could go alon at that hour to a bachelor s hous well what happen when you did get there i never went mr lyon no i swear it to you on all i hold sacr i never went someth interven to prevent my go what wa that that is a privat matter i cannot tell it you acknowledg then that you made an appoint with sir charl at the veri hour and place at which he met hi death but you deni that you kept the appoint that is the truth again and again i crossquest her but i could never get past that point mr lyon said i as i rose from thi long and inconclus interview you ar take a veri great respons and put yourself in a veri fals posit by not make an absolut clean breast of all that you know if i have to call in the aid of the polic you will find how serious you ar compromis if your posit is innoc why did you in the first instanc deni have written to sir charl upon that date becaus i fear that some fals conclus might be drawn from it and that i might find myself involv in a scandal and why were you so press that sir charl should destroi your letter if you have read the letter you will know i did not sai that i had read all the letter you quot some of it i quot the postscript the letter had as i said been burn and it wa not all legibl i ask you onc again why it wa that you were so press that sir charl should destroi thi letter which he receiv on the dai of hi death the matter is a veri privat on the more reason why you should avoid a public investig i will tell you then if you have heard anyth of my unhappi histori you will know that i made a rash marriag and had reason to regret it i have heard so much my life ha been on incess persecut from a husband whom i abhor the law is upon hi side and everi dai i am face by the possibl that he mai forc me to live with him at the time that i wrote thi letter to sir charl i had learn that there wa a prospect of my regain my freedom if certain expens could be met it meant everyth to mepeac of mind happi selfrespecteveryth i knew sir charl s generos and i thought that if he heard the stori from my own lip he would help me then how is it that you did not go becaus i receiv help in the interv from anoth sourc why then did you not write to sir charl and explain thi so i should have done had i not seen hi death in the paper next morn the woman s stori hung coher togeth and all my question were unabl to shake it i could onli check it by find if she had inde institut divorc proceed against her husband at or about the time of the tragedi it wa unlik that she would dare to sai that she had not been to baskervil hall if she realli had been for a trap would be necessari to take her there and could not have return to coomb tracei until the earli hour of the morn such an excurs could not be kept secret the probabl wa therefor that she wa tell the truth or at least a part of the truth i came awai baffl and dishearten onc again i had reach that dead wall which seem to be built across everi path by which i tri to get at the object of my mission and yet the more i thought of the ladi s face and of her manner the more i felt that someth wa be held back from me why should she turn so pale why should she fight against everi admiss until it wa forc from her why should she have been so retic at the time of the tragedi sure the explan of all thi could not be as innoc as she would have me believ for the moment i could proce no farther in that direct but must turn back to that other clue which wa to be sought for among the stone hut upon the moor and that wa a most vagu direct i realiz it as i drove back and note how hill after hill show trace of the ancient peopl barrymor s onli indic had been that the stranger live in on of these abandon hut and mani hundr of them ar scatter throughout the length and breadth of the moor but i had my own experi for a guid sinc it had shown me the man himself stand upon the summit of the black tor that then should be the centr of my search from there i should explor everi hut upon the moor until i light upon the right on if thi man were insid it i should find out from hi own lip at the point of my revolv if necessari who he wa and why he had dog us so long he might slip awai from us in the crowd of regent street but it would puzzl him to do so upon the lone moor on the other hand if i should find the hut and it tenant should not be within it i must remain there howev long the vigil until he return holm had miss him in london it would inde be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth where my master had fail luck had been against us again and again in thi inquiri but now at last it came to my aid and the messeng of good fortun wa none other than mr frankland who wa stand graywhisk and redfac outsid the gate of hi garden which open on to the highroad along which i travel gooddai dr watson cri he with unwont good humour you must realli give your hors a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratul me my feel toward him were veri far from be friendli after what i had heard of hi treatment of hi daughter but i wa anxiou to send perkin and the wagonett home and the opportun wa a good on i alight and sent a messag to sir henri that i should walk over in time for dinner then i follow frankland into hi diningroom it is a great dai for me siron of the redlett dai of my life he cri with mani chuckl i have brought off a doubl event i mean to teach them in these part that law is law and that there is a man here who doe not fear to invok it i have establish a right of wai through the centr of old middleton s park slap across it sir within a hundr yard of hi own front door what do you think of that we ll teach these magnat that thei cannot ride roughshod over the right of the common confound them and i ve close the wood where the fernworthi folk us to picnic these infern peopl seem to think that there ar no right of properti and that thei can swarm where thei like with their paper and their bottl both case decid dr watson and both in my favour i haven t had such a dai sinc i had sir john morland for trespass becaus he shot in hi own warren how on earth did you do that look it up in the book sir it will repai readingfrankland v morland court of queen s bench it cost me pound but i got my verdict did it do you ani good none sir none i am proud to sai that i had no interest in the matter i act entir from a sens of public duti i have no doubt for exampl that the fernworthi peopl will burn me in effigi tonight i told the polic last time thei did it that thei should stop these disgrac exhibit the counti constabulari is in a scandal state sir and it ha not afford me the protect to which i am entitl the case of frankland v regina will bring the matter befor the attent of the public i told them that thei would have occas to regret their treatment of me and alreadi my word have come true how so i ask the old man put on a veri know express becaus i could tell them what thei ar dy to know but noth would induc me to help the rascal in ani wai i had been cast round for some excus by which i could get awai from hi gossip but now i began to wish to hear more of it i had seen enough of the contrari natur of the old sinner to understand that ani strong sign of interest would be the surest wai to stop hi confid some poach case no doubt said i with an indiffer manner ha ha my boi a veri much more import matter than that what about the convict on the moor i stare you don t mean that you know where he is said i i mai not know exactli where he is but i am quit sure that i could help the polic to lai their hand on him ha it never struck you that the wai to catch that man wa to find out where he got hi food and so trace it to him he certainli seem to be get uncomfort near the truth no doubt said i but how do you know that he is anywher upon the moor i know it becaus i have seen with my own ey the messeng who take him hi food my heart sank for barrymor it wa a seriou thing to be in the power of thi spite old busybodi but hi next remark took a weight from my mind you ll be surpris to hear that hi food is taken to him by a child i see him everi dai through my telescop upon the roof he pass along the same path at the same hour and to whom should he be go except to the convict here wa luck inde and yet i suppress all appear of interest a child barrymor had said that our unknown wa suppli by a boi it wa on hi track and not upon the convict s that frankland had stumbl if i could get hi knowledg it might save me a long and weari hunt but incredul and indiffer were evid my strongest card i should sai that it wa much more like that it wa the son of on of the moorland shepherd take out hi father s dinner the least appear of opposit struck fire out of the old autocrat hi ey look malignantli at me and hi grai whisker bristl like those of an angri cat inde sir said he point out over the widestretch moor do you see that black tor over yonder well do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it it is the stoniest part of the whole moor is that a place where a shepherd would be like to take hi station your suggest sir is a most absurd on i meekli answer that i had spoken without know all the fact my submiss pleas him and led him to further confid you mai be sure sir that i have veri good ground befor i come to an opinion i have seen the boi again and again with hi bundl everi dai and sometim twice a dai i have been ablebut wait a moment dr watson do my ey deceiv me or is there at the present moment someth move upon that hillsid it wa sever mile off but i could distinctli see a small dark dot against the dull green and grai come sir come cri frankland rush upstair you will see with your own ey and judg for yourself the telescop a formid instrument mount upon a tripod stood upon the flat lead of the hous frankland clap hi ey to it and gave a cry of satisfact quick dr watson quick befor he pass over the hill there he wa sure enough a small urchin with a littl bundl upon hi shoulder toil slowli up the hill when he reach the crest i saw the rag uncouth figur outlin for an instant against the cold blue sky he look round him with a furtiv and stealthi air as on who dread pursuit then he vanish over the hill well am i right certainli there is a boi who seem to have some secret errand and what the errand is even a counti constabl could guess but not on word shall thei have from me and i bind you to secreci also dr watson not a word you understand just as you wish thei have treat me shamefullyshamefulli when the fact come out in frankland v regina i ventur to think that a thrill of indign will run through the countri noth would induc me to help the polic in ani wai for all thei care it might have been me instead of my effigi which these rascal burn at the stake sure you ar not go you will help me to empti the decant in honour of thi great occas but i resist all hi solicit and succeed in dissuad him from hi announc intent of walk home with me i kept the road as long as hi ey wa on me and then i struck off across the moor and made for the stoni hill over which the boi had disappear everyth wa work in my favour and i swore that it should not be through lack of energi or persever that i should miss the chanc which fortun had thrown in my wai the sun wa alreadi sink when i reach the summit of the hill and the long slope beneath me were all goldengreen on on side and grai shadow on the other a haze lai low upon the farthest skylin out of which jut the fantast shape of belliv and vixen tor over the wide expans there wa no sound and no movement on great grai bird a gull or curlew soar aloft in the blue heaven he and i seem to be the onli live thing between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it the barren scene the sens of loneli and the mysteri and urgenc of my task all struck a chill into my heart the boi wa nowher to be seen but down beneath me in a cleft of the hill there wa a circl of the old stone hut and in the middl of them there wa on which retain suffici roof to act as a screen against the weather my heart leap within me as i saw it thi must be the burrow where the stranger lurk at last my foot wa on the threshold of hi hide placehi secret wa within my grasp as i approach the hut walk as warili as stapleton would do when with pois net he drew near the settl butterfli i satisfi myself that the place had inde been us as a habit a vagu pathwai among the boulder led to the dilapid open which serv as a door all wa silent within the unknown might be lurk there or he might be prowl on the moor my nerv tingl with the sens of adventur throw asid my cigarett i close my hand upon the butt of my revolv and walk swiftli up to the door i look in the place wa empti but there were ampl sign that i had not come upon a fals scent thi wa certainli where the man live some blanket roll in a waterproof lai upon that veri stone slab upon which neolith man had onc slumber the ash of a fire were heap in a rude grate besid it lai some cook utensil and a bucket halfful of water a litter of empti tin show that the place had been occupi for some time and i saw as my ey becam accustom to the checker light a pannikin and a halfful bottl of spirit stand in the corner in the middl of the hut a flat stone serv the purpos of a tabl and upon thi stood a small cloth bundleth same no doubt which i had seen through the telescop upon the shoulder of the boi it contain a loaf of bread a tin tongu and two tin of preserv peach as i set it down again after have examin it my heart leap to see that beneath it there lai a sheet of paper with write upon it i rais it and thi wa what i read roughli scrawl in pencil dr watson ha gone to coomb tracei for a minut i stood there with the paper in my hand think out the mean of thi curt messag it wa i then and not sir henri who wa be dog by thi secret man he had not follow me himself but he had set an agentth boi perhapsupon my track and thi wa hi report possibl i had taken no step sinc i had been upon the moor which had not been observ and report alwai there wa thi feel of an unseen forc a fine net drawn round us with infinit skill and delicaci hold us so lightli that it wa onli at some suprem moment that on realiz that on wa inde entangl in it mesh if there wa on report there might be other so i look round the hut in search of them there wa no trace howev of anyth of the kind nor could i discov ani sign which might indic the charact or intent of the man who live in thi singular place save that he must be of spartan habit and care littl for the comfort of life when i thought of the heavi rain and look at the gape roof i understood how strong and immut must be the purpos which had kept him in that inhospit abod wa he our malign enemi or wa he by chanc our guardian angel i swore that i would not leav the hut until i knew outsid the sun wa sink low and the west wa blaze with scarlet and gold it reflect wa shot back in ruddi patch by the distant pool which lai amid the great grimpen mire there were the two tower of baskervil hall and there a distant blur of smoke which mark the villag of grimpen between the two behind the hill wa the hous of the stapleton all wa sweet and mellow and peac in the golden even light and yet as i look at them my soul share none of the peac of natur but quiver at the vagu and the terror of that interview which everi instant wa bring nearer with tingl nerv but a fix purpos i sat in the dark recess of the hut and wait with sombr patienc for the come of it tenant and then at last i heard him far awai came the sharp clink of a boot strike upon a stone then anoth and yet anoth come nearer and nearer i shrank back into the darkest corner and cock the pistol in my pocket determin not to discov myself until i had an opportun of see someth of the stranger there wa a long paus which show that he had stop then onc more the footstep approach and a shadow fell across the open of the hut it is a love even my dear watson said a wellknown voic i realli think that you will be more comfort outsid than in chapter death on the moor for a moment or two i sat breathless hardli abl to believ my ear then my sens and my voic came back to me while a crush weight of respons seem in an instant to be lift from my soul that cold incis iron voic could belong to but on man in all the world holm i cri holm come out said he and pleas be care with the revolv i stoop under the rude lintel and there he sat upon a stone outsid hi grai ey danc with amus as thei fell upon my astonish featur he wa thin and worn but clear and alert hi keen face bronz by the sun and roughen by the wind in hi tweed suit and cloth cap he look like ani other tourist upon the moor and he had contriv with that catlik love of person cleanli which wa on of hi characterist that hi chin should be as smooth and hi linen as perfect as if he were in baker street i never wa more glad to see anyon in my life said i as i wrung him by the hand or more astonish eh well i must confess to it the surpris wa not all on on side i assur you i had no idea that you had found my occasion retreat still less that you were insid it until i wa within twenti pace of the door my footprint i presum no watson i fear that i could not undertak to recogn your footprint amid all the footprint of the world if you serious desir to deceiv me you must chang your tobacconist for when i see the stub of a cigarett mark bradlei oxford street i know that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood you will see it there besid the path you threw it down no doubt at that suprem moment when you charg into the empti hut exactli i thought as muchand know your admir tenac i wa convinc that you were sit in ambush a weapon within reach wait for the tenant to return so you actual thought that i wa the crimin i did not know who you were but i wa determin to find out excel watson and how did you local me you saw me perhap on the night of the convict hunt when i wa so imprud as to allow the moon to rise behind me ye i saw you then and have no doubt search all the hut until you came to thi on no your boi had been observ and that gave me a guid where to look the old gentleman with the telescop no doubt i could not make it out when first i saw the light flash upon the len he rose and peep into the hut ha i see that cartwright ha brought up some suppli what s thi paper so you have been to coomb tracei have you ye to see mr laura lyon exactli well done our research have evid been run on parallel line and when we unit our result i expect we shall have a fairli full knowledg of the case well i am glad from my heart that you ar here for inde the respons and the mysteri were both becom too much for my nerv but how in the name of wonder did you come here and what have you been do i thought that you were in baker street work out that case of blackmail that wa what i wish you to think then you us me and yet do not trust me i cri with some bitter i think that i have deserv better at your hand holm my dear fellow you have been invalu to me in thi as in mani other case and i beg that you will forgiv me if i have seem to plai a trick upon you in truth it wa partli for your own sake that i did it and it wa my appreci of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examin the matter for myself had i been with sir henri and you it is confid that my point of view would have been the same as your and my presenc would have warn our veri formid oppon to be on their guard as it is i have been abl to get about as i could not possibl have done had i been live in the hall and i remain an unknown factor in the busi readi to throw in all my weight at a critic moment but why keep me in the dark for you to know could not have help us and might possibl have led to my discoveri you would have wish to tell me someth or in your kind you would have brought me out some comfort or other and so an unnecessari risk would be run i brought cartwright down with meyou rememb the littl chap at the express officeand he ha seen after my simpl want a loaf of bread and a clean collar what doe man want more he ha given me an extra pair of ey upon a veri activ pair of feet and both have been invalu then my report have all been wast my voic trembl as i recal the pain and the pride with which i had compos them holm took a bundl of paper from hi pocket here ar your report my dear fellow and veri well thumb i assur you i made excel arrang and thei ar onli delai on dai upon their wai i must compliment you exceedingli upon the zeal and the intellig which you have shown over an extraordinarili difficult case i wa still rather raw over the decept which had been practis upon me but the warmth of holm s prais drove my anger from my mind i felt also in my heart that he wa right in what he said and that it wa realli best for our purpos that i should not have known that he wa upon the moor that s better said he see the shadow rise from my face and now tell me the result of your visit to mr laura lyonsit wa not difficult for me to guess that it wa to see her that you had gone for i am alreadi awar that she is the on person in coomb tracei who might be of servic to us in the matter in fact if you had not gone todai it is exceedingli probabl that i should have gone tomorrow the sun had set and dusk wa settl over the moor the air had turn chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth there sit togeth in the twilight i told holm of my convers with the ladi so interest wa he that i had to repeat some of it twice befor he wa satisfi thi is most import said he when i had conclud it fill up a gap which i had been unabl to bridg in thi most complex affair you ar awar perhap that a close intimaci exist between thi ladi and the man stapleton i did not know of a close intimaci there can be no doubt about the matter thei meet thei write there is a complet understand between them now thi put a veri power weapon into our hand if i could onli us it to detach hi wife hi wife i am give you some inform now in return for all that you have given me the ladi who ha pass here as miss stapleton is in realiti hi wife good heaven holm ar you sure of what you sai how could he have permit sir henri to fall in love with her sir henri s fall in love could do no harm to anyon except sir henri he took particular care that sir henri did not make love to her as you have yourself observ i repeat that the ladi is hi wife and not hi sister but why thi elabor decept becaus he foresaw that she would be veri much more us to him in the charact of a free woman all my unspoken instinct my vagu suspicion suddenli took shape and centr upon the naturalist in that impass colourless man with hi straw hat and hi butterflynet i seem to see someth terriblea creatur of infinit patienc and craft with a smile face and a murder heart it is he then who is our enemyit is he who dog us in london so i read the riddl and the warningit must have come from her exactli the shape of some monstrou villaini half seen half guess loom through the dark which had girt me so long but ar you sure of thi holm how do you know that the woman is hi wife becaus he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piec of autobiographi upon the occas when he first met you and i dare sai he ha mani a time regret it sinc he wa onc a schoolmast in the north of england now there is no on more easi to trace than a schoolmast there ar scholast agenc by which on mai identifi ani man who ha been in the profess a littl investig show me that a school had come to grief under atroci circumst and that the man who had own itth name wa differenthad disappear with hi wife the descript agre when i learn that the miss man wa devot to entomolog the identif wa complet the dark wa rise but much wa still hidden by the shadow if thi woman is in truth hi wife where doe mr laura lyon come in i ask that is on of the point upon which your own research have shed a light your interview with the ladi ha clear the situat veri much i did not know about a project divorc between herself and her husband in that case regard stapleton as an unmarri man she count no doubt upon becom hi wife and when she is undeceiv why then we mai find the ladi of servic it must be our first duti to see herboth of ustomorrow don t you think watson that you ar awai from your charg rather long your place should be at baskervil hall the last red streak had fade awai in the west and night had settl upon the moor a few faint star were gleam in a violet sky on last question holm i said as i rose sure there is no need of secreci between you and me what is the mean of it all what is he after holm s voic sank as he answer it is murder watsonrefin coldblood deliber murder do not ask me for particular my net ar close upon him even as hi ar upon sir henri and with your help he is alreadi almost at my merci there is but on danger which can threaten us it is that he should strike befor we ar readi to do so anoth daytwo at the mostand i have my case complet but until then guard your charg as close as ever a fond mother watch her ail child your mission todai ha justifi itself and yet i could almost wish that you had not left hi side hark a terribl screama prolong yell of horror and anguishburst out of the silenc of the moor that fright cry turn the blood to ic in my vein oh my god i gasp what is it what doe it mean holm had sprung to hi feet and i saw hi dark athlet outlin at the door of the hut hi shoulder stoop hi head thrust forward hi face peer into the dark hush he whisper hush the cry had been loud on account of it vehem but it had peal out from somewher far off on the shadowi plain now it burst upon our ear nearer louder more urgent than befor where is it holm whisper and i knew from the thrill of hi voic that he the man of iron wa shaken to the soul where is it watson there i think i point into the dark no there again the agon cry swept through the silent night louder and much nearer than ever and a new sound mingl with it a deep mutter rumbl music and yet menac rise and fall like the low constant murmur of the sea the hound cri holm come watson come great heaven if we ar too late he had start run swiftli over the moor and i had follow at hi heel but now from somewher among the broken ground immedi in front of us there came on last despair yell and then a dull heavi thud we halt and listen not anoth sound broke the heavi silenc of the windless night i saw holm put hi hand to hi forehead like a man distract he stamp hi feet upon the ground he ha beaten us watson we ar too late no no sure not fool that i wa to hold my hand and you watson see what come of abandon your charg but by heaven if the worst ha happen we ll aveng him blindli we ran through the gloom blunder against boulder forc our wai through gors bush pant up hill and rush down slope head alwai in the direct whenc those dread sound had come at everi rise holm look eagerli round him but the shadow were thick upon the moor and noth move upon it dreari face can you see anyth noth but hark what is that a low moan had fallen upon our ear there it wa again upon our left on that side a ridg of rock end in a sheer cliff which overlook a stonestrewn slope on it jag face wa spreadeagl some dark irregular object as we ran toward it the vagu outlin harden into a definit shape it wa a prostrat man face downward upon the ground the head doubl under him at a horribl angl the shoulder round and the bodi hunch togeth as if in the act of throw a somersault so grotesqu wa the attitud that i could not for the instant realiz that that moan had been the pass of hi soul not a whisper not a rustl rose now from the dark figur over which we stoop holm laid hi hand upon him and held it up again with an exclam of horror the gleam of the match which he struck shone upon hi clot finger and upon the ghastli pool which widen slowli from the crush skull of the victim and it shone upon someth els which turn our heart sick and faint within usth bodi of sir henri baskervil there wa no chanc of either of us forget that peculiar ruddi tweed suitth veri on which he had worn on the first morn that we had seen him in baker street we caught the on clear glimps of it and then the match flicker and went out even as the hope had gone out of our soul holm groan and hi face glimmer white through the dark the brute the brute i cri with clench hand oh holm i shall never forgiv myself for have left him to hi fate i am more to blame than you watson in order to have my case well round and complet i have thrown awai the life of my client it is the greatest blow which ha befallen me in my career but how could i knowhow could i knowthat he would risk hi life alon upon the moor in the face of all my warn that we should have heard hi screamsmi god those screamsand yet have been unabl to save him where is thi brute of a hound which drove him to hi death it mai be lurk among these rock at thi instant and stapleton where is he he shall answer for thi deed he shall i will see to that uncl and nephew have been murderedth on frighten to death by the veri sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatur the other driven to hi end in hi wild flight to escap from it but now we have to prove the connect between the man and the beast save from what we heard we cannot even swear to the exist of the latter sinc sir henri ha evid di from the fall but by heaven cun as he is the fellow shall be in my power befor anoth dai is past we stood with bitter heart on either side of the mangl bodi overwhelm by thi sudden and irrevoc disast which had brought all our long and weari labour to so piteou an end then as the moon rose we climb to the top of the rock over which our poor friend had fallen and from the summit we gaze out over the shadowi moor half silver and half gloom far awai mile off in the direct of grimpen a singl steadi yellow light wa shine it could onli come from the lone abod of the stapleton with a bitter curs i shook my fist at it as i gaze why should we not seiz him at onc our case is not complet the fellow is wari and cun to the last degre it is not what we know but what we can prove if we make on fals move the villain mai escap us yet what can we do there will be plenti for us to do tomorrow tonight we can onli perform the last offic to our poor friend togeth we made our wai down the precipit slope and approach the bodi black and clear against the silver stone the agoni of those contort limb struck me with a spasm of pain and blur my ey with tear we must send for help holm we cannot carri him all the wai to the hall good heaven ar you mad he had utter a cry and bent over the bodi now he wa danc and laugh and wring my hand could thi be my stern selfcontain friend these were hidden fire inde a beard a beard the man ha a beard a beard it is not the baronetit iswhi it is my neighbour the convict with feverish hast we had turn the bodi over and that drip beard wa point up to the cold clear moon there could be no doubt about the beetl forehead the sunken anim ey it wa inde the same face which had glare upon me in the light of the candl from over the rockth face of selden the crimin then in an instant it wa all clear to me i rememb how the baronet had told me that he had hand hi old wardrob to barrymor barrymor had pass it on in order to help selden in hi escap boot shirt capit wa all sir henri s the tragedi wa still black enough but thi man had at least deserv death by the law of hi countri i told holm how the matter stood my heart bubbl over with thank and joi then the cloth have been the poor devil s death said he it is clear enough that the hound ha been laid on from some articl of sir henri sthe boot which wa abstract in the hotel in all probabilityand so ran thi man down there is on veri singular thing howev how came selden in the dark to know that the hound wa on hi trail he heard him to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like thi convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recaptur by scream wildli for help by hi cri he must have run a long wai after he knew the anim wa on hi track how did he know a greater mysteri to me is why thi hound presum that all our conjectur ar correct i presum noth well then why thi hound should be loos tonight i suppos that it doe not alwai run loos upon the moor stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henri would be there my difficulti is the more formid of the two for i think that we shall veri shortli get an explan of your while mine mai remain forev a mysteri the question now is what shall we do with thi poor wretch s bodi we cannot leav it here to the fox and the raven i suggest that we put it in on of the hut until we can commun with the polic exactli i have no doubt that you and i could carri it so far halloa watson what s thi it s the man himself by all that s wonder and audaci not a word to show your suspicionsnot a word or my plan crumbl to the ground a figur wa approach us over the moor and i saw the dull red glow of a cigar the moon shone upon him and i could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunti walk of the naturalist he stop when he saw us and then came on again why dr watson that s not you is it you ar the last man that i should have expect to see out on the moor at thi time of night but dear me what s thi somebodi hurt notdon t tell me that it is our friend sir henri he hurri past me and stoop over the dead man i heard a sharp intak of hi breath and the cigar fell from hi finger whowho s thi he stammer it is selden the man who escap from princetown stapleton turn a ghastli face upon us but by a suprem effort he had overcom hi amaz and hi disappoint he look sharpli from holm to me dear me what a veri shock affair how did he die he appear to have broken hi neck by fall over these rock my friend and i were stroll on the moor when we heard a cry i heard a cry also that wa what brought me out i wa uneasi about sir henri why about sir henri in particular i could not help ask becaus i had suggest that he should come over when he did not come i wa surpris and i natur becam alarm for hi safeti when i heard cri upon the moor by the wai hi ey dart again from my face to holm s did you hear anyth els besid a cry no said holm did you no what do you mean then oh you know the stori that the peasant tell about a phantom hound and so on it is said to be heard at night upon the moor i wa wonder if there were ani evid of such a sound tonight we heard noth of the kind said i and what is your theori of thi poor fellow s death i have no doubt that anxieti and exposur have driven him off hi head he ha rush about the moor in a crazi state and eventu fallen over here and broken hi neck that seem the most reason theori said stapleton and he gave a sigh which i took to indic hi relief what do you think about it mr sherlock holm my friend bow hi compliment you ar quick at identif said he we have been expect you in these part sinc dr watson came down you ar in time to see a tragedi ye inde i have no doubt that my friend s explan will cover the fact i will take an unpleas remembr back to london with me tomorrow oh you return tomorrow that is my intent i hope your visit ha cast some light upon those occurr which have puzzl us holm shrug hi shoulder on cannot alwai have the success for which on hope an investig need fact and not legend or rumour it ha not been a satisfactori case my friend spoke in hi frankest and most unconcern manner stapleton still look hard at him then he turn to me i would suggest carri thi poor fellow to my hous but it would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justifi in do it i think that if we put someth over hi face he will be safe until morn and so it wa arrang resist stapleton s offer of hospit holm and i set off to baskervil hall leav the naturalist to return alon look back we saw the figur move slowli awai over the broad moor and behind him that on black smudg on the silver slope which show where the man wa ly who had come so horribl to hi end chapter fix the net we re at close grip at last said holm as we walk togeth across the moor what a nerv the fellow ha how he pull himself togeth in the face of what must have been a paralyz shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to hi plot i told you in london watson and i tell you now again that we have never had a foeman more worthi of our steel i am sorri that he ha seen you and so wa i at first but there wa no get out of it what effect do you think it will have upon hi plan now that he know you ar here it mai caus him to be more cautiou or it mai drive him to desper measur at onc like most clever crimin he mai be too confid in hi own clever and imagin that he ha complet deceiv us why should we not arrest him at onc my dear watson you were born to be a man of action your instinct is alwai to do someth energet but suppos for argument s sake that we had him arrest tonight what on earth the better off should we be for that we could prove noth against him there s the devilish cun of it if he were act through a human agent we could get some evid but if we were to drag thi great dog to the light of dai it would not help us in put a rope round the neck of it master sure we have a case not a shadow of oneonli surmis and conjectur we should be laugh out of court if we came with such a stori and such evid there is sir charl s death found dead without a mark upon him you and i know that he di of sheer fright and we know also what frighten him but how ar we to get twelv stolid jurymen to know it what sign ar there of a hound where ar the mark of it fang of cours we know that a hound doe not bite a dead bodi and that sir charl wa dead befor ever the brute overtook him but we have to prove all thi and we ar not in a posit to do it well then tonight we ar not much better off tonight again there wa no direct connect between the hound and the man s death we never saw the hound we heard it but we could not prove that it wa run upon thi man s trail there is a complet absenc of motiv no my dear fellow we must reconcil ourselv to the fact that we have no case at present and that it is worth our while to run ani risk in order to establish on and how do you propos to do so i have great hope of what mr laura lyon mai do for us when the posit of affair is made clear to her and i have my own plan as well suffici for tomorrow is the evil thereof but i hope befor the dai is past to have the upper hand at last i could draw noth further from him and he walk lost in thought as far as the baskervil gate ar you come up ye i see no reason for further conceal but on last word watson sai noth of the hound to sir henri let him think that selden s death wa as stapleton would have us believ he will have a better nerv for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow when he is engag if i rememb your report aright to dine with these peopl and so am i then you must excus yourself and he must go alon that will be easili arrang and now if we ar too late for dinner i think that we ar both readi for our supper sir henri wa more pleas than surpris to see sherlock holm for he had for some dai been expect that recent event would bring him down from london he did rais hi eyebrow howev when he found that my friend had neither ani luggag nor ani explan for it absenc between us we soon suppli hi want and then over a belat supper we explain to the baronet as much of our experi as it seem desir that he should know but first i had the unpleas duti of break the new to barrymor and hi wife to him it mai have been an unmitig relief but she wept bitterli in her apron to all the world he wa the man of violenc half anim and half demon but to her he alwai remain the littl wil boi of her own girlhood the child who had clung to her hand evil inde is the man who ha not on woman to mourn him i ve been mope in the hous all dai sinc watson went off in the morn said the baronet i guess i should have some credit for i have kept my promis if i hadn t sworn not to go about alon i might have had a more live even for i had a messag from stapleton ask me over there i have no doubt that you would have had a more live even said holm drili by the wai i don t suppos you appreci that we have been mourn over you as have broken your neck sir henri open hi ey how wa that thi poor wretch wa dress in your cloth i fear your servant who gave them to him mai get into troubl with the polic that is unlik there wa no mark on ani of them as far as i know that s lucki for himin fact it s lucki for all of you sinc you ar all on the wrong side of the law in thi matter i am not sure that as a conscienti detect my first duti is not to arrest the whole household watson s report ar most incrimin document but how about the case ask the baronet have you made anyth out of the tangl i don t know that watson and i ar much the wiser sinc we came down i think that i shall be in a posit to make the situat rather more clear to you befor long it ha been an exceedingli difficult and most complic busi there ar sever point upon which we still want lightbut it is come all the same we ve had on experi as watson ha no doubt told you we heard the hound on the moor so i can swear that it is not all empti superstit i had someth to do with dog when i wa out west and i know on when i hear on if you can muzzl that on and put him on a chain i ll be readi to swear you ar the greatest detect of all time i think i will muzzl him and chain him all right if you will give me your help whatev you tell me to do i will do veri good and i will ask you also to do it blindli without alwai ask the reason just as you like if you will do thi i think the chanc ar that our littl problem will soon be solv i have no doubt he stop suddenli and stare fixedli up over my head into the air the lamp beat upon hi face and so intent wa it and so still that it might have been that of a clearcut classic statu a personif of alert and expect what is it we both cri i could see as he look down that he wa repress some intern emot hi featur were still compos but hi ey shone with amus exult excus the admir of a connoisseur said he as he wave hi hand toward the line of portrait which cover the opposit wall watson won t allow that i know anyth of art but that is mere jealousi becaus our view upon the subject differ now these ar a realli veri fine seri of portrait well i m glad to hear you sai so said sir henri glanc with some surpris at my friend i don t pretend to know much about these thing and i d be a better judg of a hors or a steer than of a pictur i didn t know that you found time for such thing i know what is good when i see it and i see it now that s a kneller i ll swear that ladi in the blue silk over yonder and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynold thei ar all famili portrait i presum everi on do you know the name barrymor ha been coach me in them and i think i can sai my lesson fairli well who is the gentleman with the telescop that is rearadmir baskervil who serv under rodnei in the west indi the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is sir william baskervil who wa chairman of committe of the hous of common under pitt and thi cavali opposit to meth on with the black velvet and the lace ah you have a right to know about him that is the caus of all the mischief the wick hugo who start the hound of the baskervil we re not like to forget him i gaze with interest and some surpris upon the portrait dear me said holm he seem a quiet meekmann man enough but i dare sai that there wa a lurk devil in hi ey i had pictur him as

in front of them stapleton wa talk with anim but the baronet look pale and distrait perhap the thought of that lone walk across the illomen moor wa weigh heavili upon hi mind as i watch them stapleton rose and left the room while sir henri fill hi glass again and lean back in hi chair puf at hi cigar i heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boot upon gravel the step pass along the path on the other side of the wall under which i crouch look over i saw the naturalist paus at the door of an outhous in the corner of the orchard a kei turn in a lock and as he pass in there wa a curiou scuffl nois from within he wa onli a minut or so insid and then i heard the kei turn onc more and he pass me and reenter the hous i saw him rejoin hi guest and i crept quietli back to where my

soft uncertain light befor us lai the dark bulk of the hous it serrat roof and bristl chimnei hard outlin against the silverspangl sky broad bar of golden light from the lower window stretch across the orchard and the moor on of them wa suddenli shut off the servant had left the kitchen there onli remain the lamp in the diningroom where the two men the murder host and the unconsci guest still chat over their cigar everi minut that white woolli plain which cover onehalf of the moor wa drift closer and closer to the hous alreadi the first thin wisp of it were curl across the golden squar of the light window the farther wall of the orchard wa alreadi invis and the tree were stand out of a swirl of white vapour as we watch it the fogwreath came crawl round both corner of the hous and roll slowli into on dens bank on which the upper floor and the roof float like a strang ship upon a shadowi sea holm struck hi hand passion upon the rock in front of us and stamp hi feet in hi impati if he isn t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be cover in half an hour we won t be abl to see our hand in front of us shall we move farther back upon higher ground ye i think it would be as well so as the fogbank flow onward we fell back befor it until we were half a mile from the hous and still that dens white sea with the moon silver it upper edg swept slowli and inexor on we ar go too far said holm we dare not take the chanc of hi be overtaken befor he can reach us at all cost we must hold our ground where we ar he drop on hi knee and clap hi ear to the ground thank god i think that i hear him come a sound of quick step broke the silenc of the moor crouch among the stone we stare intent at the silvertip bank in front of us the step grew louder and through the fog as through a curtain there step the man whom we were await he look round him in surpris as he emerg into the clear starlit night then he came swiftli along the path pass close to where we lai and went on up the long slope behind us as he walk he glanc continu over either shoulder like a man who is ill at eas hist cri holm and i heard the sharp click of a cock pistol look out it s come there wa a thin crisp continu patter from somewher in the heart of that crawl bank the cloud wa within fifti yard of where we lai and we glare at it all three uncertain what horror wa about to break from the heart of it i wa at holm s elbow and i glanc for an instant at hi face it wa pale and exult hi ey shine brightli in the moonlight but suddenli thei start forward in a rigid fix stare and hi lip part in amaz at the same instant lestrad gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground i sprang to my feet my inert hand grasp my pistol my mind paralyz by the dread shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadow of the fog a hound it wa an enorm coalblack hound but not such a hound as mortal ey have ever seen fire burst from it open mouth it ey glow with a smoulder glare it muzzl and hackl and dewlap were outlin in flicker flame never in the deliri dream of a disord brain could anyth more savag more appal more hellish be conceiv than that dark form and savag face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog with long bound the huge black creatur wa leap down the track follow hard upon the footstep of our friend so paralyz were we by the apparit that we allow him to pass befor we had recov our nerv then holm and i both fire togeth and the creatur gave a hideou howl which show that on at least had hit him he did not paus howev but bound onward far awai on the path we saw sir henri look back hi face white in the moonlight hi hand rais in horror glare helplessli at the fright thing which wa hunt him down but that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fear to the wind if he wa vulner he wa mortal and if we could wound him we could kill him never have i seen a man run as holm ran that night i am reckon fleet of foot but he outpac me as much as i outpac the littl profession in front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from sir henri and the deep roar of the hound i wa in time to see the beast spring upon it victim hurl him to the ground and worri at hi throat but the next instant holm had empti five barrel of hi revolv into the creatur s flank with a last howl of agoni and a viciou snap in the air it roll upon it back four feet paw furious and then fell limp upon it side i stoop pant and press my pistol to the dread shimmer head but it wa useless to press the trigger the giant hound wa dead sir henri lai insens where he had fallen we tore awai hi collar and holm breath a prayer of gratitud when we saw that there wa no sign of a wound and that the rescu had been in time alreadi our friend s eyelid shiver and he made a feebl effort to move lestrad thrust hi brandyflask between the baronet s teeth and two frighten ey were look up at us my god he whisper what wa it what in heaven s name wa it it s dead whatev it is said holm we ve laid the famili ghost onc and forev in mere size and strength it wa a terribl creatur which wa ly stretch befor us it wa not a pure bloodhound and it wa not a pure mastiff but it appear to be a combin of the twogaunt savag and as larg as a small lioness even now in the still of death the huge jaw seem to be drip with a bluish flame and the small deepset cruel ey were ring with fire i place my hand upon the glow muzzl and as i held them up my own finger smoulder and gleam in the dark phosphoru i said a cun prepar of it said holm snif at the dead anim there is no smell which might have interf with hi power of scent we ow you a deep apolog sir henri for have expos you to thi fright i wa prepar for a hound but not for such a creatur as thi and the fog gave us littl time to

wa open so we rush in and hurri from room to room to the amaz of a dodder old manserv who met us in the passag there wa no light save in the diningroom but holm caught up the lamp and left no corner of the hous unexplor no sign could we see of the man whom we were chase on the upper floor howev on of the bedroom door wa lock there s someon in here cri lestrad i can hear a movement open thi door a faint moan and rustl came from within holm struck the door just over the lock with the flat of hi foot and it flew open pistol in hand we all three rush into the room but there wa no sign within it of that desper and defiant villain whom we expect to see instead we were face by an object so strang and so unexpect that we stood for a moment stare at it in amaz the room had been fashion into a small museum and the wall were line by a number of glasstop case full of that collect of butterfli and moth the format of which had been the relax of thi complex and danger man in the centr of thi room there wa an upright beam which had been place at some period as a support for the old wormeaten baulk of timber which span the roof to thi post a figur wa ti so swath and muffl in the sheet which had been us to secur it that on could not for the moment tell whether it wa that of a man or a woman on towel pass round the throat and wa secur at the back of the pillar anoth cover the lower part of the face and over it two dark eyesey full of grief and shame and a dread questioningstar back at us in a minut we had torn off the gag unswath the bond and mr stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us as her beauti head fell upon her chest i saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck the brute cri holm here lestrad your brandybottl put her in the chair she ha faint from illusag and exhaust she open her ey again is he safe she ask ha he escap he cannot escap us madam no no i did not mean my husband sir henri is he safe ye and the hound it is dead she gave a long sigh of satisfact thank god thank god oh thi villain see how he ha treat me she shot her arm out from her sleev and we saw with horror that thei were all mottl with bruis but thi is nothingnoth it is my mind and soul

is but on place where he can have fled she answer there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire it wa there that he kept hi hound and there also he had made prepar so that he might have a refug that is where he would fly the fogbank lai like white wool against the window holm held the lamp toward it see said he no on could find hi wai into the grimpen mire tonight she laugh and clap her hand her ey and teeth gleam with fierc merriment he mai find hi wai in but never out she cri how can he see the guid wand tonight we plant them togeth he and i to mark the pathwai through the mire oh if i could onli have pluck them out todai then inde you would have had him at your merci it wa evid to us that all pursuit wa in vain until the fog had lift meanwhil we left lestrad in possess of the hous while holm and i went back with the baronet to baskervil hall the stori of the stapleton could no longer be withheld from him but he took the blow brave when he learn the truth about the woman whom he had love but the shock of the night s adventur had shatter hi nerv and befor morn he lai deliri in a high fever under the care of dr mortim the two of them were destin to travel togeth round the world befor sir henri had becom onc more the hale hearti man that he had been befor he becam master of that illomen estat and now i come rapidli to the conclus of thi singular narr in which i have tri to make the reader share those dark fear and vagu surmis which cloud our live so long and end in so tragic a manner on the morn after the death of the hound the fog had lift and we were guid by mr stapleton to the point where thei had found a pathwai through the bog it help us to realiz the horror of thi woman s life when we saw the eager and joi with which she laid us on her husband s track we left her stand upon the thin peninsula of firm peati soil which taper out into the widespread bog from the end of it a small wand plant here and there show where the path zigzag from tuft to tuft of rush among those greenscum pit and foul quagmir which bar the wai to the stranger rank reed and lush slimi waterpl sent an odour of decai and a heavi miasmat vapour onto our face while a fals step plung us more than onc thighdeep into the dark quiver mire which shook for yard in soft undul around our feet it tenaci grip pluck at our heel as we walk and when we sank into it it wa as if some malign hand wa tug us down into those obscen depth so grim and purpos wa the clutch in which it held us onc onli we saw a trace that someon had pass that peril wai befor us from amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing wa project holm sank to hi waist as he step from the path to seiz it and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set hi foot upon firm land again he held an old black boot in the air meyer toronto wa print on the leather insid it is worth a mud bath said he it is our friend sir henri s miss boot thrown there by stapleton in hi flight exactli he retain it in hi hand after us it to set the hound upon the track he fled when he knew the game wa up still clutch it and he hurl it awai at thi point of hi flight we know at least that he came so far in safeti but more than that we were never destin to know though there wa much which we might surmis there wa no chanc of find footstep in the mire for the rise mud ooz swiftli in upon them but as we at last reach firmer ground beyond the morass we all look eagerli for them but no slightest sign of them ever met our ey if the earth told a true stori then stapleton never reach that island of refug toward which he struggl through the fog upon that last night somewher in the heart of the great grimpen mire down in the foul slime of the huge morass which

to hear on an emerg he could keep the hound in the outhous at merripit but it wa alwai a risk and it wa onli on the suprem dai which he regard as the end of all hi effort that he dare do it thi past in the tin is no doubt the lumin mixtur with which the creatur wa daub it wa suggest of cours by the stori of the famili hellhound and by the desir to frighten old sir charl to death no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and scream even as our friend did and as we ourselv might have done when he saw such a creatur bound through the dark of the moor upon hi track it wa a cun devic for apart from the chanc of drive your victim to hi death what peasant would ventur to inquir too close into such a creatur should he get sight of it as mani have done upon the moor i said it in london watson

advantag of two convers with mr stapleton and the case ha now been so entir clear up that i am not awar that there is anyth which ha remain a secret to us you will find a few note upon the matter under the head b in my index list of case perhap you would kindli give me a sketch of the cours of event from memori certainli though i cannot guarante that i carri all the fact in my mind intens mental concentr ha a curiou wai of blot out what ha pass the barrist who ha hi case at hi finger end and is abl to argu with an expert upon hi own subject find that a week or two of the court will drive it all out of hi head onc more so each of my case displac the last and mlle carer ha blur my recollect of baskervil hall tomorrow some other littl problem mai be submit to my notic which will in turn dispossess the fair french ladi and the infam upwood so far as the case of the hound goe howev i will give you the cours of event as nearli as i can and you will suggest anyth which i mai have forgotten my inquiri show beyond all question that the famili portrait did not lie and that thi fellow wa inde a baskervil he wa a son of that rodger baskervil the younger brother of sir charl who fled with a sinist reput to south america where he wa said to have di unmarri he did as a matter of fact marri and had on child thi fellow whose real name is the same as hi father s he marri beryl garcia on of the beauti of costa rica and have purloin a consider sum of public monei he chang hi name to vandeleur and fled to england where he establish a school in the east of yorkshir hi reason for attempt thi special line of busi wa that he had struck up an acquaint with a consumpt tutor upon the voyag home and that he had us thi man s abil to make the undertak a success fraser the tutor di howev and the school which had begun well sank from disreput into infami the vandeleur found it conveni to chang their name to stapleton and he brought the remain of hi fortun hi scheme for the futur and hi tast for entomolog to the south of england i learn at the british museum that he wa a recogn author upon the subject and that the name of vandeleur ha been perman attach to a certain moth which he had in hi yorkshir dai been the first to describ we now come to that portion of hi life which ha prove to be of such intens interest to us the fellow had evid made inquiri and found that onli two live interven between him and a valuabl estat when he went to devonshir hi plan were i believ exceedingli hazi but that he meant mischief from the first is evid from the wai in which he took hi wife with him in the charact of hi sister the idea of us her as a decoi wa clearli alreadi in hi mind though he mai not have been certain how the detail of hi plot were to be arrang he meant in the end to have the estat and he wa readi to us ani tool or run ani risk for that end hi first act wa to establish himself as near to hi ancestr home as he could and hi second wa to cultiv a friendship with sir charl baskervil and with the neighbour the baronet himself told him about the famili hound and so prepar the wai for hi own death stapleton as i will continu to call him knew that the old man s heart wa weak and that a shock would kill him so much he had learn from dr mortim he had heard also that sir charl wa superstiti and had taken thi grim legend veri serious hi ingeni mind instantli suggest a wai by which the baronet could be done to death and yet it would be hardli possibl to bring home the guilt to the real murder have conceiv the idea he proceed to carri it out with consider finess an ordinari schemer would have been content to work with a savag hound the us of artifici mean to make the creatur diabol wa a flash of geniu upon hi part the dog he bought in london from ross and mangl the dealer in fulham road it wa the strongest and most savag in their possess he brought it down by the north devon line and walk a great distanc over the moor so as to get it home without excit ani remark he had alreadi on hi insect hunt learn to penetr the grimpen mire and so had found a safe hidingplac for the creatur here he kennel it and wait hi chanc but it wa some time come the old gentleman could not be decoi outsid of hi ground at night sever time stapleton lurk about with hi hound but without avail it wa dure these fruitless quest that he or rather hi alli wa seen by peasant and that the legend of the demon dog receiv a new confirm he had hope that hi wife might lure sir charl to hi ruin but here she prove unexpectedli independ she would not endeavour to entangl the old gentleman in a sentiment attach which might deliv him over to hi enemi threat and even i am sorri to sai blow refus to move her she would have noth to do with it and for a time stapleton wa at a deadlock he found a wai out of hi difficulti through the chanc that sir charl who had conceiv a friendship for him made him the minist of hi chariti in the case of thi unfortun woman mr laura lyon by repres himself as a singl man he acquir complet influenc over her and he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtain a divorc from her husband he would marri her hi plan were suddenli brought to a head by hi knowledg that sir charl wa about to leav the hall on the advic of dr mortim with whose opinion he himself pretend to coincid he must act at onc or hi victim might get beyond hi power he therefor put pressur upon mr lyon to write thi letter implor the old man to give her an interview on the even befor hi departur for london he then by a speciou argument prevent her from go and so had the chanc for which he had wait drive back in the even from coomb tracei he wa in time to get hi hound to treat it with hi infern paint and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman wait the dog incit by it master sprang over the wicketg and pursu the unfortun baronet who fled scream down the yew allei in that gloomi tunnel it must inde have been a dread sight to see that huge black creatur with it flame jaw and blaze ey bound after it victim he fell dead at the end of the allei from heart diseas and terror the hound had kept upon the grassi border while the baronet had run down the path so that no track but the man s wa visibl on see him ly still the creatur had probabl approach to sniff at him but find him dead had turn awai again it wa then that it left the print which wa actual observ by dr mortim the hound wa call off and hurri awai to it lair in the grimpen mire and a mysteri wa left which puzzl the author alarm the countrysid and final brought the case within the scope of our observ so much for the death of sir charl baskervil you perceiv the devilish cun of it for realli it would be almost imposs to make a case against the real murder hi onli accomplic wa on who could never give him awai and the grotesqu inconceiv natur of the devic onli serv to make it more effect both of the women concern in the case mr stapleton and mr laura lyon were left with a strong suspicion against stapleton mr stapleton knew that he had design upon the old man and also of the exist of the hound mr lyon knew neither of these thing but had been impress by the death occur at the time of an uncancel appoint which wa onli known to him howev both of them were under hi influenc and he had noth to fear from them the first half of hi task wa successfulli accomplish but the more difficult still remain it is possibl that stapleton did not know of the exist of an heir in canada in ani case he would veri soon learn it from hi friend dr mortim and he wa told by the latter all detail about the arriv of henri baskervil stapleton s first idea wa that thi young stranger from canada might possibl be done to death in london without come down to devonshir at all he distrust hi wife ever sinc she had refus to help him in lai a trap for the old man and he dare not leav her long out of hi sight for fear he should lose hi influenc over her it wa for thi reason that he took her to london with him thei lodg i find at the mexborough privat hotel in craven street which wa actual on of those call upon by my agent in search of evid here he kept hi wife imprison in her room while he disguis in a beard follow dr mortim to baker street and afterward to the station and to the northumberland hotel hi wife had some inkl of hi plan but she had such a fear of her husbanda fear found upon brutal illtreatmentthat she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger if the letter should fall into stapleton s hand her own life would not be safe eventu as we know she adopt the expedi of cut out the word which would form the messag and address the letter in a disguis hand it reach the baronet and gave him the first warn of hi danger it wa veri essenti for stapleton to get some articl of sir henri s attir so that in case he wa driven to us the dog he might alwai have the mean of set him upon hi track with characterist prompt and audac he set about thi at onc and we cannot doubt that the boot or chambermaid of the hotel wa well bribe to help him in hi design by chanc howev the first boot which wa procur for him wa a new on and therefor useless for hi purpos he then had it return and obtain anothera most instruct incid sinc it prove conclus to my mind that we were deal with a real hound as no other supposit could explain thi anxieti to obtain an old boot and thi indiffer to a new on the more outr and grotesqu an incid is the more carefulli it deserv to be examin and the veri point which appear to complic a case is when duli consid and scientif handl the on which is most like to elucid it then we had the visit from our friend next morn shadow alwai by stapleton in the cab from hi knowledg of our room and of my appear as well as from hi gener conduct i am inclin to think that stapleton s career of crime ha been by no mean limit to thi singl baskervil affair it is suggest that dure the last three year there have been four consider burglari in the west countri for none of which wa ani crimin ever arrest the last of these at folkeston court in mai wa remark for the coldblood pistol of the page who surpris the mask and solitari burglar i cannot doubt that stapleton recruit hi wane resourc in thi fashion and that for year he ha been a desper and danger man we had an exampl of hi readi of resourc that morn when he got awai from us so successfulli and also of hi audac in send back my own name to me through the cabman from that moment he understood that i had taken over the case in london and that therefor there wa no chanc for him there he return to dartmoor and await the arriv of the baronet on moment said i you have no doubt describ the sequenc of event correctli but there is on point which you have left unexplain what becam of the hound when it master wa in london i have given some attent to thi matter and it is undoubtedli of import there can be no question that stapleton had a confid though it is unlik that he ever place himself in hi power by share all hi plan with him there wa an old manserv at merripit hous whose name wa anthoni hi connect with the stapleton can be trace for sever year as far back as the schoolmast dai so that he must have been awar that hi master and mistress were realli husband and wife thi man ha disappear and ha escap from the countri it is suggest that anthoni is not a common name in england while antonio is so in all spanish or spanishamerican countri the man like mr stapleton herself spoke good english but with a curiou lisp accent i have myself seen thi old man cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton had mark out it is veri probabl therefor that in the absenc of hi master it wa he who care for the hound though he mai never have known the purpos for which the beast wa us the stapleton then went down to devonshir whither thei were soon follow by sir henri and you on word now as to how i stood myself at that time it mai possibl recur to your memori that when i examin the paper upon which the print word were fasten i made a close inspect for the watermark in do so i held it within a few inch of my ey and wa consciou of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamin there ar seventyf perfum which it is veri necessari that a crimin expert should be abl to distinguish from each other and case have more than onc within my own experi depend upon their prompt recognit the scent suggest the presenc of a ladi and alreadi my thought began to turn toward the stapleton thu i had made certain of the hound and had guess at the crimin befor ever we went to the west countri it wa my game to watch stapleton it wa evid howev that i could not do thi if i were with you sinc he would be keenli on hi guard i deceiv everybodi therefor yourself includ and i came down secretli when i wa suppos to be in london my hardship were not so great as you imagin though such trifl detail must never interfer with the investig of a case i stai for the most part at coomb tracei and onli us the hut upon the moor when it wa necessari to be near the scene of action cartwright had come down with me and in hi disguis as a countri boi he wa of great assist to me i wa depend upon him for food and clean linen when i wa watch stapleton cartwright wa frequent watch you so that i wa abl to keep my hand upon all the string i have alreadi told you that your report reach me rapidli be forward instantli from baker street to coomb tracei thei were of great servic to me and especi that on incident truth piec of biographi of stapleton s i wa abl to establish the ident of the man and the woman and knew at last exactli how i stood the case had been consider complic through the incid of the escap convict and the relat between him and the barrymor thi also you clear up in a veri effect wai though i had alreadi come to the same conclus from my own observ by the time that you discov me upon the moor i had a complet knowledg of the whole busi but i had not a case which could go to a juri even stapleton s attempt upon sir henri that night which end in the death of the unfortun convict did not help us much in prove murder against our man there seem to be no altern but to catch him redhand and to do so we had to us sir henri alon and appar unprotect as a bait we did so and at the cost of a sever shock to our client we succeed in complet our case and drive stapleton to hi destruct that sir henri should have been expos to thi is i must confess a reproach to my manag of the case but we had no mean of forese the terribl and paralyz spectacl which the beast present nor could we predict the fog which enabl him to burst upon us at such short notic we succeed in our object at a cost which both the specialist and dr mortim assur me will be a temporari on a long journei mai enabl our friend to recov not onli from hi shatter nerv but also from hi wound feel hi love for the ladi wa deep and sincer and to him the saddest part of all thi black busi wa that he should have been deceiv by her it onli remain to indic the part which she had plai throughout there can be no doubt that stapleton exercis an influenc over her which mai have been love or mai have been fear or veri possibl both sinc thei ar by no mean incompat emot it wa at least absolut effect at hi command she consent to pass as hi sister though he found the limit of hi power over her when he endeavour to make her the direct accessori to murder she wa readi to warn sir henri so far as she could without implic her husband and again and again she tri to do so stapleton himself seem to have been capabl of jealousi and when he saw the baronet pai court to the ladi even though it wa part of hi own plan still he could not help interrupt with a passion outburst which reveal the fieri soul which hi selfcontain manner so cleverli conceal by encourag the intimaci he made it certain that sir henri would frequent come to merripit hous and that he would sooner or later get the opportun which he desir on the dai of the crisi howev hi wife turn suddenli against him she had learn someth of the death of the convict and she knew that the hound wa be kept in the outhous on the even that sir henri wa come to dinner she tax her husband with hi intend crime and a furiou scene follow in which he show her for the first time that she had a rival in hi love her fidel turn in an instant to bitter hatr and he saw that she would betrai him he ti her up therefor that she might have no chanc of warn sir henri and he hope no doubt that when the whole countrysid put down the baronet s death to the curs of hi famili as thei certainli would do he could win hi wife back to accept an accomplish fact and to keep silent upon what she knew in thi i fanci that in ani case he made a miscalcul and that if we had not been there hi doom would none the less have been seal a woman of spanish blood doe not condon such an injuri so lightli and now my dear watson without refer to my note i cannot give you a more detail account of thi curiou case i do not know that anyth essenti ha been left unexplain he could not hope to frighten sir henri to death as he had done the old uncl with hi bogi hound the beast wa savag and halfstarv if it appear did not frighten it victim to death at least it would paralyz the resist which might be offer no doubt there onli remain on difficulti if stapleton came into the success how could he explain the fact that he the heir had been live unannounc under anoth name so close to the properti how could he claim it without caus suspicion and inquiri it is a formid difficulti and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solv it the past and the present ar within the field of my inquiri but what a man mai do in the futur is a hard question to answer mr stapleton ha heard her husband discuss the problem on sever occas there were three possibl cours he might claim the properti from south america establish hi ident befor the british author there and so obtain the fortun without ever come to england at all or he might adopt an elabor disguis dure the short time that he need be in london or again he might furnish an accomplic with the proof and paper put him in as heir and retain a claim upon some proport of hi incom we cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some wai out of the difficulti and now my dear watson we have had some week of sever work and for on even i think we mai turn our thought into more pleasant channel i have a box for le huguenot
