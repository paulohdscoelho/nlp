among us ow to hi gloomi and tragic death which happen thirteen year ago and which i shall describ in it proper place for the present i will onli sai that thi landown for so we us to call him although he hardli spent a dai of hi life on hi own estat wa a strang type yet on pretti frequent to be met with a type abject and viciou and at the same time senseless but he wa on of those senseless person who ar veri well capabl of look after their worldli affair and appar after noth els fyodor pavlovitch for instanc began with next to noth hi estat wa of the smallest he ran to dine at other men s tabl and fasten on them as a toadi yet at hi death it appear that he had a hundr thousand roubl in hard cash at the same time he wa all hi life on of the most senseless fantast fellow in the whole district i repeat it wa not stupid the major of these fantast fellow ar shrewd and intellig enough but just senseless and a peculiar nation form of it he wa marri twice and had three son the eldest dmitri by hi first wife and two ivan and alexei by hi second fyodor pavlovitch s first wife adela da ivanovna belong to a fairli rich and distinguish nobl famili also landown in our district the mi sov how it came to pass that an heiress who wa also a beauti and moreov on of those vigor intellig girl so common in thi gener but sometim also to be found in the last could have marri such a worthless puni weakl as we all call him i won t attempt to explain i knew a young ladi of the last romant gener who after some year of an enigmat passion for a gentleman whom she might quit easili have marri at ani moment invent insuper obstacl to their union and end by throw herself on stormi night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high bank almost a precipic and so perish entir to satisfi her own capric and to be like shakespear s ophelia inde if thi precipic a chosen and favorit spot of her had been less picturesqu if there had been a prosaic flat bank in it place most like the suicid would never have taken place thi is a fact and probabl there have been not a few similar instanc in the last two or three gener adela da ivanovna mi sov s action wa similarli no doubt an echo of other peopl s idea and wa due to the irrit caus by lack of mental freedom she want perhap to show her feminin independ to overrid class distinct and the despot of her famili and a pliabl imagin persuad her we must suppos for a brief moment that fyodor pavlovitch in spite of hi parasit posit wa on of the bold and iron spirit of that progress epoch though he wa in fact an ill natur buffoon and noth more what gave the marriag piquanc wa that it wa preced by an elop and thi greatli captiv adela da ivanovna s fanci fyodor pavlovitch s posit at the time made him special eager for ani such enterpris for he wa passion anxiou to make a career in on wai or anoth to attach himself to a good famili and obtain a dowri wa an allur prospect as for mutual love it did not exist appar either in the bride or in him in spite of adela da ivanovna s beauti thi wa perhap a uniqu case of the kind in the life of fyodor pavlovitch who wa alwai of a voluptu temper and readi to run after ani petticoat on the slightest encourag she seem to have been the onli woman who made no particular appeal to hi sens immedi after the elop adela da ivanovna discern in a flash that she had no feel for her husband but contempt the marriag accordingli show itself in it true color with extraordinari rapid although the famili accept the event pretti quickli and apport the runawai bride her dowri the husband and wife began to lead a most disorderli life and there were everlast scene between them it wa said that the young wife show incompar more generos and digniti than fyodor pavlovitch who as is now known got hold of all her monei up to twenti five thousand roubl as soon as she receiv it so that those thousand were lost to her for ever the littl villag and the rather fine town hous which form part of her dowri he did hi utmost for a long time to transfer to hi name by mean of some deed of convey he would probabl have succeed mere from her moral fatigu and desir to get rid of him and from the contempt and loath he arous by hi persist and shameless importun but fortun adela da ivanovna s famili interven and circumv hi greedi it is known for a fact that frequent fight took place between the husband and wife but rumor had it that fyodor pavlovitch did not beat hi wife but wa beaten by her for she wa a hot temper bold dark brow impati woman possess of remark physic strength final she left the hous and ran awai from fyodor pavlovitch with a destitut divin student leav mitya a child of three year old in her husband s hand immedi fyodor pavlovitch introduc a regular harem into the hous and abandon himself to orgi of drunken in the interv he us to drive all over the provinc complain tearfulli to each and all of adela da ivanovna s have left him go into detail too disgrac for a husband to mention in regard to hi own marri life what seem to gratifi him and flatter hi self love most wa to plai the ridicul part of the injur husband and to parad hi woe with embellish on would think that you d got a promot fyodor pavlovitch you seem so pleas in spite of your sorrow scoffer said to him mani even ad that he wa glad of a new comic part in which to plai the buffoon and that it wa simpli to make it funnier that he pretend to be unawar of hi ludicr posit but who know it mai have been simplic at last he succeed in get on the track of hi runawai wife the poor woman turn out to be in petersburg where she had gone with her divin student and where she had thrown herself into a life of complet emancip fyodor pavlovitch at onc began bustl about make prepar to go to petersburg with what object he could not himself have said he would perhap have realli gone but have determin to do so he felt at onc entitl to fortifi himself for the journei by anoth bout of reckless drink and just at that time hi wife s famili receiv the new of her death in petersburg she had di quit suddenli in a garret accord to on stori of typhu or as anoth version had it of starvat fyodor pavlovitch wa drunk when he heard of hi wife s death and the stori is that he ran out into the street and began shout with joi rais hi hand to heaven lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peac but other sai he wept without restraint like a littl child so much so that peopl were sorri for him in spite of the repuls he inspir it is quit possibl that both version were true that he rejoic at hi releas and at the same time wept for her who releas him as a gener rule peopl even the wick ar much more na ve and simpl heart than we suppos and we ourselv ar too chapter ii he get rid of hi eldest son you can easili imagin what a father such a man could be and how he would bring up hi children hi behavior as a father wa exactli what might be expect he complet abandon the child of hi marriag with adela da ivanovna not from malic nor becaus of hi matrimoni grievanc but simpli becaus he forgot him while he wa weari everi on with hi tear and complaint and turn hi hous into a sink of debaucheri a faith servant of the famili grigori took the three year old mitya into hi care if he hadn t look after him there would have been no on even to chang the babi s littl shirt it happen moreov that the child s relat on hi mother s side forgot him too at first hi grandfath wa no longer live hi widow mitya s grandmoth had move to moscow and wa serious ill while hi daughter were marri so that mitya remain for almost a whole year in old grigori s charg and live with him in the servant s cottag but if hi father had rememb him he could not inde have been altogeth unawar of hi exist he would have sent him back to the cottag as the child would onli have been in the wai of hi debaucheri but a cousin of mitya s mother pyotr alexandrovitch mi sov happen to return from pari he live for mani year afterward abroad but wa at that time quit a young man and distinguish among the mi sov as a man of enlighten idea and of european cultur who had been in the capit and abroad toward the end of hi life he becam a liber of the type common in the forti and fifti in the cours of hi career he had come into contact with mani of the most liber men of hi epoch both in russia and abroad he had known proudhon and bakunin person and in hi declin year wa veri fond of describ the three dai of the pari revolut of februari hint that he himself had almost taken part in the fight on the barricad thi wa on of the most grate recollect of hi youth he had an independ properti of about a thousand soul to reckon in the old style hi splendid estat lai on the outskirt of our littl town and border on the land of our famou monasteri with which pyotr alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit almost as soon as he came into the estat concern the right of fish in the river or wood cut in the forest i don t know exactli which he regard it as hi duti as a citizen and a man of cultur to open an attack upon the cleric hear all about adela da ivanovna whom he of cours rememb and in whom he had at on time been interest and learn of the exist of mitya he interven in spite of all hi youth indign and contempt for fyodor pavlovitch he made the latter s acquaint for the first time and told him directli that he wish to undertak the child s educ he us long afterward to tell as a characterist touch that when he began to speak of mitya fyodor pavlovitch look for some time as though he did not understand what child he wa talk about and even as though he wa surpris to hear that he had a littl son in the hous the stori mai have been exagger yet it must have been someth like the truth fyodor pavlovitch wa all hi life fond of act of suddenli plai an unexpect part sometim without ani motiv for do so and even to hi own direct disadvantag as for instanc in the present case thi habit howev is characterist of a veri great number of peopl some of them veri clever on not like fyodor pavlovitch pyotr alexandrovitch carri the busi through vigor and wa appoint with fyodor pavlovitch joint guardian of the child who had a small properti a hous and land left him by hi mother mitya did in fact pass into thi cousin s keep but as the latter had no famili of hi own and after secur the revenu of hi estat wa in hast to return at onc to pari he left the boi in charg of on of hi cousin a ladi live in moscow it came to pass that settl perman in pari he too forgot the child especi when the revolut of februari broke out make an impress on hi mind that he rememb all the rest of hi life the moscow ladi di and mitya pass into the care of on of her marri daughter i believ he chang hi home a fourth time later on i won t enlarg upon that now as i shall have much to tell later of fyodor pavlovitch s firstborn and must confin myself now to the most essenti fact about him without which i could not begin my stori in the first place thi mitya or rather dmitri fyodorovitch wa the onli on of fyodor pavlovitch s three son who grew up in the belief that he had properti and that he would be independ on come of ag he spent an irregular boyhood and youth he did not finish hi studi at the gymnasium he got into a militari school then went to the caucasu wa promot fought a duel and wa degrad to the rank earn promot again led a wild life and spent a good deal of monei he did not begin to receiv ani incom from fyodor pavlovitch until he came of ag and until then got into debt he saw and knew hi father fyodor pavlovitch for the first time on come of ag when he visit our neighborhood on purpos to settl with him about hi properti he seem not to have like hi father he did not stai long with him and made hast to get awai have onli succeed in obtain a sum of monei and enter into an agreement for futur payment from the estat of the revenu and valu of which he wa unabl a fact worthi of note upon thi occas to get a statement from hi father fyodor pavlovitch remark for the first time then thi too should be note that mitya had a vagu and exagger idea of hi properti fyodor pavlovitch wa veri well satisfi with thi as it fell in with hi own design he gather onli that the young man wa frivol unruli of violent passion impati and dissip and that if he could onli obtain readi monei he would be satisfi although onli of cours for a short time so fyodor pavlovitch began to take advantag of thi fact send him from time to time small dole instal in the end when four year later mitya lose patienc came a second time to our littl town to settl up onc for all with hi father it turn out to hi amaz that he had noth that it wa difficult to get an account even that he had receiv the whole valu of hi properti in sum of monei from fyodor pavlovitch and wa perhap even in debt to him that by variou agreement into which he had of hi own desir enter at variou previou date he had no right to expect anyth more and so on and so on the young man wa overwhelm suspect deceit and cheat and wa almost besid himself and inde thi circumst led to the catastroph the account of which form the subject of my first introductori stori or rather the extern side of it but befor i pass to that stori i must sai a littl of fyodor pavlovitch s other two son and of their origin chapter iii the second marriag and the second famili veri shortli after get hi four year old mitya off hi hand fyodor pavlovitch marri a second time hi second marriag last eight year he took thi second wife sofya ivanovna also a veri young girl from anoth provinc where he had gone upon some small piec of busi in compani with a jew though fyodor pavlovitch wa a drunkard and a viciou debauche he never neglect invest hi capit and manag hi busi affair veri successfulli though no doubt not over scrupul sofya ivanovna wa the daughter of an obscur deacon and wa left from childhood an orphan without relat she grew up in the hous of a gener s widow a wealthi old ladi of good posit who wa at onc her benefactress and tormentor i do not know the detail but i have onli heard that the orphan girl a meek and gentl creatur wa onc cut down from a halter in which she wa hang from a nail in the loft so terribl were her suffer from the capric and everlast nag of thi old woman who wa appar not bad heart but had becom an insuffer tyrant through idl fyodor pavlovitch made her an offer inquiri were made about him and he wa refus but again as in hi first marriag he propos an elop to the orphan girl there is veri littl doubt that she would not on ani account have marri him if she had known a littl more about him in time but she live in anoth provinc besid what could a littl girl of sixteen know about it except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than remain with her benefactress so the poor child exchang a benefactress for a benefactor fyodor pavlovitch did not get a penni thi time for the gener s widow wa furiou she gave them noth and curs them both but he had not reckon on a dowri what allur him wa the remark beauti of the innoc girl abov all her innoc appear which had a peculiar attract for a viciou proflig who had hitherto admir onli the coarser type of feminin beauti those innoc ey slit my soul up like a razor he us to sai afterward with hi loathsom snigger in a man so deprav thi might of cours mean no more than sensual attract as he had receiv no dowri with hi wife and had so to speak taken her from the halter he did not stand on ceremoni with her make her feel that she had wrong him he took advantag of her phenomen meek and submiss to trampl on the elementari decenc of marriag he gather loos women into hi hous and carri on orgi of debaucheri in hi wife s presenc to show what a pass thing had come to i mai mention that grigori the gloomi stupid obstin argument servant who had alwai hate hi first mistress adela da ivanovna took the side of hi new mistress he champion her caus abus fyodor pavlovitch in a manner littl befit a servant and on on occas broke up the revel and drove all the disorderli women out of the hous in the end thi unhappi young woman kept in terror from her childhood fell into that kind of nervou diseas which is most frequent found in peasant women who ar said to be possess by devil at time after terribl fit of hyster she even lost her reason yet she bore fyodor pavlovitch two son ivan and alexei the eldest in the first year of marriag and the second three year later when she di littl alexei wa in hi fourth year and strang as it seem i know that he rememb hi mother all hi life like a dream of cours at her death almost exactli the same thing happen to the two littl boi as to their elder brother mitya thei were complet forgotten and abandon by their father thei were look after by the same grigori and live in hi cottag where thei were found by the tyrann old ladi who had brought up their mother she wa still aliv and had not all those eight year forgotten the insult done her all that time she wa obtain exact inform as to her sofya s manner of life and hear of her ill and hideou surround she declar aloud two or three time to her retain it serv her right god ha punish her for her ingratitud exactli three month after sofya ivanovna s death the gener s widow suddenli appear in our town and went straight to fyodor pavlovitch s hous she spent onli half an hour in the town but she did a great deal it wa even fyodor pavlovitch whom she had not seen for those eight year came in to her drunk the stori is that instantli upon see him without ani sort of explan she gave him two good resound slap on the face seiz him by a tuft of hair and shook him three time up and down then without a word she went straight to the cottag to the two boi see at the first glanc that thei were unwash and in dirti linen she promptli gave grigori too a box on the ear and announc that she would carri off both the children she wrap them just as thei were in a rug put them in the carriag and drove off to her own town grigori accept the blow like a devot slave without a word and when he escort the old ladi to her carriag he made her a low bow and pronounc impress that god would repai her for the orphan you ar a blockhead all the same the old ladi shout to him as she drove awai fyodor pavlovitch think it over decid that it wa a good thing and did not refus the gener s widow hi formal consent to ani proposit in regard to hi children s educ as for the slap she had given him he drove all over the town tell the stori it happen that the old ladi di soon after thi but she left the boi in her will a thousand roubl each for their instruct and so that all be spent on them exclus with the condit that it be so portion out as to last till thei ar twenti on for it is more than adequ provis for such children if other peopl think fit to throw awai their monei let them i have not read the will myself but i heard there wa someth queer of the sort veri whimsic express the princip heir yefim petrovitch polenov the marshal of nobil of the provinc turn out howev to be an honest man write to fyodor pavlovitch and discern at onc that he could extract noth from him for hi children s educ though the latter never directli refus but onli procrastin as he alwai did in such case and wa inde at time effus sentiment yefim petrovitch took a person interest in the orphan he becam especi fond of the younger alexei who live for a long while as on of hi famili i beg the reader to note thi from the begin and to yefim petrovitch a man of a generos and human rare to be met with the young peopl were more indebt for their educ and bring up than to ani on he kept the two thousand roubl left to them by the gener s widow intact so that by the time thei came of ag their portion had been doubl by the accumul of interest he educ them both at hi own expens and certainli spent far more than a thousand roubl upon each of them i won t enter into a detail account of their boyhood and youth but will onli mention a few of the most import event of the elder ivan i will onli sai that he grew into a somewhat moros and reserv though far from timid boi at ten year old he had realiz that thei were live not in their own home but on other peopl s chariti and that their father wa a man of whom it wa disgrac to speak thi boi began veri earli almost in hi infanc so thei sai at least to show a brilliant and unusu aptitud for learn i don t know precis why but he left the famili of yefim petrovitch when he wa hardli thirteen enter a moscow gymnasium and board with an experienc and celebr teacher an old friend of yefim petrovitch ivan us to declar afterward that thi wa all due to the ardor for good work of yefim petrovitch who wa captiv by the idea that the boi s geniu should be train by a teacher of geniu but neither yefim petrovitch nor thi teacher wa live when the young man finish at the gymnasium and enter the univers as yefim petrovitch had made no provis for the payment of the tyrann old ladi s legaci which had grown from on thousand to two it wa delai ow to formal inevit in russia and the young man wa in great strait for the first two year at the univers as he wa forc to keep himself all the time he wa studi it must be note that he did not even attempt to commun with hi father perhap from pride from contempt for him or perhap from hi cool common sens which told him that from such a father he would get no real assist howev that mai have been the young man wa by no mean despond and succeed in get work at first give sixpenni lesson and afterward get paragraph on street incid into the newspap under the signatur of ey wit these paragraph it wa said were so interest and piquant that thei were soon taken thi alon show the young man s practic and intellectu superior over the mass of needi and unfortun student of both sex who hang about the offic of the newspap and journal unabl to think of anyth better than everlast entreati for copi and translat from the french have onc got into touch with the editor ivan fyodorovitch alwai kept up hi connect with them and in hi latter year at the univers he publish brilliant review of book upon variou special subject so that he becam well known in literari circl but onli in hi last year he suddenli succeed in attract the attent of a far wider circl of reader so that a great mani peopl notic and rememb him it wa rather a curiou incid when he had just left the univers and wa prepar to go abroad upon hi two thousand roubl ivan fyodorovitch publish in on of the more import journal a strang articl which attract gener notic on a subject of which he might have been suppos to know noth as he wa a student of natur scienc the articl dealt with a subject which wa be debat everywher at the time the posit of the ecclesiast court after discuss sever opinion on the subject he went on to explain hi own view what wa most strike about the articl wa it tone and it unexpect conclus mani of the church parti regard him unquestioningli as on their side and yet not onli the secularist but even atheist join them in their applaus final some sagaci person opin that the articl wa noth but an impud satir burlesqu i mention thi incid particularli becaus thi articl penetr into the famou monasteri in our neighborhood where the inmat be particularli interest in the question of the ecclesiast court were complet bewild by it learn the author s name thei were interest in hi be a nativ of the town and the son of that fyodor pavlovitch and just then it wa that the author himself made hi appear among us why ivan fyodorovitch had come amongst us i rememb ask myself at the time with a certain uneasi thi fate visit which wa the first step lead to so mani consequ i never fulli explain to myself it seem strang on the face of it that a young man so learn so proud and appar so cautiou should suddenli visit such an infam hous and a father who had ignor him all hi life hardli knew him never thought of him and would not under ani circumst have given him monei though he wa alwai afraid that hi son ivan and alexei would also come to ask him for it and here the young man wa stai in the hous of such a father had been live with him for two month and thei were on the best possibl term thi last fact wa a special caus of wonder to mani other as well as to me pyotr alexandrovitch mi sov of whom we have spoken alreadi the cousin of fyodor pavlovitch s first wife happen to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to hi estat he had come from pari which wa hi perman home i rememb that he wa more surpris than ani on when he made the acquaint of the young man who interest him extrem and with whom he sometim argu and not without an inner pang compar himself in acquir he is proud he us to sai he will never be in want of penc he ha got monei enough to go abroad now what doe he want here everi on can see that he hasn t come for monei for hi father would never give him ani he ha no tast for drink and dissip and yet hi father can t do without him thei get on so well togeth that wa the truth the young man had an unmistak influenc over hi father who posit appear to be behav more decent and even seem at time readi to obei hi son though often extrem and even spitefulli pervers it wa onli later that we learn that ivan had come partli at the request of and in the interest of hi elder brother dmitri whom he saw for the first time on thi veri visit though he had befor leav moscow been in correspond with him about an import matter of more concern to dmitri than himself what that busi wa the reader will learn fulli in due time yet even when i did know of thi special circumst i still felt ivan fyodorovitch to be an enigmat figur and thought hi visit rather mysteri i mai add that ivan appear at the time in the light of a mediat between hi father and hi elder brother dmitri who wa in open quarrel with hi father and even plan to bring an action against him the famili i repeat wa now unit for the first time and some of it member met for the first time in their live the younger brother alexei had been a year alreadi among us have been the first of the three to arriv it is of that brother alexei i find it most difficult to speak in thi introduct yet i must give some preliminari account of him if onli to explain on queer fact which is that i have to introduc my hero to the reader wear the cassock of a novic ye he had been for the last year in our monasteri and seem will to be cloister there for the rest of hi life chapter iv the third son alyosha he wa onli twenti hi brother ivan wa in hi twenti fourth year at the time while their elder brother dmitri wa twenti seven first of all i must explain that thi young man alyosha wa not a fanat and in my opinion at least wa not even a mystic i mai as well give my full opinion from the begin he wa simpli an earli lover of human and that he adopt the monast life wa simpli becaus at that time it struck him so to sai as the ideal escap for hi soul struggl from the dark of worldli wicked to the light of love and the reason thi life struck him in thi wai wa that he found in it at that time as he thought an extraordinari be our celebr elder zossima to whom he becam attach with all the warm first love of hi ardent heart but i do not disput that he wa veri strang even at that time and had been so inde from hi cradl i have mention alreadi by the wai that though he lost hi mother in hi fourth year he rememb her all hi life her face her caress as though she stood live befor me such memori mai persist as everi on know from an even earlier ag even from two year old but scarc stand out through a whole lifetim like spot of light out of dark like a corner torn out of a huge pictur which ha all fade and disappear except that fragment that is how it wa with him he rememb on still summer even an open window the slant rai of the set sun that he recal most vividli of all in a corner of the room the holi imag befor it a light lamp and on her knee befor the imag hi mother sob hyster with cri and moan snatch him up in both arm squeez him close till it hurt and prai for him to the mother of god hold him out in both arm to the imag as though to put him under the mother s protect and suddenli a nurs run in and snatch him from her in terror that wa the pictur and alyosha rememb hi mother s face at that minut he us to sai that it wa frenzi but beauti as he rememb but he rare care to speak of thi memori to ani on in hi childhood and youth he wa by no mean expans and talk littl inde but not from shyness or a sullen unsoci quit the contrari from someth differ from a sort of inner preoccup entir person and unconcern with other peopl but so import to him that he seem as it were to forget other on account of it but he wa fond of peopl he seem throughout hi life to put implicit trust in peopl yet no on ever look on him as a simpleton or na ve person there wa someth about him which made on feel at onc and it wa so all hi life afterward that he did not care to be a judg of other that he would never take it upon himself to critic and would never condemn ani on for anyth he seem inde to accept everyth without the least condemn though often griev bitterli and thi wa so much so that no on could surpris or frighten him even in hi earliest youth come at twenti to hi father s hous which wa a veri sink of filthi debaucheri he chast and pure as he wa simpli withdrew in silenc when to look on wa unbear but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemn hi father who had onc been in a depend posit and so wa sensit and readi to take offens met him at first with distrust and sullen he doe not sai much he us to sai and think the more but soon within a fortnight inde he took to embrac him and kiss him terribl often with drunken tear with sottish sentiment yet he evid felt a real and deep affect for him such as he had never been capabl of feel for ani on befor everi on inde love thi young man wherev he went and it wa so from hi earliest childhood when he enter the household of hi patron and benefactor yefim petrovitch polenov he gain the heart of all the famili so that thei look on him quit as their own child yet he enter the hous at such a tender ag that he could not have act from design nor art in win affect so that the gift of make himself love directli and unconsci wa inher in him in hi veri natur so to speak it wa the same at school though he seem to be just on of those children who ar distrust sometim ridicul and even dislik by their schoolfellow he wa dreami for instanc and rather solitari from hi earliest childhood he wa fond of creep into a corner to read and yet he wa a gener favorit all the while he wa at school he wa rare play or merri but ani on could see at the first glanc that thi wa not from ani sullen on the contrari he wa bright and good temper he never tri to show off among hi schoolfellow perhap becaus of thi he wa never afraid of ani on yet the boi immedi understood that he wa not proud of hi fearless and seem to be unawar that he wa bold and courag he never resent an insult it would happen that an hour after the offens he would address the offend or answer some question with as trust and candid an express as though noth had happen between them and it wa not that he seem to have forgotten or intention forgiven the affront but simpli that he did not regard it as an affront and thi complet conquer and captiv the boi he had on characterist which made all hi schoolfellow from the bottom class to the top want to mock at him not from malic but becaus it amus them thi characterist wa a wild fanat modesti and chastiti he could not bear to hear certain word and certain convers about women there ar certain word and convers unhappili imposs to erad in school boi pure in mind and heart almost children ar fond of talk in school among themselv and even aloud of thing pictur and imag of which even soldier would sometim hesit to speak more than that much that soldier have no knowledg or concept of is familiar to quit young children of our intellectu and higher class there is no moral deprav no real corrupt inner cynic in it but there is the appear of it and it is often look upon among them as someth refin subtl dare and worthi of imit see that alyosha karamazov put hi finger in hi ear when thei talk of that thei us sometim to crowd round him pull hi hand awai and shout nasti into both ear while he struggl slip to the floor tri to hide himself without utter on word of abus endur their insult in silenc but at last thei left him alon and gave up taunt him with be a regular girl and what s more thei look upon it with compass as a weak he wa alwai on of the best in the class but wa never first at the time of yefim petrovitch s death alyosha had two more year to complet at the provinci gymnasium the inconsol widow went almost immedi after hi death for a long visit to itali with her whole famili which consist onli of women and girl alyosha went to live in the hous of two distant relat of yefim petrovitch ladi whom he had never seen befor on what term he live with them he did not know himself it wa veri characterist of him inde that he never care at whose expens he wa live in that respect he wa a strike contrast to hi elder brother ivan who struggl with poverti for hi first two year in the univers maintain himself by hi own effort and had from childhood been bitterli consciou of live at the expens of hi benefactor but thi strang trait in alyosha s charact must not i think be critic too sever for at the slightest acquaint with him ani on would have perceiv that alyosha wa on of those youth almost of the type of religi enthusiast who if thei were suddenli to come into possess of a larg fortun would not hesit to give it awai for the ask either for good work or perhap to a clever rogu in gener he seem scarc to know the valu of monei not of cours in a liter sens when he wa given pocket monei which he never ask for he wa either terribl careless of it so that it wa gone in a moment or he kept it for week togeth not know what to do with it in later year pyotr alexandrovitch mi sov a man veri sensit on the score of monei and bourgeoi honesti pronounc the follow judgment after get to know alyosha here is perhap the on man in the world whom you might leav alon without a penni in the center of an unknown town of a million inhabit and he would not come to harm he would not die of cold and hunger for he would be fed and shelter at onc and if he were not he would find a shelter for himself and it would cost him no effort or humili and to shelter him would be no burden but on the contrari would probabl be look on as a pleasur he did not finish hi studi at the gymnasium a year befor the end of the cours he suddenli announc to the ladi that he wa go to see hi father about a plan which had occur to him thei were sorri and unwil to let him go the journei wa not an expens on and the ladi would not let him pawn hi watch a part present from hi benefactor s famili thei provid him liber with monei and even fit him out with new cloth and linen but he return half the monei thei gave him sai that he intend to go third class on hi arriv in the town he made no answer to hi father s first inquiri why he had come befor complet hi studi and seem so thei sai unusu thought it soon becam appar that he wa look for hi mother s tomb he practic acknowledg at the time that that wa the onli object of hi visit but it can hardli have been the whole reason of it it is more probabl that he himself did not understand and could not explain what had suddenli arisen in hi soul and drawn him irresist into a new unknown but inevit path fyodor pavlovitch could not show him where hi second wife wa buri for he had never visit her grave sinc he had thrown earth upon her coffin and in the cours of year had entir forgotten where she wa buri fyodor pavlovitch by the wai had for some time previous not been live in our town three or four year after hi wife s death he had gone to the south of russia and final turn up in odessa where he spent sever year he made the acquaint at first in hi own word of a lot of low jew jewess and jewkin and end by be receiv by jew high and low alik it mai be presum that at thi period he develop a peculiar faculti for make and hoard monei he final return to our town onli three year befor alyosha s arriv hi former acquaint found him look terribl ag although he wa by no mean an old man he behav not exactli with more digniti but with more effronteri the former buffoon show an insol propens for make buffoon of other hi deprav with women wa not simpli what it us to be but even more revolt in a short time he open a great number of new tavern in the district it wa evid that he had perhap a hundr thousand roubl or not much less mani of the inhabit of the town and district were soon in hi debt and of cours had given good secur of late too he look somehow bloat and seem more irrespons more uneven had sunk into a sort of incoher us to begin on thing and go on with anoth as though he were let himself go altogeth he wa more and more frequent drunk and if it had not been for the same servant grigori who by that time had ag consider too and us to look after him sometim almost like a tutor fyodor pavlovitch might have got into terribl scrape alyosha s arriv seem to affect even hi moral side as though someth had awaken in thi prematur old man which had long been dead in hi soul do you know he us often to sai look at alyosha that you ar like her the crazi woman that wa what he us to call hi dead wife alyosha s mother grigori it wa who point out the crazi woman s grave to alyosha he took him to our town cemeteri and show him in a remot corner a cast iron tombston cheap but decent kept on which were inscrib the name and ag of the deceas and the date of her death and below a four line vers such as ar commonli us on old fashion middl class tomb to alyosha s amaz thi tomb turn out to be grigori s do he had put it up on the poor crazi woman s grave at hi own expens after fyodor pavlovitch whom he had often pester about the grave had gone to odessa abandon the grave and all hi memori alyosha show no particular emot at the sight of hi mother s grave he onli listen to grigori s minut and solemn account of the erect of the tomb he stood with bow head and walk awai without utter a word it wa perhap a year befor he visit the cemeteri again but thi littl episod wa not without an influenc upon fyodor pavlovitch and a veri origin on he suddenli took a thousand roubl to our monasteri to pai for requiem for the soul of hi wife but not for the second alyosha s mother the crazi woman but for the first adela da ivanovna who us to thrash him in the even of the same dai he got drunk and abus the monk to alyosha he himself wa far from be religi he had probabl never put a penni candl befor the imag of a saint strang impuls of sudden feel and sudden thought ar common in such type i have mention alreadi that he look bloat hi counten at thi time bore trace of someth that testifi unmistak to the life he had led besid the long fleshi bag under hi littl alwai insol suspici and iron ey besid the multitud of deep wrinkl in hi littl fat face the adam s appl hung below hi sharp chin like a great fleshi goiter which gave him a peculiar repuls sensual appear add to that a long rapaci mouth with full lip between which could be seen littl stump of black decai teeth he slobber everi time he began to speak he wa fond inde of make fun of hi own face though i believ he wa well satisfi with it he us particularli to point to hi nose which wa not veri larg but veri delic and conspicu aquilin a regular roman nose he us to sai with my goiter i ve quit the counten of an ancient roman patrician of the decad period he seem proud of it not long after visit hi mother s grave alyosha suddenli announc that he want to enter the monasteri and that the monk were will to receiv him as a novic he explain that thi wa hi strong desir and that he wa solemnli ask hi consent as hi father the old man knew that the elder zossima who wa live in the monasteri hermitag had made a special impress upon hi gentl boi that is the most honest monk among them of cours he observ after listen in thought silenc to alyosha and seem scarc surpris at hi request h m so that s where you want to be my gentl boi he wa half drunk and suddenli he grin hi slow half drunken grin which wa not without a certain cun and tipsi slyness h m i had a presenti that you would end in someth like thi would you believ it you were make straight for it well to be sure you have your own two thousand that s a dowri for you and i ll never desert you my angel and i ll pai what s want for you there if thei ask for it but of cours if thei don t ask why should we worri them what do you sai you know you spend monei like a canari two grain a week h m do you know that near on monasteri there s a place outsid the town where everi babi know there ar none but the monk wive live as thei ar call thirti women i believ i have been there myself you know it s interest in it own wai of cours as a varieti the worst of it is it s awfulli russian there ar no french women there of cours thei could get them fast enough thei have plenti of monei if thei get to hear of it thei ll come along well there s noth of that sort here no monk wive and two hundr monk thei re honest thei keep the fast i admit it h m so you want to be a monk and do you know i m sorri to lose you alyosha would you believ it i ve realli grown fond of you well it s a good opportun you ll prai for us sinner we have sin too much here i ve alwai been think who would prai for me and whether there s ani on in the world to do it my dear boi i m awfulli stupid about that you wouldn t believ it awfulli you see howev stupid i am about it i keep think i keep think from time to time of cours not all the while it s imposs i think for the devil to forget to drag me down to hell with their hook when i die then i wonder hook where would thei get them what of iron hook where do thei forg them have thei a foundri there of some sort the monk in the monasteri probabl believ that there s a ceil in hell for instanc now i m readi to believ in hell but without a ceil it make it more refin more enlighten more lutheran that is and after all what doe it matter whether it ha a ceil or hasn t but do you know there s a damnabl question involv in it if there s no ceil there can be no hook and if there ar no hook it all break down which is unlik again for then there would be none to drag me down to hell and if thei don t drag me down what justic is there in the world il faudrait le invent those hook on purpos for me alon for if you onli knew alyosha what a blackguard i am but there ar no hook there said alyosha look gentli and serious at hi father ye ye onli the shadow of hook i know i know that s how a frenchman describ hell j ai bu l ombr d un cocher qui avec l ombr d un bross frottait l ombr d un carross how do you know there ar no hook darl when you ve live with the monk you ll sing a differ tune but go and get at the truth there and then come and tell me anywai it s easier go to the other world if on know what there is there besid it will be more seemli for you with the monk than here with me with a drunken old man and young harlot though you re like an angel noth touch you and i dare sai noth will touch you there that s why i let you go becaus i hope for that you ve got all your wit about you you will burn and you will burn out you will be heal and come back again and i will wait for you i feel that you re the onli creatur in the world who ha not condemn me my dear boi i feel it you know i can t help feel it and he even began blubber he wa sentiment he wa wick and sentiment chapter v elder some of my reader mai imagin that my young man wa a sickli ecstat poorli develop creatur a pale consumpt dreamer on the contrari alyosha wa at thi time a well grown red cheek clear ei lad of nineteen radiant with health he wa veri handsom too grace moder tall with hair of a dark brown with a regular rather long oval shape face and wide set dark grai shine ey he wa veri thought and appar veri seren i shall be told perhap that red cheek ar not incompat with fanatic and mystic but i fanci that alyosha wa more of a realist than ani on oh no doubt in the monasteri he fulli believ in miracl but to my think miracl ar never a stumbl block to the realist it is not miracl that dispos realist to belief the genuin realist if he is an unbeliev will alwai find strength and abil to disbeliev in the miracul and if he is confront with a miracl as an irrefut fact he would rather disbeliev hi own sens than admit the fact even if he admit it he admit it as a fact of natur till then unrecogn by him faith doe not in the realist spring from the miracl but the miracl from faith if the realist onc believ then he is bound by hi veri realism to admit the miracul also the apostl thoma said that he would not believ till he saw but when he did see he said my lord and my god wa it the miracl forc him to believ most like not but he believ sole becaus he desir to believ and possibl he fulli believ in hi secret heart even when he said i do not believ till i see i shall be told perhap that alyosha wa stupid undevelop had not finish hi studi and so on that he did not finish hi studi is true but to sai that he wa stupid or dull would be a great injustic i ll simpli repeat what i have said abov he enter upon thi path onli becaus at that time it alon struck hi imagin and present itself to him as offer an ideal mean of escap for hi soul from dark to light add to that that he wa to some extent a youth of our last epoch that is honest in natur desir the truth seek for it and believ in it and seek to serv it at onc with all the strength of hi soul seek for immedi action and readi to sacrific everyth life itself for it though these young men unhappili fail to understand that the sacrific of life is in mani case the easiest of all sacrific and that to sacrific for instanc five or six year of their seeth youth to hard and tediou studi if onli to multipli tenfold their power of serv the truth and the caus thei have set befor them as their goal such a sacrific is utterli beyond the strength of mani of them the path alyosha chose wa a path go in the opposit direct but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achiev as soon as he reflect serious he wa convinc of the exist of god and immort and at onc he instinct said to himself i want to live for immort and i will accept no compromis in the same wai if he had decid that god and immort did not exist he would at onc have becom an atheist and a socialist for social is not mere the labor question it is befor all thing the atheist question the question of the form taken by atheism to dai the question of the tower of babel built without god not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth alyosha would have found it strang and imposs to go on live as befor it is written give all that thou hast to the poor and follow me if thou wouldst be perfect alyosha said to himself i can t give two roubl instead of all and onli go to mass instead of follow him perhap hi memori of childhood brought back our monasteri to which hi mother mai have taken him to mass perhap the slant sunlight and the holi imag to which hi poor crazi mother had held him up still act upon hi imagin brood on these thing he mai have come to us perhap onli to see whether here he could sacrific all or onli two roubl and in the monasteri he met thi elder i must digress to explain what an elder is in russian monasteri and i am sorri that i do not feel veri compet to do so i will try howev to give a superfici account of it in a few word author on the subject assert that the institut of elder is of recent date not more than a hundr year old in our monasteri though in the orthodox east especi in sinai and atho it ha exist over a thousand year it is maintain that it exist in ancient time in russia also but through the calam which overtook russia the tartar civil war the interrupt of relat with the east after the destruct of constantinopl thi institut fell into oblivion it wa reviv among us toward the end of last centuri by on of the great ascet as thei call him pa ssy velitchkovski and hi discipl but to thi dai it exist in few monasteri onli and ha sometim been almost persecut as an innov in russia it flourish especi in the celebr kozelski optin monasteri when and how it wa introduc into our monasteri i cannot sai there had alreadi been three such elder and zossima wa the last of them but he wa almost dy of weak and diseas and thei had no on to take hi place the question for our monasteri wa an import on for it had not been distinguish by anyth in particular till then thei had neither relic of saint nor wonder work ikon nor gloriou tradit nor histor exploit it had flourish and been gloriou all over russia through it elder to see and hear whom pilgrim had flock for thousand of mile from all part what wa such an elder an elder wa on who took your soul your will into hi soul and hi will when you choos an elder you renounc your own will and yield it to him in complet submiss complet self abneg thi noviti thi terribl school of abneg is undertaken voluntarili in the hope of self conquest of self masteri in order after a life of obedi to attain perfect freedom that is from self to escap the lot of those who have live their whole life without find their true selv in themselv thi institut of elder is not found on theori but wa establish in the east from the practic of a thousand year the oblig due to an elder ar not the ordinari obedi which ha alwai exist in our russian monasteri the oblig involv confess to the elder by all who have submit themselv to him and to the indissolubl bond between him and them the stori is told for instanc that in the earli dai of christian on such novic fail to fulfil some command laid upon him by hi elder left hi monasteri in syria and went to egypt there after great exploit he wa found worthi at last to suffer tortur and a martyr s death for the faith when the church regard him as a saint wa buri him suddenli at the deacon s exhort depart all ye unbapt the coffin contain the martyr s bodi left it place and wa cast forth from the church and thi took place three time and onli at last thei learnt that thi holi man had broken hi vow of obedi and left hi elder and therefor could not be forgiven without the elder s absolut in spite of hi great deed onli after thi could the funer take place thi of cours is onli an old legend but here is a recent instanc a monk wa suddenli command by hi elder to quit atho which he love as a sacr place and a haven of refug and to go first to jerusalem to do homag to the holi place and then to go to the north to siberia there is the place for thee and not here the monk overwhelm with sorrow went to the cumen patriarch at constantinopl and besought him to releas him from hi obedi but the patriarch repli that not onli wa he unabl to releas him but there wa not and could not be on earth a power which could releas him except the elder who had himself laid that duti upon him in thi wai the elder ar endow in certain case with unbound and inexplic author that is why in mani of our monasteri the institut wa at first resist almost to persecut meantim the elder immedi began to be highli esteem among the peopl mass of the ignor peopl as well as men of distinct flock for instanc to the elder of our monasteri to confess their doubt their sin and their suffer and ask for counsel and admonit see thi the oppon of the elder declar that the sacrament of confess wa be arbitrarili and frivol degrad though the continu open of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had noth of the charact of the sacrament in the end howev the institut of elder ha been retain and is becom establish in russian monasteri it is true perhap that thi instrument which had stood the test of a thousand year for the moral regener of a man from slaveri to freedom and to moral perfect mai be a two edg weapon and it mai lead some not to humil and complet self control but to the most satan pride that is to bondag and not to freedom the elder zossima wa sixti five he came of a famili of landown had been in the armi in earli youth and serv in the caucasu as an offic he had no doubt impress alyosha by some peculiar qualiti of hi soul alyosha live in the cell of the elder who wa veri fond of him and let him wait upon him it must be note that alyosha wa bound by no oblig and could go where he pleas and be absent for whole dai though he wore the monast dress it wa voluntarili not to be differ from other no doubt he like to do so possibl hi youth imagin wa deepli stir by the power and fame of hi elder it wa said that so mani peopl had for year past come to confess their sin to father zossima and to entreat him for word of advic and heal that he had acquir the keenest intuit and could tell from an unknown face what a new comer want and what wa the suffer on hi conscienc he sometim astound and almost alarm hi visitor by hi knowledg of their secret befor thei had spoken a word alyosha notic that mani almost all went in to the elder for the first time with apprehens and uneasi but came out with bright and happi face alyosha wa particularli struck by the fact that father zossima wa not at all stern on the contrari he wa alwai almost gai the monk us to sai that he wa more drawn to those who were more sin and the greater the sinner the more he love him there were no doubt up to the end of hi life among the monk some who hate and envi him but thei were few in number and thei were silent though among them were some of great digniti in the monasteri on for instanc of the older monk distinguish for hi strict keep of fast and vow of silenc but the major were on father zossima s side and veri mani of them love him with all their heart warmli and sincer some were almost fanat devot to him and declar though not quit aloud that he wa a saint that there could be no doubt of it and see that hi end wa near thei anticip miracl and great glori to the monasteri in the immedi futur from hi relic alyosha had unquest faith in the miracul power of the elder just as he had unquest faith in the stori of the coffin that flew out of the church he saw mani who came with sick children or rel and besought the elder to lai hand on them and to prai over them return shortli after some the next dai and fall in tear at the elder s feet thank him for heal their sick whether thei had realli been heal or were simpli better in the natur cours of the diseas wa a question which did not exist for alyosha for he fulli believ in the spiritu power of hi teacher and rejoic in hi fame in hi glori as though it were hi own triumph hi heart throb and he beam as it were all over when the elder came out to the gate of the hermitag into the wait crowd of pilgrim of the humbler class who had flock from all part of russia on purpos to see the elder and obtain hi bless thei fell down befor him wept kiss hi feet kiss the earth on which he stood and wail while the women held up their children to him and brought him the sick possess with devil the elder spoke to them read a brief prayer over them bless them and dismiss them of late he had becom so weak through attack of ill that he wa sometim unabl to leav hi cell and the pilgrim wait for him to come out for sever dai alyosha did not wonder why thei love him so why thei fell down befor him and wept with emot mere at see hi face oh he understood that for the humbl soul of the russian peasant worn out by grief and toil and still more by the everlast injustic and everlast sin hi own and the world s it wa the greatest need and comfort to find some on or someth holi to fall down befor and worship among us there is sin injustic and temptat but yet somewher on earth there is some on holi and exalt he ha the truth he know the truth so it is not dead upon the earth so it will come on dai to us too and rule over all the earth accord to the promis alyosha knew that thi wa just how the peopl felt and even reason he understood it but that the elder zossima wa thi saint and custodian of god s truth of that he had no more doubt than the weep peasant and the sick women who held out their children to the elder the convict that after hi death the elder would bring extraordinari glori to the monasteri wa even stronger in alyosha than in ani on there and of late a kind of deep flame of inner ecstasi burnt more and more strongli in hi heart he wa not at all troubl at thi elder s stand as a solitari exampl befor him no matter he is holi he carri in hi heart the secret of renew for all that power which will at last establish truth on the earth and all men will be holi and love on anoth and there will be no more rich nor poor no exalt nor humbl but all will be as the children of god and the true kingdom of christ will come that wa the dream in alyosha s heart the arriv of hi two brother whom he had not known till then seem to make a great impress on alyosha he more quickli made friend with hi half brother dmitri though he arriv later than with hi own brother ivan he wa extrem interest in hi brother ivan but when the latter had been two month in the town though thei had met fairli often thei were still not intim alyosha wa natur silent and he seem to be expect someth asham about someth while hi brother ivan though alyosha notic at first that he look long and curious at him seem soon to have left off think of him alyosha notic it with some embarrass he ascrib hi brother s indiffer at first to the dispar of their ag and educ but he also wonder whether the absenc of curios and sympathi in ivan might be due to some other caus entir unknown to him he kept fanci that ivan wa absorb in someth someth inward and import that he wa strive toward some goal perhap veri hard to attain and that that wa why he had no thought for him alyosha wonder too whether there wa not some contempt on the part of the learn atheist for him a foolish novic he knew for certain that hi brother wa an atheist he could not take offens at thi contempt if it exist yet with an uneasi embarrass which he did not himself understand he wait for hi brother to come nearer to him dmitri us to speak of ivan with the deepest respect and with a peculiar earnest from him alyosha learnt all the detail of the import affair which had of late form such a close and remark bond between the two elder brother dmitri s enthusiast refer to ivan were the more strike in alyosha s ey sinc dmitri wa compar with ivan almost uneduc and the two brother were such a contrast in person and charact that it would be difficult to find two men more unlik it wa at thi time that the meet or rather gather of the member of thi inharmoni famili took place in the cell of the elder who had such an extraordinari influenc on alyosha the pretext for thi gather wa a fals on it wa at thi time that the discord between dmitri and hi father seem at it acutest stage and their relat had becom insuffer strain fyodor pavlovitch seem to have been the first to suggest appar in joke that thei should all meet in father zossima s cell and that without appeal to hi direct intervent thei might more decent come to an understand under the concili influenc of the elder s presenc dmitri who had never seen the elder natur suppos that hi father wa try to intimid him but as he secretli blame himself for hi outburst of temper with hi father on sever recent occas he accept the challeng it must be note that he wa not like ivan stai with hi father but live apart at the other end of the town it happen that pyotr alexandrovitch mi sov who wa stai in the district at the time caught eagerli at the idea a liber of the forti and fifti a freethink and atheist he mai have been led on by boredom or the hope of frivol divers he wa suddenli seiz with the desir to see the monasteri and the holi man as hi lawsuit with the monasteri still drag on he made it the pretext for see the superior in order to attempt to settl it amic a visitor come with such laudabl intent might be receiv with more attent and consider than if he came from simpl curios influenc from within the monasteri were brought to bear on the elder who of late had scarc left hi cell and had been forc by ill to deni even hi ordinari visitor in the end he consent to see them and the dai wa fix who ha made me a judg over them wa all he said smilingli to alyosha alyosha wa much perturb when he heard of the propos visit of all the wrangl quarrelsom parti dmitri wa the onli on who could regard the interview serious all the other would come from frivol motiv perhap insult to the elder alyosha wa well awar of that ivan and mi sov would come from curios perhap of the coarsest kind while hi father might be contempl some piec of buffooneri though he said noth alyosha thoroughli understood hi father the boi i repeat wa far from be so simpl as everi on thought him he await the dai with a heavi heart no doubt he wa alwai ponder in hi mind how the famili discord could be end but hi chief anxieti concern the elder he trembl for him for hi glori and dread ani affront to him especi the refin courteou ironi of mi sov and the supercili half utter of the highli educ ivan he even want to ventur on warn the elder tell him someth about them but on second thought said noth he onli sent word the dai befor through a friend to hi brother dmitri that he love him and expect him to keep hi promis dmitri wonder for he could not rememb what he had promis but he answer by letter that he would do hi utmost not to let himself be provok by vile but that although he had a deep respect for the elder and for hi brother ivan he wa convinc that the meet wa either a trap for him or an unworthi farc nevertheless i would rather bite out my tongu than be lack in respect to the saint man whom you rever so highli he wrote in conclus alyosha wa not greatli cheer by the letter book ii an unfortun gather chapter i thei arriv at the monasteri it wa a warm bright dai at the end of august the interview with the elder had been fix for half past eleven immedi after late mass our visitor did not take part in the servic but arriv just as it wa over first an eleg open carriag drawn by two valuabl hors drove up with mi sov and a distant rel of hi a young man of twenti call pyotr fomitch kalganov thi young man wa prepar to enter the univers mi sov with whom he wa stai for the time wa try to persuad him to go abroad to the univers of zurich or jena the young man wa still undecid he wa thought and absent mind he wa nice look strongli built and rather tall there wa a strang fixiti in hi gaze at time like all veri absent mind peopl he would

am not speak lightli now the thought of the life beyond the grave distract me to anguish to terror and i don t know to whom to appeal and have not dare to all my life and now i am so bold as to ask you oh god what will you think of me now she clasp her hand don t distress yourself about my opinion of you said the elder i quit believ in the sincer of your suffer oh how thank i am to you you see i shut my ey and ask myself if everi on ha faith where did it come from and then thei do sai that it all come from terror at the menac phenomena of natur and that none of it s real and i sai to myself what if i ve been believ all my life and when i come to die there s noth but the burdock grow on my grave as i read in some author it s aw how how can i get back my faith but i onli believ when i wa a littl child mechan without think of anyth how how is on to prove it i have come now to lai my soul befor you and to ask you about it if i let thi chanc slip no on all my life will answer me how can i prove it how can i convinc myself oh how unhappi i am i stand and look about me and see that scarc ani on els care no on troubl hi head about it and i m the onli on who can t stand it it s deadli deadli no doubt but there s no prove it though you can be convinc of it how by the experi of activ love strive to love your neighbor activ and indefatig in as far as you advanc in love you will grow surer of the realiti of god and of the immort of your soul if you attain to perfect self forget in the love of your neighbor then you will believ without doubt and no doubt can possibl enter your soul thi ha been tri thi is certain in activ love there s anoth question and such a question you see i so love human that would you believ it i often dream of forsak all that i have leav lise and becom a sister of merci i close my ey and think and dream and at that moment i feel full of strength to overcom all obstacl no wound no fester sore could at that moment frighten me i would bind them up and wash them with my own hand i would nurs the afflict i would be readi to kiss such wound it is much and well that your mind is full of such dream and not other sometim unawar you mai do a good deed in realiti ye but could i endur such a life for long the ladi went on fervent almost frantic that s the chief question that s my most agon question i shut my ey and ask myself would you persever long on that path and if the patient whose wound you ar wash did not meet you with gratitud but worri you with hi whim without valu or remark your charit servic began abus you and rude command you and complain to the superior author of you which often happen when peopl ar in great suffer what then would you persever in your love or not and do you know i came with horror to the conclus that if anyth could dissip my love to human it would be ingratitud in short i am a hire servant i expect my payment at onc that is prais and the repay of love with love otherwis i am incap of love ani on she wa in a veri paroxysm of self castig and conclud she look with defiant resolut at the elder it s just the same stori as a doctor onc told me observ the elder he wa a man get on in year and undoubtedli clever he spoke as frankli as you though in jest in bitter jest i love human he said but i wonder at myself the more i love human in gener the less i love man in particular in my dream he said i have often come to make enthusiast scheme for the servic of human and perhap i might actual have face crucifixion if it had been suddenli necessari and yet i am incap of live in the same room with ani on for two dai togeth as i know by experi as soon as ani on is near me hi person disturb my self complac and restrict my freedom in twenti four hour i begin to hate the best of men on becaus he s too long over hi dinner anoth becaus he ha a cold and keep on blow hi nose i becom hostil to peopl the moment thei come close to me but it ha alwai happen that the more i detest men individu the more ardent becom my love for human but what s to be done what can on do in such a case must on despair no it is enough that you ar distress at it do what you can and it will be reckon unto you much is done alreadi in you sinc you can so deepli and sincer know yourself if you have been talk to me so sincer simpli to gain approb for your frank as you did from me just now then of cours you will not attain to anyth in the achiev of real love it will all get no further than dream and your whole life will slip awai like a phantom in that case you will natur ceas to think of the futur life too and will of yourself grow calmer after a fashion in the end you have crush me onli now as you speak i understand that i wa realli onli seek your approb for my sincer when i told you i could not endur ingratitud you have reveal me to myself you have seen through me and explain me to myself ar you speak the truth well now after such a confess i believ that you ar sincer and good at heart if you do not attain happi alwai rememb that you ar on the right road and try not to leav it abov all avoid falsehood everi kind of falsehood especi fals to yourself watch over your own deceit and look into it everi hour everi minut avoid be scorn both to other and to yourself what seem to you bad within you will grow purer from the veri fact of your observ it in yourself avoid fear too though fear is onli the consequ of everi sort of falsehood never be frighten at your own faint hearted in attain love don t be frighten overmuch even at your evil action i am sorri i can sai noth more consol to you for love in action is a harsh and dread thing compar with love in dream love in dream is greedi for immedi action rapidli perform and in the sight of all men will even give their live if onli the ordeal doe not last long but is soon over with all look on and applaud as though on the stage but activ love is labor and fortitud and for some peopl too perhap a complet scienc but i predict that just when you see with horror that in spite of all your effort you ar get farther from your goal instead of nearer to it at that veri moment i predict that you will reach it and behold clearli the miracul power of the lord who ha been all the time love and mysteri guid you forgiv me for not be abl to stai longer with you thei ar wait for me good by the ladi wa weep lise lise bless her bless her she cri start up suddenli she doe not deserv to be love i have seen her naughti all along the elder said jestingli why have you been laugh at alexei lise had in fact been occupi in mock at him all the time she had notic befor that alyosha wa shy and tri not to look at her and she found thi extrem amus she wait intent to catch hi ey alyosha unabl to endur her persist stare wa irresist and suddenli drawn to glanc at her and at onc she smile triumphantli in hi face alyosha wa even more disconcert and vex at last he turn awai from her altogeth and hid behind the elder s back after a few minut drawn by the same irresist forc he turn again to see whether he wa be look at or not and found lise almost hang out of her chair to peep sidewai at him eagerli wait for him to look catch hi ey she laugh so that the elder could not help sai why do you make fun of him like that naughti girl lise suddenli and quit unexpectedli blush her ey flash and her face becam quit seriou she began speak quickli and nervous in a warm and resent voic why ha he forgotten everyth then he us to carri me about when i wa littl we us to plai togeth he us to come to teach me to read do you know two year ago when he went awai he said that he would never forget me that we were friend for ever for ever for ever and now he s afraid of me all at onc am i go to eat him why doesn t he want to come near me why doesn t he talk why won t he come and see us it s not that you won t let him we know that he goe everywher it s not good manner for me to invit him he ought to have thought of it first if he hasn t forgotten me no now he s save hi soul why have you put that long gown on him if he run he ll fall and suddenli she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresist prolong nervou inaud laughter the elder listen to her with a smile and bless her tenderli as she kiss hi hand she suddenli press it to her ey and began cry don t be angri with me i m silli and good for noth and perhap alyosha s right quit right in not want to come and see such a ridicul girl i will certainli send him said the elder chapter v so be it so be it the elder s absenc from hi cell had last for about twenti five minut it wa more than half past twelv but dmitri on whose account thei had all met there had still not appear but he seem almost to be forgotten and when the elder enter the cell again he found hi guest engag in eager convers ivan and the two monk took the lead share in it mi sov too wa try to take a part and appar veri eagerli in the convers but he wa unsuccess in thi also he wa evid in the background and hi remark were treat with neglect which increas hi irrit he had had intellectu encount with ivan befor and he could not endur a certain careless ivan show him hitherto at least i have stood in the front rank of all that is progress in europ and here the new gener posit ignor us he thought fyodor pavlovitch who had given hi word to sit still and be quiet had actual been quiet for some time but he watch hi neighbor mi sov with an iron littl smile obvious enjoi hi discomfitur he had been wait for some time to pai off old score and now he could not let the opportun slip bend over hi shoulder he began teas him again in a whisper why didn t you go awai just now after the courteous kiss why did you consent to remain in such unseemli compani it wa becaus you felt insult and aggriev and you remain to vindic yourself by show off your intellig now you won t go till you ve displai your intellect to them you again on the contrari i m just go you ll be the last the last of all to go fyodor pavlovitch deliv him anoth thrust almost at the moment of father zossima s return the discuss di down for a moment but the elder seat himself in hi former place look at them all as though cordial invit them to go on alyosha who knew everi express of hi face saw that he wa fearfulli exhaust and make a great effort of late he had been liabl to faint fit from exhaust hi face had the pallor that wa common befor such attack and hi lip were white but he evid did not want to break up the parti he seem to have some special object of hi own in keep them what object alyosha watch him intent we ar discuss thi gentleman s most interest articl said father iosif the librarian address the elder and indic ivan he bring forward much that is new but i think the argument cut both wai it is an articl written in answer to a book by an ecclesiast author on the question of the ecclesiast court and the scope of it jurisdict i m sorri i have not read your articl but i ve heard of it said the elder look keenli and intent at ivan he take up a most interest posit continu the father librarian as far as church jurisdict is concern he is appar quit oppos to the separ of church from state that s interest but in what sens father zossima ask ivan the latter at last answer him not condescendingli as alyosha had fear but with modesti and reserv with evid goodwil and appar without the slightest arri re pen e i start from the posit that thi confus of element that is of the essenti principl of church and state will of cours go on for ever in spite of the fact that it is imposs for them to mingl and that the confus of these element cannot lead to ani consist or even normal result for there is falsiti at the veri foundat of it compromis between the church and state in such question as for instanc jurisdict is to my think imposs in ani real sens my cleric oppon maintain that the church hold a precis and defin posit in the state i maintain on the contrari that the church ought to includ the whole state and not simpli to occupi a corner in it and if thi is for some reason imposs at present then it ought in realiti to be set up as the direct and chief aim of the futur develop of christian societi perfectli true father pa ssy the silent and learn monk assent with fervor and decis the purest ultramontan cri mi sov impati cross and recross hi leg oh well we have no mountain cri father iosif and turn to the elder he continu observ the answer he make to the follow fundament and essenti proposit of hi oppon who is you must note an ecclesiast first that no social organ can or ought to arrog to itself power to dispos of the civic and polit right of it member secondli that crimin and civil jurisdict ought not to belong to the church and is inconsist with it natur both as a divin institut and as an organ of men for religi object and final in the third place the church is a kingdom not of thi world a most unworthi plai upon word for an ecclesiast father pa ssy could not refrain from break in again i have read the book which you have answer he ad address ivan and wa astound at the word the church is a kingdom not of thi world if it is not of thi world then it cannot exist on earth at all in the gospel the word not of thi world ar not us in that sens to plai with such word is indefens our lord jesu christ came to set up the church upon earth the kingdom of heaven of cours is not of thi world but in heaven but it is onli enter through the church which ha been found and establish upon earth and so a frivol plai upon word in such a connect is unpardon and improp the church is in truth a kingdom and ordain to rule and in the end must undoubtedli becom the kingdom rule over all the earth for that we have the divin promis he ceas speak suddenli as though check himself after listen attent and respectfulli ivan went on address the elder with perfect composur and as befor with readi cordial the whole point of my articl li in the fact that dure the first three centuri christian onli exist on earth in the church and wa noth but the church when the pagan roman empir desir to becom christian it inevit happen that by becom christian it includ the church but remain a pagan state in veri mani of it depart in realiti thi wa bound to happen but rome as a state retain too much of the pagan civil and cultur as for exampl in the veri object and fundament principl of the state the christian church enter into the state could of cours surrend no part of it fundament principl the rock on which it stand and could pursu no other aim than those which have been ordain and reveal by god himself and among them that of draw the whole world and therefor the ancient pagan state itself into the church in that wai that is with a view to the futur it is not the church that should seek a definit posit in the state like everi social organ or as an organ of men for religi purpos as my oppon call the church but on the contrari everi earthli state should be in the end complet transform into the church and should becom noth els but a church reject everi purpos incongru with the aim of the church all thi will not degrad it in ani wai or take from it honor and glori as a great state nor from the glori of it ruler but onli turn it from a fals still pagan and mistaken path to the true and right path which alon lead to the etern goal thi is why the author of the book on the foundat of church jurisdict would have judg correctli if in seek and lai down those foundat he had look upon them as a temporari compromis inevit in our sin and imperfect dai but as soon as the author ventur to declar that the foundat which he predic now part of which father iosif just enumer ar the perman essenti and etern foundat he is go directli against the church and it sacr and etern vocat that is the gist of my articl that is in brief father pa ssy began again lai stress on each word accord to certain theori onli too clearli formul in the nineteenth centuri the church ought to be transform into the state as though thi would be an advanc from a lower to a higher form so as to disappear into it make wai for scienc for the spirit of the ag and civil and if the church resist and is unwil some corner will be set apart for her in the state and even that under control and thi will be so everywher in all modern european countri but russian hope and concept demand not that the church should pass as from a lower into a higher type into the state but on the contrari that the state should end by be worthi to becom onli the church and noth els so be it so be it well i confess you ve reassur me somewhat mi sov said smile again cross hi leg so far as i understand then the realiz of such an ideal is infinit remot at the second come of christ that s as you pleas it s a beauti utopian dream of the abolit of war diplomaci bank and so on someth after the fashion of social inde but i imagin that it wa all meant serious and that the church might be now go to try crimin and sentenc them to beat prison and even death but if there were none but the ecclesiast court the church would not even now sentenc a crimin to prison or to death crime and the wai of regard it would inevit chang not all at onc of cours but fairli soon ivan repli calmli without flinch ar you seriou mi sov glanc keenli at him if everyth becam the church the church would exclud all the crimin and disobedi and would not cut off their head ivan went on i ask you what would becom of the exclud he would be cut off then not onli from men as now but from christ by hi crime he would have transgress not onli against men but against the church of christ thi is so even now of cours strictli speak but it is not clearli enunci and veri veri often the crimin of to dai compromis with hi conscienc i steal he sai but i don t go against the church i m not an enemi of christ that s what the crimin of to dai is continu sai to himself but when the church take the place of the state it will be difficult for him in opposit to the church all over the world to sai all men ar mistaken all in error all mankind ar the fals church i a thief and murder am the onli true christian church it will be veri difficult to sai thi to himself it requir a rare combin of unusu circumst now on the other side take the church s own view of crime is it not bound to renounc the present almost pagan attitud and to chang from a mechan cut off of it taint member for the preserv of societi as at present into complet and honestli adopt the idea of the regener of the man of hi reform and salvat what do you mean i fail to understand again mi sov interrupt some sort of dream again someth shapeless and even incomprehens what is excommun what sort of exclus i suspect you ar simpli amus yourself ivan fyodorovitch ye but you know in realiti it is so now said the elder suddenli and all turn to him at onc if it were not for the church of christ there would be noth to restrain the crimin from evil do no real chastis for it afterward none that is but the mechan punish spoken of just now which in the major of case onli embitt the heart and not the real punish the onli effectu on the onli deterr and soften on which li in the recognit of sin by conscienc how is that mai on inquir ask mi sov with live curios why began the elder all these sentenc to exil with hard labor and formerli with flog also reform no on and what s more deter hardli a singl crimin and the number of crime doe not diminish but is continu on the increas you must admit that consequ the secur of societi is not preserv for although the obnoxi member is mechan cut off and sent far awai out of sight anoth crimin alwai come to take hi place at onc and often two of them if anyth doe preserv societi even in our time and doe regener and transform the crimin it is onli the law of christ speak in hi conscienc it is onli by recogn hi wrong do as a son of a christian societi that is of the church that he recogn hi sin against societi that is against the church so that it is onli against the church and not against the state that the crimin of to dai can recogn that he ha sin if societi as a church had jurisdict then it would know when to bring back from exclus and to reunit to itself now the church have no real jurisdict but onli the power of moral condemn withdraw of her own accord from punish the crimin activ she doe not excommun him but simpli persist in motherli exhort of him what is more the church even tri to preserv all christian communion with the crimin she admit him to church servic to the holi sacrament give him alm and treat him more as a captiv than as a convict and what would becom of the crimin o lord if even the christian societi that is the church were to reject him even as the civil law reject him and cut him off what would becom of him if the church punish him with her excommun as the direct consequ of the secular law there could be no more terribl despair at least for a russian crimin for russian crimin still have faith though who know perhap then a fear thing would happen perhap the despair heart of the crimin would lose it faith and then what would becom of him but the church like a tender love mother hold aloof from activ punish herself as the sinner is too sever punish alreadi by the civil law and there must be at least some on to have piti on him the church hold aloof abov all becaus it judgment is the onli on that contain the truth and therefor cannot practic and moral be unit to ani other judgment even as a temporari compromis she can enter into no compact about that the foreign crimin thei sai rare repent for the veri doctrin of to dai confirm him in the idea that hi crime is not a crime but onli a reaction against an unjustli oppress forc societi cut him off complet by a forc that triumph over him mechan and so at least thei sai of themselv in europ accompani thi exclus with hatr forget and the most profound indiffer as to the ultim fate of the er brother in thi wai it all take place without the compassion intervent of the church for in mani case there ar no church there at all for though ecclesiast and splendid church build remain the church themselv have long ago striven to pass from church into state and to disappear in it complet so it seem at least in lutheran countri as for rome it wa proclaim a state instead of a church a thousand year ago and so the crimin is no longer consciou of be a member of the church and sink into despair if he return to societi often it is with such hatr that societi itself instinct cut him off you can judg for yourself how it must end in mani case it would seem to be the same with us but the differ is that besid the establish law court we have the church too which alwai keep up relat with the crimin as a dear and still preciou son and besid that there is still preserv though onli in thought the judgment of the church which though no longer exist in practic is still live as a dream for the futur and is no doubt instinct recogn by the crimin in hi soul what wa said here just now is true too that is that if the jurisdict of the church were introduc in practic in it full forc that is if the whole of the societi were chang into the church not onli the judgment of the church would have influenc on the reform of the crimin such as it never ha now but possibl also the crime themselv would be incred diminish and there can be no doubt that the church would look upon the crimin and the crime of the futur in mani case quit differ and would succe in restor the exclud in restrain those who plan evil and in regener the fallen it is true said father zossima with a smile the christian societi now is not readi and is onli rest on some seven righteou men but as thei ar never lack it will continu still unshaken in expect of it complet transform from a societi almost heathen in charact into a singl univers and all power church so be it so be it even though at the end of the ag for it is ordain to come to pass and there is no need to be troubl about time and season for the secret of the time and season is in the wisdom of god in hi foresight and hi love and what in human reckon seem still afar off mai by the divin ordin be

with some open to a certain extent onli of cours he wa rather courteou than open as frenchmen know how to be courteou especi to a foreign but i thoroughli understood him the subject wa the socialist revolutionari who were at that time persecut i will quot onli on most curiou remark drop by thi person we ar not particularli afraid said he of all these socialist anarchist infidel and revolutionist we keep watch on them and know all their go on but there ar a few peculiar men among them who believ in god and ar christian but at the same time ar socialist these ar the peopl we ar most afraid of thei ar dread peopl the socialist who is a christian is more to be dread than a socialist who is an atheist the word struck me at the time and now thei have suddenli come back to me here gentlemen you appli them to us and look upon us as socialist father pa ssy ask directli without beat about the bush but befor pyotr alexandrovitch could think what to answer the door open and the guest so long expect dmitri fyodorovitch came in thei had in fact given up expect him and hi sudden appear caus some surpris for a moment chapter vi why is such a man aliv dmitri fyodorovitch a young man of eight

hi ey somehow did not follow hi mood but betrai someth els sometim quit incongru with what wa pass it s hard to tell what he s think those who talk to him sometim declar peopl who saw someth pensiv and sullen in hi ey were startl by hi sudden laugh which bore wit to mirth and light heart thought at the veri time when hi ey were so gloomi a certain strain look in hi face wa easi to understand at thi moment everi on knew or had heard of the extrem restless and dissip life which he had been lead of late as well as of the violent anger to which he had been rous in hi quarrel with hi father there were sever stori current in the town about it it is true that he wa irasc by natur of an unstabl and unbalanc mind as our justic of the peac katchalnikov happili describ him he wa stylishli and irreproach dress in a carefulli button frock coat he wore black glove and carri a top hat have onli late left the armi he still had mustach and no beard hi dark brown hair wa crop short and comb

taken no more than two minut and the convers wa resum but thi time mi sov thought it unnecessari to repli to father pa ssy s persist and almost irrit question allow me to withdraw from thi discuss he observ with a certain well bred nonchal it s a subtl question too here ivan fyodorovitch is smile at us he must have someth interest to sai about that also ask him noth special except on littl remark ivan repli at onc european liber in gener and even our liber dilettanti often mix up the final result of social with those of christian thi wild notion is of cours a characterist featur but it s not onli liber and dilettanti who mix up social and christian but in mani case it appear the polic the foreign polic of cours do the same your pari anecdot is rather to the point pyotr alexandrovitch i ask your permiss to drop thi subject altogeth mi sov repeat i will tell you instead gentlemen anoth interest and rather characterist anecdot of ivan fyodorovitch himself onli five dai ago in a gather

had been ani love on earth hitherto it wa not ow to a natur law but simpli becaus men have believ in immort ivan fyodorovitch ad in parenthesi that the whole natur law li in that faith and that if you were to destroi in mankind the belief in immort not onli love but everi live forc maintain the life of the world would at onc be dri up moreov noth then would be immor everyth would be law even cannib that s not all he end by assert that for everi individu like ourselv who doe not believ in god or immort the moral law of natur must immedi be chang into the exact contrari of the former religi law

to god ilya s employ and mani other in the town especi of the tradespeopl tri to cloth her better and alwai rig her out with high boot and sheepskin coat for the winter but although she allow them to dress her up without resist she usual went awai prefer to the cathedr porch and take off all that had been given her kerchief sheepskin skirt or boot she left them there and walk awai barefoot in her

night and slept either in the passag or the cowhous peopl were amaz that she could stand such a life but she wa accustom to it and although she wa so tini she wa of a robust constitut some of the townspeopl declar that she did all thi onli from pride but that is hardli credibl she could hardli speak and onli from time to time utter an inarticul grunt how could she have been proud it happen on clear warm moonlight night in septemb mani year ago five or six drunken revel were return from the club at a veri late hour accord to our provinci notion thei pass through the back wai which led between the back garden of the hous with hurdl on either side thi wai lead out on to the bridg over the long stink pool which we were accustom to call a river among the nettl and burdock under the hurdl our revel saw lizaveta asleep thei stop to look at her laugh and began jest with unbridl licenti it occur to on young gentleman to make the whimsic inquiri whether ani on could possibl look upon such an anim as a woman and so forth thei all pronounc with lofti repugn that it wa imposs but fyodor pavlovitch who wa among them sprang forward and declar that it wa by no mean imposs and that inde there wa a certain piquanc about it and so on it is true that at that time he wa overdo hi part as a buffoon he like to put himself forward and entertain the compani ostens on equal term of cours though in realiti he wa on a servil foot with them it wa just at the time when he had receiv the new of hi first wife s death in petersburg and with crape upon hi hat wa drink and behav so shamelessli that even the most reckless among us were shock at the sight of him the revel of cours laugh at thi unexpect opinion and on of them even began challeng him to act upon it the other repel the idea even more emphat although still with the utmost hilar and at last thei went on their wai later on fyodor pavlovitch swore that he had gone with them and perhap it wa so no on know for certain and no on ever knew but five or six month later all the town wa talk with intens and sincer indign of lizaveta s condit and try to find out who wa the miscreant who had wrong her then suddenli a terribl rumor

the muddi courtyard three hundr roubl note which he had onli just receiv he onli miss them next dai and wa just hasten to search hi pocket when he saw the note ly on the tabl where had thei come from smerdyakov had pick them up and brought them in the dai befor well my lad i ve never met ani on like you fyodor pavlovitch said shortli and gave him ten roubl we mai add that he not onli believ in hi honesti but had for some reason a like for him although the young man look as moros at him as at everi on and wa alwai silent he rare spoke if it had occur to ani on to wonder at the time what the young man wa interest in and what wa in hi mind it would have been imposs to tell by look at him yet he us sometim to stop suddenli in the hous or even in the yard or street and would stand still for ten minut lost in thought a physiognomist studi hi face would have said that there wa no thought in it no reflect but onli a sort of contempl there is a remark pictur by the painter kramskoi call contempl there is a forest in winter and on a roadwai through the forest in absolut solitud stand a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoe he stand as it were lost in thought yet he is not think he is contempl if ani on touch him he would start and look at on as though awaken and bewild it s true he would come to himself immedi but if he were ask what he had been think about he would rememb noth yet probabl he ha hidden within himself the impress which had domin him dure the period of contempl those impress ar dear to him and no doubt he hoard them impercept and even unconsci how and why of cours he doe not know either he mai suddenli after hoard impress for mani year abandon everyth and go off to jerusalem on a pilgrimag for hi soul s salvat or perhap he will suddenli set fire to hi nativ villag and perhap do both there ar a good mani contempl among the peasantri well smerdyakov wa probabl on of them and he probabl wa greedili hoard up hi impress hardli know why chapter vii the controversi but balaam s ass had suddenli spoken the subject wa a strang on grigori had gone in the morn to make purchas and had heard from the shopkeep lukyanov the stori of a russian soldier which had appear in the newspap of that dai thi soldier had been taken prison in some remot part of asia and wa threaten with an immedi agon death if he did not renounc christian and follow islam he refus to deni hi faith and wa tortur flai aliv and di prais and glorifi christ grigori had relat the stori at tabl fyodor pavlovitch alwai like over the dessert after dinner to laugh and talk if onli with grigori thi afternoon he wa in a particularli good humor and expans mood sip hi brandi and listen to the stori he observ that thei ought to make a saint of a soldier like that and to take hi skin to some monasteri that would make the peopl flock and bring the monei in grigori frown see that fyodor pavlovitch wa by no mean touch but as usual wa begin to scoff at that moment smerdyakov who wa stand by the door smile smerdyakov often wait at tabl toward the end of dinner and sinc ivan s arriv in our town he had done so everi dai what ar you grin at ask fyodor pavlovitch catch the smile instantli and know that it refer to grigori well my opinion is smerdyakov began suddenli and unexpectedli in a loud voic that if that laudabl soldier s exploit wa so veri great there would have been to my think no sin in it if he had on such an emerg renounc so to speak the name of christ and hi own christen to save by that same hi life for good deed by which in the cours of year to expiat hi cowardic how could it not be a sin you re talk nonsens for that you ll go straight to hell and be roast there like mutton put in fyodor pavlovitch it wa at thi point that alyosha came in and fyodor pavlovitch as we have seen wa highli delight at hi appear we re on your subject your subject he chuckl gleefulli make alyosha sit down to listen as for mutton that s not so and there ll be noth there for thi and there shouldn t be either if it s accord to justic smerdyakov maintain stoutli how do you mean accord to justic fyodor pavlovitch cri still more gayli nudg alyosha with hi knee he s a rascal that s what he is burst from grigori he look smerdyakov wrathfulli in the face as for be a rascal wait a littl grigori vassilyevitch answer smerdyakov with perfect composur you d better consid yourself that onc i am taken prison by the enemi of the christian race and thei demand from me to curs the name of god and to renounc my holi christen i am fulli entitl to act by my own reason sinc there would be no sin in it but you ve said that befor don t wast word prove it cri fyodor pavlovitch soup maker mutter grigori contemptu as for be a soup maker wait a bit too and consid for yourself grigori vassilyevitch without abus me for as soon as i sai to those enemi no i m not a christian and i curs my true god then at onc by god s high judgment i becom immedi and special anathema accurs and am cut off from the holi church exactli as though i were a heathen so that at that veri instant not onli when i sai it aloud but when i think of sai it befor a quarter of a second ha pass i am cut off is that so or not grigori vassilyevitch he address grigori with obviou satisfact though he wa realli answer fyodor pavlovitch s question and wa well awar of it and intention pretend that grigori had ask the question ivan cri fyodor pavlovitch suddenli stoop down for me to whisper he s got thi all up for your benefit he want you to prais him prais him ivan listen with perfect serious to hi father s excit whisper stai smerdyakov be quiet a minut cri fyodor pavlovitch onc more ivan your ear again ivan bent down again with a perfectli grave face i love you as i do alyosha don t think i don t love you some brandi ye but you re rather drunk yourself thought ivan look steadili at hi father he wa watch smerdyakov with great curios you re anathema accurs as it is grigori suddenli burst out and how dare you argu you rascal after that if don t scold him grigori don t scold him fyodor pavlovitch cut him short you should wait grigori vassilyevitch if onli a short time and listen for i haven t finish all i had to sai for at the veri moment i becom accurs at that same highest moment i becom exactli like a heathen and my christen is taken off me and becom of no avail isn t that so make hast and finish my boi fyodor pavlovitch urg him sip from hi wine glass with relish and if i ve ceas to be a christian then i told no lie to the enemi when thei ask whether i wa a christian or not a christian see i had alreadi been reliev by god himself of my christian by reason of the thought alon befor i had time to utter a word to the enemi and if i have alreadi been discharg in what manner and with what sort of justic can i be held respons as a christian in the other world for have deni christ when through the veri thought alon befor deni him i had been reliev from my christen if i m no longer a christian then i can t renounc christ for i ve noth then to renounc who will hold an unclean tatar respons grigori vassilyevitch even in heaven for not have been born a christian and who would punish him for that consid that you can t take two skin off on ox for god almighti himself even if he did make the tatar respons when he di would give him the smallest possibl punish i imagin sinc he must be punish judg that he is not to blame if he ha come into the world an unclean heathen from heathen parent the lord god can t sure take a tatar and sai he wa a christian that would mean that the almighti would tell a real untruth and can the lord of heaven and earth tell a lie even in on word grigori wa thunderstruck and look at the orat hi ey nearli start out of hi head though he did not clearli understand what wa said he had caught someth in thi rigmarol and stood look like a man who ha just hit hi head against a wall fyodor pavlovitch empti hi glass and went off into hi shrill laugh alyosha alyosha what do you sai to that ah you casuist he must have been with the jesuit somewher ivan oh you stink jesuit who taught you but you re talk nonsens you casuist nonsens nonsens nonsens don t cry grigori we ll reduc him to smoke and ash in a moment tell me thi o ass you mai be right befor your enemi but you have renounc your faith all the same in your own heart and you sai yourself that in that veri hour you becam anathema accurs and if onc you re anathema thei won t pat you on the head for it in hell what do you sai to that my fine jesuit there is no doubt that i have renounc it in my own heart but there wa no special sin in that or if there wa sin it wa the most ordinari how s that the most ordinari you lie accurs on hiss grigori consid yourself grigori vassilyevitch smerdyakov went on staid and unruffl consciou of hi triumph but as it were gener to the vanquish foe consid yourself grigori vassilyevitch it is said in the scriptur that if you have faith even as a mustard seed and bid a mountain move into the sea it will move without the least delai at your bid well grigori vassilyevitch if i m without faith and you have so great a faith that you ar continu swear at me you try yourself tell thi mountain not to move into the sea for that s a long wai off but even to our stink littl river which run at the bottom of the garden you ll see for yourself that it won t budg but will remain just where it is howev much you shout at it and that show grigori vassilyevitch that you haven t faith in the proper manner and onli abus other about it again take into consider that no on in our dai not onli you but actual no on from the highest person to the lowest peasant can shove mountain into the sea except perhap some on man in the world or at most two and thei most like ar save their soul in secret somewher in the egyptian desert so you wouldn t find them if so it be if all the rest have no faith will god curs all the rest that is the popul of the whole earth except about two hermit in the desert and in hi well known merci will he not forgiv on of them and so i m persuad that though i mai onc have doubt i shall be forgiven if i shed tear of repent stai cri fyodor pavlovitch in a transport of delight so you do suppos there ar two who can move mountain ivan make a note of it write it down there you have the russian all over you re quit right in sai it s characterist of the peopl s faith ivan assent with an approv smile you agre then it must be so if you agre it s true isn t it alyosha that s the russian faith all over isn t it no smerdyakov ha not the russian faith at all said alyosha firmli and grave i m not talk about hi faith i mean those two in the desert onli that idea sure that s russian isn t it ye that s pure russian said alyosha smile your word ar worth a gold piec o ass and i ll give it to you to dai but as to the rest you talk nonsens nonsens nonsens let me tell you stupid that we here ar all of littl faith onli from careless becaus we haven t time thing ar too much for us and in the second place the lord god ha given us so littl time onli twenti four hour in the dai so that on hasn t even time to get sleep enough much less to repent of on s sin while you have deni your faith to your enemi when you d noth els to think about but to show your faith so i consid brother that it constitut a sin constitut a sin it mai but consid yourself grigori vassilyevitch that it onli extenu it if it doe constitut if i had believ then in veri truth as i ought to have believ then it realli would have been sin if i had not face tortur for my faith and had gone over to the pagan mohammedan faith but of cours it wouldn t have come to tortur then becaus i should onli have had to sai at that instant to the mountain move and crush the tormentor and it would have move and at the veri instant have crush him like a black beetl and i should have walk awai as though noth had happen prais and glorifi god but suppos at that veri moment i had tri all that and cri to that mountain crush these tormentor and it hadn t crush them how could i have help doubt prai at such a time and at such a dread hour of mortal terror and apart from that i should know alreadi that i could not attain to the full of the kingdom of heaven for sinc the mountain had not move at my word thei could not think veri much of my faith up aloft and there could be no veri great reward await me in the world to come so why should i let them flai the skin off me as well and to no good purpos for even though thei had flai my skin half off my back even then the mountain would not have move at my word or at my cry and at such a moment not onli doubt might come over on but on might lose on s reason from fear so that on would not be abl to think at all and therefor how should i be particularli to blame if not see my advantag or reward there or here i should at least save my skin and so trust fulli in the grace of the lord i should cherish the hope that i might be altogeth forgiven chapter viii over the brandi the controversi wa over but strang to sai fyodor pavlovitch who had been so gai suddenli began frown he frown and gulp brandi and it wa alreadi a glass too much get along with you jesuit he cri to the servant go awai smerdyakov i ll send you the gold piec i promis you to dai but be off don t cry grigori go to marfa she ll comfort you and put you to bed the rascal won t let us sit in peac after dinner he snap peevishli as the servant promptli withdrew at hi word smerdyakov alwai poke himself in now after dinner it s you he s so interest in what have you done to fascin him he ad to ivan noth whatev answer ivan he s pleas to have a high opinion of me he s a lackei and a mean soul raw materi for revolut howev when the time come for revolut there will be other and better on but there will be some like him as well hi kind will come first and better on after and when will the time come the rocket will go off and fizzl out perhap the peasant ar not veri fond of listen to these soup maker so far ah brother but a balaam s ass like that think and think and the devil know where he get to he s store up idea said ivan smile you see i know he can t bear me nor ani on els even you though you fanci that he ha a high opinion of you wors still with alyosha he despis alyosha but he doesn t steal that s on thing and he s not a gossip he hold hi tongu and doesn t wash our dirti linen in public he make capit fish pasti too but damn him is he worth talk about so much of cours he isn t and as for the idea

in the draw room but in the draw room the convers wa alreadi over katerina ivanovna wa greatli excit though she look resolut at the moment alyosha and madam hohlakov enter ivan fyodorovitch stood up to take leav hi face wa rather pale and alyosha look at him anxious for thi moment wa to solv a doubt a harass enigma which had for some time haunt alyosha dure the preced month it had been sever time suggest to him that hi brother ivan wa in love with katerina ivanovna and what wa more that he meant to carri her off from dmitri until quit late the idea seem to alyosha monstrou though it worri him extrem he love both hi brother and dread such rivalri between them meantim dmitri had said outright on the previou dai that he wa glad that ivan wa hi rival and that it wa a great assist to him dmitri in what wai did it assist him to marri grushenka but that alyosha consid the worst thing possibl besid all thi alyosha had till the even befor implicitli believ that katerina ivanovna had a steadfast and passion love for dmitri but he had onli believ it till the even befor he had fanci too that she wa incap of love a man like ivan and that she did love dmitri and love him just as he wa in spite of all the strang of such a passion but dure yesterdai s scene with grushenka anoth idea had struck him the word lacer which madam hohlakov had just utter almost made him start becaus half wake up toward daybreak that night he had cri out lacer lacer probabl appli it to hi dream he had been dream all night of the previou dai s scene at katerina ivanovna s now alyosha wa impress by madam hohlakov s blunt and persist assert that katerina ivanovna wa in love with ivan and onli deceiv herself through some sort of pose from self lacer and tortur herself by her pretend love for dmitri from some fanci duti of gratitud ye he thought perhap the whole truth li in those word but in that case what wa ivan s posit alyosha felt instinct that a charact like katerina ivanovna s must domin and she could onli domin some on like dmitri and never a man like ivan for dmitri might at last submit to her domin to hi own happi which wa what alyosha would have desir but ivan no ivan could not submit to her and such submiss would not give him happi alyosha could not help believ that of ivan and now all these doubt and reflect flit through hi mind as he enter the draw room anoth idea too forc itself upon him what if she love neither of them neither ivan nor dmitri it must be note that alyosha felt as it were asham of hi own thought and blame himself when thei kept recur to him dure the last month what do i know about love and women and how can i decid such question he thought reproachfulli after such doubt and surmis and yet it wa imposs not to think about it he felt instinct that thi rivalri wa of immens import in hi brother live and that a great deal depend upon it on reptil will devour the other ivan had pronounc the dai befor speak in anger of hi father and dmitri so ivan look upon dmitri as a reptil and perhap had long done so wa it perhap sinc he had known katerina ivanovna that phrase had of cours escap ivan unawar yesterdai but that onli made it more import if he felt like that what chanc wa there of peac were there not on the contrari new ground for hatr and hostil in their famili and with which of them wa alyosha to sympath and what wa he to wish for each of them he love them both but what could he desir for each in the midst of these conflict interest he might go quit astrai in thi maze and alyosha s heart could not endur uncertainti becaus hi love wa alwai of an activ charact he wa incap of passiv love if he love ani on he set to work at onc to help him and to do so he must know what he wa aim at he must know for certain what wa best for each and have ascertain thi it wa natur for him to help them both but instead of a definit aim he found noth but uncertainti and perplex on all side it wa lacer as wa said just now but what could he understand even in thi lacer

the two hundr roubl alexei fyodorovitch and your take them to that poor offic and she told me all the aw stori of how he had been insult and you know although mamma muddl thing she alwai rush from on thing to anoth i cri when i heard well did you give him the monei and how is that poor man get on the fact is i didn t give it to him and it s a long stori answer alyosha as though he too could think of noth but hi regret at have fail yet lise saw perfectli well that he too look awai and that he too wa try to talk of other thing alyosha sat down to the tabl and began to tell hi stori but at the first word he lost hi embarrass and gain the whole of lise s attent as well he spoke with deep feel under the influenc of the strong impress he had just receiv and he succeed in tell hi stori well and circumstanti in old dai in moscow he had been fond of come to lise and describ to her what had just happen to him what he had read or what he rememb of hi childhood sometim thei had made dai dream and woven whole romanc togeth gener cheer and amus on now thei both felt suddenli transport to the old dai in moscow two year befor lise wa extrem touch by hi stori alyosha describ ilusha with warm feel when he finish describ how the luckless man trampl on the monei lise could not help clasp her hand and cry out so you didn t give him the monei so you let him run awai oh dear you ought to have run after him no lise it s better i didn t run after him said alyosha get up from hi chair and walk thoughtfulli across the room how so how is it better now thei ar without food and their case is hopeless not hopeless for the two hundr roubl will still come to them he ll take the monei to morrow to morrow he will be sure to take it said alyosha pace up and down ponder you see lise he went on stop suddenli befor her i made on blunder but that even that is all for the best what blunder and why is it for the best i ll tell you he is a man of weak and timor charact he ha suffer so much and is veri good natur i keep wonder why he took offens so suddenli for i assur you up to the last minut he did not know that he wa go to trampl on the note and i think now that there wa a great deal to offend him and it could not have been otherwis in hi posit to begin with he wa sore at have been so glad of the monei in my presenc and not have conceal it from me if he had been pleas but not so much if he had not shown it if he had begun affect scrupl and difficulti as other peopl do when thei take monei he might still endur to take it but he wa too genuin delight and that wa mortifi ah lise he is a good and truth man that s the worst of the whole busi all the while he talk hi voic wa so weak so broken he talk so fast so fast he kept laugh such a laugh or perhap he wa cry ye i am sure he wa cry he wa so delight and he talk about hi daughter and about the situat he could get in anoth town and when he had pour out hi heart he felt asham at have shown me hi inmost soul like that so he began to hate me at onc he is on of those awfulli sensit poor peopl what had made him feel most asham wa that he had given in too soon and accept me as a friend you see at first he almost flew at me and tri to intimid me but as soon as he saw the monei he had begun embrac me he kept touch me with hi hand thi must have been how he came to feel it all so humili and then i made that blunder a veri import on i suddenli said to him that if he had not monei enough to move to anoth town we would give it to him and inde i myself would give him as much as he want out of my own monei that struck him all at onc why he thought did i put myself forward to help him you know lise it s awfulli hard for a man who ha been injur when other peopl look at him as though thei were hi benefactor i ve heard that father zossima told me so i don t know how to put it but i have often seen it myself and i feel like that myself too and the worst of it wa that though he did not know up to the veri last minut that he would trampl on the note he had a kind of presenti of it i am sure of that that s just what made him so ecstat that he had that presenti and though it s so dread it s all for the best in fact i believ noth better could have happen why why could noth better have happen cri lise look with great surpris at alyosha becaus if he had taken the monei in an hour after get home he would be cry with mortif that s just what would have happen and most like he would have come to me earli to morrow and perhap have flung the note at me and trampl upon them as he did just now but now he ha gone home awfulli proud and triumphant though he know he ha ruin himself so now noth could be easier than to make him accept the two hundr roubl by to morrow for he ha alreadi vindic hi honor toss awai the monei and trampl it under foot he couldn t know when he did it that i should bring it to him again to morrow and yet he is in terribl need of that monei though he is proud of himself now yet even to dai he ll be think what a help he ha lost he will think of it more than ever at night will dream of it and by to morrow morn he mai be readi to run to me to ask forgiv it s just then that i ll appear here you ar a proud man i shall sai you have shown it but now take the monei and forgiv us and then he will take it alyosha wa carri awai with joi as he utter hi last word and then he will take it lise clap her hand ah

it wa get late nearli three o clock alyosha s whole soul turn to the monasteri to hi dy saint but the necess of see dmitri outweigh everyth the convict that a great inevit catastroph wa about to

without me anywai i won t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that i might have save someth and did not but pass by and hasten home if i do as i intend i shall be follow hi great precept hi plan wa to catch hi brother dmitri unawar to climb over the fenc as he had the dai befor get into the garden and sit in the summer hous if dmitri were not there thought alyosha he would not announc himself to foma or the women of the hous but would remain hidden in the summer hous even if he had to wait there till even if as befor dmitri were ly in wait for grushenka to come he would be veri like to come to the summer hous alyosha did not howev give much thought to the detail of hi plan but resolv to act upon it even if it meant not get back to the monasteri that dai everyth happen without hindranc he climb over the hurdl almost in the same spot as the dai befor and stole into the summer hous unseen he did not want to be notic the woman of the hous and foma too if he were here might be loyal to hi brother and obei hi instruct and so refus to let alyosha come into the garden or might warn dmitri that he wa be sought and inquir for there wa no on in the summer hous alyosha

concern but why ar you so worri about my go awai we ve plenti of time befor i go an etern if you ar go awai to morrow what do you mean by an etern but what doe it matter to us laugh ivan we ve time enough for our talk for what brought us here why do you look so surpris answer why have we met here to talk of my love for katerina ivanovna of the old man and dmitri of foreign travel of the fatal posit of russia of the emperor napoleon is that it no then you know what for it s differ for other peopl but we in our green youth have to settl the etern question first of all that s what we care about young russia is talk about noth but the etern question now just when the old folk ar all taken up with practic question why have you been look at me in expect for the last three month to ask me what do you believ or don t you believ at all that s what your ey have been mean for these three month haven t thei perhap so smile alyosha you ar not laugh at me now ivan me laugh i don t want to wound my littl brother who ha been watch me with such expect for three month alyosha look straight at me of cours i am just such a littl boi as you ar onli not a novic and what have russian boi been do up till now some of them i mean in thi stink tavern for instanc here thei meet and sit down in a corner thei ve never met in their live befor and when thei go out of the tavern thei won t meet again for forti year and what do thei talk about in that momentari halt in the tavern of the etern question of the exist of god and immort and those who do not believ in god talk of social or anarch of the transform of all human on a new pattern so that it all come to the same thei re the same question turn insid out and mass mass of the most origin russian boi do noth but talk of the etern question isn t it so ye for real russian the question of god s exist and of immort or as you sai the same question turn insid out come first and foremost of cours and so thei should said alyosha still watch hi brother with the same gentl and inquir smile well alyosha it s sometim veri unwis to be a russian at all but anyth stupid than the wai russian boi spend their time on can hardli imagin but there s on russian boi call alyosha i am awfulli fond of how nice you put that in alyosha laugh suddenli well tell me where to begin give your order the exist of god eh begin where you like you declar yesterdai at father s that there wa no god alyosha look searchingli at hi brother i said that yesterdai at dinner on purpos to teas you and i saw your ey glow but now i ve no object to discuss with you and i sai so veri serious i want to be friend with you alyosha for i have no friend and want to try it well onli fanci perhap i too accept god laugh ivan that s a surpris for you isn t it ye of cours if you ar not joke now joke i wa told at the elder s yesterdai that i wa joke you know dear boi there wa an old sinner in the eighteenth centuri who declar that if there were no god he would have to be invent s il n existait pa dieu il faudrait l invent and man ha actual invent god and what s strang what would be marvel is not that god should realli exist the marvel is that such an idea the idea of the necess of god could enter the head of such a savag viciou beast as man so holi it is so touch so wise and so great a credit it doe to man as for me i ve long resolv not to think whether man creat god or god man and i won t go through all the axiom laid down by russian boi on that subject all deriv from european hypothes for what s a hypothesi there is an axiom with the russian boi and not onli with the boi but with their teacher too for our russian professor ar often just the same boi themselv and so i omit all the hypothes for what ar we aim at now i am try to explain as quickli as possibl my essenti natur that is what manner of man i am what i believ in and for what i hope that s it isn t it and therefor i tell you that i accept god simpli but you must note thi if god exist and if he realli did creat the world then as we all know he creat it accord to the geometri of euclid and the human mind with the concept of onli three dimens in space yet there have been and still ar geometrician and philosoph and even some of the most distinguish who doubt whether the whole univers or to speak more wide the whole of be wa onli creat in euclid s geometri thei even dare to dream that two parallel line which accord to euclid can never meet on earth mai meet somewher in infin i have come to the conclus that sinc i can t understand even that i can t expect to understand about god i acknowledg humbl that i have no faculti for settl such question i have a euclidian earthli mind and how could i solv problem that ar not of thi world and i advis you never to think about it either my dear alyosha especi about god whether he exist or not all such question ar utterli inappropri for a mind creat with an idea of onli three dimens and so i accept god and am glad to and what s more i accept hi wisdom hi purpos which ar utterli beyond our ken i believ in the underli order and the mean of life i believ in the etern harmoni in which thei sai we shall on dai be blend i believ in the word to which the univers is strive and which itself wa with god and which itself is god and so on and so on to infin there ar all sort of phrase for it i seem to be on the right path don t i yet would you believ it in the final result i don t accept thi world of god s and although i know it exist i don t accept it at all it s not that i don t accept god you must understand it s the world creat by him i don t and cannot accept let me make it plain i believ like a child that suffer will be heal and made up for that all the humili absurd of human contradict will vanish like a piti mirag like the despic fabric of the impot and infinit small euclidian mind of man that in the world s final at the moment of etern harmoni someth so preciou will come to pass that it will suffic for all heart for the comfort of all resent for the aton of all the crime of human of all the blood thei ve shed that it will make it not onli possibl to forgiv but to justifi all that ha happen with men but though all that mai come to pass i don t accept it i won t accept it even if parallel line do meet and i see it myself i shall see it and sai that thei ve met but still i won t accept it that s what s at the root of me alyosha that s my creed i am in earnest in what i sai i began our talk as stupidli as i could on purpos but i ve led up to my confess for that s all you want you didn t want to hear about god but onli to know what the brother you love live by and so i ve told you ivan conclud hi long tirad with mark and unexpect feel and why did you begin as stupidli as you could ask alyosha look dreamili at him to begin with for the sake of be russian russian convers on such subject ar alwai carri on inconceiv stupidli and secondli the stupid on is the closer on is to realiti the stupid on is the clearer on is stupid is brief and artless while intellig wriggl and hide itself intellig is a knave but stupid is honest and straightforward i ve led the convers to my despair and the more stupidli i have present it the better for me you will explain why you don t accept the world said alyosha to be sure i will it s not a secret that s what i ve been lead up to dear littl brother i don t want to corrupt you or to turn you from your stronghold perhap i want to be heal by you ivan smile suddenli quit like a littl gentl child alyosha had never seen such a smile on hi face befor chapter iv rebellion i must make you on confess ivan began i could never understand how on can love on s neighbor it s just on s neighbor to my mind that on can t love though on might love those at a distanc i onc read somewher of john the merci a saint that when a hungri frozen beggar came to him he took him into hi bed held him in hi arm and began breath into hi mouth which wa putrid and loathsom from some aw diseas i am convinc that he did that from self lacer from the self lacer of falsiti for the sake of the chariti impos by duti as a penanc laid on him for ani on to love a man he must be hidden for as soon as he show hi face love is gone father zossima ha talk of that more than onc observ alyosha he too said that the face of a man often hinder mani peopl not practic in love from love him but yet there s a great deal of love in mankind and almost christ like love i know that myself ivan well i know noth of it so far and can t understand it and the innumer mass of mankind ar with me there the question is whether that s due to men s bad qualiti or whether it s inher in their natur to my think christ like love for men is a miracl imposs on earth he wa god but we ar not god suppos i for instanc suffer intens anoth can never know how much i suffer becaus he is anoth and not i and what s more a man is rare readi to admit anoth s suffer as though it were a distinct why won t he admit it do you think becaus i smell unpleas becaus i have a stupid face becaus i onc trod on hi foot besid there is suffer and suffer degrad humili suffer such as humbl me hunger for instanc my benefactor will perhap allow me but when you come to higher suffer for an idea for instanc he will veri rare admit that perhap becaus my face strike him as not at all what he fanci a man should have who suffer for an idea and so he depriv me instantli of hi favor and not at all from bad of heart beggar especi genteel beggar ought never to show themselv but to ask for chariti through the newspap on can love on s neighbor in the abstract or even at a distanc but at close quarter it s almost imposs if it were as on the stage in the ballet where if beggar come in thei wear silken rag and tatter lace and beg for alm danc gracefulli then on might like look at them but even then we should not love them but enough of that i simpli want to show you my point of view i meant to speak of the suffer of mankind gener but we had better confin ourselv to the suffer of the children that reduc the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would be still we d better keep to the children though it doe weaken my case but in the first place children can be love even at close quarter even when thei ar dirti even when thei ar ugli i fanci though children never ar ugli the second reason why i won t speak of grown up peopl is that besid be disgust and unworthi of love thei have a compens thei ve eaten the appl and know good and evil and thei have becom like god thei go on eat it still but the children haven t eaten anyth and ar so far innoc ar you fond of children alyosha i know you ar and you will understand why i prefer to speak of them if thei too suffer horribl on earth thei must suffer for their father sin thei must be punish for their father who have eaten the appl but that reason is of the other world and is incomprehens for the heart of man here on earth the innoc must not suffer for anoth s sin and especi such innoc you mai be surpris at me alyosha but i am awfulli fond of children too and observ cruel peopl the violent the rapaci the karamazov ar sometim veri fond of children children while thei ar quit littl up to seven for instanc ar so remot from grown up peopl thei ar differ creatur as it were of a differ speci i knew a crimin in prison who had in the cours of hi career as a burglar murder whole famili includ sever children but when he wa in prison he had a strang affect for them he spent all hi time at hi window watch the children plai in the prison yard he train on littl boi to come up to hi window and made great friend with him you don t know why i am tell you all thi alyosha my head ach and i am sad you speak with a strang air observ alyosha uneasili as though you were not quit yourself by the wai a bulgarian i met late in moscow ivan went on seem not to hear hi brother s word told me about the crime commit by turk and circassian in all part of bulgaria through fear of a gener rise of the slav thei burn villag murder outrag women and children thei nail their prison by the ear to the fenc leav them so till morn and in the morn thei hang them all sort of thing you can t imagin peopl talk sometim of bestial cruelti but that s a great injustic and insult to the beast a beast can never be so cruel as a man so artist cruel the tiger onli tear and gnaw that s all he can do he would never think of nail peopl by the ear even if he were abl to do it these turk took a pleasur in tortur children too cut the unborn child from the mother s womb and toss babi up in the air and catch them on the point of their bayonet befor their mother ey do it befor the mother ey wa what gave zest to the amus here is anoth scene that i thought veri interest imagin a trembl mother with her babi in her arm a circl of invad turk around her thei ve plan a divers thei pet the babi laugh to make it laugh thei succe the babi laugh at that moment a turk point a pistol four inch from the babi s face the babi laugh with glee hold out it littl hand to the pistol and he pull the trigger in the babi s face and blow out it brain artist wasn t it by the wai turk ar particularli fond of sweet thing thei sai brother what ar you drive at ask alyosha i think if the devil doesn t exist but man ha creat him he ha creat him in hi own imag and like just as he did god then observ alyosha it s wonder how you can turn word as poloniu sai in hamlet laugh ivan you turn my word against me well i am glad your must be a fine god if man creat him in hi imag and like you ask just now what i wa drive at you see i am fond of collect certain fact and would you believ i even copi anecdot of a certain sort from newspap and book and i ve alreadi got a fine collect the turk of cours have gone into it but thei ar foreign i have specimen from home that ar even better than the turk you know we prefer beat rod and scourg that s our nation institut nail ear is unthink for us for we ar after all european but the rod and the scourg we have alwai with us and thei cannot be taken from us abroad now thei scarc do ani beat manner ar more human or law have been pass so that thei don t dare to flog men now but thei make up for it in anoth wai just as nation as our and so nation that it would be practic imposs among us though i believ we ar be inocul with it sinc the religi movement began in our aristocraci i have a charm pamphlet translat from the french describ how quit recent five year ago a murder richard wa execut a young man i believ of three and twenti who repent and wa convert to the christian faith at the veri scaffold thi richard wa an illegitim child who wa given as a child of six by hi parent to some shepherd on the swiss mountain thei brought him up to work for them he grew up like a littl wild beast among them the shepherd taught him noth and scarc fed or cloth him but sent him out at seven to herd the flock in cold and wet and no on hesit or scrupl to treat him so quit the contrari thei thought thei had everi right for richard had been given to them as a chattel and thei did not even see the necess of feed him richard himself describ how in those year like the prodig son in the gospel he long to eat of the mash given to the pig which were fatten for sale but thei wouldn t even give him that and beat him when he stole from the pig and that wa how he spent all hi childhood and hi youth till he grew up and wa strong enough to go awai and be a thief the savag began to earn hi live as a dai labor in geneva he drank what he earn he live like a brute and finish by kill and rob an old man he wa caught tri and condemn to death thei ar not sentimentalist there and in prison he wa immedi surround by pastor member of christian brotherhood philanthrop ladi and the like thei taught him to read and write in prison and expound the gospel to him thei exhort him work upon him drum at him incessantli till at last he solemnli confess hi crime he wa convert he wrote to the court himself that he wa a monster but that in the end god had vouchsaf him light and shown grace all geneva wa in excit about him all philanthrop and religi geneva all the aristocrat and well bred societi of the town rush to the prison kiss richard and embrac him you ar our brother you have found grace and richard doe noth but weep with emot ye i ve found grace all my youth and childhood i wa glad of pig food but now even i have found grace i am dy in the lord ye richard die in the lord you have shed blood and must die though it s not your fault that you knew not the lord when you covet the pig food and were beaten for steal it which wa veri wrong of you for steal is forbidden but you ve shed blood and you must die and on the last dai richard perfectli limp did noth but cry and repeat everi minut thi is my happiest dai i am go to the lord ye cry the pastor and the judg and philanthrop ladi thi is the happiest dai of your life for you ar go to the lord thei all walk or drive to the scaffold in process behind the prison van at the scaffold thei call to richard die brother die in the lord for even thou hast found grace and so cover with hi brother kiss richard is drag on to the scaffold and led to the guillotin and thei chop off hi head in brotherli fashion becaus he had found grace ye that s characterist that pamphlet is translat into russian by some russian philanthropist of aristocrat rank and evangel aspir and ha been distribut grati for the enlighten of the peopl the case of richard is interest becaus it s nation though to us it s absurd to cut off a man s head becaus he ha becom our brother and ha found grace yet we have our own special which is all but wors our histor pastim is the direct satisfact of inflict pain there ar line in nekrassov describ how a peasant lash a hors on the ey on it meek ey everi on must have seen it it s peculiarli russian he describ how a feebl littl nag ha founder under too heavi a load and cannot move the peasant beat it beat it savag beat it at last not know what he is do in the intox of cruelti thrash it mercilessli over and over again howev weak you ar you must pull if you die for it the nag strain and then he begin lash the poor defenseless creatur on it weep on it meek ey the frantic beast tug and draw the load trembl all over gasp for breath move sidewai with a sort of unnatur spasmod action it s aw in nekrassov but that s onli a hors and god ha given hors to be beaten so the tatar have taught us and thei left us the knout as a remembr of it but men too can be beaten a well educ cultur gentleman and hi wife beat their own child with a birch rod a girl of seven i have an exact account of it the papa wa glad that the birch wa cover with twig it sting more said he and so he began sting hi daughter i know for a fact there ar peopl who at everi blow ar work up to sensual to liter sensual which increas progress at everi blow thei inflict thei beat for a minut for five minut for ten minut more often and more savag the child scream at last the child cannot scream it gasp daddi daddi by some diabol unseemli chanc the case wa brought into court a counsel is engag the russian peopl have long call a barrist a conscienc for hire the counsel protest in hi client s defens it s such a simpl thing he sai an everydai domest event a father correct hi child to our shame be it said it is brought into court the juri convinc by him give a favor verdict the public roar with delight that the tortur is acquit ah piti i wasn t there i would have propos to rais a subscript in hi honor charm pictur but i ve still better thing about children i ve collect a great great deal about russian children alyosha there wa a littl girl of five who wa hate by her father and mother most worthi and respect peopl of good educ and breed you see i must repeat again it is a peculiar characterist of mani peopl thi love of tortur children and children onli to all other type of human these tortur behav mildli and benevol like cultiv and human european but thei ar veri fond of torment children even fond of children themselv in that sens it s just their defenseless that tempt the tormentor just the angel confid of the child who ha no refug and no appeal that set hi vile blood on fire in everi man of cours a demon li hidden the demon of rage the demon of lust heat at the scream of the tortur victim the demon of lawless let off the chain the demon of diseas that follow on vice gout kidnei diseas and so on thi poor child of five wa subject to everi possibl tortur by those cultiv parent thei beat her thrash her kick her for no reason till her bodi wa on bruis then thei went to greater refin of cruelti shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privi and becaus she didn t ask to be taken up at night as though a child of five sleep it angel sound sleep could be train to wake and ask thei smear her face and fill her mouth with excrement and it wa her mother her mother did thi and that mother could sleep hear the poor child s groan can you understand why a littl creatur who can t even understand what s done to her should beat her littl ach heart with her tini fist in the dark and the cold and weep her meek unres tear to dear kind god to protect her do you understand that friend and brother you piou and humbl novic do you understand why thi infami must be and is permit without it i am told man could not have exist on earth for he could not have known good and evil why should he know that diabol good and evil when it cost so much why the whole world of knowledg is not worth that child s prayer to dear kind god i sai noth of the suffer of grown up peopl thei have eaten the appl damn them and the devil take them all but these littl on i am make you suffer alyosha you ar not yourself i ll leav off if you like never mind i want to suffer too mutter alyosha on pictur onli on more becaus it s so curiou so characterist and i have onli just read it in some collect of russian antiqu i ve forgotten the name i must look it up it wa in the darkest dai of serfdom at the begin of the centuri and long live the liber of the peopl there wa in those dai a gener of aristocrat connect the owner of great estat on of those men somewhat except i believ even then who retir from the servic into a life of leisur ar convinc that thei ve earn absolut power over the live of their subject there were such men then so our gener settl on hi properti of two thousand soul live in pomp and domin over hi poor neighbor as

our moral feel speak alyosha to be shot murmur alyosha lift hi ey to ivan with a pale twist smile bravo cri ivan delight if even you sai so you re a pretti monk so there is a littl devil sit in your heart alyosha karamazov what i said wa absurd but that s just the point that but cri ivan let me tell you novic that the absurd is onli too necessari on earth the world stand on absurd and perhap noth would have come to pass in it without them we know what we know what do you know i understand noth ivan went on as though in delirium i don t want to understand anyth now i want to stick to the fact i made up my mind long ago not to understand if i try to understand anyth i shall be fals to the fact and i have determin to stick to the fact why ar you try me alyosha cri with sudden distress will you sai what you mean at last of cours i will that s what i ve been lead up to you ar dear to me i don t want to let you go and i won t give you up to your zossima ivan for a minut wa silent hi face becam all at onc veri sad listen i took the case of children onli to make my case clearer of the other tear of human with which the earth is soak from it crust to it center i will sai noth i have narrow my subject on purpos i am a bug and i recogn in all humil that i cannot understand why the world is arrang as it is men ar themselv to blame i suppos thei were given paradis thei want freedom and stole fire from heaven though thei knew thei would becom unhappi so there is no need to piti them with my piti earthli euclidian understand all i know is that there is suffer and that there ar none guilti that caus follow effect simpli and directli that everyth flow and find it level but that s onli euclidian nonsens i know that and i can t consent to live by it what comfort is it to me that there ar none guilti and that caus follow effect simpli and directli and that i know it i must have justic or i will destroi myself and not justic in some remot infinit time and space but here on earth and that i could see myself i have believ in it i want to see it and if i am dead by then let me rise again for if it all happen without me it will be too unfair sure i haven t suffer simpli that i my crime and my suffer mai manur the soil of the futur harmoni for somebodi els i want to see with my own ey the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrac hi murder i want to be there when everi on suddenli understand what it ha all been for all the religion of the world ar built on thi long and i am a believ but then there ar the children and what am i to do about them that s a question i can t answer for the hundredth time i repeat there ar number of question but i ve onli taken the children becaus in their case what i mean is so unanswer clear listen if all must suffer to pai for the etern harmoni what have children to do with it tell me pleas it s beyond all comprehens why thei should suffer and why thei should pai for the harmoni why should thei too furnish materi to enrich the soil for the harmoni of the futur i understand solidar in sin among men i understand solidar in retribut too but there can be no such solidar with children and if it is realli true that thei must share respons for all their father crime such a truth is not of thi world and is beyond my comprehens some jester will sai perhap that the child would have grown up and have sin but you see he didn t grow up he wa torn to piec by the dog at eight year old oh alyosha i am not blasphem i understand of cours what an upheav of the univers it will be when everyth in heaven and earth blend in on hymn of prais and everyth that live and ha live cri aloud thou art just o lord for thy wai ar reveal when the mother embrac the fiend who threw her child to the dog and all three cry aloud with tear thou art just o lord then of cours the crown of knowledg will be reach and all will be made clear but what pull me up here is that i can t accept that harmoni and while i am on earth i make hast to take my own measur you see alyosha perhap it realli mai happen that if i live to that moment or rise again to see it i too perhap mai cry aloud with the rest look at the mother embrac the child s tortur thou art just o lord but i don t want to cry aloud then while there is still time i hasten to protect myself and so i renounc the higher harmoni altogeth it s not worth the tear of that on tortur child who beat itself on the breast with it littl fist and prai in it stink outhous with it unexpi tear to dear kind god it s not worth it becaus those tear ar unaton for thei must be aton for or there can be no harmoni but how how ar you go to aton for them is it possibl by their be aveng but what do i care for aveng them what do i care for a hell for oppressor what good can hell do sinc those children have alreadi been tortur and what becom of harmoni if there is hell i want to forgiv i want to embrac i don t want more suffer and if the suffer of children go to swell the sum of suffer which wa necessari to pai for truth then i protest that the truth is not worth such a price i don t want the mother to embrac the oppressor who threw her son to the dog she dare not forgiv him let her forgiv him for herself if she will let her forgiv the tortur for the immeasur suffer of her mother s heart but the suffer of her tortur child she ha no right to forgiv she dare not forgiv the tortur even if the child were to forgiv him and if that is so if thei dare not forgiv what becom of harmoni is there in the whole world a be who would have the right to forgiv and could forgiv i don t want harmoni from love for human i don t want it i would rather be left with the unaveng suffer i would rather remain with my unaveng suffer and unsatisfi indign even if i were wrong besid too high a price is ask for harmoni it s beyond our mean to pai so much to enter on it and so i hasten to give back my entranc ticket and if i am an honest man i am bound to give it back as soon as possibl and that i am do it s not god that i don t accept alyosha onli i most respectfulli return him the ticket that s rebellion murmur alyosha look down rebellion i am sorri you call it that said ivan earnestli on can hardli live in rebellion and i want to live tell me yourself i challeng you answer imagin that you ar creat a fabric of human destini with the object of make men happi in the end give them peac and rest at last but that it wa essenti and inevit to tortur to death onli on tini creatur that babi beat it breast with it fist for instanc and to found that edific on it unaveng tear would you consent to be the architect on those condit tell me and tell the truth no i wouldn t consent said alyosha softli and can you admit the idea that men for whom you ar build it would agre to accept their happi on the foundat of the unexpi blood of a littl victim and accept it would remain happi for ever no i can t admit it brother said alyosha suddenli with flash ey you said just now is there a be in the whole world who would have the right to forgiv and could forgiv but there is a be and he can forgiv everyth all and for all becaus he gave hi innoc blood for all and everyth you have forgotten him and on him is built the edific and it is to him thei cry aloud thou art just o lord for thy wai ar reveal ah the on without sin and hi blood no i have not forgotten him on the contrari i ve been wonder all the time how it wa you did not bring him in befor for usual all argument on your side put him in the foreground do you know alyosha don t laugh i made a poem about a year ago if you can wast anoth ten minut on me i ll tell it to you you wrote a poem oh no i didn t write it laugh ivan and i ve never written two line of poetri in my life but i made up thi poem in prose and i rememb it i wa carri awai when i made it up you will be my first reader that is listen why should an author forego even on listen smile ivan shall i tell it to you i am all attent said alyosha my poem is call the grand inquisitor it s a ridicul thing but i want to tell it to you chapter v the grand inquisitor even thi must have a prefac that is a literari prefac laugh ivan and i am a poor hand at make on you see my action take place in the sixteenth centuri and at that time as you probabl learnt at school it wa customari in poetri to bring down heavenli power on earth not to speak of dant in franc clerk as well as the monk in the monasteri us to give regular perform in which the madonna the saint the angel christ and god himself were brought on the stage in those dai it wa done in all simplic in victor hugo s notr dame de pari an edifi and gratuit spectacl wa provid for the peopl in the h tel de vill of pari in the reign of loui xi in honor of the birth of the dauphin it wa call le bon jugement de la tr s saint et gracieus vierg mari and she appear herself on the stage and pronounc her bon jugement similar plai chiefli from the old testament were occasion perform in moscow too up to the time of peter the great but besid plai there were all sort of legend and ballad scatter about the world in which the saint and angel and all the power of heaven took part when requir in our monasteri the monk busi themselv in translat copi and even compos such poem and even under the tatar there is for instanc on such poem of cours from the greek the wander of our ladi through hell with descript as bold as dant s our ladi visit hell and the archangel michael lead her through the torment she see the sinner and their punish there she see among other on noteworthi set of sinner in a burn lake some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that thei can t swim out and these god forget an express of extraordinari depth and forc and so our ladi shock and weep fall befor the throne of god and beg for merci for all in hell for all she ha seen there indiscrimin her convers with god is immens interest she beseech him she will not desist and when god point to the hand and feet of her son nail to the cross and ask how can i forgiv hi tormentor she bid all the saint all the martyr all the angel and archangel to fall down with her and prai for merci on all without distinct it end by her win from god a respit of suffer everi year from good fridai till triniti dai and the sinner at onc rais a cry of thank from hell chant thou art just o lord in thi judgment well my poem would have been of that kind if it had appear at that time he come on the scene in my poem but he sai noth onli appear and pass on fifteen centuri have pass sinc he promis to come in hi glori fifteen centuri sinc hi prophet wrote behold i come quickli of that dai and that hour knoweth no man neither the son but the father as he himself predict on earth but human await him with the same faith and with the same love oh with greater faith for it is fifteen centuri sinc man ha ceas to see sign from heaven no sign from heaven come to dai to add to what the heart doth sai there wa noth left but faith in what the heart doth sai it is true there were mani miracl in those dai there were saint who perform miracul cure some holi peopl accord to their biographi were visit by the queen of heaven herself but the devil did not slumber and doubt were alreadi aris among men of the truth of these miracl and just then there appear in the north of germani a terribl new heresi a huge star like to a torch that is to a church fell on the sourc of the water and thei becam bitter these heret began blasphem deni miracl but those who remain faith were all the more ardent in their faith the tear of human rose up to him as befor await hi come love him hope for him yearn to suffer and die for him as befor and so mani ag mankind had prai with faith and fervor o lord our god hasten thy come so mani ag call upon him that in hi infinit merci he deign to come down to hi servant befor that dai he had come down he had visit some holi men martyr and hermit as is written in their live among us tyutchev with absolut faith in the truth of hi word bore wit that bear the cross in slavish dress weari and worn the heavenli king our mother russia came to bless and through our land went wander and that certainli wa so i assur you and behold he deign to appear for a moment to the peopl to the tortur suffer peopl sunk in iniqu but love him like children my stori is laid in spain in sevil in the most terribl time of the inquisit when fire were light everi dai to the glori of god and in the splendid auto da f the wick heret were burnt oh of cours thi wa not the come in which he will appear accord to hi promis at the end of time in all hi heavenli glori and which will be sudden as lightn flash from east to west no he visit hi children onli for a moment and there where the flame were crackl round the heret in hi infinit merci he came onc more among men in that human shape in which he walk among men for three year fifteen centuri ago he came down to the hot pavement of the southern town in which on the dai befor almost a hundr heret had ad majorem gloriam dei been burnt by the cardin the grand inquisitor in a magnific auto da f in the presenc of the king the court the knight the cardin the most charm ladi of the court and the whole popul of sevil he came softli unobserv and yet strang to sai everi on recogn him that might be on of the best passag in the poem i mean why thei recogn him the peopl ar irresist drawn to him thei surround him thei flock about him follow him he move silent in their midst with a gentl smile of infinit compass the sun of love burn in hi heart light and power shine from hi ey and their radianc shed on the peopl stir their heart with respons love he hold out hi hand to them bless them and a heal virtu come from contact with him even with hi garment an old man in the crowd blind from childhood cri out o lord heal me and i shall see thee and as it were scale fall from hi ey and the blind man see him the crowd weep and kiss the earth under hi feet children throw flower befor him sing and cry hosannah it is he it is he all repeat it must be he it can be no on but him he stop at the step of the sevil cathedr at the moment when the weep mourner ar bring in a littl open white coffin in it li a child of seven the onli daughter of a promin citizen the dead child li hidden in flower he will rais your child the crowd shout to the weep mother the priest come to meet the coffin look perplex and frown but the mother of the dead child throw herself at hi feet with a wail if it is thou rais my child she cri hold out her hand to him the process halt the coffin is laid on the step at hi feet he look with compass and hi lip onc more softli pronounc maiden aris and the maiden aris the littl girl sit up in the coffin and look round smile with wide open wonder ey hold a bunch of white rose thei had put in her hand there ar cri sob confus among the peopl and at that moment the cardin himself the grand inquisitor pass by the cathedr he is an old man almost nineti tall and erect with a wither face and sunken ey in which there is still a gleam of light he is not dress in hi gorgeou cardin s robe as he wa the dai befor when he wa burn the enemi of the roman church at thi moment he is wear hi coars old monk s cassock at a distanc behind him come hi gloomi assist and slave and the holi guard he stop at the sight of the crowd and watch it from a distanc he see everyth he see them set the coffin down at hi feet see the child rise up and hi face darken he knit hi thick grai brow and hi ey gleam with a sinist fire he hold out hi finger and bid the guard take him and such is hi power so complet ar the peopl cow into submiss and trembl obedi to him that the crowd immedi make wai for the guard and in the midst of deathlik silenc thei lai hand on him and lead him awai the crowd instantli bow down to the earth like on man befor the old inquisitor he bless the peopl in silenc and pass on the guard lead their prison to the close gloomi vault prison in the ancient palac of the holi inquisit and shut him in it the dai pass and is follow by the dark burn breathless night of sevil the air is fragrant with laurel and lemon in the pitch dark the iron door of the prison is suddenli open and the grand inquisitor himself come in with a light in hi hand he is alon the door is close at onc behind him he stand in the doorwai and for a minut or two gaze into hi face at last he goe up slowli set the light on the tabl and speak is it thou thou but receiv no answer he add at onc don t answer be silent what canst thou sai inde i know too well what thou wouldst sai and thou hast no right to add anyth to what thou hadst said of old why then art thou come to hinder us for thou hast come to hinder us and thou knowest that but dost thou know what will be to morrow i know not who thou art and care not to know whether it is thou or onli a semblanc of him but to morrow i shall condemn thee and burn thee at the stake as the worst of heret and the veri peopl who have to dai kiss thy feet to morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the ember of thy fire knowest thou that ye mayb thou knowest it he ad with thought penetr never for a moment take hi ey off the prison i don t quit understand ivan what doe it mean alyosha who had been listen in silenc said with a smile is it simpli a wild fantasi or a mistak on the part of the old man some imposs quiproquo take it as the last said ivan laugh if you ar so corrupt by modern realism and can t stand anyth fantast if you like it to be a case of mistaken ident let it be so it is true he went on laugh the old man wa nineti and he might well be crazi over hi set idea he might have been struck by the appear of the prison it might in fact be simpli hi rave the delus of an old man of nineti over excit by the auto da f of a hundr heret the dai befor but doe it matter to us after all whether it wa a mistak of ident or a wild fantasi all that matter is that the old man should speak out should speak openli of what he ha thought in silenc for nineti year and the prison too is silent doe he look at him and not sai a word that s inevit in ani case ivan laugh again the old man ha told him he hasn t the right to add anyth to what he ha said of old on mai sai it is the most fundament featur of roman catholic in my opinion at least all ha been given by thee to the pope thei sai and all therefor is still in the pope s hand and there is no need for thee to come now at all thou must not meddl for the time at least that s how thei speak and write too the jesuit at ani rate i have read it myself in the work of their theologian hast thou the right to reveal to us on of the mysteri of that world from which thou hast come my old man ask him and answer the question for him no thou hast not that thou mayest not add to what ha been said of old and mayest not take from men the freedom which thou didst exalt when thou wast on earth whatsoev thou revealest anew will encroach on men s freedom of faith for it will be manifest as a miracl and the freedom of their faith wa dearer to thee than anyth in those dai fifteen hundr year ago didst thou not often sai then i will make you free but now thou hast seen these free men the old man add suddenli with a pensiv smile ye we ve paid dearli for it he goe on look sternli at him but at last we have complet that work in thy name for fifteen centuri we have been wrestl with thy freedom but now it is end and over for good dost thou not believ that it s over for good thou lookest meekli at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me but let me tell thee that now to dai peopl ar more persuad than ever that thei have perfect freedom yet thei have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbl at our feet but that ha been our do wa thi what thou didst wa thi thy freedom i don t understand again alyosha broke in is he iron is he jest not a bit of it he claim it as a merit for himself and hi church that at last thei have vanquish freedom and have done so to make men happi for now he is speak of the inquisit of cours for the first time it ha becom possibl to think of the happi of men man wa creat a rebel and how can rebel be happi thou wast warn he sai to him thou hast had no lack of admonit and warn but thou didst not listen to those warn thou didst reject the onli wai by which men might be made happi but fortun depart thou didst hand on the work to us thou hast promis thou hast establish by thy word thou hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind and now of cours thou canst not think of take it awai why then hast thou come to hinder us and what s the mean of no lack of admonit and warn ask alyosha why that s the chief part of what the old man must sai the wise and dread spirit the spirit of self destruct and non exist the old man goe on the great spirit talk with thee in the wilder and we ar told in the book that he tempt thee is that so and could anyth truer be said than what he reveal to thee in three question and what thou didst reject and what in the book is call the temptat and yet if there ha ever been on earth a real stupend miracl it took place on that dai on the dai of the three temptat the statement of those three question wa itself the miracl if it were possibl to imagin simpli for the sake of argument that those three question of the dread spirit had perish utterli from the book and that we had to restor them and to invent them anew and to do so had gather togeth all the wise men of the earth ruler chief priest learn men philosoph poet and had set them the task to invent three question such as would not onli fit the occas but express in three word three human phrase the whole futur histori of the world and of human dost thou believ that all the wisdom of the earth unit could have invent anyth in depth and forc equal to the three question which were actual put to thee then by the wise and mighti spirit in the wilder from those question alon from the miracl of their statement we can see that we have here to do not with the fleet human intellig but with the absolut and etern for in those three question the whole subsequ histori of mankind is as it were brought togeth into on whole and foretold and in them ar unit all the unsolv histor contradict of human natur at the time it could not be so clear sinc the futur wa unknown but now that fifteen hundr year have pass we see that everyth in those three question wa so justli divin and foretold and ha been so truli fulfil that noth can be ad to them or taken from them judg thyself who wa right thou or he who question thee then rememb the first question it mean in other word wa thi thou wouldst go into the world and art go with empti hand with some promis of freedom which men in their simplic and their natur unruli cannot even understand which thei fear and dread for noth ha ever been more insupport for a man and a human societi than freedom but seest thou these stone in thi parch and barren wilder turn them into bread and mankind will run after thee like a flock of sheep grate and obedi though for ever trembl lest thou withdraw thy hand and deni them thy bread but thou wouldst not depriv man of freedom and didst reject the offer think what is that freedom worth if obedi is bought with bread thou didst repli that man live not by bread alon but dost thou know that for the sake of that earthli bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against thee and will strive with thee and overcom thee and all will follow him cry who can compar with thi beast he ha given us fire from heaven dost thou know that the ag will pass and human will proclaim by the lip of their sage that there is no crime and therefor no sin there is onli hunger feed men and then ask of them virtu that s what thei ll write on the banner which thei will rais against thee and with which thei will destroi thy templ where thy templ stood will rise a new build the terribl tower of babel will be built again and though like the on of old it will not be finish yet thou mightest have prevent that new tower and have cut short the suffer of men for a thousand year for thei will come back to us after a thousand year of agoni with their tower thei will seek us again hidden underground in the catacomb for we shall be again persecut and tortur thei will find us and cry to us feed us for those who have promis us fire from heaven haven t given it and then we shall finish build their tower for he finish the build who feed them and we alon shall feed them in thy name declar fals that it is in thy name oh never never can thei feed themselv without us no scienc will give them bread so long as thei remain free in the end thei will lai their freedom at our feet and sai to us make us your slave but feed us thei will understand themselv at last that freedom and bread enough for all ar inconceiv togeth for never never will thei be abl to share between them thei will be convinc too that thei can never be free for thei ar weak viciou worthless and rebelli thou didst promis them the bread of heaven but i repeat again can it compar with earthli bread in the ey of the weak ever sin and ignobl race of man and if for the sake of the bread of heaven thousand shall follow thee what is to becom of the million and ten of thousand of million of creatur who will not have the strength to forego the earthli bread for the sake of the heavenli or dost thou care onli for the ten of thousand of the great and strong while the million numer as the sand of the sea who ar weak but love thee must exist onli for the sake of the great and strong no we care for the weak too thei ar sin and rebelli but in the end thei too will becom obedi thei will marvel at us and look on us as god becaus we ar readi to endur the freedom which thei have found so dread and to rule over them so aw it will seem to them to be free but we shall tell them that we ar thy servant and rule them in thy name we shall deceiv them again for we will not let thee come to us again that decept will be our suffer for we shall be forc to lie thi is the signific of the first question in the wilder and thi is what thou hast reject for the sake of that freedom which thou hast exalt abov everyth yet in thi question li hid the great secret of thi world choos bread thou wouldst have satisfi the univers and everlast crave of human to find some on to worship so long as man remain free he strive for noth so incessantli and so painfulli as to find some on to worship but man seek to worship what is establish beyond disput so that all men would agre at onc to worship it for these piti creatur ar concern not onli to find what on or the other can worship but to find someth that all would believ in and worship what is essenti is that all mai be togeth in it thi crave for commun of worship is the chief miseri of everi man individu and of all human from the begin of time for the sake of common worship thei ve slain each other with the sword thei have set up god and challeng on anoth put awai your god and come and worship our or we will kill you and your god and so it will be to the end of the world even when god disappear from the earth thei will fall down befor idol just the same thou didst know thou couldst not but have known thi fundament secret of human natur but thou didst reject the on infal banner which wa offer thee to make all men bow down to thee alon the banner of earthli bread and thou hast reject it for the sake of freedom and the bread of heaven behold what thou didst further and all again in the name of freedom i tell thee that man is torment by no greater anxieti than to find some on quickli to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill fate creatur is born but onli on who can appeas their conscienc can take over their freedom in bread there wa offer thee an invinc banner give bread and man will worship thee for noth is more certain than bread but if some on els gain possess of hi conscienc oh then he will cast awai thy bread and follow after him who ha ensnar hi conscienc in that thou wast right for the secret of man s be is not onli to live but to have someth to live for without a stabl concept of the object of life man would not consent to go on live and would rather destroi himself than remain on earth though he had bread in abund that is true but what happen instead of take men s freedom from them thou didst make it greater than ever didst thou forget that man prefer peac and even death to freedom of choic in the knowledg of good and evil noth is more seduct for man than hi freedom of conscienc but noth is a greater caus of suffer and behold instead of give a firm foundat for set the conscienc of man at rest for ever thou didst choos all that is except vagu and enigmat thou didst choos what wa utterli beyond the strength of men act as though thou didst not love them at all thou who didst come to give thy life for them instead of take possess of men s freedom thou didst increas it and burden the spiritu kingdom of mankind with it suffer for ever thou didst desir man s free love that he should follow thee freeli entic and taken captiv by thee in place of the rigid ancient law man must hereaft with free heart decid for himself what is good and what is evil have onli thy imag befor him as hi guid but didst thou not know that he would at last reject even thy imag and thy truth if he is weigh down with the fear burden of free choic thei will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in thee for thei could not have been left in greater confus and suffer than thou hast caus lai upon them so mani care and unanswer problem so that in truth thou didst thyself lai the foundat for the destruct of thy kingdom and no on is more to blame for it yet what wa offer thee there ar three power three power alon abl to conquer and to hold captiv for ever the conscienc of these impot rebel for their happi those forc ar miracl mysteri and author thou hast reject all three and hast set the exampl for do so when the wise and dread spirit set thee on the pinnacl of the templ and said to thee if thou wouldst know whether thou art the son of god then cast thyself down for it is written the angel shall hold him up lest he fall and bruis himself and thou shalt know then whether thou art the son of god and shalt prove then how great is thy faith in thy father but thou didst refus and wouldst not cast thyself down oh of cours thou didst proudli and well like god but the weak unruli race of men ar thei god oh thou didst know then that in take on step in make on movement to cast thyself down thou wouldst be tempt god and have lost all thy faith in him and wouldst have been dash to piec against that earth which thou didst come to save and the wise spirit that tempt thee would have rejoic but i ask again ar there mani like thee and couldst thou believ for on moment that men too could face such a temptat is the natur of men such that thei can reject miracl and at the great moment of their life the moment of their deepest most agon spiritu difficulti cling onli to the free verdict of the heart oh thou didst know that thy deed would be record in book would be hand down to remot time and the utmost end of the earth and thou didst hope that man follow thee would cling to god and not ask for a miracl but thou didst not know that when man reject miracl he reject god too for man seek not so much god as the miracul and as man cannot bear to be without the miracul he will creat new miracl of hi own for himself and will worship deed of sorceri and witchcraft though he might be a hundr time over a rebel heret and infidel thou didst not come down from the cross when thei shout to thee mock and revil thee come down from the cross and we will believ that thou art he thou didst not come down for again thou wouldst not enslav man by a miracl and didst crave faith given freeli not base on miracl thou didst crave for free love and not the base raptur of the slave befor the might that ha overaw him for ever but thou didst think too highli of men therein for thei ar slave of cours though rebelli by natur look round and judg fifteen centuri have pass look upon them whom hast thou rais up to thyself i swear man is weaker and baser by natur than thou hast believ him can he can he do what thou didst by show him so much respect thou didst as it were ceas to feel for him for thou didst ask far too much from him thou who hast love him more than thyself respect him less thou wouldst have ask less of him that would have been more like love for hi burden would have been lighter he is weak and vile what though he is everywher now rebel against our power and proud of hi rebellion it is the pride of a child and a schoolboi thei ar littl children riot and bar out the teacher at school but their childish delight will end it will cost them dear thei will cast down templ and drench the earth with blood but thei will see at last the foolish children that though thei ar rebel thei ar impot rebel unabl to keep up their own rebellion bath in their foolish tear thei will recogn at last that he who creat them rebel must have meant to mock at them thei will sai thi in despair and their utter will be a blasphemi which will make them more unhappi still for man s natur cannot bear blasphemi and in the end alwai aveng it on itself and so unrest confus and unhappi that is the present lot of man after thou didst bear so much for their freedom the great prophet tell in vision and in imag that he saw all those who took part in the first resurrect and that there were of each tribe twelv thousand but if there were so mani of them thei must have been not men but god thei had born thy cross thei had endur score of year in the barren hungri wilder live upon locust and root and thou mayest inde point with pride at those children of freedom of free love of free and splendid sacrific for thy name but rememb that thei were onli some thousand and what of the rest and how ar the other weak on to blame becaus thei could not endur what the strong have endur how is the weak soul to blame that it is unabl to receiv such terribl gift canst thou have simpli come to the elect and for the elect but if so it is a mysteri and we cannot understand it and if it is a mysteri we too have a right to preach a mysteri and to teach them that it s not the free judgment of their heart not love that matter but a mysteri which thei must follow blindli even against their conscienc so we have done we have correct thy work and have found it upon miracl mysteri and author and men rejoic that thei were again led like sheep and that the terribl gift that had brought them such suffer wa at last lift from their heart were we right teach them thi speak did we not love mankind so meekli acknowledg their feebl lovingli lighten their burden and permit their weak natur even sin with our sanction why hast thou come now to hinder us and why dost thou look silent and searchingli at me with thy mild ey be angri i don t want thy love for i love thee not and what us is it for me to hide anyth from thee don t i know to whom i am speak all that i can sai is known to thee alreadi and is it for me to conceal from thee our mysteri perhap it is thy will to hear it from my lip listen then we ar not work with thee but with him that is our mysteri it s long eight centuri sinc we have been on hi side and not on thine just eight centuri ago we took from him what thou didst reject with scorn that last gift he offer thee show thee all the kingdom of the earth we took from him rome and the sword of c sar and proclaim ourselv sole ruler of the earth though hitherto we have not been abl to complet our work but whose fault is that oh the work is onli begin but it ha begun it ha long to await complet and the earth ha yet much to suffer but we shall triumph and shall be c sar and then we shall plan the univers happi of man but thou mightest have taken even then the sword of c sar why didst thou reject that last gift hadst thou accept that last counsel of the mighti spirit thou wouldst have accomplish all that man seek on earth that is some on to worship some on to keep hi conscienc and some mean of unit all in on unanim and harmoni ant heap for the crave for univers uniti is the third and last anguish of men mankind as a whole ha alwai striven to organ a univers state there have been mani great nation with great histori but the more highli thei were develop the more unhappi thei were for thei felt more acut than other peopl the crave for world wide union the great conqueror timour and ghenghi khan whirl like hurrican over the face of the earth strive to subdu it peopl and thei too were but the unconsci express of the same crave for univers uniti hadst thou taken the world and c sar s purpl thou wouldst have found the univers state and have given univers peac for who can rule men if not he who hold their conscienc and their bread in hi hand we have taken the sword of c sar and in take it of cours have reject thee and follow him oh ag ar yet to come of the confus of free thought of their scienc and cannib for have begun to build their tower of babel without us thei will end of cours with cannib but then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet and spatter them with tear of blood and we shall sit upon the beast and rais the cup and on it will be written mysteri but then and onli then the reign of peac and happi will come for men thou art proud of thine elect but thou hast onli the elect while we give rest to all and besid how mani of those elect those mighti on who could becom elect have grown weari wait for thee and have transfer and will transfer the power of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp and end by rais their free banner against thee thou didst thyself lift up that banner but with us all will be happi and will no more rebel nor destroi on anoth as under thy freedom oh we shall persuad them that thei will onli becom free when thei renounc their freedom to us and submit to us and shall we be right or shall we be ly thei will be convinc that we ar right for thei will rememb the horror of slaveri and confus to which thy freedom brought them freedom free thought and scienc will lead them into such strait and will bring them face to face with such marvel and insolubl mysteri that some of them the fierc and rebelli will destroi themselv other rebelli but weak will destroi on anoth while the rest weak and unhappi will crawl fawn to our feet and whine to us ye you were right you alon possess hi mysteri and we come back to you save us from ourselv receiv bread from us thei will see clearli that we take the bread made by their hand from them to give it to them without ani miracl thei will see that we do not chang the stone to bread but in truth thei will be more thank for take it from our hand than for the bread itself for thei will rememb onli too well that in old dai without our help even the bread thei made turn to stone in their hand while sinc thei have come back to us the veri stone have turn to bread in their hand too too well will thei know the valu of complet submiss and until men know that thei will be unhappi who is most to blame for their not know it speak who scatter the flock and sent it astrai on unknown path but the flock will come togeth again and will submit onc more and then it will be onc for all then we shall give them the quiet humbl happi of weak creatur such as thei ar by natur oh we shall persuad them at last not to be proud for thou didst lift them up and therebi taught them to be proud we shall show them that thei ar weak that thei ar onli piti children but that childlik happi is the sweetest of all thei will becom timid and will look to us and huddl close to us in fear as chick to the hen thei will marvel at us and will be aw stricken befor us and will be proud at our be so power and clever that we have been abl to subdu such a turbul flock of thousand of million thei will trembl impot befor our wrath their mind will grow fear thei will be quick to shed tear like women and children but thei will be just as readi at a sign from us to pass to laughter and rejoic to happi mirth and childish song ye we shall set them to work but in their leisur hour we shall make their life like a child s game with children s song and innoc danc oh we shall allow them even sin thei ar weak and helpless and thei will love us like children becaus we allow them to sin we shall tell them that everi sin will be expiat if it is done with our permiss that we allow them to sin becaus we love them and the punish for these sin we take upon ourselv and we shall take it upon ourselv and thei will ador us as their savior who have taken on themselv their sin befor god and thei will have no secret from us we shall allow or forbid them to live with their wive and mistress to have or not to have children accord to whether thei have been obedi or disobedi and thei will submit to us gladli and cheerfulli the most pain secret of their conscienc all all thei will

themselv and all will be happi all the million of creatur except the hundr thousand who rule over them for onli we we who guard the mysteri shall be unhappi there will be thousand of million of happi babe and a hundr thousand suffer who have taken upon themselv the curs of the knowledg of good and evil peacefulli thei will die peacefulli thei will expir in thy name and beyond the grave thei will find noth but death but we shall keep the secret and for their happi we shall allur them with the reward of heaven and etern though if there were anyth in the other world it certainli would not be for such as thei it is prophesi that thou wilt come again in victori thou wilt come with thy chosen the proud and strong but we will sai that thei have onli save themselv but we have save all we ar told that the harlot who sit upon the beast and hold in her hand the mysteri shall be put to shame that the weak will rise up again and will rend her royal purpl and will strip nake her loathsom bodi but then i will stand up and point out to thee the thousand million of happi children who have known no sin and we who have taken their sin upon us for their happi will stand up befor thee and sai judg us if thou canst and darest know that i fear thee not know that i too have been in the wilder i too have live on root and locust i too prize the freedom with which thou hast bless men and i too wa strive to stand among thy elect among the strong and power thirst to make up the number but i awaken and would not serv mad i turn back and join the rank of those who have correct thy work i left the proud and went back to the humbl for the happi of the humbl what i sai to thee will come to pass and our dominion will be built up i repeat to morrow thou shalt see that obedi flock who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinder about the pile on which i shall burn thee for come to hinder us for if ani on ha ever deserv our fire it is thou to morrow i shall burn thee dixi ivan stop he wa carri awai as he talk and spoke with excit when he had finish he suddenli smile alyosha had listen in silenc toward the end he wa greatli move and seem sever time on the point of interrupt but restrain himself now hi word came with a rush but that s absurd he cri flush your poem is in prais of jesu not in blame of him as you meant it to be and who will believ you about freedom is that the wai to understand it that s not the idea of it in the orthodox church that s rome and not even the whole of rome it s fals those ar the worst of the cathol the inquisitor the jesuit and there could not be such a fantast creatur as your inquisitor what ar these sin of mankind thei take on themselv who ar these keeper of the mysteri who have taken some curs upon themselv for the happi of mankind when have thei been seen we know the jesuit thei ar spoken ill of but sure thei ar not what you describ thei ar not that at all not at all thei ar simpli the romish armi for the earthli sovereignti of the world in the futur with the pontiff of rome for emperor that s their ideal but there s no sort of mysteri or lofti melancholi about it it s simpl lust of power of filthi earthli gain of domin someth like a univers serfdom with them as master that s all thei stand for thei don t even believ in god perhap your suffer inquisitor is a mere fantasi stai stai laugh ivan how hot you ar a fantasi you sai let it be so of cours it s a fantasi but allow me to sai do you realli think that the roman cathol movement of the last centuri is actual noth but the lust of power of filthi earthli gain is that father pa ssy s teach no no on the contrari father pa ssy did onc sai someth rather the same as you but of cours it s not the same not a bit the same alyosha hastili correct himself a preciou admiss in spite of your not a bit the same i ask you why your jesuit and inquisitor have unit simpli for vile materi gain why can there not be among them on martyr oppress by great sorrow and love human you see onli suppos that there wa on such man among all those who desir noth but filthi materi gain if there s onli on like my old inquisitor who had himself eaten root in the desert and made frenzi effort to subdu hi flesh to make himself free and perfect but yet all hi life he love human and suddenli hi ey were open and he saw that it is no great moral blessed to attain perfect and freedom if at the same time on gain the convict that million of god s creatur have been creat as a mockeri that thei will never be capabl of us their freedom that these poor rebel can never turn into giant to complet the tower that it wa not for such gees that the great idealist dreamt hi dream of harmoni see all that he turn back and join the clever peopl sure that could have happen join whom what clever peopl cri alyosha complet carri awai thei have no such great clever and no mysteri and secret perhap noth but atheism that s all their secret your inquisitor doe not believ in god that s hi secret what if it is so at last you have guess it it s perfectli true it s true that that s the whole secret but isn t that suffer at least for a man like that who ha wast hi whole life in the desert and yet could not shake off hi incur love of human in hi old ag he reach the clear convict that noth but the advic of the great dread spirit could build up ani toler sort of life for the feebl unruli incomplet empir creatur creat in jest and so convinc of thi he see that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit the dread spirit of death and destruct and therefor accept ly and decept and lead men conscious to death and destruct and yet deceiv them all the wai so that thei mai not notic where thei ar be led that the poor blind creatur mai at least on the wai think themselv happi and note the decept is in the name of him in whose ideal the old man had so fervent believ all hi life long is not that tragic and if onli on such stood at the head of the whole armi fill with the lust of power onli for the sake of filthi gain would not on such be enough to make a tragedi more than that on such stand at the head is enough to creat the actual lead idea of the roman church with all it armi and jesuit it highest idea i tell you frankli that i firmli believ that there ha alwai been such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement who know there mai have been some such even among the roman pope who know perhap the spirit of that accurs old man who love mankind so obstin in hi own wai is to be found even now in a whole multitud of such old men exist not by chanc but by agreement as a secret leagu form long ago for the guard of the mysteri to guard it from the weak and the unhappi so as to make them happi no doubt it is so and so it must be inde i fanci that even among the mason there s someth of the same mysteri at the bottom and that that s why the cathol so detest the mason as their rival break up the uniti of the idea while it is so essenti that there should be on flock and on shepherd but from the wai i defend my idea i might be an author impati of your critic enough of it you ar perhap a mason yourself broke suddenli from alyosha you don t believ in god he ad speak thi time veri sorrowfulli he fanci besid that hi brother wa look at him iron how doe your poem end he ask suddenli look down or wa it the end i meant to end it like thi when the inquisitor ceas speak he wait some time for hi prison to answer him hi silenc weigh down upon him he saw that the prison had listen intent all the time look gentli in hi face and evid not wish to repli the old man long for him to sai someth howev bitter and terribl but he suddenli approach the old man in silenc and softli kiss him on hi bloodless ag lip that wa all hi answer the old man shudder hi lip move he went to the door open it and said to him go and come no more come not at all never never and he let him out into the dark allei of the town the prison went awai and the old man the kiss glow in hi heart but the old man adher to hi idea and you with him you too cri alyosha mournfulli ivan laugh why it s all nonsens alyosha it s onli a senseless poem of a senseless student who could never write two line of vers why do you take it so serious sure you don t suppos i am go straight off to the jesuit to join the men who ar correct hi work good lord it s no busi of mine i told you all i want is to live on to thirti and then dash the cup to the ground but the littl sticki leav and the preciou tomb and the blue sky and the woman you love how will you live how will you love them alyosha cri sorrowfulli with such a hell in your heart and your head how can you no that s just what you ar go awai for to join them if not you will kill yourself you can t endur it there is a strength to endur everyth ivan said with a cold smile what strength the strength of the karamazov the strength of the karamazov base to sink into debaucheri to stifl your soul with corrupt ye possibl even that onli perhap till i am thirti i shall escap it and then how will you escap it by what will you escap it that s imposs with your idea in the karamazov wai again everyth is law you mean everyth

you like everyth is law sinc the word ha been said i won t deni it and mitya s version isn t bad alyosha look at him in silenc i thought that go awai from here i have you at least ivan said suddenli with unexpect feel but now i see that there is no place for me even in your heart my dear hermit the formula all is law i won t renounc will you renounc me for that ye alyosha got up went to him and softli kiss him on the lip that s plagiar cri ivan highli delight you stole that from my poem thank you though get up alyosha it s time we were go both of us thei went out but stop when thei reach the entranc of the restaur listen alyosha ivan began in a resolut voic if i am realli abl to care for the sticki littl leav i shall onli love them rememb you it s enough for me that you ar somewher here and i shan t lose my desir for life yet is that enough for you take it as a declar of love if you like and now you go to the right and i to the left and it s enough do you hear enough i mean even if i don t go awai to morrow i think i certainli shall go and we meet again don t sai a word more on these subject i beg that particularli and about dmitri too i ask you special never speak to me again he

it s rather a solemn promis you see and we realli mai be part for seven year or ten come go now to your pater seraphicu he is dy if he di without you you will be angri with me for have kept you good by kiss me onc more that s right now go ivan turn suddenli and went hi wai without look back it wa just as dmitri had left alyosha the dai befor though the part had been veri differ the strang resembl flash like an arrow through alyosha s mind in the distress and deject of that moment he wait a littl look after hi brother he suddenli notic that ivan swai as he walk and that hi right shoulder look lower than hi left he had never notic it befor but all at onc he turn too and almost ran to the monasteri it wa nearli dark and he felt almost frighten someth new wa grow up in him for which he could not account the wind had risen again as on the previou even and the ancient pine murmur gloomili about him when he enter the hermitag cops he almost ran pater seraphicu he got that name from somewher where from alyosha wonder ivan poor ivan and when shall i see you again here is the hermitag ye ye that he is pater seraphicu he will save me from him and for ever sever time afterward he wonder how he could on leav ivan so complet forget hi brother dmitri though he had that morn onli a few hour befor so firmli resolv to find him and not to give up do so even should he be unabl to return to the monasteri that night chapter vi for awhil a veri obscur on and ivan on part from alyosha went home to fyodor pavlovitch s hous but strang to sai he wa overcom by insuffer depress which grew greater at everi step he took toward the hous there wa noth strang in hi be depress what wa strang wa that ivan could not have said what wa the caus of it he had often been depress befor and there wa noth surpris at hi feel so at such a moment when he had broken off with everyth that had brought him here and wa prepar that dai to make a new start and enter upon a new unknown futur he would again be as solitari as ever and though he had great hope and great too great expect from life he could not have given ani definit account of hi hope hi expect or even hi desir yet at that moment though the apprehens of the new and unknown certainli found place in hi heart what wa worri him wa someth quit differ is it loath for my father s hous he wonder quit like i am so sick of it and though it s the last time i shall cross it hate threshold still i loath it no it s not that either is it the part with alyosha and the convers i had with him for so mani year i ve been silent with the whole world and not deign to speak and all of a sudden i reel off a rigmarol like that it certainli might have been the youth vexat of youth inexperi and vaniti vexat at have fail to express himself especi with such a be as alyosha on whom hi heart had certainli been reckon no doubt that came in that vexat it must have done inde but yet that wa not it that wa not it either i feel sick with depress and yet i can t tell what i want better not think perhap ivan tri not to think but that too wa no us what made hi depress so vexati and irrit wa that it had a kind of casual extern charact he felt that some person or thing seem to be stand out somewher just as someth will sometim obtrud itself upon the ey and though on mai be so busi with work or convers that for a long time on doe not notic it yet it irrit and almost torment on till at last on realiz and remov the offend object often quit a trifl and ridicul on some articl left about in the wrong place a handkerchief on the floor a book not replac on the shelf and so on at last feel veri cross and ill humor ivan arriv home and suddenli about fifteen pace from the garden gate he guess what wa fret and worri him on a bench in the gatewai the valet smerdyakov wa sit enjoi the cool of the even and at the first glanc at him ivan knew that the valet smerdyakov wa on hi mind and that it wa thi man that hi soul loath it all dawn upon him suddenli and becam clear just befor when alyosha had been tell him of hi meet with smerdyakov he had felt a sudden twing of gloom and loath which had immedi stir respons anger in hi heart afterward as he talk smerdyakov had been forgotten for the time but still he had been in hi mind and as soon as ivan part with alyosha and wa walk home the forgotten sensat began to obtrud itself again is it possibl that a miser contempt creatur like that can worri me so much he wonder with insuffer irrit it wa true that ivan had come of late to feel an intens dislik for the man especi dure the last few dai he had even begun to notic in himself a grow feel that wa almost of hatr for the creatur perhap thi hatr wa accentu by the fact that when ivan first came to the neighborhood he had felt quit differ then he had taken a mark interest in smerdyakov and had even thought him veri origin he had encourag him to talk to him although he had alwai wonder at a certain incoher or rather restless in hi mind and could not understand what it wa that so continu and insist work upon the brain of the contempl thei discuss philosoph question and even how there could have been light on the first dai when the sun moon and star were onli creat on the fourth dai and how that wa to be understood but ivan soon saw that though the sun moon and star might be an interest subject yet that it wa quit secondari to smerdyakov and that he wa look for someth altogeth differ in on wai and anoth he began to betrai a boundless vaniti and a wound vaniti too and that ivan dislik it had first given rise to hi avers later on there had been troubl in the hous grushenka had come on the scene and there had been the scandal with hi brother dmitri thei discuss that too but though smerdyakov alwai talk of that with great excit it wa imposs to discov what he desir to come of it there wa in fact someth surpris in the illog and incoher of some of hi desir accident betrai and alwai vagu express smerdyakov wa alwai inquir put certain indirect but obvious premedit question but what hi object wa he did not explain and usual at the most import moment he would break off and relaps into silenc or pass to anoth subject but what final irrit ivan most and confirm hi dislik for him wa the peculiar revolt familiar which smerdyakov began to show more and more markedli not that he forgot himself and wa rude on the contrari he alwai spoke veri respectfulli yet he had obvious begun to consid good know why that there wa some sort of understand between him and ivan fyodorovitch he alwai spoke in a tone that suggest that those two had some kind of compact some secret between them that had at some time been express on both side onli known to them and beyond the comprehens of those around them but for a long while ivan did not recogn the real caus of hi grow dislik and he had onli late realiz what wa at the root of it with a feel of disgust and irrit he tri to pass in at the gate without speak or look at smerdyakov but smerdyakov rose from the bench and from that action alon ivan knew instantli that he want particularli to talk to him ivan look at him and stop and the fact that he did stop instead of pass by as he meant to the minut befor drove him to furi with anger and repuls he look at smerdyakov s emascul sickli face with the littl curl comb forward on hi forehead hi left ey wink and he grin as if to sai where ar you go you won t pass by you see that we two clever peopl have someth to sai to each other ivan shook get awai miser idiot what have i to do with you wa on the tip of hi tongu but to hi profound astonish he heard himself sai is my father still asleep or ha he wake he ask the question softli and meekli to hi own surpris and at onc again to hi own surpris sat down on the bench for an instant he felt almost frighten he rememb it afterward smerdyakov stood face him hi hand behind hi back look at him with assur and almost sever hi honor is still asleep he articul deliber you were the first to speak not i he seem to sai i am surpris at you sir he ad after a paus drop hi ey affectedli set hi right foot forward and plai with the tip of hi polish boot why ar you surpris at me ivan ask abruptli and sullenli do hi utmost to restrain himself and suddenli realiz with disgust that he wa feel intens curios and would not on ani account have gone awai without satisfi it why don t you go to tchermashnya sir smerdyakov suddenli rais hi ey and smile familiarli why i smile you must understand of yourself if you ar a clever man hi screw up left ey seem to sai why should i go to tchermashnya ivan ask in surpris smerdyakov wa silent again fyodor pavlovitch himself ha so beg you to he said at last slowli and appar attach no signific to hi answer i put you off with a secondari reason he seem to suggest simpli to sai someth damn you speak out what you want ivan cri angrili at last pass from meek to violenc smerdyakov drew hi right foot up to hi left pull himself up but still look at him with the same seren and the same littl smile substanti noth but just by wai of convers anoth silenc follow thei did not speak for nearli a minut ivan knew that he ought to get up and show anger and smerdyakov stood befor him and seem to be wait as though to see whether he would be angri or not so at least it seem to ivan at last he move to get up smerdyakov seem to seiz the moment i m in an aw posit ivan fyodorovitch i don t know how to help myself he said resolut and distinctli and at hi last word he sigh ivan fyodorovitch sat down again thei ar both utterli crazi thei

grigori know beforehand he will be sure not to let him in i should never dare to tell grigori vassilyevitch about the signal without order from my master and as for grigori vassilyevitch hear him and not admit him he ha been ill ever sinc yesterdai and marfa ignatyevna intend to give him medicin to morrow thei ve just arrang it it s a veri strang remedi of her marfa ignatyevna know of a prepar and alwai keep it it s a strong thing made from some herb she ha the secret of it and she alwai give it to grigori vassilyevitch three time a year when hi lumbago s so bad he is almost paralyz by it then she take a towel wet it with the stuff and rub hi whole back for half an hour till it s quit red and swollen and what s left in the bottl she give him to drink with a special prayer but not quit all for on such occas she leav some for herself and drink it herself and as thei never take strong drink i assur you thei both drop asleep at onc and sleep sound a veri long time and when grigori vassilyevitch wake up he is perfectli well after it but marfa ignatyevna alwai ha a headach from it so if marfa ignatyevna carri out her intent to morrow thei won t hear anyth and hinder dmitri fyodorovitch thei ll be asleep what a rigmarol and it all seem to happen at onc as though it were plan you ll have a fit and thei ll both be unconsci cri ivan but aren t you try to arrang it so broke from him suddenli and he frown threateningli how could i and why should i when it all depend on dmitri fyodorovitch and hi plan if he mean to do anyth he ll do it but if not i shan t be thrust him upon hi father and why should he go to father especi on the sly if as you sai yourself agrafena alexandrovna won t come at all ivan went on turn white with anger you sai that yourself and all the while i ve been here i ve felt sure it wa all the old man s fanci and the creatur won t come to him why should dmitri break in on him if she doesn t come speak i want to know what you ar think you know yourself why he ll come what s the us of what i think hi honor will come simpli becaus he is in a rage or suspici on account of my ill perhap and he ll dash in as he did yesterdai through impati to search the room to see whether she hasn t escap him on the sly he is perfectli well awar too that fyodor pavlovitch ha a big envelop with three thousand roubl in it ti up with ribbon and seal with three seal on it is written in hi own hand to my angel grushenka if she will come to which he ad three dai later for my littl chicken there s no know what that might do nonsens cri ivan almost besid himself dmitri won t come to steal monei and kill my father to do it he might have kill him yesterdai on account of grushenka like the frantic savag fool he is but he won t steal he is in veri great need of monei now the greatest need ivan fyodorovitch you don t know in what need he is smerdyakov explain with perfect composur and remark distinct he look on that three thousand as hi own too he said so to me himself my father still ow me just three thousand he said and besid that consid ivan fyodorovitch there is someth els perfectli true it s as good as certain so to sai that agrafena alexandrovna will forc him if onli she care to to marri her the master himself i mean fyodor pavlovitch if onli she care to and of cours she mai care to all i ve said is that she won t come but mayb she s look for more than that i mean to be mistress here i know myself that samsonov her merchant wa laugh with her about it tell her quit openli that it would not be at all a stupid thing to do and she s got plenti of sens she wouldn t marri a beggar like dmitri fyodorovitch so take that into consider ivan fyodorovitch reflect that then neither dmitri fyodorovitch nor yourself and your brother alexei fyodorovitch would have anyth after the master s death not a roubl for agrafena alexandrovna would marri him simpli to get hold of the whole all the monei there is but if your father were to die now there d be some forti thousand for sure even for dmitri fyodorovitch whom he hate so for he s made no will dmitri fyodorovitch know all that veri well a sort of shudder pass over ivan s face he suddenli flush then why on earth he suddenli interrupt smerdyakov do you advis me to go to tchermashnya what did you mean by that if i go awai you see what will happen here ivan drew hi breath with difficulti precis so said smerdyakov softli and reason watch ivan intent howev what do you mean by precis so ivan question him with a menac light in hi ey restrain himself with difficulti i spoke

disappear hi face express attent and expect intent but timid and cring haven t you someth more to sai someth to add could be read in the intent gaze he fix on ivan and couldn t i be sent for from tchermashnya too in case anyth happen ivan shout suddenli for some unknown reason rais hi voic from tchermashnya too you could be sent for smerdyakov mutter almost in a whisper look disconcert but

though there is no doubt from other account of it that the convers that even wa gener though the guest did not interrupt father zossima much yet thei too talk perhap even told someth themselv besid father zossima could not have carri on an uninterrupt narr for he wa sometim gasp for breath hi voic fail him and he even lai down to rest on hi bed though he did not fall asleep and hi visitor did not leav their seat onc or twice the convers wa interrupt by father pa ssy s read the gospel it is worthi of note too that no on of them suppos that he would die that night for on that even of hi life

that we were bad by natur all these young men were good fellow but thei behav badli and i worst of all what made it wors for me wa that i had come into my own monei and so i flung myself into a life of pleasur and plung headlong into all the reckless of youth i wa fond of read yet strang to sai the bibl wa the on book i never open at that time though i alwai carri it about with me and i wa never separ from it in veri truth i wa keep that book for the dai and the hour for the month and the year though i knew it not after four year of thi life i chanc to be in the town of k where our regiment wa station at the time we found the peopl of the town hospit rich and fond of entertain i met with a cordial recept everywher as i wa of a live tempera and wa known to be well off which alwai goe a

landown a veri amiabl man still young though older than i wa connect with the best petersburg societi which i wa not and of excel educ which i also wa not i wa so overwhelm at thi unexpect circumst that my mind wa posit cloud the worst of it all wa that as i learn then the young landown had been a long while betroth to her and i had met him inde mani time in her hous but blind by my conceit i had notic noth and thi particularli mortifi me almost everybodi had known all about it while i knew noth i wa fill with sudden irrepress furi with flush face i began recal how often i had been on the

that although everybodi talk openli of our duel the author took no notic of it becaus my antagonist wa a near relat of our gener and as there had been no bloodsh and no seriou consequ and as i resign my commiss thei took it as a joke and i began then to speak aloud and fearlessli regardless of their laughter for it wa alwai kindli and not spite laughter these convers mostli took place in the even in the compani of ladi women particularli like listen to me then and thei made the men listen but how can i possibl be respons for all everi on would laugh in my face can i for instanc be respons for

held out her hand let me tell you she said that i am the first not to laugh at you but on the contrari i thank you with tear and express my respect for you for your action then her husband too came up and then thei all approach me and almost kiss me my heart wa fill with joi but my attent wa especi caught by a middl ag man who came up to me with the other i knew him by name alreadi but had never made hi acquaint nor exchang a word with him till that even d the mysteri visitor he had long been an offici in the town he wa in a promin posit respect by all rich and had a reput for benevol he subscrib consider sum to the almshous and the orphan asylum he wa veri charit too in secret a fact which onli becam known after hi death he wa a man of about fifti almost stern in appear and not much given to convers he had been marri about ten year and hi wife who wa still young had born him three children well i wa sit alon in my room the follow even when my door suddenli open and thi gentleman walk in i must mention by the wai that i wa no longer live in my former quarter as soon as i resign my commiss i took room with an old ladi the widow of a govern clerk my landladi s servant wait upon me for i had move into her room simpli becaus on my return from the duel i had sent afanasi back to the regiment as i felt asham to look him in the face after my last interview with him so prone is the man of the world to be asham of ani righteou action i have said my visitor with great interest listen to you speak in differ hous the last few dai and i want at last to make your person acquaint so as to talk to you more intim can you dear sir grant me thi favor i can with the greatest pleasur and i shall look upon it as an honor i said thi though i felt almost dismai so greatli wa i impress from the first moment by the appear of thi man for though other peopl had listen to me with interest and attent no on had come to me befor with such a seriou stern and concentr express and now he had come to see me in my own room he sat down you ar i see a man of great strength of charact he said as you have dare to serv the truth even when by do so you risk incur the contempt of all your prais is perhap excess i repli no it s not excess he answer believ me such a cours of action is far more difficult than you think it is that which ha impress me and it is onli on that account that i have come to you he continu tell me pleas that is if you ar not annoi by my perhap unseemli curios what were your exact sensat if you can recal them at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiv at the duel do not think my question frivol on the contrari i have in ask the question a secret motiv of my own which i will perhap explain to you later on if it is god s will that we should becom more intim acquaint all the while he wa speak i wa look at him straight into the face and i felt all at onc a complet trust in him and great curios on my side also for i felt that there wa some strang secret in hi soul you ask what were my exact sensat at the moment when i ask my oppon s forgiv i answer but i had better tell you from the begin what i have not yet told ani on els and i describ all that had pass between afanasi and me and how i had bow down to the ground at hi feet from that you can see for yourself i conclud that at the time of the duel it wa easier for me for i had made a begin alreadi at home and when onc i had start on that road to go farther along it wa far from be difficult but becam a sourc of joi and happi i like the wai he look at me as he listen all that he said is exceedingli interest i will come to see you again and again and from that time forth he came to see me nearli everi even and we should have becom greater friend if onli he had ever talk of himself but about himself he scarc ever said a word yet continu ask me about myself in spite of that i becam veri fond of him and spoke with perfect frank to him about all my feel for thought i what need have i to know hi secret sinc i can see without that that he is a good man moreov though he is such a seriou man and my senior he come to see a youngster like me and treat me as hi equal and i learn a great deal that wa profit from him for he wa a man of lofti mind that life is heaven he said to me suddenli that i have long been think about and all at onc he ad i think of noth els inde he look at me and smile i am more convinc of it than you ar i will tell you later why i listen to him and thought that he evid want to tell me someth heaven he went on li hidden within all of us here it li hidden in me now and if i will it it will be reveal to me to morrow and for all time i look at him he wa speak with great emot and gaze mysteri at me as if he were question me and that we ar all respons to all for all apart from our own sin you were quit right in think that and it is wonder how you could comprehend it in all it signific at onc and in veri truth so soon as men understand that the kingdom of heaven will be for them not a dream but a live realiti and when i cri out to him bitterli when will that come to pass and will it ever come to pass is not it simpli a dream of our what then you don t believ it he said you preach it and don t believ it yourself believ me thi dream as you call it will come to pass without doubt it will come but not now for everi process ha it law it s a spiritu psycholog process to transform the world to recreat it afresh men must turn into anoth path psycholog until you have becom realli in actual fact a brother to everi on brotherhood will not come to pass no sort of scientif teach no kind of common interest will ever teach men to share properti and privileg with equal consider for all everi on will think hi share too small and thei will be alwai envi complain and attack on anoth you ask when it will come to pass it will come to pass but first we have to go through the period of isol what do you mean by isol i ask him why the isol that prevail everywher abov all in our ag it ha not fulli develop it ha not reach it limit yet for everi on strive to keep hi individu as apart as possibl wish to secur the greatest possibl full of life for himself but meantim all hi effort result not in attain full of life but self destruct for instead of self realiz he end by arriv at complet solitud all mankind in our ag have split up into unit thei all keep apart each in hi own groov each on hold aloof hide himself and hide what he ha from the rest and he end by be repel by other and repel them he heap up rich by himself and think how strong i am now and how secur and in hi mad he doe not understand that the more he heap up the more he sink into self destruct impot for he is accustom to reli upon himself alon and to cut himself off from the whole he ha train himself not to believ in the help of other in men and in human and onli trembl for fear he should lose hi monei and the privileg that he ha won for himself everywher in these dai men have in their mockeri ceas to understand that the true secur is to be found in social solidar rather than in isol individu effort but thi terribl individu must inevit have an end and all will suddenli understand how unnatur thei ar separ from on anoth it will be the spirit of the time and peopl will marvel that thei have sat so long in dark without see the light and then the sign of the son of man will be seen in the heaven but until then we must keep the banner fly sometim even if he ha to do it alon and hi conduct seem to be crazi a man must set an exampl and so draw men s soul out of their solitud and spur them to some act of brotherli love that the great idea mai not die our even on after anoth were spent in such stir and fervent talk i gave up societi and visit my neighbor much less frequent besid my vogu wa somewhat over i sai thi not as blame for thei still love me and treat me good humoredli but there s no deni that fashion is a great power in societi i began to regard my mysteri visitor with admir for besid enjoi hi intellig i began to perceiv that he wa brood over some plan in hi heart and wa prepar himself perhap for a great deed perhap he like my not show curios about hi secret not seek to discov it by direct question nor by insinu but i notic at last that he seem to show sign of want to tell me someth thi had becom quit evid inde about a month after he first began to visit me do you know he said to me onc that peopl ar veri inquisit about us in the town and wonder why i come to see you so often but let them wonder for soon all will be explain sometim an extraordinari agit would come over him and almost alwai on such occas he would get up and go awai sometim he would fix a long pierc look upon me and i thought he will sai someth directli now but he would suddenli begin talk of someth ordinari and familiar he often complain of headach too on dai quit unexpectedli inde after he had been talk with great fervor a long time i saw him suddenli turn pale and hi face work convuls while he stare persist at me what s the matter i said do you feel ill he had just been complain of headach i do you know i murder some on he said thi and smile with a face as white as chalk why is it he is smile the thought flash through my mind befor i realiz anyth els i too turn pale what ar you sai i cri you see he said with a pale smile how much it ha cost me to sai the first word now i have said it i feel i ve taken the first step and shall go on for a long while i could not believ him and i did not believ him at that time but onli after he had been to see me three dai run and told me all about it i thought he wa mad but end by be convinc to my great grief and amaz hi crime wa a great and terribl on fourteen year befor he had murder the widow of a landown a wealthi and handsom young woman who had a hous in our town he fell passion in love with her declar hi feel and tri to persuad her to marri him but she had alreadi given her heart to anoth man an offic of nobl birth and high rank in the servic who wa at that time awai at the front though she wa expect him soon to return she refus hi offer and beg him not to come and see her after he had ceas to visit her he took advantag of hi knowledg of the hous to enter at night through the garden by the roof at great risk of discoveri but as often happen a crime commit with extraordinari audac is more success than other enter the garret through the skylight he went down the ladder know that the door at the bottom of it wa sometim through the neglig of the servant left unlock he hope to find it so and so it wa he made hi wai in the dark to her bedroom where a light wa burn as though on purpos both her maid had gone off to a birthdai parti in the same street without ask leav the other servant slept in the servant quarter or in the kitchen on the ground floor hi passion flame up at the sight of her asleep and then vindict jealou anger took possess of hi heart and like a drunken man besid himself he thrust a knife into her heart so that she did not even cry out then with devilish and crimin cun he contriv that suspicion should fall on the servant he wa so base as to take her purs to open her chest with kei from under her pillow and to take some thing from it do it all as it might have been done by an ignor servant leav valuabl paper and take onli monei he took some of the larger gold thing but left smaller articl that were ten time as valuabl he took with him too some thing for himself as remembr but of that later have done thi aw deed he return by the wai he had come neither the next dai when the alarm wa rais nor at ani time after in hi life did ani on dream of suspect that he wa the crimin no on inde knew of hi love for her for he wa alwai reserv and silent and had no friend to whom he would have open hi heart he wa look upon simpli as an acquaint and not a veri intim on of the murder woman as for the previou fortnight he had not even visit her a serf of her call pyotr wa at onc suspect and everi circumst confirm the suspicion the man knew inde hi mistress did not conceal the fact that have to send on of her serf as a recruit she had decid to send him as he had no relat and hi conduct wa unsatisfactori peopl had heard him angrili threaten to murder her when he wa drunk in a tavern two dai befor her death he had run awai stai no on knew where in the town the dai after the murder he wa found on the road lead out of the town dead drunk with a knife in hi pocket and hi right hand happen to be stain with blood he declar that hi nose had been bleed but no

servant thei arrest him and he wa tri for the murder but a week after the arrest the prison fell sick of a fever and di unconsci in the hospit there the matter end and the judg and the author and everi on in the town remain convinc that the crime had been commit by no on but the servant who had di in the hospit and after that the punish began my mysteri visitor now my friend told me that at first he wa not in the least troubl by pang of conscienc he wa miser a long time but not for that reason onli from regret that he had kill the woman he love that she wa no more that in kill her he had kill hi love while the fire of passion wa still in hi vein but of the innoc blood he had shed of the murder of a fellow creatur he scarc thought the thought that hi victim might have becom the wife of anoth man wa insupport to him and so for a long time he wa convinc in hi conscienc that he could not have act otherwis at first he wa worri at the arrest of the servant but hi ill and death soon set hi mind at rest for the man s death wa appar so he reflect at the time not ow to hi arrest or hi fright but a chill he had taken on the dai he ran awai when he had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground the theft of the monei and other thing troubl him littl for he argu that the theft had not been commit for gain but to avert suspicion the sum stolen wa small and he shortli afterward subscrib the whole of it and much more toward the fund for maintain an almshous in the town he did thi on purpos to set hi conscienc at rest about the theft and it s a remark fact that for a long time he realli wa at peac he told me thi himself he enter then upon a career of great activ in the servic volunt for a difficult and labori duti which occupi him two year and be a man of strong will almost

me with great interest and eager for man love to see the downfal and disgrac of the righteou but i held my tongu and veri shortli after i left the town and five month later by god s grace i enter upon the safe and bless path prais the unseen finger which had guid me so clearli to it but i rememb in my prayer to thi dai the servant of god mihail who suffer so greatli chapter iii convers and exhort of father zossima e the russian monk and hi possibl signific father and teacher what is the monk in the cultiv world the word is nowadai pronounc by some peopl with a jeer and by other it is us as a term of abus and thi contempt for the monk is grow it is true ala it is true that there ar mani sluggard glutton proflig and insol beggar among monk educ peopl point to these you ar idler useless member of societi you live on the labor of other you ar shameless beggar and yet how mani meek and humbl monk there ar yearn for solitud and fervent prayer in peac these ar less notic or pass over in silenc and how surpris men would be if i were to sai that from these meek monk who yearn for solitari prayer the salvat of russia will come perhap onc more for thei ar in truth made readi in peac and quiet for the dai and the hour the month and the year meanwhil in their solitud thei keep the imag of christ fair and undefil in the puriti of god s truth from the time of the father of old the apostl and the martyr and when the time come thei will show it to the totter creed of the world that is a great thought that star will rise out of the east that is my view of the monk and is it fals is it too proud look at the worldli and all who set themselv up abov the peopl of god ha not god s imag and hi truth been distort in them thei have scienc but in scienc there is noth but what is the object of sens the spiritu world the higher part of man s be is reject altogeth dismiss with a sort of triumph even with hatr the world ha proclaim the reign of freedom especi of late but what do we see in thi freedom of their noth but slaveri and self destruct for the world sai you have desir and so satisfi them for you have the same right as the most rich and power don t be afraid of satisfi them and even multipli your desir that is the modern doctrin of the world in that thei see freedom and what follow from thi right of multipl of desir in the rich isol and spiritu suicid in the poor envi and murder for thei have been given right but have not been shown the mean of satisfi their want thei maintain that the world is get more and more unit more and more bound togeth in brotherli commun as it overcom distanc and set thought fly through the air ala put no faith in such a bond of union interpret freedom as the multipl and rapid satisfact of desir men distort their own natur for mani senseless and foolish desir and habit and ridicul fanci ar foster in them thei live onli for mutual envi for luxuri and ostent to have dinner visit carriag rank and slave to wait on on is look upon as a necess for which life honor and human feel ar sacrif and men even commit suicid if thei ar unabl to satisfi it we see the same thing among those who ar not rich while the poor drown their unsatisfi need and their envi in drunken but soon thei will drink blood instead of wine thei ar be led on to it i ask you is such a man free i knew on champion of freedom who told me himself that when he wa depriv of tobacco in prison he wa so wretch at the privat that he almost went and betrai hi caus for the sake of get tobacco again and such a man sai i am fight for the caus of human how can such a on fight what is he fit for he is capabl perhap of some action quickli over but he cannot hold out long and it s no wonder that instead of gain freedom thei have sunk into slaveri and instead of serv the caus of brotherli love and the union of human have fallen on the contrari into dissens and isol as my mysteri visitor and teacher said to me in my youth and therefor the idea of the servic of human of brotherli love and the solidar of mankind is more and more dy out in the world and inde thi idea is sometim treat with deris for how can a man shake off hi habit what can becom of him if he is in such bondag to the habit of satisfi the innumer desir he ha creat for himself he is isol and what concern ha he with the rest of human thei have succeed in accumul a greater mass of object but the joi in the world ha grown less the monast wai is veri differ obedi fast and prayer ar laugh at yet onli through them li the wai to real true freedom i cut off my superflu and unnecessari desir i subdu my proud and wanton will and chastis it with obedi and with god s help i attain freedom of spirit and with it spiritu joi which is most capabl of conceiv a great idea and serv it the rich man in hi isol or the man who ha freed himself from the tyranni of materi thing and habit the monk is reproach for hi solitud you have seclud yourself within the wall of the monasteri for your own salvat and have forgotten the brotherli servic of human but we shall see which will be most zealou in the caus of brotherli love for it is not we but thei who ar in isol though thei don t see that of old leader of the peopl came from among us and why should thei not again the same meek and humbl ascet will rise up and go out to work for the great caus the salvat of russia come from the peopl and the russian monk ha alwai been on the side of the peopl we ar isol onli if the peopl ar isol the peopl believ as we do and an unbeliev reform will never do anyth in russia even if he is sincer in heart and a geniu rememb that the peopl will meet the atheist and overcom him and russia will be on and orthodox take care of the peasant and guard hi heart go on educ him quietli that s your duti as monk for the peasant ha god in hi heart f of master and servant and of whether it is possibl for them to be brother in the spirit of cours i don t deni that there is sin in the peasant too and the fire of corrupt is spread visibl hourli work from abov downward the spirit of isol is come upon the peopl too monei lender and devour of the commun ar rise up alreadi the merchant grow more and more eager for rank and strive to show himself cultur though he ha not a trace of cultur and to thi end meanli despis hi old tradit and is even asham of the faith of hi father he visit princ though he is onli a peasant corrupt the peasant ar rot in drunken and cannot shake off the habit and what cruelti to their wive to their children even all from drunken i ve seen in the factori children of nine year old frail ricketi bent and alreadi deprav the stuffi workshop the din of machineri work all dai long the vile languag and the drink the drink is that what a littl child s heart need he need sunshin childish plai good exampl all about him and at least a littl love there must be no more of thi monk no more tortur of children rise up and preach that make hast make hast but god will save russia for though the peasant ar corrupt and cannot renounc their filthi sin yet thei know it is curs by god and that thei do wrong in sin so that our peopl still believ in righteous have faith in god and weep tear of devot it is differ with the upper class thei follow scienc want to base justic on reason alon but not with christ as befor and thei have alreadi proclaim that there is no crime that there is no sin and that s consist for if you have no god what is the mean of crime in europ the peopl ar alreadi rise up against the rich with violenc and the leader of the peopl ar everywher lead them to bloodsh and teach them that their wrath is righteou but their wrath is accurs for it is cruel but god will save russia as he ha save her mani time salvat will come from the peopl from their faith and their meek father and teacher watch over the peopl s faith and thi will not be a dream i ve been struck all my life in our great peopl by their digniti their true and seemli digniti i ve seen it myself i can testifi to it i ve seen it and marvel at it i ve seen it in spite of the degrad sin and poverti stricken appear of our peasantri thei ar not servil and even after two centuri of serfdom thei ar free in manner and bear yet without insol and not reveng and not enviou you ar rich and nobl you ar clever and talent well be so god bless you i respect you but i know that i too am a man by the veri fact that i respect you without envi i prove my digniti as a man in truth if thei don t sai thi for thei don t know how to sai thi yet that is how thei act i have seen it myself i have known it myself and would you believ it the poorer our russian peasant is the more notic is that seren good for the rich among them ar for the most part corrupt alreadi and much of that is due to our careless and indiffer but god will save hi peopl for russia is great in her humil i dream of see and seem to see clearli alreadi our futur it will come to pass that even the most corrupt of our rich will end by be asham of hi rich befor the poor and the poor see hi humil will understand and give wai befor him will respond joyfulli and kindli to hi honor shame believ me that it will end in that thing ar move to that equal is to be found onli in the spiritu digniti of man and that will onli be understood among us if we were brother there would be fratern but befor that thei will never agre about the divis of wealth we preserv the imag of christ and it will shine forth like a preciou diamond to the whole world so mai it be so mai it be father and teacher a touch incid befel me onc in my wander i met in the town of k my old orderli afanasi it wa eight year sinc i had part from him he chanc to see me in the market place recogn me ran up to me and how delight he wa he simpli pounc on me master dear is it you is it realli you i see he took me home with him he wa no longer in the armi he wa marri and alreadi had two littl children he and hi wife earn their live as costermong in the market place hi room wa poor but bright and clean he made me sit down set the samovar sent for hi wife as though my appear were a festiv for them he brought me hi children bless them father is it for me to bless them i am onli a humbl monk i will prai for them and for you afanasi pavlovitch i have prai everi dai sinc that dai for it all came from you said i and i explain that to him as well as i could and what do you think the man kept gaze at me and could not believ that i hi former master an offic wa now befor him in such a guis and posit it made him shed tear why ar you weep said i better rejoic over me dear friend whom i can never forget for my path is a glad and joy on he did not sai much but kept sigh and shake hi head over me tenderli what ha becam of your fortun he ask i gave it to the monasteri i answer we live in common after tea i began sai good by and suddenli he brought out half a roubl as an offer to the monasteri and anoth half roubl i saw him thrust hurriedli into my hand that s for you in your wander it mai be of us to you father i took hi half roubl bow to him and hi wife and went out rejoic and on my wai i thought here we ar both now he at home and i on the road sigh and shake our head no doubt and yet smile joyfulli in the glad of our heart rememb how god brought about our meet i have never seen him again sinc then i had been hi master and he my servant but now when we exchang a love kiss with soften heart there wa a great human bond between us i have thought a great deal about that and now what i think is thi is it so inconceiv that that grand and simpl heart uniti might in due time becom univers among the russian peopl i believ that it will come to pass and that the time is at hand and of servant i will add thi in old dai when i wa young i wa often angri with servant the cook had serv someth too hot the orderli had not brush my cloth but what taught me better then wa a thought of my dear brother s which i had heard from him in childhood am i worth it that anoth should serv me and be order about by me in hi poverti and ignor and i wonder at the time that such simpl and self evid idea should be so slow to occur to our mind it is imposs that there should be no servant in the world but act so that your servant mai be freer in spirit than if he were not a servant and why cannot i be a servant to my servant and even let him see it and that without ani pride on my part or ani mistrust on hi why should not my servant be like my own kindr so that i mai take him into my famili and rejoic in do so even now thi can be done but it will lead to the grand uniti of men in the futur when a man will not seek servant for himself or desir to turn hi fellow creatur into servant as he doe now but on the contrari will long with hi whole heart to be the servant of all as the gospel teach and can it be a dream that in the end man will find hi joi onli in deed of light and merci and not in cruel pleasur as now in gluttoni fornic ostent boast and enviou rivalri of on with the other i firmli believ that it is not and that the time is at hand peopl laugh and ask when will that time come and doe it look like come i believ that with christ s help we shall accomplish thi great thing and how mani idea there have been on earth in the histori of man which were unthink ten year befor thei appear yet when their destin hour had come thei came forth and spread over the whole earth so it will be with us and our peopl will shine forth in the world and all men will sai the stone which the builder reject ha becom the corner stone of the build and we mai ask the scorn themselv if our hope is a dream when will you build up your edific and order thing justli by your intellect alon without christ if thei declar that it is thei who ar advanc toward uniti onli the most simpl heart among them believ it so that on mai posit marvel at such simplic of a truth thei have more fantast dream than we thei aim at justic but deni christ thei will end by flood the earth with blood for blood cri out for blood and he that taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword and if it were not for christ s coven thei would slaughter on anoth down to the last two men on earth and those two last men would not be abl to restrain each other in their pride and the on would slai the other and then himself and that would come to pass were it not for the promis of christ that for the sake of the humbl and meek the dai shall be shorten while i wa still wear an offic s uniform after my duel i talk about servant in gener societi and i rememb everi on wa amaz at me what thei ask ar we to make our servant sit down on the sofa and offer them tea and i answer them why not sometim at least everi on laugh their question wa frivol and my answer wa not clear but the thought in it wa to some extent right g of prayer of love and of contact with other world young man be not forget of prayer everi time you prai if your prayer is sincer there will be new feel and new mean in it which will give you fresh courag and you will understand that prayer is an educ rememb too everi dai and whenev you can repeat to yourself lord have merci on all who appear befor thee to dai for everi hour and everi moment thousand of men leav life on thi earth and their soul appear befor god and how mani of them depart in solitud unknown sad deject that no on mourn for them or even know whether thei have live or not and behold from the other end of the earth perhap your prayer for their rest will rise up to god though you knew them not nor thei you how touch it must be to a soul stand in dread befor the lord to feel at that instant that for him too there is on to prai that there is a fellow creatur left on earth to love him too and god will look on you both more gracious for if you have had so much piti on him how much will he have piti who is infinit more love and merci than you and he will forgiv him for your sake brother have no fear of men s sin love a man even in hi sin for that is the semblanc of divin love and is the highest love on earth love all god s creation the whole and everi grain of sand in it love everi leaf everi rai of god s light love the anim love the plant love everyth if you love everyth you will perceiv the divin mysteri in thing onc you perceiv it you will begin to comprehend it better everi dai and you will come at last to love the whole world with an all embrac love love the anim god ha given them the rudiment of thought and joi untroubl do not troubl it don t harass them don t depriv them of their happi don t work against god s intent man do not pride yourself on superior to the anim thei ar without sin and you with your great defil the earth by your appear on it and leav the trace of your foul after you ala it is true of almost everi on of us love children especi for thei too ar sinless like the angel thei live to soften and purifi our heart and as it were to guid us woe to him who offend a child father anfim taught me to love children the kind silent man us often on our wander to spend the farth given us on sweet and cake for the children he could not pass by a child without emot that s the natur of the man at some thought on stand perplex especi at the sight of men s sin and wonder whether on should us forc or humbl love alwai decid to us humbl love if you resolv on that onc for all you mai subdu the whole world love humil is marvel strong the strongest of all thing and there is noth els like it everi dai and everi hour everi minut walk round yourself and watch yourself and see that your imag is a seemli on you pass by a littl child you pass by spite with ugli word with wrath heart you mai not have notic the child but he ha seen you and your imag unseemli and ignobl mai remain in hi defenseless heart you don t know it but you mai have sown an evil seed in him and it mai grow and all becaus you were not care befor the child becaus you did not foster in yourself a care activ benevol love brother love is a teacher but on must know how to acquir it for it is hard to acquir it is dearli bought it is won slowli by long labor for we must love not onli occasion for a moment but for ever everi on can love occasion even the wick can my brother ask the bird to forgiv him that sound senseless but it is right for all is like an ocean all is flow and blend a touch in on place set up movement at the other end of the earth it mai be senseless to beg forgiv of the bird but bird would be happier at your side a littl happier anywai and children and all anim if you were nobler than you ar now it s all like an ocean i tell you then you would prai to the bird too consum by an all embrac love in a sort of transport and prai that thei too will forgiv you your sin treasur thi ecstasi howev senseless it mai seem to men my friend prai to god for glad be glad as children as the bird of heaven and let not the sin of men confound you in your do fear not that it will wear awai your work and hinder it be accomplish do not sai sin is mighti wicked is mighti evil environ is mighti and we ar lone and helpless and evil environ is wear us awai and hinder our good work from be done fly from that deject children there is onli on mean of salvat then take yourself and make yourself respons for all men s sin that is the truth you know friend for as soon as you sincer make yourself respons for everyth and for all men you will see at onc that it is realli so and that you ar to blame for everi on and for all thing but throw your own indol and impot on other you will end by share the pride of satan and murmur against god of the pride of satan what i think is thi it is hard for us on earth to comprehend it and therefor it is so easi to fall into error and to share it even imagin that we ar do someth grand and fine inde mani of the strongest feel and movement of our natur we cannot comprehend on earth let not that be a stumbl block and think not that it mai serv as a justif to you for anyth for the etern judg ask of you what you can comprehend and not what you cannot you will know that yourself hereaft for you will behold all thing truli then and will not disput them on earth inde we ar as it were astrai and if it were not for the preciou imag of christ befor us we should be undon and altogeth lost as wa the human race befor the flood much on earth is hidden from us but to make up for that we have been given a preciou mystic sens of our live bond with the other world with the higher heavenli world and the root of our thought and feel ar not here but in other world that is why the philosoph sai that we cannot apprehend the realiti of thing on earth god took seed from differ world and sow them on thi earth and hi garden grew up and everyth came up that could come up but what grow live and is aliv onli through the feel of it contact with other mysteri world if that feel grow weak or is destroi in you the heavenli growth will die awai in you then you will be indiffer to life and even grow to hate it that s what i think h can a man judg hi fellow creatur faith to the end rememb particularli that you cannot be a judg of ani on for no on can judg a crimin until he recogn that he is just such a crimin as the man stand befor him and that he perhap is more than all men to blame for that crime when he understand that he will be abl to be a judg though that sound absurd it is true if i had been righteou myself perhap there would have been no crimin stand befor me if you can take upon yourself the crime of the crimin your heart is judg take it at onc suffer for him yourself and let him go without reproach and even if the law itself make you hi judg act in the same spirit so far as possibl for he will go awai and condemn himself more bitterli than you have done if after your kiss he goe awai untouch mock at you do not let that be a stumbl block to you it show hi time ha not yet come but it will come in due cours and if it come not no matter if not he then anoth in hi place will understand and suffer and judg and condemn himself and the truth will be fulfil believ that believ it without doubt for in that li all the hope and faith of the saint work without ceas if you rememb in the night as you go to sleep i have not done what i ought to have done rise up at onc and do it if the peopl around you ar spite and callou and will not hear you fall down befor them and beg their forgiv for in truth you ar to blame for their not want to hear you and if you cannot speak to them in their bitter serv them in silenc and in humil never lose hope if all men abandon you and even drive you awai by forc then when you ar left alon fall on the earth and kiss it water it with your tear and it will bring forth fruit even though no on ha seen or heard you in your solitud believ to the end even if all men went astrai and you were left the onli on faith bring your offer even then and prais god in your loneli and if two of you ar gather togeth then there is a whole world a world of live love embrac each other tenderli and prais god for if onli in you two hi truth ha been fulfil if you sin yourself and griev even unto death for your sin or for your sudden sin then rejoic for other rejoic for the righteou man rejoic that if you have sin he is righteou and ha not sin if the evil do of men move you to indign and overwhelm distress even to a desir for vengeanc on the evil doer shun abov all thing that feel go at onc and seek suffer for yourself as though you were yourself guilti of that wrong accept that suffer and bear it and your heart will find comfort and you will understand that you too ar guilti for you might have been a light to the evil doer even as the on man sinless and you were not a light to them if you had been a light you would have lighten the path for other too and the evil doer might perhap have been save by your light from hi sin and even though your light wa shine yet you see men were not save by it hold firm and doubt not the power of the heavenli light believ that if thei were not save thei will be save hereaft and if thei ar not save hereaft then their son will be save for your light will not die even when you ar dead the righteou man depart but hi light remain men ar alwai save after the death of the deliver men reject their prophet and slai them but thei love their martyr and honor those whom thei have slain you ar work for the whole you ar act for the futur seek no reward for great is your reward on thi earth the spiritu joi which is onli vouchsaf to the righteou man fear not the great nor the mighti but be wise and ever seren know the measur know the time studi that when you ar left alon prai love to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it kiss the earth and love it with an unceas consum love love all men love everyth seek that raptur and ecstasi water the earth with the tear of your joi and love those tear don t be asham of that ecstasi prize it for it is a gift of god and a great on it is not given to mani but onli to the elect i of hell and hell fire a mystic reflect father and teacher i ponder what is hell i maintain that it is the suffer of be unabl to love onc in infinit exist immeasur in time and space a spiritu creatur wa given on hi come to earth the power of sai i am and i love onc onli onc there wa given him a moment of activ live love and for that wa earthli life given him and with it time and season and that happi creatur reject the priceless gift prize it and love it not scorn it and remain callou such a on have left the earth see abraham s bosom and talk with abraham as we ar told in the parabl of the rich man and lazaru and behold heaven and can go up to the lord but that is just hi torment to rise up to the lord without ever have love to be brought close to those who have love when he ha despis their love for he see clearli and sai to himself now i have understand and though i now thirst to love there will be noth great no sacrific in my love for my earthli life is over and abraham will not come even with a drop of live water that is the gift of earthli activ life to cool the fieri thirst of spiritu love which burn in me now though i despis it on earth there is no more life for me and will be no more time even though i would gladli give my life for other it can never be for that life is pass which can be sacrif for love and now there is a gulf fix between that life and thi exist thei talk of hell fire in the materi sens i don t go into that mysteri and i shun it but i think if there were fire in materi sens thei would be glad of it for i imagin that in materi agoni their still greater spiritu agoni would be forgotten for a moment moreov that spiritu agoni cannot be taken from them for that suffer is not extern but within them and if it could be taken from them i think it would be bitter still for the unhappi creatur for even if the righteou in paradis forgav them behold their torment and call them up to heaven in their infinit love thei would onli multipli their torment for thei would arous in them still more keenli a flame thirst for respons activ and grate love which is now imposs in the timid of my heart i imagin howev that the veri recognit of thi imposs would serv at last to consol them for accept the love of the righteou togeth with the imposs of repai it by thi submiss and the effect of thi humil thei will attain at last as it were to a certain semblanc of that activ love which thei scorn in life to someth like it outward express i am sorri friend and brother that i cannot express thi clearli but woe to those who have slain themselv on earth woe to the suicid i believ that there can be none more miser then thei thei tell us that it is a sin to prai for them and outwardli the church as it were renounc them but in my secret heart i believ that we mai prai even for them love can never be an offens to christ for such as those i have prai inwardli all my life i confess it father and teacher and even now i prai for them everi dai oh there ar some who remain proud and fierc even in hell in spite of their certain knowledg and contempl of the absolut truth there ar some fear on who have given themselv over to satan and hi proud spirit entir for such hell is voluntari and ever consum thei ar tortur by their own choic for thei have curs themselv curs god and life thei live upon their vindict pride like a starv man in the desert suck blood out of hi own bodi but thei ar never satisfi and thei refus forgiv thei curs god who call them thei cannot behold the live god without hatr and thei cry out that the god of life should be annihil that god should destroi himself and hi own creation and thei will burn in the fire of their own wrath for ever and yearn for death and annihil but thei will not attain to death here alexei fyodorovitch karamazov s manuscript end i repeat it is incomplet and fragmentari biograph detail for instanc cover onli father zossima s earliest youth of hi teach and opinion we find brought togeth sai evid utter on veri differ occas hi utter dure the last few hour have not been kept separ from the rest but their gener charact can be gather from what we have in alexei fyodorovitch s manuscript the elder s death came in the end quit unexpectedli for although those who were gather about him that last even realiz that hi death wa approach yet it wa difficult to imagin that it would come so suddenli on the contrari hi friend as i observ alreadi see him that night appar so cheer and talk were convinc that there wa at least a temporari chang for the better in hi condit even five minut befor hi death thei said afterward wonderingli it wa imposs to forese it he seem suddenli to feel an acut pain in hi chest he turn pale and press hi hand to hi heart all rose from their seat and hasten to him but though suffer he still look at them with a smile sank slowli from hi chair on to hi knee then bow hi face to the ground stretch out hi arm and as though in joy ecstasi prai and kiss the ground quietli and joyfulli gave up hi soul to god the new of hi death spread at onc through the hermitag and reach the monasteri the nearest friend of the deceas and those whose duti it wa from their posit began to lai out the corps accord to the ancient ritual and all the monk gather togeth in the church and befor dawn the new of the death reach the town by the morn all the town wa talk of the event and crowd were flock from the town to the monasteri but thi subject will be treat in the next book i will onli add here that befor a dai had pass someth happen so unexpect so strang upset and bewild in it effect on the monk and the townspeopl that after all these year that dai of gener suspens is still vividli rememb in the town part iii book vii alyosha chapter i the breath of corrupt the bodi of father zossima wa prepar for burial accord to the establish ritual as is well known the bodi of dead monk and hermit ar not wash in the word of the church ritual if ani on of the monk depart in the lord the monk design that is whose offic it is shall wipe the bodi with warm water make first the sign of the cross with a spong on the forehead of the deceas on the breast on the hand and feet and on the knee and that is enough all thi wa done by father pa ssy who then cloth the deceas in hi monast garb and wrap him in hi cloak which wa accord to custom somewhat slit to allow of it be fold about him in the form of a cross on hi head he put a hood with an eight corner cross the hood wa left open and the dead man s face wa cover with black gauz in hi hand wa put an ikon of the saviour toward morn he wa put in the coffin which had been made readi long befor it wa decid to leav the coffin all dai in the cell in the larger room in which the elder us to receiv hi visitor and fellow monk as the deceas wa a priest and monk of the strictest rule the gospel not the psalter had to be read over hi bodi by monk in holi order the read wa begun by father iosif immedi after the

class thi intens expect on the part of believ displai with such hast such open even with impati and almost insist impress father pa ssy as unseemli though he had long foreseen someth of the sort the actual manifest of the feel wa beyond anyth he had look for when he came across ani of the monk who displai thi excit father pa ssy began to reprov them such immedi expect of someth extraordinari he said show a leviti possibl to worldli peopl but unseemli in us but littl attent wa paid him and father pa ssy notic it uneasili yet he himself if the whole truth must be told secretli at the bottom of hi heart cherish almost the same hope and could not but be awar of it though he wa indign at the too impati expect around him and saw in it light minded and vaniti nevertheless it wa particularli unpleas to him to meet certain person whose presenc arous in him great misgiv in the crowd in the dead man s cell he notic with inward avers for which he immedi reproach himself the presenc of rakitin and of the monk from obdorsk who wa still stai in the monasteri of both of them father pa ssy felt for some reason suddenli suspici though inde he might well have felt the same about other the monk from obdorsk wa conspicu as the most fussi in the excit crowd he wa to be seen everywher everywher he wa ask question everywher he wa listen on all side he wa whisper with a peculiar mysteri air hi express show the greatest impati and even a sort of irrit as for rakitin he as appear later had come so earli to the hermitag at the special request of madam hohlakov as soon as that good heart but weak mind woman who could not herself have been admit to the hermitag wake and heard of the death of father zossima she wa overtaken with such intens curios that she promptli dispatch rakitin to the hermitag to keep a care look out and report to her by letter everi half hour or so everyth that take place she regard rakitin as a most religi and devout young man he wa particularli clever in get round peopl and assum whatev part he thought most to their tast if he detect the slightest advantag to himself from do so it wa a bright clear dai and mani of the visitor were throng about the tomb which were particularli numer round the church and scatter here and there about the hermitag as he walk round the hermitag father pa ssy rememb alyosha and that he had not seen him for some time not sinc the night and he had no sooner thought of him than he at onc notic him in the farthest corner of the hermitag garden sit on the tombston of a monk who had been famou long ago for hi saintli he sat with hi back to the hermitag and hi face to the wall and seem to be hide behind the tombston go up to him father pa ssy saw that he wa weep quietli but bitterli with hi face hidden in hi hand and that hi whole frame wa shake with sob father pa ssy stood over him for a littl enough dear son enough dear he pronounc with feel at last why do you weep rejoic and weep not don t you know that thi is the greatest of hi dai think onli where he is now at thi moment alyosha glanc at him uncov hi face which wa swollen with cry like a child s but turn awai at onc without utter a word and hid hi face in hi hand again mayb it is well said father pa ssy thoughtfulli weep if you must christ ha sent you those tear your touch tear ar but a relief to your spirit and will serv to gladden your dear heart he ad to himself walk awai from alyosha and think lovingli of him he move awai quickli howev for he felt that he too might weep look at him meanwhil the time wa pass the monasteri servic and the requiem for the dead follow in their due cours father pa ssy again took father iosif s place by the coffin and began read the gospel but befor three o clock in the afternoon that someth took place to which i allud at the end of the last book someth so unexpect by all of us and so contrari to the gener hope that i repeat thi trivial incid ha been minut rememb to thi dai in our town and all the surround neighborhood i mai add here for myself person that i feel it almost repuls to recal that event which caus such frivol agit and wa such a stumbl block to mani though in realiti it wa the most natur and trivial matter i should of cours have omit all mention of it in my stori if it had not exert a veri strong influenc on the heart and soul of the chief though futur hero of my stori alyosha form a crisi and turn point in hi spiritu develop give a shock to hi intellect which final strengthen it for the rest of hi life and gave it a definit aim and so to return to our stori when befor dawn thei laid father zossima s bodi in the coffin and brought it into the front room the question of open the window wa rais among those who were around the coffin but thi suggest made casual by some on wa unansw and almost unnot some of those present mai perhap have inwardli notic it onli to reflect that the anticip of decai and corrupt from the bodi of such a saint wa an actual absurd call for compass if not a smile for the lack of faith and the frivol it impli for thei expect someth quit differ and behold soon after middai there were sign of someth at first onli observ in silenc by those who came in and out and were evid each afraid to commun the thought in hi mind but by three o clock those sign had becom so clear and unmistak that the new swiftli reach all the monk and visitor in the hermitag promptli penetr to the monasteri throw all the monk into amaz and final in the shortest possibl time spread to the town excit everi on in it believ and unbeliev alik the unbeliev rejoic and as for the believ some of them rejoic even more than the unbeliev for men love the downfal and disgrac of the righteou as the deceas elder had said in on of hi exhort the fact is that a smell of decomposit began to come from the coffin grow gradual more mark and by three o clock it wa quit unmistak in all the past histori of our monasteri no such scandal could be recal and in no other circumst could such a scandal have been possibl as show itself in unseemli disord immedi after thi discoveri among the veri monk themselv afterward even mani year afterward some sensibl monk were amaz and horrifi when thei recal that dai that the scandal could have reach such proport for in the past monk of veri holi life had di god fear old men whose saintli wa acknowledg by all yet from their humbl coffin too the breath of corrupt had come natur as from all dead bodi but that had caus no scandal nor even the slightest excit of cours there had been in former time saint in the monasteri whose memori wa carefulli preserv and whose relic accord to tradit show no sign of corrupt thi fact wa regard by the monk as touch and mysteri and the tradit of it wa cherish as someth bless and miracul and as a promis by god s grace of still greater glori from their tomb in the futur on such whose memori wa particularli cherish wa an old monk job who had di seventi year befor at the ag of a hundr and five he had been a celebr ascet rigid in fast and silenc and hi tomb wa point out to all visitor on their arriv with peculiar respect and mysteri hint of great hope connect with it that wa the veri tomb on which father pa ssy had found alyosha sit in the morn anoth memori cherish in the monasteri wa that of the famou father varsonofi who wa onli recent dead and had preced father zossima in the eldership he wa reverenc dure hi lifetim as a crazi saint by all the pilgrim to the monasteri there wa a tradit that both of these had lain in their coffin as though aliv that thei had shown no sign of decomposit when thei were buri and that there had been a holi light in their face and some peopl even insist that a sweet fragranc came from their bodi yet in spite of these edifi memori it would be difficult to explain the frivol absurd and malic that were manifest besid the coffin of father zossima it is my privat opinion that sever differ caus were simultan at work on of which wa the deepli root hostil to the institut of elder as a pernici innov an antipathi hidden deep in the heart of mani of the monk even more power wa jealousi of the dead man s saintli so firmli establish dure hi lifetim that it wa almost a forbidden thing to question it for though the late elder had won over mani heart more by love than by miracl and had gather round him a mass of love adher none the less in fact rather the more on that account he had awaken jealousi and so had come to have bitter enemi secret and open not onli in the monasteri but in the world outsid it he did no on ani harm but why do thei think him so saintli and that question alon gradual repeat gave rise at last to an intens insati hatr of him that i believ wa why mani peopl were extrem delight at the smell of decomposit which came so quickli for not a dai had pass sinc hi death at the same time there were some among those who had been hitherto rever devot to the elder who were almost mortifi and person affront by thi incid thi wa how the thing happen as soon as sign of decomposit had begun to appear the whole aspect of the monk betrai their secret motiv in enter the cell thei went in stai a littl while and hasten out to confirm the new to the crowd of other monk wait outsid some of the latter shook their head mournfulli but other did not even care to conceal the delight which gleam unmistak in their malign ey and now no on reproach them for it no on rais hi voic in protest which wa strang for the major of the monk had been devot to the dead elder but it seem as though god had in thi case let the minor get the upper hand for a time visitor from outsid particularli of the educ class soon went into the cell too with the same spy intent of the peasantri few went into the cell though there were crowd of them at the gate of the hermitag after three o clock the rush of worldli visitor wa greatli increas and thi wa no doubt ow to the shock new peopl were attract who would not otherwis have come on that dai and had not intend to come and among them were some personag of high stand but extern decorum wa still preserv and father pa ssy with a stern face continu firmli and distinctli read aloud the gospel appar not notic what wa take place around him though he had in fact observ someth unusu long befor but at last the murmur first subdu but gradual louder and more confid reach even him it show god s judgment is not as man s father pa ssy heard suddenli the first to give utter to thi sentiment wa a layman an elderli offici from the town known to be a man of great pieti but he onli repeat aloud what the monk had long been whisper thei had long befor formul thi damn conclus and the worst of it wa that a sort of triumphant satisfact at that conclus becam more and more appar everi moment soon thei began to lai asid even extern decorum and almost seem to feel thei had a sort of right to discard it and for what reason can thi have happen some of the monk said at first with a show of regret he had a small frame and hi flesh wa dri up on hi bone what wa there to decai it must be a sign from heaven other hasten to add and their opinion wa adopt at onc without protest for it wa point out too that if the decomposit had been natur as in the case of everi dead sinner it would have been appar later after a laps of at least twenti four hour but thi prematur corrupt wa in excess of natur and so the finger of god wa evid it wa meant for a sign thi conclus seem irresist gentl father iosif the librarian a great favorit of the dead man s tri to repli to some of the evil speaker that thi is not held everywher alik and that the incorrupt of the bodi of the just wa not a dogma of the orthodox church but onli an opinion and that even in the most orthodox region at atho for instanc thei were not greatli confound by the smell of corrupt and there the chief sign of the glorif of the save wa not bodili incorrupt but the color of the bone when the bodi have lain mani year in the earth and have decai in it and if the bone ar yellow as wax that is the great sign that the lord ha glorifi the dead saint if thei ar not yellow but black it show that god ha not deem him worthi of such glori that is the belief in atho a great place where the orthodox doctrin ha been preserv from of old unbroken and in it greatest puriti said father iosif in conclus but the meek father s word had littl effect and even provok a mock retort that s all pedantri and innov no us listen to it the monk decid we stick to the old doctrin there ar all sort of innov nowadai ar we to follow them all ad other we have had as mani holi father as thei had there thei ar among the turk thei have forgotten everyth their doctrin ha long been impur and thei have no bell even the most sneer ad father iosif walk awai griev the more sinc he had put forward hi own opinion with littl confid as though scarc believ in it himself he foresaw with distress that someth veri unseemli wa begin and that there were posit sign of disobedi littl by littl all the sensibl monk were reduc to silenc like father iosif and so it came to pass that all who love the elder and had accept with devout obedi the institut of the eldership were all at onc terribl cast down and glanc timidli in on anoth s face when thei met those who were hostil to the institut of elder as a novelti held up their head proudli there wa no smell of corrupt from the late elder varsonofi but a sweet fragranc thei recal malignantli but he gain that glori not becaus he wa an elder but becaus he wa a holi man and thi wa follow by a shower of critic and even blame of father zossima hi teach wa fals he taught that life is a great joi and not a vale of tear said some of the more unreason he follow the fashion belief he did not recogn materi fire in hell other still more unreason ad he wa not strict in fast allow himself sweet thing at cherri jam with hi tea ladi us to send it to him is it for a monk of strict rule to drink tea could be heard among some of the enviou he sat in pride the most malign declar vindict he consid himself a saint and he took it as hi due when peopl knelt befor him he abus the sacrament of confess the fiercest oppon of the institut of elder ad in a malici whisper and among these were some of the oldest monk strictest in their devot genuin ascet who had kept silent dure the life of the deceas elder but now suddenli unseal their lip and thi wa terribl for their word had great influenc on young monk who were not yet firm in their convict the monk from obdorsk heard all thi attent heav deep sigh and nod hi head ye clearli father ferapont wa right in hi judgment yesterdai and at that moment father ferapont himself made hi appear as though on purpos to increas the confus i have mention alreadi that he rare left hi wooden cell by the apiari he wa seldom even seen at church and thei overlook thi neglect on the ground of hi crazi and did not keep him to the rule bind on all the rest but if the whole truth is to be told thei hardli had a choic about it for it would have been discredit to insist on burden with the common regul so great an ascet who prai dai and night he even drop asleep on hi knee if thei had insist the monk would have said he is holier than all of us and he follow a rule harder than our and if he doe not go to church it s becaus he know when he ought to he ha hi own rule it wa to avoid the chanc of these sin murmur that father ferapont wa left in peac as everi on wa awar father ferapont particularli dislik father zossima and now the new had reach him in hi hut that god s judgment is not the same as man s and that someth had happen which wa in excess of natur it mai well be suppos that among the first to run to him with the new wa the monk from obdorsk who had visit him the even befor and left hi cell terror stricken i have mention abov that though father pa ssy stand firm and immov read the gospel over the coffin could not hear nor see what wa pass outsid the cell he gaug most of it correctli in hi heart for he knew the men surround him well he wa not shaken by it but await what would come next without fear watch with penetr and insight for the outcom of the gener excit suddenli an extraordinari uproar in the passag in open defianc of decorum burst on hi ear the door wa flung open and father ferapont appear in the doorwai behind him there could be seen accompani him a crowd of monk togeth with mani peopl from the town thei did not howev enter the cell but stood at the bottom of the step wait to see what father ferapont would sai or do for thei felt with a certain aw in spite of their audac that he had not come for noth stand in the doorwai father ferapont rais hi arm and under hi right arm the keen inquisit littl ey of the monk from obdorsk peep in he alon in hi intens curios could not resist run up the step after father ferapont the other on the contrari press farther back in sudden alarm when the door wa noisili flung open hold hi hand aloft father ferapont suddenli roar cast out i cast out and turn in all direct he began at onc make the sign of the cross at each of the four wall and four corner of the cell in success all who accompani father ferapont immedi understood hi action for thei knew he alwai did thi wherev he went and that he would not sit down or sai a word till he had driven out the evil spirit satan go henc satan go henc he repeat at each sign of the cross cast out i cast out he roar again he wa wear hi coars gown girt with a rope hi bare chest cover with grai hair could be seen under hi hempen shirt hi feet were bare as soon as he began wave hi arm the cruel iron he wore under hi gown could be heard clank father pa ssy paus in hi read step forward and stood befor him wait what have you come for worthi father why do you offend against good order why do you disturb the peac of the flock he said at last look sternli at him what have i come for you ask why what is your faith shout father ferapont crazili i ve come here to drive out your visitor the unclean devil i ve come to see how mani have gather here while i have been awai i want to sweep them out with a birch broom you cast out the evil spirit but perhap you ar serv him yourself father pa ssy went on fearlessli and who can sai of himself i am holi can you father i am unclean not holi i would not sit in an arm chair and would not have them bow down to me as an idol thunder father ferapont nowadai folk destroi the true faith the dead man your saint he turn to the crowd point with hi finger to the coffin did not believ in devil he gave medicin to keep off the devil and so thei have becom as common as spider in the corner and now he ha begun to stink himself in that we see a great sign from god the incid he refer to wa thi on of the monk wa haunt in hi dream and later on in wake moment by vision of evil spirit when in the utmost terror he confid thi to father zossima the elder had advis continu prayer and rigid fast but when that wa of no us he advis him while persist in prayer and fast to take a special medicin mani person were shock at the time and wag their head as thei talk over it and most of all father ferapont to whom some of the censori had hasten to report thi extraordinari counsel on the part of the elder go awai father said father pa ssy in a command voic it s not for man to judg but for god perhap we see here a sign which neither you nor i nor ani on of us is abl to comprehend go father and do not troubl the flock he repeat impress he did not keep the fast accord to the rule and therefor

sip tea he worship hi belli fill it with sweet thing and hi mind with haughti thought and for thi he is put to shame you speak lightli father father pa ssy too rais hi voic i admir your fast and sever but you speak lightli like some frivol youth fickl and childish go awai father i command you father pa ssy thunder in conclus i will go said ferapont seem somewhat taken aback but still as bitter you learn men you ar so clever you look down upon my humbl i came hither with littl learn and here i have forgotten what i did know god himself ha preserv me in my weak from your subtleti father pa ssy stood over him wait resolut father ferapont paus and suddenli lean hi cheek on hi hand despond pronounc in a sing song voic look at the coffin of the dead elder to morrow thei will sing over him our helper and defend a splendid anthem and over me when i die all thei ll sing will be what earthli joi a littl canticl he ad with tear regret you ar proud and puf up thi is a vain place he shout suddenli like a madman and with a wave of hi hand he turn quickli and quickli descend the step the crowd await him below waver some follow him at onc and some linger for the cell wa still open and father pa ssy follow father ferapont on to the step stood watch him but the excit old fanat wa not complet silenc walk twenti step awai he suddenli turn toward the set sun rais both hi arm and as though some on had cut him down fell to the ground with a loud scream my god ha conquer christ ha conquer the set sun he shout frantic stretch up hi hand to the sun and fall face downward on the ground he sob like a littl child shaken by hi tear and spread out hi arm on the ground then all rush up to him there were exclam and sympathet sob a kind of frenzi seem to take possess of them all thi is the on who is a saint thi is the on who is a holi man some cri aloud lose their fear thi is he who should be an elder other ad malignantli he wouldn t be an elder he would refus he wouldn t serv a curs innov he wouldn t imit their fooleri other voic chime in at onc and it is hard to sai how far thei might have gone but at that moment the bell rang summon them to servic all began cross themselv at onc father ferapont too got up and cross himself went back to hi cell without look round still utter exclam which were utterli incoher a few follow him but the greater number dispers hasten to servic father pa ssy let father iosif read in hi place and went down the frantic outcri of bigot could not shake him but hi heart wa suddenli fill with melancholi for some special reason and he felt that he stood still and suddenli wonder why am i sad even to deject and immedi grasp with surpris that hi sudden sad wa due to a veri small and special caus in the crowd throng at the entranc to the cell he had notic alyosha and he rememb that he had felt at onc a pang at heart on see him can that boi mean so much to my heart now he ask himself wonder at that moment alyosha pass him hurri awai but not in the direct of the church their ey met alyosha quickli turn awai hi ey and drop them to the ground and from the boi s look alon father pa ssy guess what a great chang wa take place in him at that moment have you too fallen into temptat cri father pa ssy can you be with those of littl faith he ad mournfulli alyosha stood still and gaze vagu at father pa ssy but quickli turn hi ey awai again and again look on the ground he stood sidewai and did not turn hi face to father pa ssy who watch him attent where ar you hasten the bell call to servic he ask again but again alyosha gave no answer ar you leav the hermitag what without ask leav without ask a bless alyosha suddenli gave a wry smile cast a strang veri strang look at the father to whom hi former guid the former sovereign of hi heart and mind hi belov elder had confid him as he lai dy and suddenli still without speak wave hi hand as though not care even to be respect and with rapid step walk toward the gate awai from the hermitag you will come back again murmur father pa ssy look after him with sorrow surpris chapter ii a critic moment father pa ssy of cours wa not wrong when he decid that hi dear boi would come back again perhap inde to some extent he penetr with insight into the true mean of alyosha s spiritu condit yet i must frankli own that it would be veri difficult for me to give a clear account of that strang vagu moment in the life of the young hero i love so much to father pa ssy s sorrow question ar you too with those of littl faith i could of cours confid answer for alyosha no he is not with those of littl faith quit the contrari inde all hi troubl came from the fact that he wa of great faith but still the troubl wa there and wa so agon that even long afterward alyosha thought of that sorrow dai as on of the bitterest and most fatal dai of hi life if the question is ask could all hi grief and disturb have been onli due to the fact that hi elder s bodi had shown sign of prematur decomposit instead of at onc perform miracl i must answer without beat about the bush ye it certainli wa i would onli beg the reader not to be in too great a hurri to laugh at my young hero s pure heart i am far from intend to apolog for him or to justifi hi innoc faith on the ground of hi youth or the littl progress he had made in hi studi or ani such reason i must declar on the contrari that i have genuin respect for the qualiti of hi heart no doubt a youth who receiv impress cautious whose love wa lukewarm and whose mind wa too prudent for hi ag and so of littl valu such a young man might i admit have avoid what happen to my hero but in some case it is realli more credit to be carri awai by an emot howev unreason which spring from a great love than to be unmov and thi is even truer in youth for a young man who is alwai sensibl is to be suspect and is of littl worth that s my opinion but reason peopl will exclaim perhap everi young man cannot believ in such a superstit and your hero is no model for other to thi i repli again ye my hero had faith a faith holi and steadfast but still i am not go to apolog for him though i declar abov and perhap too hastili that i should not explain or justifi my hero i see that some explan is necessari for the understand of the rest of my stori let me sai then it wa not a question of miracl there wa no frivol and impati expect of miracl in hi mind and alyosha need no miracl at the time for the triumph of some preconceiv idea oh no not at all what he saw befor all wa on figur the figur of hi belov elder the figur of that holi man whom he rever with such ador the fact is that all the love that lai conceal in hi pure young heart for everi on and everyth had for the past year been concentr and perhap wrongli so on on be hi belov elder it is true that be had for so long been accept by him as hi ideal that all hi young strength and energi could not but turn toward that ideal even to the forget at the moment of everi on and everyth he rememb afterward how on that terribl dai he had entir forgotten hi brother dmitri about whom he had been so anxiou and troubl the dai befor he had forgotten too to take the two hundr roubl to ilusha s father though he had so warmli intend to do so the preced even but again it wa not miracl he need but onli the higher justic which had been in hi belief outrag by the blow that had so suddenli and cruelli wound hi heart and what doe it signifi that thi justic look for by alyosha inevit took the shape of miracl to be wrought immedi by the ash of hi ador teacher why everi on in the monasteri cherish the same thought and the same hope even those whose intellect alyosha rever father pa ssy himself for instanc and so alyosha untroubl by doubt cloth hi dream too in the same form as all the rest and a whole year of life in the monasteri had form the habit of thi expect in hi heart but it wa justic justic he thirst for not simpli miracl and now the man who should he believ have been exalt abov everi on in the whole world that man instead of receiv the glori that wa hi due wa suddenli degrad and dishonor what for who had judg him who could have decre thi those were the question that wrung hi inexperienc and virgin heart he could not endur without mortif without resent even that the holiest of holi men should have been expos to the jeer and spite mockeri of the frivol crowd so inferior to him even had there been no miracl had there been noth marvel to justifi hi hope why thi indign why thi humili why thi prematur decai in excess of natur as the spite monk said why thi sign from heaven which thei so triumphantli acclaim in compani with father ferapont and why did thei believ thei had gain the right to acclaim it where is the finger of provid why did provid hide it face at the most critic moment so alyosha thought it as though voluntarili submit to the blind dumb pitiless law of natur that wa why alyosha s heart wa bleed and of cours as i have said alreadi the sting of it all wa that the man he love abov everyth on earth should be put to shame and humili thi murmur mai have been shallow and unreason in my hero but i repeat again for the third time and am prepar to admit that it might be difficult to defend my feel i am glad that my hero show himself not too reason at that moment for ani man of sens will alwai come back to reason in time but if love doe not gain the upper hand in a boi s heart at such an except moment when will it i will not howev omit to mention someth strang which came for a time to the surfac of alyosha s mind at thi fatal and obscur moment thi new someth wa the harass impress left by the convers with ivan which now persist haunt alyosha s mind at thi moment it haunt him oh it wa not that someth of the fundament element so to speak faith of hi soul had been shaken he love hi god and believ in him steadfastli though he wa suddenli murmur against him yet a vagu but torment and evil impress left by hi convers with ivan the dai befor suddenli reviv again now in hi soul and seem forc it wai to the surfac of hi conscious it had begun to get dusk when rakitin cross the pine cops from the hermitag to the monasteri suddenli notic alyosha ly face downward on the ground under a tree not move and appar asleep he went up and call him by hi name you here alexei can you have he began wonder but broke off

through hi soul flash like star and went out again at onc to be succeed by other but yet there wa reign in hi soul a sens of the whole of thing someth steadfast and comfort and he wa awar of it

from hi soul he stretch out hi hand utter a cry and wake up again the coffin the open window and the soft solemn distinct read of the gospel but alyosha did not listen to the read it wa strang he had fallen asleep on hi knee but now he wa on hi feet and suddenli as though thrown forward with three firm rapid step he went right up to the coffin hi shoulder brush against father pa ssy without hi notic it father pa ssy rais hi ey for an instant from hi book but look awai again at onc see that someth strang wa happen to the boi alyosha gaze for half a minut at the coffin at the cover motionless dead man that lai in the coffin with the ikon on hi breast and the peak cap with the octangular cross on hi head he had onli just been hear hi voic and that voic wa still ring in hi ear he wa listen still expect other word but suddenli he turn sharpli and went out of the cell he did not stop on the step either but went quickli down hi soul overflow with raptur yearn for freedom space open the vault of heaven full of soft shine star stretch vast and fathomless abov him the milki wai ran in two pale stream from the zenith to the horizon the fresh motionless still night enfold the earth the white tower and golden dome of the cathedr gleam out against the sapphir sky the gorgeou autumn flower in the bed round the hous were slumber till morn the silenc of earth seem to melt into the silenc of the heaven the mysteri of earth wa on with the mysteri of the star alyosha stood gaze and suddenli threw himself down on the earth he did not know why he embrac it he could not have told why he long so irresist to kiss it to kiss it all but he kiss it weep sob and water it with hi tear and vow passion to love it to love it for ever and ever water the earth with the tear of your joi and love those tear echo in hi soul what wa he weep over oh in hi raptur he wa weep even over those star which were shine to him from the abyss of space and he wa not asham of that ecstasi there seem to be thread from all those innumer world of god link hi soul to them and it wa trembl all over in contact with other world he long to forgiv everi on and for everyth and to beg forgiv oh not for himself but for all men for all and for everyth and other ar prai for me too echo again in hi soul but with everi instant he felt clearli and as it were tangibl that someth firm and unshak as that vault of heaven had enter into hi soul it wa as though some idea had seiz the sovereignti of hi mind and it wa for all hi life and for ever and ever he had fallen on the earth a weak boi but he rose up a resolut champion and he knew and felt it suddenli at the veri moment of hi ecstasi and never never all hi life long could alyosha forget that minut some on visit my soul in that hour he us to sai afterward with implicit faith in hi word within three dai he left the monasteri in accord with the word of hi elder who had bidden him sojourn in the world book viii mitya chapter i kuzma samsonov but dmitri to whom grushenka fly awai to a new life had left her last greet bid him rememb the hour of her love for ever knew noth of what had happen to her and wa at that moment in a condit of feverish agit and activ for the last two dai he had been in such an inconceiv state of mind that he might easili have fallen ill with brain fever as he said himself afterward alyosha had not been abl to find him the morn befor and ivan had not succeed in meet him at the tavern on the same dai the peopl at hi lodg by hi order conceal hi movement he had spent those two dai liter rush in all direct struggl with hi destini and try to save himself as he express it himself afterward and for some hour he even made a dash out of the town on urgent busi terribl as it wa to him to lose sight of grushenka for a moment all thi wa explain afterward in detail and confirm by documentari evid but for the present we will onli note the most essenti incid of those two terribl dai immedi preced the aw catastroph that broke so suddenli upon him though grushenka had it is true love him for an hour genuin and sincer yet she tortur him sometim cruelli and mercilessli the worst of it wa that he could never tell what she meant to do to prevail upon her by forc or kind wa also imposs she would yield to noth she would onli have becom angri and turn awai from him altogeth he knew that well alreadi he suspect quit correctli that she too wa pass through an inward struggl and wa in a state of extraordinari indecis that she wa make up her mind to someth and unabl to determin upon it and so not without good reason he divin with a sink heart that at moment she must simpli hate him and hi passion and so perhap it wa but what wa distress grushenka he did not understand for him the whole torment question lai between him and fyodor pavlovitch here we must note by the wai on certain fact he wa firmli persuad that fyodor pavlovitch would offer or perhap had offer grushenka law wedlock and did not for a moment believ that the old voluptuari hope to gain hi object for three thousand roubl mitya had reach thi conclus from hi knowledg of grushenka and her charact that wa how it wa that he could believ at time that all grushenka s uneasi rose from not know which of them to choos which wa most to her advantag strang to sai dure those dai it never occur to him to think of the approach return of the offic that is of the man who had been such a fatal influenc in grushenka s life and whose arriv she wa expect with such emot and dread it is true that of late grushenka had been veri silent about it yet he wa perfectli awar of a letter she had receiv a month ago from her seduc and had heard of it from her own lip he partli knew too what the letter contain in a moment of spite grushenka had shown him that letter but to her astonish he attach hardli ani consequ to it it would be hard to sai why thi wa perhap weigh down by all the hideou horror of hi struggl with hi own father for thi woman he wa incap of imagin ani danger more terribl at ani rate for the time he simpli did not believ in a suitor who suddenli turn up again after five year disappear still less in hi speedi arriv moreov in the offic s first letter which had been shown to mitya the possibl of hi new rival s visit wa veri vagu suggest the letter wa veri indefinit high flown and full of sentiment it must be note that grushenka had conceal from him the last line of the letter in which hi return wa allud to more definit he had besid notic at that moment he rememb afterward a certain involuntari proud contempt for thi missiv from siberia on grushenka s face grushenka told him noth of what had pass later between her and thi rival so that by degre he had complet forgotten the offic s exist he felt that whatev might come later whatev turn thing might take hi final conflict with fyodor pavlovitch wa close upon him and must be decid befor anyth els with a sink heart he wa expect everi moment grushenka s decis alwai believ that it would come suddenli on the impuls of the moment all of a sudden she would sai to him take me i m your for ever and it would all be over he would seiz her and bear her awai at onc to the end of the earth oh then he would bear her awai at onc as far far awai as possibl to the farthest end of russia if not of the earth then he would marri her and settl down with her incognito so that no on would know anyth about them there here or anywher then oh then a new life would begin at onc of thi differ reform and virtuou life it must it must be virtuou he dream feverishli at everi moment he thirst for that reform and renew the filthi morass in which he had sunk of hi own free will wa too revolt to him and like veri mani men in such case he put faith abov all in chang of place if onli it were not for these peopl if onli it were not for these circumst if onli he could fly awai from thi accurs place he would be altogeth regener would enter on a new path that wa what he believ in and what he wa yearn for but all thi could onli be on condit of the first the happi solut of the question there wa anoth possibl a differ and aw end suddenli she might sai to him go awai i have just come to term with fyodor pavlovitch i am go to marri him and don t want you and then but then but mitya did not know what would happen then up to the last hour he didn t know that must be said to hi credit he had no definit intent had plan no crime he wa simpli watch and spy in agoni while he prepar himself for the first happi solut of hi destini he drove awai ani other idea in fact but for that end a quit differ anxieti aros a new incident but yet fatal and insolubl difficulti present itself if she were to sai to him i m your take me awai how could he take her awai where had he the mean the monei to do it it wa just at thi time that all sourc of revenu from fyodor pavlovitch dole which had gone on without interrupt for so mani year ceas grushenka had monei of cours but with regard to thi mitya suddenli evinc extraordinari pride he want to carri her awai and begin the new life with her himself at hi own expens not at her he could not conceiv of take her monei and the veri idea caus him a pang of intens repuls i won t enlarg on thi fact or analyz it here but confin myself to remark that thi wa hi attitud at the moment all thi mai have arisen indirectli and unconsci from the secret sting of hi conscienc for the monei of katerina ivanovna that he had dishonestli appropri i ve been a scoundrel to on of them and i shall be a scoundrel again to the other directli wa hi feel then as he explain after and when grushenka know she won t care for such a scoundrel where then wa he to get the mean where wa he to get the fate monei without it all would be lost and noth could be done and onli becaus i hadn t the monei oh the shame of it to anticip thing he did perhap know where to get the monei knew perhap where it lai at that moment i will sai no more of thi here as it will all be clear later but hi chief troubl i must explain howev obscur lai in the fact that to have that sum he knew of to have the right to take it he must first restor katerina ivanovna s three thousand if not i m a common pickpocket i m a scoundrel and i don t want to begin a new life as a scoundrel mitya decid and so he made up hi mind to move heaven and earth to return katerina ivanovna that three thousand and that first of all the final stage of thi decis so to sai had been reach onli dure the last hour that is after hi last interview with alyosha two dai befor on the high road on the even when grushenka had insult katerina ivanovna and mitya after hear alyosha s account of it had admit that he wa a scoundrel and told him to tell katerina ivanovna so if it could be ani comfort to her after part from hi brother on that night he had felt in hi frenzi that it would be better to murder and rob some on than fail to pai my debt to katya i d rather everi on thought me a robber and a murder i d rather go to siberia than that katya should have the right to sai that i deceiv her and stole her monei and us her monei to run awai with grushenka and begin a new life that i can t do so mitya decid grind hi teeth and he might well fanci at time that hi brain would give wai but meanwhil he went on struggl strang to sai though on would have suppos there wa noth left for him but despair for what chanc had he with noth in the world to rais such a sum yet to the veri end he persist in hope that he would get that three thousand that the monei would somehow come to him of itself as though it might drop from heaven that is just how it is with peopl who like dmitri have never had anyth to do with monei except to squander what ha come to them by inherit without ani effort of their own and have no notion how monei is obtain a whirl of the most fantast notion took possess of hi brain immedi after he had part with alyosha two dai befor and threw hi thought into a tangl of confus thi is how it wa he pitch first on a perfectli wild enterpris and perhap to men of that kind in such circumst the most imposs fantast scheme occur first and seem most practic he suddenli determin to go to samsonov the merchant who wa grushenka s protector and to propos a scheme to him and by mean of it to obtain from him at onc the whole of the sum requir of the commerci valu of hi scheme he had no doubt not the slightest and wa onli uncertain how samsonov would look upon hi freak suppos he were to consid it from ani but the commerci point of view though mitya knew the merchant by sight he wa not acquaint with him and had never spoken a word to him but for some unknown reason he had long entertain the convict that the old reprob who wa ly at death s door would perhap not at all object now to grushenka s secur a respect posit and marri a man to be depend upon and he believ not onli that he would not object but that thi wa what he desir and if opportun aros that he would be readi to help from some rumor or perhap from some strai word of grushenka s he had gather further that the old man would perhap prefer him to fyodor pavlovitch for grushenka possibl mani of the reader of my novel will feel that in reckon on such assist and be readi to take hi bride so to speak from the hand of her protector dmitri show great coars and want of delicaci i will onli observ that mitya look upon grushenka s past as someth complet over he look on that past with infinit piti and resolv with all the fervor of hi passion that when onc grushenka told him she love him and would marri him it would mean the begin of a new grushenka and a new dmitri free from everi vice thei would forgiv on anoth and would begin their live afresh as for kuzma samsonov dmitri look upon him as a man who had exercis a fate influenc in that remot past of grushenka s though she had never love him and who wa now himself a thing of the past complet done with and so to sai non exist besid mitya hardli look upon him as a man at all for it wa known to everi on in the town that he wa onli a shatter wreck whose relat with grushenka had chang their charact and were now simpli patern and that thi had been so for a long time in ani case there wa much simplic on mitya s part in all thi for in spite of all hi vice he wa a veri simpl heart man it wa an instanc of thi simplic that mitya wa serious persuad that be on the ev of hi departur for the next world old kuzma must sincer repent of hi past relat with grushenka and that she had no more devot friend and protector in the world than thi now harmless old man after hi convers with alyosha at the cross road he hardli slept all night and at ten o clock next morn he wa at the hous of samsonov and tell the servant to announc him it wa a veri larg and gloomi old hous

he wa inform of the arriv of the captain he at onc refus to see him but mitya persist and sent hi name up again samsonov question the lad minut what he look like whether he wa drunk wa he go to make a row the answer he receiv wa that he wa sober but wouldn t go awai the old man again refus to see him then mitya who had foreseen thi and purpos brought pencil and paper with him wrote clearli on the piec of paper the word on most import busi close concern agrafena alexandrovna and sent it up to the old man after think a littl samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to the draw room and sent the old woman downstair with a summon to hi younger son to come upstair to him at onc thi younger son a man over six foot and of except physic strength who wa close shaven and dress in the european style though hi father still wore a kaftan and a beard came at onc without a comment all the famili trembl befor the father the old man had sent for thi giant not becaus he wa afraid of the captain he wa by no mean of a timor temper but in order to have a wit in case of ani emerg support by hi son and the servant lad he waddl at last into the draw room it mai be assum that he felt consider curios the draw room in which mitya wa await him wa a vast dreari room that laid a weight of depress on the heart it had a doubl row of window a galleri marbl wall and three immens chandeli with glass luster

three hour later thei arriv at volovya mitya at onc order post hors to drive to the town and suddenli realiz that he wa appallingli hungri while the hors were be har an omelett wa prepar for him he at it all in an instant at a huge hunk of bread at a sausag and swallow three glass of vodka after eat hi spirit and hi heart grew lighter he flew toward the town urg on the driver and suddenli made a new and unalter plan to procur that accurs monei befor even and to think onli to think that a man s life should be ruin for the sake of that paltri three thousand he cri contemptu i ll settl it to dai and if it had not been for the thought of grushenka and of what might have happen to her which never left him he would perhap have becom quit cheer again but the thought of her wa stab him to the heart everi moment like a sharp knife at last thei arriv and mitya at onc ran to grushenka chapter iii gold mine thi wa the visit of mitya of which grushenka had spoken to rakitin with such horror she wa just then expect the messag and wa much reliev that mitya had not been to see her that dai or the dai befor she hope that pleas god he won t come till i m gone awai and he suddenli burst in on her the rest we know alreadi to get him off her hand she suggest at onc that he should walk with her to samsonov s where she said she absolut must go to settl hi account and when mitya accompani her at onc she said good by to him at the gate make him promis to come at twelv o clock to take her home again mitya too wa delight at thi arrang if she wa sit at samsonov s she could not be go to fyodor pavlovitch s if onli she s not ly he ad at onc but he thought she wa not ly from what he saw he wa that sort of jealou man who in the absenc of the belov woman at onc invent all sort of aw fanci of what mai be happen to her and how she mai be betrai him but when shaken heartbroken convinc of her faithless he run back to her at the first glanc at her face her gai laugh affection face he reviv at onc lai asid all suspicion and with joy shame abus himself for hi jealousi after leav grushenka at the gate he rush home oh he had so much still to do that dai but a load had been lift from hi heart anywai now i must onli make hast and find out from smerdyakov whether anyth happen there last night whether by ani chanc she went to fyodor pavlovitch ough float through hi mind befor he had time to reach hi lodg jealousi had surg up again in hi restless heart jealousi othello wa not jealou he wa trust observ pushkin and that remark alon is enough to show the deep insight of our great poet othello s soul wa shatter and hi whole outlook cloud simpli becaus hi ideal wa destroi but othello did not begin hide spy peep he wa trust on the contrari he had to be led up push on excit with great difficulti befor he could entertain the idea of deceit the truli jealou man is not like that it is imposs to pictur to oneself the shame and moral degrad to which the jealou man can descend without a qualm of conscienc and yet it s not as though the jealou were all vulgar and base soul on the contrari a man of lofti feel whose love is pure and full of self sacrific mai yet hide under tabl bribe the vilest peopl and be familiar with the lowest ignomini of spy and eavesdrop othello wa incap of make up hi mind to faithless not incap of forgiv it but of make up hi mind to it though hi soul wa as innoc and free from malic as a babe s it is not so with the realli jealou man it is hard to imagin what some jealou men can make up their mind to and overlook and what thei can forgiv the jealou ar the readiest of all to forgiv and all women know it the jealou man can forgiv extraordinarili quickli though of cours after a violent scene and he is abl to forgiv infidel almost conclus prove the veri kiss and embrac he ha seen if onli he can somehow be convinc that it ha all been for the last time and that hi rival will vanish from that dai forward will depart to the end of the earth or that he himself will carri her awai somewher where that dread rival will not get near her of cours the reconcili is onli for an hour for even if the rival did disappear next dai he would invent anoth on and would be jealou of him and on might wonder what there wa in a love that had to be so watch over what a love could be worth that need such strenuou guard but that the jealou will never understand and yet among them ar men of nobl heart it is remark too that those veri men of nobl heart stand hidden in some cupboard listen and spy never feel the sting of conscienc at that moment anywai though thei understand clearli enough with their nobl heart the shame depth to which thei have voluntarili sunk at the sight of grushenka mitya s jealousi vanish and for an instant he becam trust and gener and posit despis himself for hi evil feel but it onli prove that in hi love for the woman there wa an element of someth far higher than he himself imagin that it wa not onli a sensual passion not onli the curv of her bodi of which he had talk to alyosha but as soon as grushenka had gone mitya began to suspect her of all the low cun of faithless and he felt no sting of conscienc at it and so jealousi surg up in him again he had in ani case to make hast the first thing to be done wa to get hold of at least a small temporari loan of monei the nine roubl had almost all gone on hi expedit and as we all know on can t take a step without monei but he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan he had a brace of fine duel pistol in a case which he had not pawn till then becaus he prize them abov all hi possess in the metropoli tavern he had some time sinc made acquaint with a young offici and had learnt that thi veri opul bachelor wa passion fond of weapon he us to bui pistol revolv dagger hang them on hi wall and show them to acquaint he pride himself on them and wa quit a specialist on the mechan of the revolv mitya without stop to think went straight to him and offer to pawn hi pistol to him for ten roubl the offici delight began try to persuad him to sell them outright but mitya would not consent so the young man gave him ten roubl protest that noth would induc him to take interest thei part friend mitya wa in hast he rush toward fyodor pavlovitch s by the back wai to hi arbor to get hold of smerdyakov as soon as possibl in thi wai the fact wa establish that three or four hour befor a certain event of which i shall speak later on mitya had not a farth and pawn for ten roubl a possess he valu though three hour later he wa in possess of thousand but i am anticip from marya kondratyevna the woman live near fyodor pavlovitch s he learn the veri disturb fact of smerdyakov s ill he heard the stori of hi fall in the cellar hi fit the doctor s visit fyodor pavlovitch s anxieti he heard with interest too that hi brother ivan had set off that morn for moscow then he must have driven through volovya befor me thought dmitri but he wa terribl distress about smerdyakov what will happen now who ll keep watch for me who ll bring me word he thought he began greedili question the women whether thei had seen anyth the even befor thei quit understood what he wa try to find out and complet reassur him no on had been there ivan fyodorovitch had been there the night everyth had been perfectli as usual mitya grew thought he would certainli have to keep watch to dai but where here or at samsonov s gate he decid that he must be on the look out both here and there and meanwhil meanwhil the difficulti wa that he had to carri out the new plan that he had made on the journei back he wa sure of it success but he must not delai act upon it mitya resolv to sacrific an hour to it in an hour i shall know everyth i shall settl everyth and then then first of all to samsonov s i ll inquir whether grushenka s there and instantli be back here again stai till eleven and then to samsonov s again to bring her home thi wa what he decid he flew home wash comb hi hair brush hi cloth dress and went to madam hohlakov s ala he had built hi hope on her he had resolv to borrow three thousand from that ladi and what wa more he felt suddenli convinc that she would not refus to lend it to him it mai be wonder why if he felt so certain he had not gone to her at first on of hi own sort so to speak instead of to samsonov a man he did not know who wa not of hi own class and to whom he hardli knew how to speak but the fact wa that he had never known madam hohlakov well and had seen noth of her for the last month and that he knew she could not endur him she had detest him from the first becaus he wa engag to katerina ivanovna while she had for some reason suddenli conceiv the desir that katerina ivanovna should throw him over and marri the charm chivalr refin ivan who had such excel manner mitya s manner she detest mitya posit laugh at her and had onc said about her that she wa just as live and at her eas as she wa uncultiv but that morn in the cart a brilliant idea had struck him if she is so anxiou i should not marri katerina ivanovna and he knew she wa posit hyster upon the subject why should she refus me now that three thousand just to enabl me to leav katya and get awai from her for ever these spoilt fine ladi if thei set their heart on anyth will spare no expens to satisfi their capric besid she s so rich mitya argu as for hi plan it wa just the same as befor it consist of the offer of hi right to tchermashnya but not with a commerci object as it had been with samsonov not try to allur the ladi with the possibl of make a profit of six or seven thousand but simpli as a secur for the debt as he work out thi new idea mitya wa enchant with it but so it alwai wa with him in all hi undertak in all hi sudden decis he gave himself up to everi

view at least onli an act of the greatest reckless and not so disgrac when on take into consider your charact even admit that it wa an action in the highest degre discredit still discredit is not disgrac mani peopl have alreadi guess dure thi last month about the three thousand of katerina ivanovna s that you have spent and i heard the legend myself apart from your confess mihail makarovitch for instanc had heard it too so that inde it wa scarc a legend but the gossip of the whole town there ar indic too if i am not mistaken that you confess thi yourself to some on i mean that the monei wa katerina ivanovna s and so it s extrem surpris to me that hitherto that is up to the present moment you have made such an extraordinari secret of the fifteen hundr you sai you put by appar connect a feel of posit horror with that secret it s not easi to believ that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret you cri out just now that siberia would be better than confess it the prosecutor ceas speak he wa provok he did not conceal hi vexat which wa almost anger and gave vent to all hi accumul spleen disconnectedli and incoher without choos word it s not the fifteen hundr that s the disgrac but that i put it apart from the rest of the three thousand said mitya firmli why smile the prosecutor irrit what is there disgrac to your think in your have set asid half of the three thousand you had discredit if you prefer disgracefulli appropri your take the three thousand is more import than what you did with it and by the wai why did you do that why did you set apart that half for what purpos for what object did you do it can you explain that to us oh gentlemen the purpos is the whole point cri mitya i put it asid becaus i wa vile that is becaus i wa calcul and to be calcul in such a case is vile and that vile ha been go on a whole month it s incomprehens i wonder at you but i ll make it clearer perhap it realli is incomprehens you see attend to what i sai i appropri three thousand entrust to my honor i spend it on a spree sai i spend it all and next morn i go to her and sai katya i ve done wrong i ve squander your three thousand well is that right no it s not right it s dishonest and cowardli i m a beast with no more self control than a beast that s so isn t it but still i m not a thief not a downright thief you ll admit i squander it but i didn t steal it now a second rather more favor altern follow me carefulli or i mai get confus again my head s go round and so for the second altern i spend here onli fifteen hundr out of the three thousand that is onli half next dai i go and take that half to her katya take thi fifteen hundr from me i m a low beast and an untrustworthi scoundrel for i ve wast half the monei and i shall wast thi too so keep me from temptat well what of that altern i should be a beast and a scoundrel and whatev you like but not a thief not altogeth a thief or i should not have brought back what wa left but have kept that too she would see at onc that sinc i brought back half i should pai back what i d spent that i should never give up try to that i should work to get it and pai it back so in that case i should be a scoundrel but not a thief you mai sai what you like not a thief i admit that there is a certain distinct said the prosecutor with a cold smile but it s strang that you see such a vital differ ye i see a vital differ everi man mai be a scoundrel and perhap everi man is a scoundrel but not everi on can be a thief it take an arch scoundrel to be that oh of cours i don t know how to make these fine distinct but a thief is lower than a scoundrel that s my convict listen i carri the monei about me a whole month i mai make up my mind to give it back to morrow and i m a scoundrel no longer but i cannot make up my mind you see though i m make up my mind everi dai and everi dai spur myself on to do it and yet for a whole month i can t bring myself to it you see is that right to your think is that right certainli that s not right that i can quit understand and that i don t disput answer the prosecutor with reserv and let us give up all discuss of these subtleti and distinct and if you will be so kind get back to the point and the point is that you have still not told us altogeth we ve ask you why in the first place you halv the monei squander on half and hide the other for what purpos exactli did you hide it what did you mean to do with that fifteen hundr i insist upon that question dmitri fyodorovitch ye of cours cri mitya strike himself on the forehead forgiv me i m worri you and am not explain the chief point or you d understand in a minut for it s just the motiv of it that s the disgrac you see it wa all to do with the old man my dead father he wa alwai pester agrafena alexandrovna and i wa jealou i thought then that she wa hesit between me and him so i kept think everi dai suppos she were to make up her mind all of a sudden suppos she were to leav off torment me and were suddenli to sai to me i love you not him take me to the other end of the world and i d onli forti copeck how could i take her awai what could i do why i d be lost you see i didn t know her then i didn t understand her i thought she want monei and that she wouldn t forgiv my poverti and so i fiendishli count out the half of that three thousand sew it up calcul on it sew it up befor i wa drunk and after i had sewn it up i went off to get drunk on the rest ye that wa base do you understand now both the lawyer laugh aloud i should have call it sensibl and moral on your part not to have squander it all chuckl nikolai parfenovitch for after all what doe it amount to why that i stole it that s what it amount to oh god you horrifi me by not understand everi dai that i had that fifteen hundr sewn up round my neck everi dai and everi hour i said to myself you re a thief you re a thief ye that s why i ve been so savag all thi month that s why i fought in the tavern that s why i attack my father it wa becaus i felt i wa a thief i couldn t make up my mind i didn t dare even to tell alyosha my brother about that fifteen hundr i felt i wa such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket but do you know while i carri it i said to myself at the same time everi hour no dmitri fyodorovitch you mai yet not be a thief why becaus i might go next dai and pai back that fifteen hundr to katya and onli yesterdai i made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck on my wai from fenya s to perhotin i hadn t been abl till that moment to bring myself to it and it wa onli when i tore it off that i becam a downright thief a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life why becaus with that i destroi too my dream of go to katya and sai i m a scoundrel but not a thief do you understand now do you understand what wa it made you decid to do it yesterdai nikolai parfenovitch interrupt why it s absurd to ask becaus i had condemn myself to die at five o clock thi morn here at dawn i thought it made no differ whether i di a thief or a man of honor but i see it s not so it turn out that it doe make a differ believ me gentlemen what ha tortur me most dure thi night ha not been the thought that i d kill the old servant and that i wa in danger of siberia just when my love wa be reward and heaven wa open to me again oh that did tortur me but not in the same wai not so much as the damn conscious that i had torn that damn monei off my breast at last and spent it and had becom a downright thief oh gentlemen i tell you again with a bleed heart i have learnt a great deal thi night i have learnt that it s not onli imposs to live a scoundrel but imposs to die a scoundrel no gentlemen on must die honest mitya wa pale hi face had a haggard and exhaust look in spite of hi be intens excit i am begin to understand you dmitri fyodorovitch the prosecutor said slowli in a soft and almost compassion tone but all thi if you ll excus my sai so is a matter of nerv in my opinion your overwrought nerv that s what it is and why for instanc should you not have save yourself such miseri for almost a month by go and return that fifteen hundr to the ladi who had entrust it to you and why could you not have explain thing to her and in view of your posit which you describ as be so aw why could you not have had recours to the plan which would so natur have occur to on s mind that is after honor confess your error to her why could you not have ask her to lend you the sum need for your expens which with her gener heart she would certainli not have refus you in your distress especi

himself thei grasp that thei had to address their answer to nikolai parfenovitch onli it turn out that thei could speak russian quit correctli except for their accent in some word of hi relat with grushenka past and present pan mussyalovitch spoke proudli and warmli so that mitya wa rous at onc and declar that he would not allow the scoundrel to speak like that in hi presenc pan mussyalovitch at onc call attent to the word scoundrel and beg that it should be put down in the protocol mitya fume with rage he s a scoundrel a scoundrel you can put that down and put down too that in spite of the protocol i still declar that he s a scoundrel he cri though nikolai parfenovitch did insert thi in the protocol he show the most praiseworthi tact and manag after sternli reprimand mitya he cut short all further inquiri into the romant aspect of the case and hasten to pass to what wa essenti on piec of evid given by the pole rous special interest in the lawyer that wa how in that veri room mitya had tri to bui off pan mussyalovitch and had offer him three thousand roubl to resign hi claim seven hundr roubl down and the remain two thousand three hundr to be paid next dai in the town he

account and taunt him with be a mother s darl but the boi could take hi own part he wa a resolut boi tremend strong as wa rumor in hi class and soon prove to be the fact he wa agil strong will and of an audaci and enterpris temper he wa good at lesson and there wa a rumor in the school that he could beat the teacher dardanelov at arithmet and univers histori though he look down upon everi on he wa a good comrad and not supercili he accept hi schoolfellow respect as hi due but wa friendli with them abov all he knew where to draw the line he could restrain himself on occas and in hi relat with the teacher he never overstep that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becom an unpardon breach of disciplin but he wa as fond of mischief on everi possibl occas as the smallest boi in the school and not so much for the sake of mischief as for creat a sensat invent someth someth effect and conspicu he wa extrem vain he knew how to make even hi mother give wai to him he wa almost despot in hi control of her she gave wai to him oh she had given wai to him for year the on thought unendur to her wa that her boi had no great love for her she wa alwai fanci that kolya wa unfeel to her and at time dissolv into hyster tear she us to reproach him with hi cold the boi dislik thi and the more demonstr of feel were demand of him the more he seem intention to avoid them yet it wa not intent on hi part but instinct it wa hi charact hi mother wa mistaken he wa veri fond of her he onli dislik sheepish sentiment as he express it in hi schoolboi languag there wa a bookcas in the hous contain a few book that had been hi father s kolya wa fond of read and had read sever of them by himself hi mother did not mind that and onli wonder sometim at see the boi stand for hour by the bookcas pore over a book instead of go to plai and in that wai kolya read some thing unsuit for hi ag though the boi as a rule knew where to draw the line in hi mischief he had of late begun to plai prank that caus hi mother seriou alarm it is true there wa noth viciou in what he did but a wild mad reckless it happen that juli dure the summer holidai that the mother and son went to anoth district forti five mile awai to spend a week with a distant relat whose husband wa an offici at the railwai station the veri station the nearest on to our town from which a month later ivan fyodorovitch karamazov set off for moscow there kolya began by carefulli investig everi detail connect with the railwai know that he could impress hi schoolfellow when he got home with hi newli acquir knowledg but there happen to be some other boi in the place with whom he soon made friend some of them were live at the station other in the neighborhood there were six or seven of them all between twelv and fifteen and two of them came from our town the boi plai togeth and on the fourth or fifth dai of kolya s stai at the station a mad bet wa made by the foolish boi kolya who wa almost the youngest of the parti and rather look down upon by the other in consequ wa move by vaniti or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubl that he would lie down between the rail at night when the eleven o clock train wa due and would lie there without move while the train roll over him at full speed it is true thei made a preliminari investig from which it appear that it wa possibl to lie so flat between the rail that the train could pass over without touch but to lie there wa no joke kolya maintain stoutli that he would at first thei laugh at him call him a littl liar a braggart but that onli eg him on what piqu him most wa that these boi of fifteen turn up their nose at him too supercili and were at first dispos to treat him as a small boi not fit to associ with them and that wa an unendur insult and so it wa resolv to go in the even half a mile from the station so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leav the station the boi assembl it wa a pitch dark night without a moon at the time fix kolya lai down between the rail the five other who had taken the bet wait among the bush below the embank their heart beat with suspens which wa follow by alarm and remors at last thei heard in the distanc the rumbl of the train leav the station two red light gleam out of the dark the monster roar as it approach run run awai from the rail the boi cri to kolya from the bush breathless with terror but it wa too late the train dart up and flew past the boi rush to kolya he lai without move thei began pull at him lift him up he suddenli got up and walk awai without a word then he explain that he had lain there as though he were insens to frighten them but the fact wa that he realli had lost conscious as he confess long after to hi mother in thi wai hi reput as a desper charact wa establish for ever he return home to the station as white as a sheet next dai he had a slight attack of nervou fever but he wa in high spirit and well pleas with himself the incid did not becom known at onc but when thei came back to the town it penetr to the school and even reach the ear of the master but then kolya s mother hasten to entreat the master on her boi s behalf and in the end dardanelov a respect and influenti teacher exert himself in hi favor and the affair wa ignor dardanelov wa a middl ag bachelor who had been passion in love with madam krassotkin for mani year past and had onc alreadi about a year previous ventur trembl with fear and the delicaci of hi sentiment to offer her most respectfulli hi hand in marriag but she refus him resolut feel that to accept him would be an act of treacheri to her son though dardanelov had to judg from certain mysteri symptom reason for believ that he wa not an object of avers to the charm but too chast and tender heart widow kolya s mad prank seem to have broken the ic and dardanelov wa reward for hi intercess by a suggest of hope the suggest it is true wa a faint on but then dardanelov wa such a paragon of puriti and delicaci that it wa enough for the time be to make him perfectli happi he wa fond of the boi though he would have felt it beneath him to try and win him over and wa sever and strict with him in class kolya too kept him at a respect distanc he learn hi lesson perfectli he wa second in hi class wa reserv with dardanelov and the whole class firmli believ that kolya wa so good at univers histori that he could beat even dardanelov kolya did inde ask him the question who found troi to which dardanelov had made a veri vagu repli refer to the movement and migrat of race to the remot of the period to the mythic legend but the question who had found troi that is what individu he could not answer and even for some reason regard the question as idl and frivol but the boi remain convinc that dardanelov did not know who found troi kolya had read of the founder of troi in smaragdov whose histori wa among the book in hi father s bookcas in the end all the boi becam interest in the question who it wa that had found troi but krassotkin would not tell hi secret and hi reput for knowledg remain unshaken after the incid on the railwai a certain chang came over kolya s attitud to hi mother when anna fyodorovna madam krassotkin heard of her son s exploit she almost went out of her mind with horror she had such terribl attack of hyster last with interv for sever dai that kolya serious alarm at last promis on hi honor that such prank should never be repeat he swore on hi knee befor the holi imag and swore by the memori of hi father at madam krassotkin s instanc and the manli kolya burst into tear like a boi of six and all that dai the mother and son were constantli rush into each other s arm sob next dai kolya woke up as unfeel as befor but he had becom more silent more modest sterner and more thought six week later it is true he got into anoth scrape which even brought hi name to the ear of our justic of the peac but it wa a scrape of quit anoth kind amus foolish and he did not as it turn out take the lead part in it but wa onli implic in it but of thi later hi mother still fret and trembl but the more uneasi she becam the greater were the hope of dardanelov it must be note that kolya understood and divin what wa in dardanelov s heart and of cours despis him profoundli for hi feel he had in the past been so tactless as to show thi contempt befor hi mother hint vagu that he knew what dardanelov wa after but from the time of the railwai incid hi behavior in thi respect also wa chang he did not allow himself the remotest allus to the subject and began to speak more respectfulli of dardanelov befor hi mother which the sensit woman at onc appreci with boundless gratitud but at the slightest mention of dardanelov by a visitor in kolya s presenc she would flush as pink as a rose at such moment kolya would either stare out of the window scowl or would investig the state of hi boot or would shout angrili for perezvon the big shaggi mangi dog which he had pick up a month befor brought home and kept for some reason secretli indoor not show him to ani of hi schoolfellow he bulli him frightfulli teach him all sort of trick so that the poor dog howl for him whenev he wa absent

you told me to get out of the wai of troubl that wa simpli out of affect and my sincer devot to you forese troubl in the hous to spare you onli i want to spare myself even more that s why i told you to get out of harm s wai that you might understand that there would be troubl in the hous and would remain at home to protect your father you might have said it more directli you blockhead ivan suddenli fire up how could i have said it more directli then it wa simpli my fear that made me speak and you might have been angri too i might well have been apprehens that dmitri fyodorovitch would make a scene and carri awai that monei for he consid it as good as hi own but who could tell that it would end in a murder like thi i thought that he would onli carri off the three thousand that lai under the master s mattress in the envelop and you see he s murder him how could you guess it either sir but if you sai yourself that it couldn t be guess how could i have guess and stai at home you contradict yourself said ivan ponder you might have guess from my send you to tchermashnya and not to moscow how could i guess it from that smerdyakov seem much exhaust and again he wa silent for a minut you might have guess from the fact of my ask you not to go to moscow but to tchermashnya that i want to have you nearer for moscow s a long wai off and dmitri fyodorovitch know you ar not far off would not be so bold and if anyth had happen you might have come to protect me too for i warn you of grigori vassilyevitch s ill and that i wa afraid of have a fit and when i explain those knock to you by mean of which on could go in to the deceas and that dmitri fyodorovitch knew them all through me i thought that you would guess yourself that he would be sure to do someth and so wouldn t go to tchermashnya even but would stai he talk veri coher thought ivan though he doe mumbl what s the derang of hi faculti that herzenstub talk of you ar cun with me damn you he exclaim get angri but i thought at the time that you quit guess smerdyakov parri with the simplest air if i d guess i should have stai cri ivan why i thought that it wa becaus you guess that you went awai in such a hurri onli to get out of troubl onli to run awai and save yourself in your fright you think that everi on is as great a coward as yourself forgiv me i thought you were like me of cours i ought to have guess ivan said in agit and i did guess there wa some mischief brew on your part onli you ar ly you ar ly again he cri suddenli recollect do you rememb how you went up to the carriag and said to me it s alwai worth while speak to a clever man so you were glad i went awai sinc you prais me smerdyakov sigh again and again a trace of color came into hi face if i wa pleas he articul rather breathlessli it wa simpli becaus you agre not to go to moscow but to tchermashnya for it wa nearer anywai onli when i said these word to you it wa not by wai of prais but of reproach you didn t understand it what reproach why that forese such a calam you desert your own father and would not protect us for i might have been taken up ani time for steal that three thousand damn you ivan swore again stai did you tell the prosecutor and the investig lawyer about those knock i told them everyth just as it wa ivan wonder inwardli again if i thought of anyth then he began again it wa sole of some wicked on your part dmitri might kill him but that he would steal i did not believ that then but i wa prepar for ani wicked from you you told me yourself you could sham a fit what did you sai that for it wa just through my simplic and i never have sham a fit on purpos in my life and i onli said so then to boast to you it wa just foolish i like you so much then and wa open heart with you my brother directli accus you of the murder and theft what els is left for him to do said smerdyakov with a bitter grin and who will believ him with all the proof against him grigori vassilyevitch saw the door open what can he sai after that but never mind him he is trembl to save himself he slowli ceas speak then suddenli as though on reflect ad and look here again he want to throw it on me and make out that it is the work of my hand i ve heard that alreadi but as to my be clever at sham a fit should i have told you beforehand that i could sham on if i realli had had such a design against your father if i had been plan such a murder could i have been such a fool as to give such evid against myself beforehand and to hi son too upon my word is that like as if that could be such a thing ha never happen no on hear thi talk of our now except provid itself and if you were to tell of it to the prosecutor and nikolai parfenovitch you might defend me complet by do so for who would be like to be such a crimin if he is so open heart beforehand ani on can see that well and ivan got up to cut short the convers struck by smerdyakov s last argument i don t suspect you at all and i think it s absurd inde to suspect you on the contrari i am grate to you for set my mind at rest now i am go but i ll come again meanwhil good by get well is there anyth you want i am veri thank for everyth marfa ignatyevna doe not forget me and provid me anyth i want accord to her kind good peopl visit me everi dai good by but i shan t sai anyth of your be abl to sham a fit and i don t advis you to either someth made ivan sai suddenli i quit understand and if you don t speak of that i shall sai noth of that convers of our at the gate then it happen that ivan went out and onli when he had gone a dozen step along the corridor he suddenli felt that there wa an insult signific in smerdyakov s last word he wa almost on the point of turn back but it wa onli a pass impuls and mutter nonsens he went out of the hospit hi chief feel wa on of relief at the fact that it wa not smerdyakov but mitya who had commit the murder though he might have been expect to feel the opposit he did not want to analyz the reason for thi feel and even felt a posit repugn at pry into hi sensat he felt as though he want to make hast to forget someth in the follow dai he becam convinc of mitya s guilt as he got to know all the weight of evid against him there wa evid of peopl of no import fenya and her mother for instanc but the effect of it wa almost overpow as to perhotin the peopl at the tavern and at plotnikov s shop as well as the wit at mokro their evid seem conclus it wa the detail that were so damn the secret of the knock impress the lawyer almost as much as grigori s evid as to the open door grigori s wife marfa in answer to ivan s question declar that smerdyakov had been ly all night the other side of the partit wall he wa not three pace from our bed and that although she wa a sound sleeper she wake sever time and heard him moan he wa moan the whole time moan continu talk to herzenstub and give it as hi opinion that smerdyakov wa not mad but onli rather weak ivan onli evok from the old man a subtl smile do you know how he spend hi time now he ask learn list of french word by heart he ha an exercis book under hi pillow with the french word written out in russian letter for him by some on he he he ivan end by dismiss all doubt he could not think of dmitri without repuls onli on thing wa strang howev alyosha persist that dmitri wa not the murder and that in all probabl smerdyakov wa ivan alwai felt that alyosha s opinion meant a great deal to him and so he wa astonish at it now anoth thing that wa strang wa that alyosha did not make ani attempt to talk about mitya with ivan that he never began on the subject and onli answer hi question thi too struck ivan particularli but he wa veri much preoccupi at that time with someth quit apart from that on hi return from moscow he abandon himself hopelessli to hi mad and consum passion for katerina ivanovna thi is not the time to begin to speak of thi new passion of ivan s which left it mark on all the rest of hi life thi would furnish the subject for anoth novel which i mai perhap never write but i cannot omit to mention here that when ivan on leav katerina ivanovna with alyosha as i ve relat alreadi told him i am not keen on her it wa an absolut lie he love her madli though at time he hate her so that he might have murder her mani caus help to bring about thi feel shatter by what had happen with mitya she rush on ivan s return to meet him as her on salvat she wa hurt insult and humili in her feel and here the man had come back to her who had love her so ardent befor oh she knew that veri well and whose heart and intellect she consid so superior to her own but the sternli virtuou girl did not abandon herself altogeth to the man she love in spite of the karamazov violenc of hi passion and the great fascin he had for her she wa continu torment at the same time by remors for have desert mitya and in moment of discord and violent anger and thei were numer she told ivan so plainli thi wa what he had call to alyosha li upon li there wa of cours much that wa fals in it and that anger ivan more than anyth but of all thi later he did in fact for a time almost forget smerdyakov s exist and yet a fortnight after hi first visit to him he began to be haunt by the same strang thought as befor it s enough to sai that he wa continu ask himself why wa it that on that last night in fyodor pavlovitch s hous he had crept out on to the stair like a thief and listen to hear what hi father wa do below why had he recal that afterward with repuls why next morn had he been suddenli so depress on the journei why as he reach moscow had he said to himself i am a scoundrel and now he almost fanci that these torment thought would make him even forget katerina ivanovna so complet did thei take possess of him again it wa just after fanci thi that he met alyosha in the street he stop him at onc and put a question to him do you rememb when dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father and afterward i told you in the yard that i reserv the right to desir tell me did you think then that i desir father s death or not i did think so answer alyosha softli it wa so too it wa not a matter of guess but didn t you fanci then that what i wish wa just that on reptil should devour anoth that is just that dmitri should kill father and as soon as possibl and that i myself wa even prepar to help to bring that about alyosha turn rather pale and look silent into hi brother s face speak cri ivan i want abov everyth to know what you thought then i want the truth the truth he drew a deep breath look angrili at alyosha befor hi answer came forgiv me i did think that too at the time whisper alyosha and he did not add on soften phrase thank snap ivan and leav alyosha he went quickli on hi wai from that time alyosha notic that ivan began obvious to avoid him and seem even to have taken a dislik to him so much so that alyosha gave up go to see him immedi after that meet with him ivan had not gone home but went straight to smerdyakov again chapter vii the second visit to smerdyakov by that time smerdyakov had been discharg from the hospit ivan knew hi new lodg the dilapid littl wooden hous divid in two by a passag on on side of which live marya kondratyevna and her mother and on the other smerdyakov no on knew on what term he live with them whether as a friend or as a lodger it wa suppos afterward that he had come to stai with them as marya kondratyevna s betroth and wa live there for a time without pai for board or lodg both mother and daughter had the greatest respect for him and look upon him as greatli superior to themselv ivan knock and on the door be open went straight into the passag by marya kondratyevna s direct he went straight to the better room on the left occupi by smerdyakov there wa a tile stove in the room and it wa extrem hot the wall were gai with blue paper which wa a good deal us howev and in the crack under it cockroach swarm in amaz number so that there wa a continu rustl from them the furnitur wa veri scanti two bench against each wall and two chair by the tabl the tabl of plain wood wa cover with a cloth with pink pattern on it there wa a pot of geranium on each of the two littl window in the corner there wa a case of ikon on the tabl stood a littl copper samovar with mani dent in it and a trai with two cup but smerdyakov had finish tea and the samovar wa out he wa sit at the tabl on a bench he wa look at an exercis book and slowli write with a pen there wa a bottl of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick but with a composit candl ivan saw at onc from smerdyakov s face that he had complet recov from hi ill hi face wa fresher fuller hi hair stood up jauntili in front and wa plaster down at the side he wa sit in a parti color wad dress gown rather dirti and frai howev he had spectacl on hi nose which ivan had never seen him wear befor thi trifl circumst suddenli redoubl ivan s anger a creatur like that and wear spectacl smerdyakov slowli rais hi head and look intent at hi visitor through hi spectacl then he slowli took them off and rose from the bench but by no mean respectfulli almost lazili do the least possibl requir by common civil all thi struck ivan instantli he took it all in and note it at onc most of all the look in smerdyakov s ey posit malici churlish and haughti what do you want to intrud for it seem to sai we settl everyth then why have you come again ivan could scarc control himself it s hot here he said still stand and unbutton hi overcoat take off your coat smerdyakov conced ivan took off hi coat and threw it on a bench with trembl hand he took a chair move it quickli to the tabl and sat down smerdyakov manag to sit down on hi bench befor him to begin with ar we alon ivan ask sternli and impuls can thei overhear us in there no on can hear anyth you ve seen for yourself there s a passag listen my good fellow what wa that you babbl as i wa leav the hospit that if i said noth about your faculti of sham fit you wouldn t tell the investig lawyer all our convers at the gate what do you mean by all what could you mean by it were you threaten me have i enter into some sort of compact with you do you suppos i am afraid of you ivan said thi in a perfect furi give him to understand with obviou intent that he scorn ani subterfug or indirect and meant to show hi card smerdyakov s ey gleam resentfulli hi left ey wink and he at onc gave hi answer with hi habitu composur and deliber you want to have everyth abov board veri well you shall have it he seem to sai thi is what i meant then and thi is why i said that that you know beforehand of thi murder of your own parent left him to hi fate and that peopl mightn t after that conclud ani evil about your feel and perhap of someth els too that s what i promis not to tell the author though smerdyakov spoke without hast and obvious control himself yet there wa someth in hi voic determin and emphat resent and insol defiant he stare impud at ivan a mist pass befor ivan s ey for the first moment how what ar you out of your mind i m perfectli in possess of all my faculti do you suppos i knew of the murder ivan cri at last and he brought hi fist violent on the tabl what do you mean by someth els too speak scoundrel smerdyakov wa silent and still scan ivan with the same insol stare speak you stink rogu what is that someth els too the someth els i meant wa that you probabl too were veri desir of your parent s death ivan jump up and struck him with all hi might on the shoulder so that he fell back against the wall in an instant hi face wa bath in tear sai it s a shame sir to strike a sick man he dri hi ey with a veri dirti blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weep a minut pass that s enough leav off ivan said peremptorili sit down again don t put me out of all patienc smerdyakov took the rag from hi ey everi line of hi pucker face reflect the insult he had just receiv so you thought then you scoundrel that togeth with dmitri i meant to kill my father i didn t know what thought were in your mind then said smerdyakov resentfulli and so i stop you then at the gate to sound you on that veri point to sound what what why that veri circumst whether you want your father to be murder or not what infuri ivan more than anyth wa the aggress insol tone to which smerdyakov persist adher it wa you murder him he cri suddenli smerdyakov smile contemptu you know of yourself for a fact that it wasn t i murder him and i should have thought that there wa no need for a sensibl man to speak of it again but why why had you such a suspicion about me at the time as you know alreadi it wa simpli from fear for i wa in such a posit shake with fear that i suspect everi on i resolv to sound you too for i thought if you want the same as your brother then the busi wa as good as settl and i should be crush like a fly too look here you didn t sai that a fortnight ago i meant the same when i talk to you in the hospit onli i thought you d understand without wast word and that be such a sensibl man you wouldn t care to talk of it openli what next come answer answer i insist what wa it what could i have done to put such a degrad suspicion into your mean soul as for the murder you couldn t have done that and didn t want to but as for want some on els to do it that wa just what you did want and how coolli how coolli he speak but why should i have want it what ground had i for want it what ground had you what about the inherit said smerdyakov sarcast and as it were vindict why after your parent s death there wa at least forti thousand to come to each of you and veri like more but if fyodor pavlovitch got marri then to that ladi agrafena alexandrovna she would have had all hi capit made over to her directli after the wed for she s plenti of sens so that your parent would not have left you two roubl between the three of you and were thei far from a wed either not a hair s breadth that ladi had onli to lift her littl finger and he would have run after her to church with hi tongu out ivan restrain himself with pain effort veri good he comment at last you see i haven t jump up i haven t knock you down i haven t kill you speak on so accord to you i had fix on dmitri to do it i wa reckon on him how could you help reckon on him if he kill him then he would lose all the right of a nobleman hi rank and properti and would go off to exil so hi share of the inherit would come to you and your brother alexei fyodorovitch in equal part so you d each have not forti but sixti thousand each there s not a doubt you did reckon on dmitri fyodorovitch what i put up with from you listen scoundrel if i had reckon on ani on then it would have been on you not on dmitri and i swear i did expect some wicked from you at the time i rememb my impress i thought too for a minut at the time that you were reckon on me as well said smerdyakov with a sarcast grin so that it wa just by that more than anyth you show me what wa in your mind for if you had a forebod about me and yet went awai you as good as said to me you can murder my parent i won t hinder you you scoundrel so that s how you understood it it wa all that go to tchermashnya why you were mean to go to moscow and refus all your father s entreati to go to tchermashnya and simpli at a foolish word from me you consent at onc what reason had you to consent to tchermashnya sinc you went to tchermashnya with no reason simpli at my word it show that you must have expect someth from me no i swear i didn t shout ivan grind hi teeth you didn t then you ought as your father s son to have had me taken to the lock up and thrash at onc for my word then or at least to have given me a punch in the face on the spot but you were not a bit angri if you pleas and at onc in a friendli wai act on my foolish word and went awai which wa utterli absurd for you ought to have stai to save your parent s life how could i help draw my conclus ivan sat scowl both hi fist convuls press on hi knee ye i am sorri i didn t punch you in the face he said with a bitter smile i couldn t have taken you to the lock up just then who would have believ me and what charg could i bring against you but the punch in the face oh i m sorri i didn t think of it though blow ar forbidden i should have pound your ugli face to a jelli smerdyakov look at him almost with relish in the ordinari occas of life he said in the same complac and sententi tone in which he had taunt grigori and argu with him about religion at fyodor pavlovitch s tabl in the ordinari occas of life blow on the face ar forbidden nowadai by law and peopl have given them up but in except occas of life peopl still fly to blow not onli among us but all over the world be it even the fullest republ of franc just as in the time of adam and ev and thei never will leav off but you even in an except case did not dare what ar you learn french word for ivan nod toward the exercis book ly on the tabl why shouldn t i learn them so as to improv my educ suppos that i mai myself chanc to go some dai to those happi part of europ listen monster ivan s ey flash and he trembl all over i am not afraid of your accus you can sai what you like about me and if i don t beat you to death it s simpli becaus i suspect you of that crime and i ll drag you to justic i ll unmask you to my think you d better keep quiet for what can you accus me of consid my absolut innoc and who would believ you onli if you begin i shall tell everyth too for i must defend myself do you think i am afraid of you now if the court doesn t believ all i ve said to you just now the public will and you will be asham that s as much as to sai it s alwai worth while speak to a sensibl man eh snarl ivan you hit the mark inde and you d better be sensibl ivan got up shake all over with indign put on hi coat and without repli further to smerdyakov without even look at him walk quickli out of the cottag the cool even air refresh him there wa a bright moon in the sky a nightmar of idea and sensat fill hi soul shall i go at onc and give inform against smerdyakov but what inform can i give he is not guilti anywai on the contrari he ll accus me and in fact why did i set off for tchermashnya then what for what for ivan ask himself ye of cours i wa expect someth and he is right and he rememb for the hundredth time how on the last night in hi father s hous he had listen on the stair but he rememb it now with such anguish that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stab ye i expect it then that s true i want the murder i did want the murder did i want the murder did i want it i must kill smerdyakov if i don t dare kill smerdyakov now life is not worth live ivan did not go home but went straight to katerina ivanovna and alarm her by hi appear he wa like a madman he repeat all hi convers with smerdyakov everi syllabl of it he couldn t be calm howev much she tri to sooth him he kept walk about the room speak strang disconnectedli at last he sat down put hi elbow on the tabl lean hi head on hi hand and pronounc thi strang sentenc if it s not dmitri but smerdyakov who s the murder i share hi guilt for i put him up to it whether i did i don t know yet but if he is the murder and not dmitri then of cours i am the murder too when katerina ivanovna heard that she got up from her seat without a word went to her write tabl open a box stand on it took out a sheet of paper and laid it befor ivan thi wa the document of which ivan spoke to alyosha later on as a conclus proof that dmitri had kill hi father it wa the letter written by mitya to katerina ivanovna when he wa drunk on the veri even he met alyosha at the crossroad on the wai to the monasteri after the scene at katerina ivanovna s when grushenka had insult her then part from alyosha mitya had rush to grushenka i don t know whether he saw her but in the even he wa at the metropoli where he got thoroughli drunk then he ask for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighti consequ to himself it wa a wordi disconnect frantic letter a drunken letter in fact it wa like the talk of a drunken man who on hi return home begin with extraordinari heat tell hi wife or on of hi household how he ha just been insult what a rascal had just insult him what a fine fellow he is on the other hand and how he will pai that scoundrel out and all that at great length with great excit and incoher with drunken tear and blow on the tabl the letter wa written on a dirti piec of ordinari paper of the cheapest kind it had been provid by the tavern and there were figur scrawl on the back of it there wa evid not space enough for hi drunken verbos and mitya not onli fill the margin but had written the last line right across the rest the letter ran as follow fatal katya to morrow i will get the monei and repai your three thousand and farewel woman of great wrath but farewel too my love let us make an end to morrow i shall try and get it from everi on and if i can t borrow it i give you my word of honor i shall go to my father and break hi skull and take the monei from under the pillow if onli ivan ha gone if i have to go to siberia for it i ll give

and he doesn t love you pp i kiss your feet farewel ppp katya prai to god that some on ll give me the monei then i shall not be steep in gore and if no on doe i shall kill me your slave and enemi d karamazov when ivan read thi document he wa convinc so then it wa hi brother not smerdyakov and if not smerdyakov then not he ivan thi letter at onc assum in hi ey the aspect of a logic proof there could be no longer the slightest doubt of mitya s guilt the suspicion never occur to ivan by the wai that mitya might have commit the murder in conjunct with smerdyakov and inde such a theori did not fit in with the fact ivan wa complet reassur the next morn he onli thought of smerdyakov and hi gibe with contempt a few dai later he posit wonder how he could have been so horribl distress at hi suspicion he resolv to dismiss him with contempt and forget him so pass a month he made no further inquiri about smerdyakov but twice he happen to hear that he wa veri ill and out of hi mind he ll end in mad the young doctor varvinski observ about him and ivan rememb thi dure the last week of that month ivan himself began to feel veri ill he went to consult the moscow doctor who had been sent for by katerina ivanovna just befor the trial and just at that time hi relat with katerina ivanovna becam acut strain thei were like two enemi in love with on anoth katerina ivanovna s return to mitya that is her brief but violent revuls of feel in hi favor drove ivan to perfect frenzi strang to sai until that last scene describ abov when alyosha came from mitya to katerina ivanovna ivan had never onc dure that month heard her express a doubt of mitya s guilt in spite of those return that were so hate to him it is remark too that while he felt that he hate mitya more and more everi dai he realiz that it wa not on account of katya s return that he hate him but just becaus he wa the murder of hi father he wa consciou of thi and fulli recogn it to himself nevertheless he went to see mitya ten dai befor the trial and propos to him a plan of escap a plan he had obvious thought over a long time he wa partli impel to do thi by a sore place still left in hi heart from a phrase of smerdyakov s that it wa to hi ivan s advantag that hi brother should be convict as that would increas hi inherit and alyosha s from forti to sixti thousand roubl he determin to sacrific thirti thousand on arrang mitya s escap on hi return from see him he wa veri mourn and dispirit he suddenli began to feel that he wa anxiou for mitya s escap not onli to heal that sore place by sacrif thirti thousand but for anoth reason is it becaus i am as much a murder at heart he ask himself someth veri deep down seem burn and rankl in hi soul hi pride abov all suffer cruelli all that month but of that later when after hi convers with alyosha ivan suddenli decid with hi hand on the bell of hi lodg to go to smerdyakov he obei a sudden and peculiar impuls of indign he suddenli rememb how katerina ivanovna had onli just cri out to him in alyosha s presenc it wa you you persuad me of hi that is mitya s guilt ivan wa thunderstruck when he recal it he had never onc tri to persuad her that mitya wa the murder on the contrari he had suspect himself in her presenc that time when he came back from smerdyakov it wa she she who had produc that document and prove hi brother s guilt and now she suddenli exclaim i ve been at smerdyakov s myself when had she been there ivan had known noth of it so she wa not at all so sure of mitya s guilt and what could smerdyakov have told her what what had he said to her hi heart burn with violent anger he could not understand how he could half an hour befor have let those word pass and not have cri out at the moment he let go of the bell and rush off to smerdyakov i shall kill him perhap thi time he thought on the wai chapter viii the third and last interview with smerdyakov when he wa half wai there the keen dry wind that had been blow earli that morn rose again and a fine dry snow began fall thickli it did not lie on the ground but wa whirl about by the wind and soon there wa a regular snowstorm there were scarc ani lamp post in the part of the town where smerdyakov live ivan strode alon in the dark unconsci of the storm instinct pick out hi wai hi head ach and there wa a pain throb in hi templ he felt that hi hand were twitch convuls not far from marya kondratyevna s cottag ivan suddenli came upon a solitari drunken littl peasant he wa wear a coars and patch coat and wa walk in zigzag grumbl and swear to himself then suddenli he would begin sing in a huski drunken voic ach vanka s gone to petersburg i won t wait till he come back but he broke off everi time at the second line and began swear again then he would begin the same song again ivan felt an intens hatr for him befor he had thought about him at all suddenli he realiz hi presenc and felt an irresist impuls to knock him down at that moment thei met and the peasant with a violent lurch fell full tilt against ivan who push him back furious the peasant went fly backward and fell like a log on the frozen ground he utter on plaintiv o oh and then wa silent ivan step up to him he wa ly on hi back without movement or conscious he will be frozen thought ivan and he went on hi wai to smerdyakov s in the passag marya kondratyevna who ran out to open the door with a candl in her hand whisper that smerdyakov wa veri ill it s not that he s laid up but he seem not himself and he even told us to take the tea awai he wouldn t have ani why doe he make a row ask ivan coars oh

the sofa wear the same dress gown the tabl had been brought out in front of the sofa so that there wa hardli room to move on the tabl lai a thick book in yellow cover but smerdyakov wa not read it he seem to be sit do noth he met ivan with a slow silent gaze and wa appar not at all surpris at hi come there wa a great chang in hi face he wa much thinner and sallow hi ey were sunken and there were blue mark under them why you realli ar ill ivan stop short i won t keep you long i won t even take off my coat where can on sit down he went to the other end of the tabl move up a chair and sat down

kept think of dmitri brother brother ach he suddenli clutch hi head in both hand listen did you kill him alon with my brother s help or without it wa onli with you with your help i kill him and dmitri

smerdyakov mutter in surpris won t you have some lemonad i ll ask for some at onc it s veri refresh onli i must hide thi first and again he motion at the note he wa just go to get up and call at the door to marya kondratyevna to make some lemonad and bring it them but look for someth to cover up the note that she might not see them he first took out hi handkerchief and as it turn out to be veri dirti took up the big yellow book that ivan had notic at first ly on the tabl and put it over the note the book wa the sai of the holi father isaac the syrian ivan read it mechan i won t have ani lemonad he said talk of me later sit down and tell me how you did it tell me all about it you d better take off your greatcoat or you ll be too hot ivan as though he d onli just thought of it took off hi coat and without get up from hi chair threw it on the bench speak pleas speak he seem calmer he wait feel sure that smerdyakov would tell him all about it how it wa done sigh smerdyakov it wa done in a most natur wai follow your veri word of my word later ivan broke in again appar with complet self possess firmli utter hi word and not shout as befor onli tell me in detail how you did it everyth as it happen don t forget anyth the detail abov everyth the detail i beg you you d gone awai then i fell into the cellar in a fit or in a sham on a sham on natur i sham it all i went quietli down the step to the veri bottom and lai down quietli and as i lai down i gave a scream and struggl till thei carri me out stai and were you sham all along afterward and in the hospit no not at all next dai in the morn befor thei took me to the hospit i had a real attack and a more violent on than i ve had for year for two dai i wa quit unconsci all right all right go on thei laid me on the bed i knew i d be the other side of the partit for whenev i wa ill marfa ignatyevna us to put me there near them she s alwai been veri kind to me from my birth up at night i moan but quietli i kept expect dmitri fyodorovitch to come expect him to come to you not to me i expect him to come into the hous for i d no doubt that he d come that night for be without me and get no new he d be sure to come and climb over the fenc as he us to and do someth and if he hadn t come then noth would have happen i should never have brought myself to it without him all right all right speak more intellig don t hurri abov all don t leav anyth out i expect him to kill fyodor pavlovitch i thought that wa certain for i had prepar him for it dure the last few dai he knew about the knock that wa the chief thing with hi suspici and the furi which had been grow in him all those dai he wa bound to get into the hous by mean of those tap that wa inevit so i wa expect him stai ivan interrupt if he had kill him he would have taken the monei and carri it awai you must have consid that what would you have got by it afterward i don t see but he would never have found the monei that wa onli what i told him that the monei wa under the mattress but that wasn t true it had been ly in a box and afterward i suggest to fyodor pavlovitch as i wa the onli person he trust to hide the envelop with the note in the corner behind the ikon for no on would have guess that place especi if thei came in a hurri so that s where the envelop lai in the corner behind the ikon it would have been absurd to keep it under the mattress the box anywai could be lock but all believ it wa under the mattress a stupid thing to believ so if dmitri fyodorovitch had commit the murder find noth he would either have run awai in a hurri afraid of everi sound as alwai happen with murder or he would have been arrest so i could alwai have clamber up to the ikon and have taken awai the monei next morn or even that night and it would have all been put down to dmitri fyodorovitch i could reckon upon that but what if he did not kill him but onli knock him down if he did not kill him of cours i would not have ventur to take the monei and noth would have happen but i calcul that he would beat him senseless and i should have time to take it then and then i d make out to fyodor pavlovitch that it wa no on but dmitri fyodorovitch who had taken the monei after beat him stop i am get mix then it wa dmitri after all who kill him you onli took the monei no he didn t kill him well i might as well have told you now that he wa the murder but i don t want to lie to you now becaus becaus if you realli haven t understood till now as i see for myself and ar not pretend so as to throw your guilt on me to my veri face you ar still respons for it all sinc you knew of the murder and charg me to do it and went awai know all about it and so i want to prove to your face thi even that you ar the onli real murder in the whole affair and i am not the real murder though i did kill him you ar the right murder why why am i a murder oh god ivan cri unabl to restrain himself at last and forget that he had put off discuss himself till the end of the convers you still mean that tchermashnya stai tell me why did you want my consent if you realli took tchermashnya for consent how will you explain that now assur of your consent i should have known that you wouldn t have made an outcri over those three thousand be lost even if i d been suspect instead of dmitri fyodorovitch or as hi accomplic on the contrari you would have protect me from other and when you got your inherit you would have reward me when you were abl all the rest of your life for you d have receiv your inherit through me see that if he had marri agrafena alexandrovna you wouldn t have had a farth ah then you intend to worri me all my life afterward snarl ivan and what if i hadn t gone awai then but had inform against you what could you have inform that i persuad you to go to tchermashnya that s all nonsens besid after our convers you would either have gone awai or have stai if you had stai noth would have happen i should have known that you didn t want it done and should have attempt noth as you went awai it meant you assur me that you wouldn t dare to inform against me at the trial and that you d overlook my have the three thousand and inde you couldn t have prosecut me afterward becaus then i should have told it all in the court that is not that i had stolen the monei or kill him i shouldn t have said that but that you d put me up to the theft and the murder though i didn t consent to it that s why i need your consent so that you couldn t have corner me afterward for what proof could you have had i could alwai have corner you reveal your eager for your father s death and i tell you the public would have believ it all and you would have been asham for the rest of your life wa i then so eager wa i ivan snarl again to be sure you were and by your consent you silent sanction my do it smerdyakov look resolut at ivan he wa veri weak and spoke slowli and wearili but some hidden inner forc urg him on he evid had some design ivan felt that go on he said tell me what happen that night what more is there to tell i lai there and i thought i heard the master shout and befor that grigori vassilyevitch had suddenli got up and came out and he suddenli gave a scream and then all wa silenc and dark i lai there wait my heart beat i couldn t bear it i got up at last went out i saw the window open on the left into the garden and i step to the left to listen whether he wa sit there aliv and i heard the master move about sigh so i knew he wa aliv ech i thought i went to the window and shout to the master it s i and he shout to me he s been he s been he s run awai he meant dmitri fyodorovitch had been he s kill grigori where i whisper there in the corner he point he wa whisper too wait a bit i said i went to the corner of the garden to look and there i came upon grigori vassilyevitch ly by the wall cover with blood senseless so it s true that dmitri fyodorovitch ha been here wa the thought that came into my head and i determin on the spot to make an end of it as grigori vassilyevitch even if he were aliv would see noth of it as he lai there senseless the onli risk wa that marfa ignatyevna might wake up i felt that at the moment but the long to get it done came over me till i could scarc breath i went back to the window to the master and said she s here she s come agrafena alexandrovna ha come want to be let in and he start like a babi where is she he fairli gasp but couldn t believ it she s stand there said i open he look out of the window at me half believ and half distrust but afraid to open why he is afraid of me now i thought and it wa funni i bethought me to knock on the window frame those tap we d agre upon as a signal that grushenka had come in hi presenc befor hi ey he didn t seem to believ my word but as soon as he heard the tap he ran at onc to open the door he open it i would have gone in but he stood in the wai to prevent me pass where is she where is she he look at me all of a trembl well thought i if he s so frighten of me as all that it s a bad look out and my leg went weak with fright that he wouldn t let me in or would call out or marfa ignatyevna would run up or someth els might happen i don t rememb now but i must have stood pale face him i whisper to him why she s there there under the window how is it you don t see her i said bring her then bring her she s afraid said i she wa frighten at the nois she s hidden in the bush go and call to her yourself from the studi he ran to the window put the candl in the window grushenka he cri grushenka ar you here though he cri that he didn t want to lean out of the window he didn t want to move awai from me for he wa panic stricken he wa so frighten he didn t dare to turn hi back on me why here she is said i i went up to the window and lean right out of it here she is she s in the bush laugh at you don t you see her he suddenli believ it he wa all of a shake he wa awfulli crazi about her and he lean right out of the window i snatch up that iron paper weight from hi tabl do you rememb weigh about three pound i swung it and hit him on the top of the skull with the corner of it he didn t even cry out he onli sank down suddenli and i hit him again and a third time and the third time i knew i d broken hi skull he suddenli roll on hi back face upward cover with blood i look round there wa no blood on me not a spot i wipe the paper weight put it back went up to the ikon took the monei out of the envelop and flung the envelop on the floor and the pink ribbon besid it i went out into the garden all of a trembl straight to the appl tree with a hollow in it you know that hollow i d mark it long befor and put a rag and a piec of paper readi in it i wrap all the note in the rag and stuf it deep down in the hole and there it stai for over a fortnight i took it out later when i came out of the hospit i went back to my bed lai down and thought if grigori vassilyevitch ha been kill outright it mai be a bad job for me but if he is not kill and recov it will be first rate for then he ll bear wit that dmitri fyodorovitch ha been here and so he must have kill him and taken the monei then i began groan with suspens and impati so as to wake marfa ignatyevna as soon as possibl at last she got up and she rush to me but when she saw grigori vassilyevitch wa not there she ran out and i heard her scream in the garden and that set it all go and set my mind at rest he stop ivan had listen all the time in dead silenc without stir or take hi ey off him as he told hi stori smerdyakov glanc at him from time to time but for the most part kept hi ey avert when he had finish he wa evid agit and wa breath hard the perspir stood out on hi face but it wa imposs to tell whether it wa remors he wa feel or what stai cri ivan ponder what about the door if he onli open the door to you how could grigori have seen it open befor for grigori saw it befor you went it wa remark that ivan spoke quit amic in a differ tone not angri as befor so if ani on had open the door at that moment and peep in at them he would certainli have conclud that thei were talk peaceabl about some ordinari though interest subject as for that door and grigori vassilyevitch s have seen it open that s onli hi fanci said smerdyakov with a wry smile he is not a man i assur you but an obstin mule he didn t see it but fanci he had seen it and there s no shake him it s just our luck he took that notion into hi head for thei can t fail to convict dmitri fyodorovitch after that listen said ivan begin to seem bewild again and make an effort to grasp someth listen there ar a lot of question i want to ask you but i forget them i keep forget and get mix up ye tell me thi at least why did you open the envelop and leav it there on the floor why didn t you simpli carri off the envelop when you were tell me i thought you spoke about it as though it were the right thing to do but why i can t understand i did that for a good reason for if a man had known all about it as i did for instanc if he d seen those note befor and perhap had put them in that envelop himself and had seen the envelop seal up and address with hi own ey if such a man had done the murder what should have made him tear open the envelop afterward especi in such desper hast sinc he d know for certain the note must be in the envelop no if the robber had been some on like me he d simpli have put the envelop straight in hi pocket and got awai with it as fast as he could but it d be quit differ with dmitri fyodorovitch he onli knew about the envelop by hearsai he had never seen it and if he d found it for instanc under the mattress he d have torn it open as quickli as possibl to make sure the note were in it and he d have thrown the envelop down without have time to think that it would be evid against him becaus he wa not an habitu thief and had never directli stolen anyth befor for he is a gentleman born and if he did bring himself to steal it would not be regular steal but simpli take what wa hi own for he d told the whole town he meant to befor and had even brag aloud befor everi on that he d go and take hi properti from fyodor pavlovitch i didn t sai that openli to the prosecutor when i wa be examin but quit the contrari i brought him to it by a hint as though i didn t see it myself and as though he d thought of it himself and i hadn t prompt him so that mr prosecutor s mouth posit water at my suggest but can you possibl have thought of all that on the spot cri ivan overcom with astonish he look at smerdyakov again with alarm merci on us could ani on think of it all in such a desper hurri it wa all thought out beforehand well well it wa the devil help you ivan cri again no you ar not a fool you ar far clever than i thought he got up obvious intend to walk across the room he wa in terribl distress but as the tabl block hi wai and there wa hardli room to pass between the tabl and the wall he onli turn round where he stood and sat down again perhap the imposs of move irrit him as he suddenli cri out almost as furious as befor listen you miser contempt creatur don t you understand that if i haven t kill you it s simpli becaus i am keep you to answer to morrow at the trial god see ivan rais hi hand perhap i too wa guilti perhap i realli had a secret desir for my father s death but i swear i wa not as guilti as you think and perhap i didn t urg you on at all no no i didn t urg you on but no matter i will give evid against myself to morrow at the trial i m determin to i shall tell

ar yellow smerdyakov comment without the least ironi with appar sympathi in fact we ll go togeth ivan repeat and if you won t go no matter i ll go alon smerdyakov paus as though ponder there ll be noth of the sort and you won t go he conclud at last posit you don t understand me ivan exclaim reproachfulli you ll be too much asham if you confess it all and what s more it will be no us at all for i shall sai straight out that i never said anyth of the sort to you and that you ar either ill and it look like it too or that you re so sorri for your brother that you ar sacrif yourself to save him and have invent it all against me for you ve alwai thought no more of me than if i d been a fly and who will believ you and what singl proof have you got listen you show me those note just now to convinc me smerdyakov lift the book off the note and laid it on on side take that monei awai with you smerdyakov sigh of cours i shall take it but why do you give it to me if you commit the murder for the sake of it ivan look at him with great surpris i don t want it smerdyakov articul in a shake voic with a gestur of refus i did have an idea of begin a new life with that monei in moscow or better still abroad i did dream of it chiefli becaus all thing ar law that wa quit right what you taught me for you talk a lot to me about that for if there s no everlast god there s no such thing as virtu and there s no need of it you were right there so that s how i look at it did you come to that of yourself ask ivan with a wry smile with your guidanc and now i suppos you believ in god sinc you ar give back the monei no i don t believ whisper smerdyakov then why ar you give it back leav off that s enough smerdyakov wave hi hand again you us to sai yourself that everyth wa law so now why ar you so upset too you even want to go and give evid against yourself onli there ll be noth of the sort you won t go to give evid smerdyakov decid with convict you ll see said ivan it isn t possibl you ar

anyth you who us to be so bold till to morrow cri ivan and move to go out stai a moment show me those note again ivan took out the note and show them to him smerdyakov look at them for ten second well you can go he said with a wave of hi hand ivan fyodorovitch he call after him again what do you want ivan turn without stop good by till to morrow ivan cri again and he walk out of the cottag the snowstorm wa still rage he walk the first few step boldli but suddenli began stagger it s someth physic he thought with a grin someth like joi wa spring up in hi heart he wa consciou of unbound resolut he would make an end of the waver that had so tortur him of late hi determin wa taken and now it will not be chang he thought with relief at that moment he stumbl against someth and almost fell down stop short he made out at hi feet the peasant he had knock down still ly senseless and motionless the snow had almost cover hi face ivan seiz him and lift him in hi arm see a light in the littl hous to the right he went up knock at the shutter and ask the man to whom the hous belong to help him carri the peasant to the polic station promis him three roubl the man got readi and came out i won t describ in detail how ivan succeed in hi object bring the peasant to the polic station and arrang for a doctor to see him at onc provid with a liber hand for the expens i will onli sai that thi busi took a whole hour but ivan wa well content with it hi mind wander and work incessantli if i had not taken my decis so firmli for to morrow he reflect with satisfact i should not have stai a whole hour to look after the peasant but should have pass by without care about hi be frozen i am quit capabl of watch myself by the wai he thought at the same instant with still greater satisfact although thei have decid that i am go out of my mind just as he reach hi own hous he stop short ask himself suddenli hadn t he better go at onc to the prosecutor and tell him everyth he decid the question by turn back to the hous everyth togeth to morrow he whisper to himself and strang to sai almost all hi glad and self satisfact pass in on instant as he enter hi own room he felt someth like a touch of ic on hi heart like a recollect or more exactli a remind of someth agon and revolt that wa in that room now at that moment and had been there befor he sank wearili on hi sofa the old woman brought him a samovar he made tea but did not touch it he sat on the sofa and felt giddi he felt that he wa ill and helpless he wa begin to drop asleep but got up uneasili and walk across the room to shake off hi drowsi at moment he fanci he wa deliri but it wa not ill that he thought of most sit down again he began look round as though search for someth thi happen sever time at last hi ey were fasten intent on on point ivan smile but an angri flush suffus hi face he sat a long time in hi place hi head prop on both arm though he look sidewai at the same point at the sofa that stood against the opposit wall there wa evid someth some object that irrit him there worri him and torment him chapter ix the devil ivan s nightmar i am not a doctor but yet i feel that the moment ha come when i must inevit give the reader some account of the natur of ivan s ill anticip event i can sai at least on thing he wa at that moment on the veri ev of an attack of brain fever though hi health had long been affect it had offer a stubborn resist to the fever which in the end gain complet masteri over it though i know noth of medicin i ventur to hazard the suggest that he realli had perhap by a terribl effort of will succeed in delai the attack for a time hope of cours to check it complet he knew that he wa unwel but he loath the thought of be ill at that fatal time at the approach crisi in hi life when he need to have all hi wit about him to sai what he had to sai boldli and resolut and to justifi himself to himself he had howev consult the new doctor who had been brought from moscow by a fantast notion of katerina ivanovna s to which i have refer alreadi after listen to him and examin him the doctor came to the conclus that he wa actual suffer from some disord of the brain and wa not at all surpris by an admiss which ivan had reluctantli made him hallucin ar quit like in your condit the doctor opin though it would be better to verifi them you must take step at onc without a moment s delai or thing will go badli with you but ivan did not follow thi judici advic and did not take to hi bed to be nurs i am walk about so i am strong enough if i drop it ll be differ then ani on mai nurs me who like he decid dismiss the subject and so he wa sit almost consciou himself of hi delirium and as i have said alreadi look persist at some object on the sofa against the opposit wall some on appear to be sit there though good know how he had come in for he had not been in the room when ivan came into it on hi return from smerdyakov thi wa a person or more accur speak a russian

outgrown thrash out long ago and flung asid like a dead carcass you present to me as someth new there s no pleas you and i thought i should fascin you by my literari style that hosannah in the ski realli wasn t bad wa it and then that iron tone la hein eh no i wa never such a flunkei how then could my soul beget a flunkei like you my dear fellow i know a most charm and attract young russian gentleman a young thinker and a great lover of literatur and art the author of a promis poem entitl the grand inquisitor i wa onli think of him i forbid you to speak of the grand inquisitor cri ivan crimson with shame and the geolog cataclysm do you rememb that wa a poem now hold your tongu or i ll kill you you ll kill me no excus me i will speak i came to treat myself to that pleasur oh i love the dream of my ardent young friend quiver with eager for life there ar new men you decid last spring when you were mean to come here thei propos to destroi everyth and begin with cannib stupid fellow thei didn t ask my advic i maintain that noth need be destroi that we onli need to destroi the idea of god in man that s how we have to set to work it s that that we must begin with oh blind race of men who have no understand as soon as men have all of them deni god and i believ that period analog with geolog period will come to pass the old concept of the univers will fall of itself without cannib and what s more the old moral and everyth will begin anew men will unit to take from life all it can give but onli for joi and happi in the present world man will be lift up with a spirit of divin titan pride and the man god will appear from hour to hour extend hi conquest of natur infinit by hi will and hi scienc man will feel such lofti joi from hour to hour in do it that it will make up for all hi old dream of the joi of heaven everi on will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudli and seren like a god hi pride will teach him that it s useless for him to repin at life s be a moment and he will love hi brother without need of reward love will be suffici onli for a moment of life but the veri conscious of it momentari will intensifi it fire which now is dissip in dream of etern love beyond the grave and so on and so on in the same style charm ivan sat with hi ey on the floor and hi hand press to hi ear but he began trembl all over the voic continu the question now is my young thinker reflect is it possibl that such a period will ever come if it doe everyth is determin and human is settl for ever but as ow to man s inveter stupid thi cannot come about for at least a thousand year everi on who recogn the truth even now mai legitim order hi life as he pleas on the new principl in that sens all thing ar law for him what s more even if thi period never come to pass sinc there is anywai no god and no immort the new man mai well becom the man god even if he is the onli on in the whole world and promot to hi new posit he mai lightheartedli overstep all the barrier of the old moral of the old slave man if necessari there is no law for god where god stand the place is holi where i stand will be at onc the foremost place all thing ar law and that s the end of it that s all veri charm but if you want to swindl why do you want a moral sanction for do it but that s our modern russian all over he can t bring himself to swindl without a moral sanction he is so in love with truth the visitor talk obvious carri awai by hi own eloqu speak louder and louder and look iron at hi host but he did not succe in finish ivan suddenli snatch a glass from the tabl and

judici error chapter i the fatal dai at ten o clock in the morn of the dai follow the event i have describ the trial of dmitri karamazov began in our district court i hasten to emphas the fact that i am far from esteem myself capabl of report all that took place at the trial in full detail or even in the actual order of event i imagin that to mention everyth with full explan would fill a volum even a veri larg on and so i trust i mai not be reproach for confin myself to what struck me i mai have select as of most interest what wa of secondari import and mai have omit the most promin and essenti detail but i see i shall do better not to apolog i will do my best and the reader will see for himself that i have done all i can and to begin with befor enter the court i will mention what surpris me most on that dai inde as it appear later everi on wa surpris at it too we all knew that the affair had arous great interest that everi on wa burn with impati for the trial to begin that it had been a subject of talk conjectur exclam and surmis for the last two month in local societi everi on knew too that the case had becom known throughout russia but yet we had not imagin that it had arous such burn such intens interest in everi on not onli among ourselv but all over russia thi becam evid at the trial thi dai visitor had arriv not onli from the chief town of our provinc but from sever other russian town as well as from moscow and petersburg among them were lawyer ladi and even sever distinguish personag everi ticket of admiss had been snatch up a special place behind the tabl at which the three judg sat wa set apart for the most distinguish and import of the men visitor a row of arm chair had been place there someth except which had never been allow befor a larg proport not less than half of the public were ladi there wa such a larg number of lawyer from all part that thei did not know where to seat them for everi ticket had long sinc been eagerli sought for and distribut i saw at the end of the room behind the platform a special partit hurriedli put up behind which all these lawyer were admit and thei thought themselv lucki to have stand room there for all chair had been remov for the sake of space and the crowd behind the partit stood throughout the case close pack shoulder to shoulder some of the ladi especi those who came from a distanc made their appear in the galleri veri smartli dress but the major of the ladi were oblivi even of dress their face betrai hyster intens almost morbid curios a peculiar fact establish afterward by mani observ wa that almost all the ladi or at least the vast major of them were on mitya s side and in favor of hi be acquit thi wa perhap chiefli ow to hi reput as a conqueror of femal heart it wa known that two women rival were to appear in the case on of them katerina ivanovna wa an object of gener interest all sort of extraordinari tale were told about her amaz anecdot of her passion for mitya in spite of hi crime her pride and aristocrat connect were particularli insist upon she had call upon scarc ani on in the town peopl said she intend to petit the govern for leav to accompani the crimin to siberia and to be marri to him somewher in the mine the appear of grushenka in court wa await with no less impati the public wa look forward with anxiou curios to the meet of the two rival the proud aristocrat girl and the hetaira but grushenka wa a more familiar figur to the ladi of the district than katerina ivanovna thei had alreadi seen the woman who had ruin fyodor pavlovitch and hi unhappi son and all almost without except wonder how father and son could be so in love with such a veri common ordinari russian girl who wa not even pretti in brief there wa a great deal of talk i know for a fact that there were sever seriou famili quarrel on mitya s account in our town mani ladi quarrel violent with their husband over differ of opinion about the dread case and it wa onli natur that the husband of these ladi far from be favor dispos to the prison should enter the court bitterli prejud against him in fact on mai sai pretti certainli that the masculin as distinguish from the feminin part of the audienc were bias against the prison there were number of sever frown even vindict face mitya inde had manag to offend mani peopl dure hi stai in the town some of the visitor were of cours in excel spirit and quit unconcern as to the fate of mitya person but all were interest in the trial and the major of the men were certainli hope for the convict of the crimin except perhap the lawyer who were more interest in the legal than in the moral aspect of the case everybodi wa excit at the presenc of the celebr lawyer fetyukovitch hi talent wa well known and thi wa not the first time he had defend notori crimin case in the provinc and if he defend them such case becam celebr and long rememb all over russia there were stori too about our prosecutor and about the presid of the court it wa said that ippolit kirillovitch wa in a tremor at meet fetyukovitch and that thei had been enemi from the begin of their career in petersburg that though our sensit prosecutor who alwai consid that he had been aggriev by some on in petersburg becaus hi talent had not been properli appreci wa keenli excit over the karamazov case and wa even dream of rebuild hi flag fortun by mean of it fetyukovitch thei said wa hi on anxieti but these rumor were not quit just our prosecutor wa not on of those men who lose heart in face of danger on the contrari hi self confid increas with the increas of danger it must be note that our prosecutor wa in gener too hasti and morbidli impression he would put hi whole soul into some case and work at it as though hi whole fate and hi whole fortun depend on it result thi wa the subject of some ridicul in the legal world for just by thi characterist our prosecutor had gain a wider notorieti than could have been expect from hi modest posit peopl laugh particularli at hi passion for psycholog in my opinion thei were wrong and our prosecutor wa i believ a charact of greater depth than wa gener suppos but with hi delic health he had fail to make hi mark at the outset of hi career and had never made up for it later as for the presid of our court i can onli sai that he wa a human and cultur man who had a practic knowledg of hi work and progress view he wa rather ambiti but did not concern himself greatli about hi futur career the great aim of hi life wa to be a man of advanc idea he wa too a man of connect and properti he felt as we learnt afterward rather strongli about the karamazov case but from a social not from a person standpoint he wa interest in it as a social phenomenon in it classif and it charact as a product of our social condit as typic of the nation charact and so on and so on hi attitud to the person aspect of the case to it tragic signific and the person involv in it includ the prison wa rather indiffer and abstract as wa perhap fit inde the court wa pack and overflow long befor the judg made their appear our court is the best hall in the town spaciou lofti and good for sound on the right of the judg who were on a rais platform a tabl and two row of chair had been put readi for the juri on the left wa the place for the prison and the counsel for the defens in the middl of the court near the judg wa a tabl with the materi proof on it lai fyodor pavlovitch s white silk dress gown stain with blood the fatal brass pestl with which the suppos murder had been commit mitya s shirt with a blood stain sleev hi coat stain with blood in patch over the pocket in which he had put hi handkerchief the handkerchief itself stiff with blood and by now quit yellow the pistol load by mitya at perhotin s with a view to suicid and taken from him on the sly at mokro by trifon borissovitch the envelop in which the three thousand roubl had been put readi for grushenka the narrow pink ribbon with which it had been ti and mani other articl i don t rememb in the bodi of the hall at some distanc came the seat for the public but in front of the balustrad a few chair had been place for wit who remain in the court after give their evid at ten o clock the three judg arriv the presid on honorari justic of the peac and on other the prosecutor of cours enter immedi after the presid wa a short stout thick set man of fifti with a dyspept complexion dark hair turn grai and cut short and a red ribbon of what order i don t rememb the prosecutor struck me and the other too as look particularli pale almost green hi face seem to have grown suddenli thinner perhap in a singl night for i had seen him look as usual onli two dai befor the presid began with ask the court whether all the juri were present but i see i can t go on like thi partli becaus some thing i did not hear other i did not notic and other i have forgotten but most of all becaus as i have said befor i have liter no time or space to mention everyth that wa said and done i onli know that neither side object to veri mani of the jurymen i rememb the twelv jurymen four were petti offici of the town two were merchant and six peasant and artisan of the town i rememb long befor the trial question were continu ask with some surpris especi by ladi can such a delic complex and psycholog case be submit for decis to petti offici and even peasant and what can an offici still more a peasant understand in such an affair all the four offici in the juri were in fact men of no consequ and of low rank except on who wa rather younger thei were grai head men littl known in societi who had veget on a piti salari and who probabl had elderli unpresent wive and crowd of children perhap even without shoe and stock at most thei spent their leisur over card and of cours had never read a singl book the two merchant look respect but were strang silent and stolid on of them wa close shaven and wa dress in european style the other had a small grai beard and wore a red ribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on hi neck there is no need to speak of the artisan and the peasant the artisan of skotoprigonyevsk ar almost peasant and even work on the land two of them also wore european dress and perhap for that reason were dirtier and more uninvit look than the other so that on might well wonder as i did as soon as i had look at them what men like that could possibl make of such a case yet their face made a strang impos almost menac impress thei were stern and frown at last the presid open the case of the murder of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov i don t quit rememb how he describ him the court usher wa told to bring in the prison and mitya made hi appear there wa a hush through the court on could have heard a fly i don t know how it wa with other but mitya made a most unfavor impress on me he look an aw dandi in a brand new frock coat i heard afterward that he had order it in moscow expressli for the occas from hi own tailor who had hi measur he wore immacul black kid glove and exquisit linen he walk in with hi yard long stride look stiffli straight in front of him and sat down in hi place with a most unperturb air at the same moment the counsel for defens the celebr fetyukovitch enter and a sort of subdu hum pass through the court he wa a tall spare man with long thin leg with extrem long thin pale finger clean shaven face demur brush rather short hair and thin lip that were at time curv into someth between a sneer and a smile he look about forti hi face would have been pleasant if it had not been for hi ey which in themselv small and inexpress were set remark close togeth with onli the thin long nose as a divid line between them in fact there wa someth strikingli birdlik about hi face he wa in even dress and white tie i rememb the presid s first question to mitya about hi name hi call and so on mitya answer sharpli and hi voic wa so unexpectedli loud that it made the presid start and look at the prison with surpris then follow a list of person who were to take part in the proceed that is of the wit and expert it wa a long list four of the wit were not present mi sov who had given evid at the preliminari inquiri but wa now in pari madam hohlakov and maximov who were absent through ill and smerdyakov through hi sudden death of which an offici statement from the polic wa present the new of smerdyakov s death produc a sudden stir and whisper in the court mani of the audienc of cours had not heard of the sudden suicid what struck peopl most wa mitya s sudden outburst as soon as the statement of smerdyakov s death wa made he cri out aloud from hi place he wa a dog and di like a dog i rememb how hi counsel rush to him and how the presid address him threaten to take stern measur if such an irregular were repeat mitya nod and in a subdu voic repeat sever time abruptli to hi counsel with no show of regret i won t again i won t it escap me i won t do it again and of cours thi brief episod did him no good with the juri or the public hi charact wa displai and it spoke for itself it wa under the influenc of thi incid that the open statement wa read it wa rather short but circumstanti it onli state the chief reason why he had been arrest why he must be tri and so on yet it made a great impress on me the clerk read it loudli and distinctli the whole tragedi wa suddenli unfold befor us concentr in bold relief in a fatal and pitiless light i rememb how immedi after it had been read the presid ask mitya in a loud impress voic prison do you plead guilti mitya suddenli rose from hi seat i plead guilti to drunken and dissip he exclaim again in a startl almost frenzi voic to idl and debaucheri i meant to becom an honest man for good just at the moment when i wa struck down by fate but i am not guilti of the death of that old man my enemi and my father no no i am not guilti of rob him i could not be dmitri karamazov is a scoundrel but not a thief he sat down again visibl trembl all over the presid again briefli but impress admonish him to answer onli what wa ask and not to go off into irrelev exclam then he order the case to proce all the wit were led up to take the oath then i saw them all togeth the brother of the prison were howev allow to give evid without take the oath after an exhort from the priest and the presid the wit were led awai and were made to sit as far as possibl apart from on anoth then thei began call them up on by on chapter ii danger wit i do not know whether the wit for the defens and for the prosecut were separ into group by the presid and whether it wa arrang to call them in a certain order but no doubt it wa so i onli know that the wit for the prosecut were call first i repeat i don t intend to describ all the question step by step besid my account would be to some extent superflu becaus in the speech for the prosecut and for the defens the whole cours of the evid wa brought togeth and set in a strong and signific light and i took down part of those two remark speech in full and will quot them in due cours togeth with on extraordinari and quit unexpect episod which occur befor the final speech and undoubtedli influenc the sinist and fatal outcom of the trial i will onli observ that from the first moment of the trial on peculiar characterist of the case wa conspicu and observ by all that is the overwhelm strength of the prosecut as compar with the argument the defens had to reli upon everi on realiz it from the first moment that the fact began to group themselv round a singl point and the whole horribl and bloodi crime wa gradual reveal everi on perhap felt from the first that the case wa beyond disput that there wa no doubt about it that there could be realli no discuss and that the defens wa onli a matter of form and that the prison wa guilti obvious and conclus guilti i imagin that even the ladi who were so impati long for the acquitt of the interest prison were at the same time without except convinc of hi guilt what s more i believ thei would have been mortifi if hi guilt had not been so firmli establish as that would have lessen the effect of the close scene of the crimin s acquitt that he would be acquit all the ladi strang to sai were firmli persuad up to the veri last moment he is guilti but he will be acquit from motiv of human in accord with the new idea the new sentiment that had come into fashion and so on and so on and that wa why thei had crowd into the court so impati the men were more interest in the contest between the prosecutor and the famou fetyukovitch all were wonder and ask themselv what could even a talent like fetyukovitch s make of such a desper case and so thei follow hi achiev step by step with concentr attent but fetyukovitch remain an enigma to all up to the veri end up to hi speech person of experi suspect that he had some design that he wa work toward some object but it wa almost imposs to guess what it wa hi confid and self relianc were unmistak howev everi on notic with pleasur moreov that he after so short a stai not more than three dai perhap among us had so wonderfulli succeed in master the case and had studi it to a niceti peopl describ with relish afterward how cleverli he had taken down all the wit for the prosecut and as far as possibl perplex them and what s more had aspers their reput and so depreci the valu of their evid but it wa suppos that he did thi rather by wai of sport so to speak for profession glori to show noth had been omit of the accept method for all were convinc that he could do no real good by such disparag of the wit and probabl wa more awar of thi than ani on have some idea of hi own in the background some conceal weapon of defens which he would suddenli reveal when the time came but meanwhil consciou of hi strength he seem to be divert himself so for instanc when grigori fyodor pavlovitch s old servant who had given the most damn piec of evid about the open door wa examin the counsel for the defens posit fasten upon him when hi turn came to question him it must be note that grigori enter the hall with a compos and almost state air not the least disconcert by the majesti of the court or the vast audienc listen to him he gave evid with as much confid as though he had been talk with hi marfa onli perhap more respectfulli it wa imposs to make him contradict himself the prosecutor question him first in detail about the famili life of the karamazov the famili pictur stood out in lurid color it wa plain to ear and ey that the wit wa guileless and imparti in spite of hi profound rever for the memori of hi deceas master he yet bore wit that he had been unjust to mitya and hadn t brought up hi children as he should he d have been devour by lice when he wa littl if it hadn t been for me he ad describ mitya s earli childhood it wasn t fair either of the father to wrong hi son over hi mother s properti which wa by right hi in repli to the prosecutor s question what ground he had for assert that fyodor pavlovitch had wrong hi son in their monei relat grigori to the surpris of everi on had no proof at all to bring forward but he still persist that the arrang with the son wa unfair and that he ought to have paid him sever thousand roubl more i must note by the wai that the prosecutor ask thi question whether fyodor pavlovitch had realli kept back part of mitya s inherit with mark persist of all the wit who could be ask it not except alyosha and ivan but he obtain no exact inform from ani on all alleg that it wa so but were unabl to bring forward ani distinct proof grigori s descript of the scene at the dinner tabl when dmitri had burst in and beaten hi father threaten to come back to kill him made a sinist impress on the court especi as the old servant s composur in tell it hi parsimoni of word and peculiar phraseolog were as effect as eloqu he observ that he wa not angri with mitya for have knock him down and struck him on the face he had forgiven him long ago he said of the deceas smerdyakov he observ cross himself that he wa a lad of abil but stupid and afflict and wors still an infidel and that it wa fyodor pavlovitch and hi elder son who had taught him to be so but he defend smerdyakov s honesti almost with warmth and relat how smerdyakov had onc found the master s monei in the yard and instead of conceal it had taken it to hi master who had reward him with a gold piec for it and trust him implicitli from that time forward he maintain obstin that the door into the garden had been open but he wa ask so mani question that i can t recal them all at last the counsel for the defens began to cross examin him and the first question he ask wa about the envelop in which fyodor pavlovitch wa suppos to have put three thousand roubl for a certain person have you ever seen it you who were for so mani year in close attend on your master grigori answer that he had not seen it and had never heard of the monei from ani on till everybodi wa talk about it thi question about the envelop fetyukovitch put to everi on who could conceiv have known of it as persist as the prosecutor ask hi question about dmitri s inherit and got the same answer from all that no on had seen the envelop though mani had heard of it from the begin everi on notic fetyukovitch s persist on thi subject now with your permiss i ll ask you a question fetyukovitch said suddenli and unexpectedli of what wa that balsam or rather decoct made which as we learn from the preliminari inquiri you us on that even to rub your lumbago in the hope of cure it grigori look blankli at the question and after a brief silenc mutter there wa saffron in it noth but saffron don t you rememb ani other ingredi there wa milfoil in it too and pepper perhap fetyukovitch queri ye there wa pepper too etcetera and all dissolv in vodka in spirit there wa a faint sound of laughter in the court you see in spirit after rub your back i believ you drank what wa left in the bottl with a certain piou prayer onli known to your wife i did did you drink much roughli speak a wine glass or two it might have been a tumbler full a tumbler full even perhap a

mani finger you have on your hand i am a servant grigori said suddenli in a loud and distinct voic if my better think fit to make game of me it is my duti to suffer it fetyukovitch wa a littl taken aback and the presid interven remind him that he must ask more relev question fetyukovitch bow with digniti and said that he had no more question to ask of the wit the public and the juri of cours were left with a grain of doubt in their mind as to the evid of a man who might while undergo a certain cure have seen the gate of heaven and who did not even know what year he wa live in but befor grigori left the box anoth episod occur the presid turn to the prison ask him whether he had ani comment to make on the evid of the last wit except about the door all he ha said is true cri mitya in a

sop too what sop the presid ask sternli again oh pierrot my father fyodor pavlovitch the presid again and again warn mitya impress and veri sternli to be more care in hi languag you ar injur yourself in the opinion of your judg the counsel for the defens wa equal clever in deal with the evid of rakitin i mai remark that rakitin wa on of the lead wit and on to whom the prosecutor attach great signific it appear that he knew everyth hi knowledg wa amaz he had been everywher seen everyth talk to everybodi knew everi detail of the biographi of fyodor pavlovitch and all the karamazov of the envelop it is true he had onli heard from mitya himself but he describ minut mitya s exploit in the metropoli all hi compromis do and sai and told the stori of captain snegiryov s wisp of tow but even rakitin could sai noth posit about mitya s inherit and confin himself to contemptu gener who could tell which of them wa to blame and which wa in debt to the other with their crazi karamazov wai of muddl thing so that no on could make head or tail of it he attribut the tragic crime to the habit that had becom ingrain by ag of serfdom and the distress condit of russia due to the lack of appropri institut he wa in fact allow some latitud of speech thi wa the first occas on which rakitin show what he could do and attract notic the prosecutor knew that the wit wa prepar a magazin articl on the case and afterward in hi speech as we shall see later quot some idea from the articl show that he had seen it alreadi the pictur drawn by the wit wa a gloomi and sinist on and greatli strengthen the case for the prosecut altogeth rakitin s discours fascin the public by it independ and the extraordinari nobil of it idea there were even two or three outbreak of applaus when he spoke of serfdom and the distress condit of russia but rakitin in hi youth ardor made a slight blunder of which the counsel for the defens at onc adroitli took advantag answer certain question about grushenka and carri awai by the lofti of hi own sentiment and hi success of which he wa of cours consciou he went so far as to speak somewhat contemptu of agrafena alexandrovna as the kept mistress of samsonov he would have given a good deal to take back hi word afterward for fetyukovitch caught him out over it at onc and it wa all becaus rakitin had not reckon on the lawyer have been abl to becom so intim acquaint with everi detail in so short a time allow me to ask began the counsel for the defens with the most affabl and even respect smile you ar of cours the same mr rakitin whose pamphlet the life of the deceas elder father zossima publish by the diocesan author full of profound and religi reflect and preced by an excel and devout dedic to the bishop i have just read with such pleasur i did not write it for public it wa publish afterward mutter rakitin for some reason fearfulli disconcert and almost asham oh that s excel a thinker like you can and inde ought to take the widest view of everi social question your most instruct pamphlet ha been wide circul through the patronag of the bishop and ha been of appreci servic but thi is the chief thing i should like to learn from you you state just now that you were veri intim acquaint with madam svyetlov it must be note that grushenka s surnam wa svyetlov i heard it for the first time that dai dure the case i cannot answer for all my acquaint i am a young man and who can be respons for everi on he meet cri rakitin flush all over i understand i quit understand cri fetyukovitch as though he too were embarrass and in hast to excus himself you like ani other might well be interest in an acquaint with a young and beauti woman who would readili entertain the lite of the youth of the neighborhood but i onli want to know it ha come to my knowledg that madam svyetlov wa particularli anxiou a coupl of month ago to make the acquaint of the younger karamazov alexei fyodorovitch and promis you twenti five roubl if you would bring him to her in hi monast dress and that actual took place on the even of the dai on which the terribl crime which is the subject of the present investig wa commit you brought alexei karamazov to madam svyetlov and did you receiv the twenti five roubl from madam svyetlov as a reward that s what i want to hear from you it wa a joke i don t see of what interest that can be to you i took it for a joke mean to give it back later then you did take but you have not given it back yet or have you that s of no consequ mutter rakitin i refus to answer such question of cours i shall give it back the presid interven but fetyukovitch declar he had no more question to ask of the wit mr rakitin left the wit box not absolut without a stain upon hi charact the effect left by the lofti ideal of hi speech wa somewhat mar and fetyukovitch s express as he watch him walk awai seem to suggest to the public thi is a specimen of the lofti mind person who accus him i rememb that thi incid too did not pass off without an outbreak from mitya enrag by the tone in which rakitin had refer to grushenka he suddenli shout bernard when after rakitin s cross examin the presid ask the prison if he had anyth to sai mitya cri loudli sinc i ve been arrest he ha borrow monei from me he is a contempt bernard and opportunist and he doesn t believ in god he took the bishop in mitya of cours wa pull up again for the intemper of hi languag but rakitin wa done for captain snegiryov s evid wa a failur too but from quit a differ reason he appear in rag and dirti cloth muddi boot and in spite of the vigil and expert observ of the polic offic he turn out to be hopelessli drunk on be ask about mitya s attack upon him he refus to answer god bless him ilusha told me not to god will make it up to me yonder who told you not to tell of whom ar you talk ilusha my littl son father father how he insult you he said that at the stone now he is dy the captain suddenli began sob and plump down on hi knee befor the presid he wa hurriedli led awai amidst the laughter of the public the effect prepar by the prosecutor did not come off at all fetyukovitch went on make the most of everi opportun and amaz peopl more and more by hi minut knowledg of the case thu for exampl trifon borissovitch made a great impress of cours veri prejudici to mitya he calcul almost on hi finger that on hi first visit to mokro mitya must have spent three thousand roubl or veri littl less just think what he squander on those gypsi girl alon and as for our lousi peasant it wasn t a case of fling half a roubl in the street he made them present of twenti five roubl each at least he didn t give them less and what a lot of monei wa simpli stolen from him and if ani on did steal he did not leav a receipt how could on catch the thief when he wa fling hi monei awai all the time our peasant ar robber you know thei have no care for their soul and the wai he went on with the girl our villag girl thei re complet set up sinc then i tell you thei us to be poor he recal in fact everi item of expens and ad it all up so the theori that onli fifteen hundr had been spent and the rest had been put asid in a littl bag seem inconceiv i saw three thousand as clear as a penni in hi hand i saw it with my own ey i should think i ought to know how to reckon monei cri trifon borissovitch do hi best to satisfi hi better when fetyukovitch had to cross examin him he scarc tri to refut hi evid but began ask him about an incid at the first carous at mokro a month befor the arrest when timofei and anoth peasant call akim had pick up on the floor in the passag a hundr roubl drop by mitya when he wa drunk and had given them to trifon borissovitch and receiv a roubl each from him for do so well ask the lawyer did you give that hundr roubl back to mr karamazov trifon borissovitch shuffl in vain he wa oblig after the peasant had been examin to admit the find of the hundr roubl onli ad that he had religi return it all to dmitri fyodorovitch in perfect honesti and it s onli becaus hi honor wa in liquor at the time he wouldn t rememb it but as he had deni the incid of the hundr roubl till the peasant had been call to prove it hi evid as to return the monei to mitya wa natur regard with great suspicion so on of the most danger wit brought forward by the prosecut wa again discredit the same thing happen with the pole thei took up an attitud of pride and independ thei vocifer loudli that thei had both been in the servic of the crown and that pan mitya had offer them three thousand to bui their honor and that thei had seen a larg sum of monei in hi hand pan mussyalovitch introduc a terribl number of polish word into hi sentenc and see that thi onli increas hi consequ in the ey of the presid and the prosecutor grew more and more pompou and end by talk in polish altogeth but fetyukovitch caught them too in hi snare trifon borissovitch recal wa forc in spite of hi evas to admit that pan vrublevski had substitut anoth pack of card for the on he had provid and that pan mussyalovitch had cheat dure the game kalganov confirm thi and both the pole left the wit box with damag reput amidst laughter from the public then exactli the same thing happen with almost all the most danger wit fetyukovitch succeed in cast a slur on all of them and dismiss them with a certain deris the lawyer and expert were lost in admir and were onli at a loss to understand what good purpos could be serv by it for all i repeat felt that the case for the prosecut could not be refut but wa grow more and more tragic overwhelm but from the confid of the great magician thei saw that he wa seren and thei wait feel that such a man had not come from petersburg for noth and that he wa not a man to return unsuccess chapter iii the medic expert and a pound of nut the evid of the medic expert too wa of littl us to the prison and it appear later that fetyukovitch had not reckon much upon it the medic line of defens had onli been taken up through the insist of katerina ivanovna who had sent for a celebr doctor from moscow on purpos the case for the defens could of cours lose noth by it and might with luck gain someth from it there wa howev an element of comedi about it through the differ of opinion of the doctor the medic expert were the famou doctor from moscow our doctor herzenstub and the young doctor varvinski the two latter appear also as wit for the prosecut the first to be call in the capac of expert wa doctor herzenstub he wa a grai and bald old man of seventi of middl height and sturdi build he wa much esteem and respect by everi on in the town he wa a conscienti doctor and an excel and piou man a herngut or moravian brother i am not quit sure which he had been live amongst us for mani year and behav with wonder digniti he wa a kind heart and human man he treat the sick poor and peasant for noth visit them in their slum and hut and left monei for medicin but he wa as obstin as a mule if onc he had taken an idea into hi head there wa no shake it almost everi on in the town wa awar by the wai that the famou doctor had within the first two or three dai of hi presenc among us utter some extrem offens allus to doctor herzenstub s qualif though the moscow doctor ask twenti five roubl for a visit sever peopl in the town were glad to take advantag of hi arriv and rush to consult him regardless of expens all these had of cours been previous patient of doctor herzenstub and the celebr doctor had critic hi treatment with extrem harsh final he had ask the patient as soon as he saw them well who ha been cram you with nostrum herzenstub he he doctor herzenstub of cours heard all thi and now all the three doctor made their appear on after anoth to be examin doctor herzenstub roundli declar that the abnorm of the prison s mental faculti wa self evid then give hi ground for thi opinion which i omit here he ad that the abnorm wa not onli evid in mani of the prison s action in the past but wa appar even now at thi veri moment when he wa ask to explain how it wa appar now at thi moment the old doctor with simpl heart direct point out that the prison on enter the court had an extraordinari air remark in the circumst that he had march in like a soldier look straight befor him though it would have been more natur for him to look to the left where among the public the ladi were sit see that he wa a great admir of the fair sex and must be think much of what the ladi ar sai of him now the old man conclud in hi peculiar languag i must add that he spoke russian readili but everi phrase wa form in german style which did not howev troubl him for it had alwai been a weak of hi to believ that he spoke russian perfectli better inde than russian and he wa veri fond of us russian proverb alwai declar that the russian proverb were the best and most express sai in the whole world i mai remark too that in convers through absent minded he often forgot the most ordinari word which sometim went out of hi head though he knew them perfectli the same thing happen though when he spoke german and at such time he alwai wave hi hand befor hi face as though try to catch the lost word and no on could induc him to go on speak till he had found the miss word hi remark that the prison ought to have look at the ladi on enter rous a whisper of amus in the audienc all our ladi were veri fond of our old doctor thei knew too that have been all hi life a bachelor and a religi man of exemplari conduct he look upon women as lofti creatur and so hi unexpect observ struck everi on as veri queer the moscow doctor be question in hi turn definit and emphat repeat that he consid the prison s mental condit abnorm in the highest degre he talk at length and with erudit of aberr and mania and argu that from all the fact collect the prison had undoubtedli been in a condit of aberr for sever dai befor hi arrest and if the crime had been commit by him it must even if he were consciou of it have been almost involuntari as he had not the power to control the morbid impuls that possess him but apart from temporari aberr the doctor diagnos mania which premis in hi word to lead to complet insan in the futur it must be note that i report thi in my own word the doctor made us of veri learn and profession languag all hi action ar in contravent of common sens and logic he continu not to refer to what i have not seen that is the crime itself and the whole catastroph the dai befor yesterdai while he wa talk to me he had an unaccount fix look in hi ey he laugh unexpectedli when there wa noth to laugh at he show continu and inexplic irrit us strang word bernard ethic and other equal inappropri but the doctor detect mania abov all in the fact that the prison could not even speak of the three thousand roubl of which he consid himself to have been cheat without extraordinari irrit though he could speak compar lightli of other misfortun and grievanc accord to all account he had even in the past whenev the subject of the three thousand roubl wa touch on flown into a perfect frenzi and yet he wa report to be a disinterest and not grasp man as to the opinion of my learn colleagu the moscow doctor ad iron in conclus that the prison would on enter the court have natur look at the ladi and not straight befor him i will onli sai that apart from the play of thi theori it is radic unsound for though i fulli agre that the prison on enter the court where hi fate will be decid would not natur look straight befor him in that fix wai and that that mai realli be a sign of hi abnorm mental condit at the same time i maintain that he would natur not look to the left at the ladi but on the contrari to the right to find hi legal advis on whose help all hi hope rest and on whose defens all hi futur depend the doctor express hi opinion posit and emphat but the unexpect pronounc of doctor varvinski gave the last touch of comedi to the differ of opinion between the expert in hi opinion the prison wa now and had been all along in a perfectli normal condit and although he certainli must have been in a nervou and exceedingli excit state befor hi arrest thi might have been due to sever perfectli obviou caus jealousi anger continu drunken and so on but thi nervou condit would not involv the mental aberr of which mention had just been made as to the question whether the prison should have look to the left or to the right on enter the court in hi modest opinion the prison would natur look straight befor him on enter the court as he had in fact done as that wa where the judg on whom hi fate depend were sit so that it wa just by look straight befor him that he show hi perfectli normal state of mind at the present the young doctor conclud hi modest testimoni with some heat bravo doctor cri mitya from hi seat just so mitya of cours wa check but the young doctor s opinion had a decis influenc on the judg and on the public and as appear afterward everi on agre with him but doctor herzenstub when call as a wit wa quit unexpectedli of us to mitya as an old resid in the town who had known the karamazov famili for year he furnish some fact of great valu for the prosecut and suddenli as though recal someth he ad but the poor young man might have had a veri differ life for he had a good heart both in childhood and after childhood that i know but the russian proverb sai if a man ha on head it s good but if anoth clever man come to visit him it would be better still for then there will be two head and not onli on on head is good but two ar better the prosecutor put in impati he knew the old man s habit of talk slowli and deliber regardless of the impress he wa make and of the delai he wa caus and highli prize hi flat dull and alwai gleefulli complac german wit the old man wa fond of make joke oh ye that s what i sai he went on stubbornli on head is good but two ar much better but he did not meet anoth head with wit and hi wit went where did thei go i ve forgotten the word he went on pass hi hand befor hi ey oh ye spazieren wander oh ye wander that s what i sai well hi wit went wander and fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself and yet he wa a grate and sensit boi oh i rememb him veri well a littl chap so high left neglect by hi father in the back yard when he ran about without boot on hi feet and hi littl breech hang by on button a note of feel and tender suddenli came into the honest old man s voic fetyukovitch posit start as though scent someth and caught at it instantli oh ye i wa a young man then i wa well i wa forti five then and had onli just come here and i wa so sorri for the boi then i ask myself why shouldn t i bui him a pound of a pound of what i ve forgotten what it s call a pound of what children ar veri fond of what is it what is it the doctor began wave hi hand again it grow on a tree and is gather and given to everi on appl oh no no you have a dozen of appl not a pound no there ar a lot of them and all littl you put them in the mouth and crack nut quit so nut i sai so the doctor repeat in the calmest wai as though he had been at no loss for a word and i bought him a pound of nut for no on had ever bought the boi a pound of nut befor and i lift my finger and said to him boi gott der vater he laugh and said gott der vater gott der sohn he laugh again and lisp gott der sohn gott der heilig geist then he laugh and said as best he could gott der heilig geist i went awai and two dai after i happen to be pass and he shout to me of himself uncl gott der vater gott der sohn and he had onli forgotten gott der heilig geist but i remind him of it and i felt veri sorri for him again but he wa taken awai and i did not see him again twenti three year pass i am sit on morn in my studi a white hair old man when there walk into the room a bloom young man whom i should never have recogn but he held up hi finger and said laugh gott der vater gott der sohn and gott der heilig geist i have just arriv and have come to thank you for that pound of nut for no on els ever bought me a pound of nut you ar the onli on that ever did and then i rememb my happi youth and the poor child in the yard without boot on hi feet and my heart wa touch and i said you ar a grate young man for you have rememb all your life the pound of nut i bought you in your childhood and i embrac him and bless him and i shed tear he laugh but he shed tear too for the russian often laugh when he ought to be weep but he did weep i saw it and now ala and i am weep now german i am weep now too you saintli man mitya cri suddenli in ani case the anecdot made a certain favor impress on the public but the chief sensat in mitya s favor wa creat by the evid of katerina ivanovna which i will describ directli inde when the wit d charg that is call by the defens began give evid fortun seem all at onc markedli more favor to mitya and what wa particularli strike thi wa a surpris even to the counsel for the defens but befor katerina ivanovna wa call alyosha wa examin and he recal a fact which seem to furnish posit evid against on import point made by the prosecut chapter iv fortun smile on mitya it came quit as a surpris even to alyosha himself he wa not requir to take the oath and i rememb that both side address him veri gentli and sympathet it wa evid that hi reput for good had preced him alyosha gave hi evid modestli and with restraint but hi warm sympathi for hi unhappi brother wa unmistak in answer to on question he sketch hi brother s charact as that of a man violent temper perhap and carri awai by hi passion but at the same time honor proud and gener capabl of self sacrific if necessari he admit howev that through hi passion for grushenka and hi rivalri with hi father hi brother had been of late in an intoler posit but he repel with indign the suggest that hi brother might have commit a murder for the sake of gain though he recogn that the three thousand roubl had becom almost an obsess with mitya that he look upon them as part of the inherit he had been cheat of by hi father and that indiffer as he wa to monei as a rule he could not even speak of that three thousand without furi as for the rivalri of the two ladi as the prosecutor express it that is of grushenka and katya he answer evas and wa even unwil to answer on or two question altogeth did your brother tell you anywai that he intend to kill your father ask the prosecutor you can refus to answer if you think necessari he ad he did not tell me so directli answer alyosha how so did he indirectli he spoke to me onc of hi hatr for our father and hi fear that at an extrem moment at a moment of furi he might perhap murder him and you believ him i am afraid to sai that i did but i never doubt that some higher feel would alwai save him at the fatal moment as it ha inde save him for it wa not he kill my father alyosha said firmli in a loud voic that wa heard throughout the court the prosecutor start like a war hors at the sound of a trumpet let me assur you that i fulli believ in the complet sincer of your convict and do not explain it by or identifi it with your affect for your unhappi brother your peculiar view of the whole tragic episod is known to us alreadi from the preliminari investig i won t attempt to conceal from you that it is highli individu and contradict all the other evid collect by the prosecut and so i think it essenti to press you to tell me what fact have led you to thi convict of your brother s innoc and of the guilt of anoth person against whom you gave evid at the preliminari inquiri i onli answer the question ask me at the preliminari inquiri repli alyosha slowli and calmli i made no accus against smerdyakov of myself yet you gave evid against him i wa led to do so by my brother dmitri s word i wa told what took place at hi arrest and how he had point to smerdyakov befor i wa examin i believ absolut that my brother is innoc and if he didn t commit the murder then then smerdyakov why smerdyakov and why ar you so complet persuad of your brother s innoc i cannot help believ my brother i know he wouldn t lie to me i saw from hi face he wasn t ly onli from hi face is that all the proof you have i have no other proof and of smerdyakov s guilt you have no proof whatev but your brother s word and the express of hi face no i have no other proof the prosecutor drop the examin at thi point the impress left by alyosha s evid on the public wa most disappoint there had been talk about smerdyakov befor the trial some on had heard someth some on had point out someth els it wa said that alyosha had gather togeth some extraordinari proof of hi brother s innoc and smerdyakov s guilt and after all there wa noth no evid except certain moral convict so natur in a brother but fetyukovitch began hi cross examin on hi ask alyosha when it wa that the prison had told him of hi hatr for hi father and that he might kill him and whether he had heard it for instanc at their last meet befor the catastroph alyosha start as he answer as though onli just recollect and understand someth i rememb on circumst now which i d quit forgotten myself it wasn t clear to me at the time but now and obvious onli now for the first time struck by an idea he recount eagerli how at hi last interview with mitya that even under the tree on the road to the monasteri mitya had struck himself on the breast the upper part of the breast and had repeat sever time that he had a mean of regain hi honor that that mean wa here here on hi breast i thought when he struck himself on the breast he meant that it wa in hi heart alyosha continu that he might find in hi heart strength to save himself from some aw disgrac which wa await him and which he did not dare confess even to me i must confess i did think at the time that he wa speak of our father and that the disgrac he wa shudder at wa the thought of go to our father and do some violenc to him yet it wa just then that he point to someth on hi breast so that i rememb the idea struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of the breast but below and that he struck himself much too high just below the neck and kept point to that place my idea seem silli to me at the time but he wa perhap point then to that littl bag in which he had fifteen hundr roubl just so mitya cri from hi place that s right alyosha it wa the littl bag i struck with my fist fetyukovitch flew to him in hot hast entreat him to keep quiet and at the same instant pounc on alyosha alyosha carri awai himself by hi recollect warmli express hi theori that thi disgrac wa probabl just that fifteen hundr roubl on him which he might have return to katerina ivanovna as half of what he ow her but which he had yet determin not to repai her and to us for anoth purpos name to enabl him to elop with grushenka if she consent it is so it must be so exclaim alyosha in sudden excit my brother cri sever time that half of the disgrac half of it he said half sever time he could free himself from at onc but that he wa so unhappi in hi weak of will that he wouldn t do it that he knew beforehand he wa incap of do it and you clearli confid rememb that he struck himself just on thi part of the breast fetyukovitch ask eagerli clearli and confid for i thought at the time why doe he strike himself up there when the heart is lower down and the thought seem stupid to me at the time i rememb it seem stupid it flash through my mind that s what brought it back to me just now how could i have forgotten it till now it wa that littl bag he meant when he said he had the mean but wouldn t give back that fifteen hundr and when he wa arrest at mokro he cri out i know i wa told it that he consid it the most disgrac act of hi life that when he had the mean of repai katerina ivanovna half half note what he ow her he yet could not bring himself to repai the monei and prefer to remain a thief in her ey rather than part with it and what tortur what tortur that debt ha been to him alyosha exclaim in conclus the prosecutor of cours interven he ask alyosha to describ onc more how it had all happen and sever time insist on the question had the prison seem to point to anyth perhap he had simpli struck himself with hi fist on the breast but it wa not with hi fist cri alyosha he point with hi finger and point here veri high up how could i have so complet forgotten it till thi moment the presid ask mitya what he had to sai to the last wit s evid mitya confirm it sai that he had been point to the fifteen hundr roubl which were on hi breast just below the neck and that that wa of cours the disgrac a disgrac i cannot deni the most shame act of my whole life cri mitya i might have repaid it and didn t repai it i prefer to remain a thief in her ey rather than give it back and the most shame part of it wa that i knew beforehand i shouldn t give it back you ar right alyosha thank alyosha so alyosha s cross examin end what wa import and strike about it wa that on fact at least had been found and even though thi were onli on tini bit of evid a mere hint at evid it did go some littl wai toward prove that the bag had exist and had contain fifteen hundr roubl and that the prison had not been ly at the preliminari inquiri when he alleg at mokro that those fifteen hundr roubl were hi own alyosha wa glad with a flush face he move awai to the seat assign to him he kept repeat to himself how wa it i forgot how could i have forgotten it and what made it come back to me now katerina ivanovna wa call to the wit box as she enter someth extraordinari happen in the court the ladi clutch their lorgnett and opera glass there wa a stir among the men some stood up to get a better view everybodi alleg afterward that mitya had turn white as a sheet on her entranc all in black she advanc modestli almost timidli it wa imposs to tell from her face that she wa agit but there wa a resolut gleam in her dark and gloomi ey i mai remark that mani peopl mention that she look particularli handsom at that moment she spoke softli but clearli so that she wa heard all over the court she express herself with composur or at least tri to appear compos the presid began hi examin discreetli and veri respectfulli as though afraid to touch on certain chord and show consider for her great unhappi but in answer to on of the first question katerina ivanovna repli firmli that she had been formerli betroth to the prison until he left me of hi own accord she ad quietli when thei ask her about the three thousand she had entrust to mitya to post to her relat she said firmli i didn t give him the monei simpli to send it off i felt at the time that he wa in great need of monei i gave him the three thousand on the understand that he should post it within the month if he care to there wa no need for him to worri himself about that debt afterward i will not repeat all the question ask her and all her answer in detail i will onli give the substanc of her evid i wa firmli convinc that he would send off that sum as soon as he got monei from hi father she went on i have never doubt hi disinterested and hi honesti hi scrupul honesti in monei matter he felt quit certain that he would receiv the monei from hi father and spoke to me sever time about it i knew he had a feud with hi father and have alwai believ that he had been unfairli treat by hi father i don t rememb ani threat utter by him against hi father he certainli never utter ani such threat befor me if he had come to me at that time i should have at onc reliev hi anxieti about that unlucki three thousand roubl but he had given up come to see me and i myself wa put in such a posit that i could not invit him and i had no right inde to be exact as to that monei she ad suddenli and there wa a ring of resolut in her voic i wa onc indebt to him for assist in monei for more than three thousand and i took it although i could not at that time forese that i should ever be in a posit to repai my debt there wa a note of defianc in her voic it wa then fetyukovitch began hi cross examin did that take place not here but at the begin of your acquaint fetyukovitch suggest cautious feel hi wai instantli scent someth favor i must mention in parenthesi that though fetyukovitch had been brought from petersburg partli at the instanc of katerina ivanovna herself he knew noth about the episod of the four thousand roubl given her by mitya and of her bow to the ground to him she conceal thi from him and said noth about it and that wa strang it mai be pretti certainli assum that she herself did not know till the veri last minut whether she would speak of that episod in the court and wait for the inspir of the moment no i can never forget those moment she began tell her stori she told everyth the whole episod that mitya had told alyosha and her bow to the ground and her reason she told about her father and her go to mitya and did not in on word in a singl hint suggest that mitya had himself through her sister propos thei should send him katerina ivanovna to fetch the monei she gener conceal that and wa not asham to make it appear as though she had of her own impuls run to the young offic reli on someth to beg him for the monei it wa someth tremend i turn cold and trembl as i listen the court wa hush try to catch each word it wa someth unexampl even from such a self will and contemptu proud girl as she wa such an extrem frank avow such sacrific such self immol seem incred and for what for whom to save the man who had deceiv and insult her and to help in howev small a degre in save him by creat a strong impress in hi favor and inde the figur of the young offic who with a respect bow to the innoc girl hand her hi last four thousand roubl all he had in the world wa thrown into a veri sympathet and attract light but i had a pain misgiv at heart i felt that calumni might come of it later and it did in fact it did it wa repeat all over the town afterward with spite laughter that the stori wa perhap not quit complet that is in the statement that the offic had let the young ladi depart with noth but a respect bow it wa hint that someth wa here omit and even if noth had been omit if thi were the whole stori the most highli respect of our ladi maintain even then it s veri doubt whether it wa credit for a young girl to behav in that wai even for the sake of save her father and can katerina ivanovna with her intellig her morbid sensit have fail to understand that peopl would talk like that she must have understood it yet she made up her mind to tell everyth of cours all these nasti littl suspicion as to the truth of her stori onli aros afterward and at the first moment all were deepli impress by it as for the judg and the lawyer thei listen in rever almost shame face silenc to katerina ivanovna the prosecutor did not ventur upon even on question on the subject fetyukovitch made a low bow to her oh he wa almost triumphant much ground had been gain for a man to give hi last four thousand on a gener impuls and then for the same man to murder hi father for the sake of rob him of three thousand the idea seem too incongru fetyukovitch felt that now the charg of theft at least wa as good as disprov the case wa thrown into quit a differ light there wa a wave of sympathi for mitya as for him i wa told that onc or twice while katerina ivanovna wa give her evid he jump up from hi seat sank back again and hid hi face in hi hand but when she had finish he suddenli cri in a sob voic katya why have you ruin me and hi sob were audibl all over the court but he instantli restrain himself and cri again now i am condemn then he sat rigid in hi place with hi teeth clench and hi arm across hi chest katerina ivanovna remain in the court and sat down in her place she wa pale and sat with her ey cast down those who were sit near her declar that for a long time she shiver all over as though in a fever grushenka wa call i am approach the sudden catastroph which wa perhap the final caus of mitya s ruin for i am convinc so is everi on all the lawyer said the same afterward that if the episod had not occur the prison would at least have been recommend to merci but of that later a few word first about grushenka she too wa dress entir in black with her magnific black shawl on her shoulder she walk to the wit box with her smooth noiseless tread with the slightli swai gait common in women of full figur she look steadili at the presid turn her ey neither to the right nor to the left to my think she look veri handsom at that moment and not at all pale as the ladi alleg afterward thei declar too that she had a concentr and spite express i believ that she wa simpli irrit and painfulli consciou of the contemptu and inquisit ey of our scandal love public she wa proud and could not stand contempt she wa on of those peopl who flare up angri and eager to retali at the mere suggest of contempt there wa an element of timid too of cours and inward shame at her own timid so it wa not strang that her tone kept chang at on moment it wa angri contemptu and rough and at anoth there wa a sincer note of self condemn sometim she spoke as though she were take a desper plung as though she felt i don t care what happen i ll sai it apropo of her acquaint with fyodor pavlovitch she remark curtli that s all nonsens and wa it my fault that he would pester me but a minut later she ad it wa all my fault i wa laugh at them both at the old man and at him too and i brought both of them to thi it wa all on account of me it happen samsonov s name came up somehow that

the prosecutor the lackei smerdyakov who murder hi master and hang himself last night she wa of cours at onc ask what ground she had for such a definit accus but it appear that she too had no ground for it dmitri fyodorovitch told me so himself you can believ him the woman who came between us ha ruin him she is the caus of it all let me tell you grushenka ad she seem to be quiver with hatr and there wa a vindict note in her voic she wa again ask to whom she wa refer the young ladi katerina ivanovna there she sent for me offer me chocol tri to fascin me there s not much true shame about her

can t help think that thei felt asham of take advantag of her hysteria and of listen to such avow i rememb hear them sai to her we understand how hard it is for you be sure we ar abl to feel for you and so on and so on and yet thei drag the evid out of the rave hyster woman she describ at last with extraordinari clear which is so often seen though onli for a moment in such over wrought state how ivan had been nearli driven out of hi mind dure the last two month try to save the monster and murder hi brother he tortur himself she exclaim he wa alwai try to minim hi brother s guilt and confess to me that he too had never love hi father and perhap desir hi death himself oh he ha a tender over tender conscienc he torment himself with hi conscienc he told me everyth everyth he came everi dai and talk to me as hi onli friend i have the honor to be hi onli friend she cri suddenli with a sort of defianc and her ey flash he had been twice to see smerdyakov on dai he came to me and said if it wa not my brother but smerdyakov commit the murder for the legend wa circul everywher that smerdyakov had done it perhap i too am guilti for smerdyakov knew i didn t like my father and perhap believ that i desir my father s death then i brought out that letter and show it him he wa entir convinc that hi brother had done it and he wa overwhelm by it he couldn t endur the thought that hi own

the doctor from moscow at my request examin him the dai befor yesterdai and told me that he wa on the ev of brain fever and all on hi account on account of thi monster and last night he learnt that smerdyakov wa dead it wa such a shock that it drove him out of hi mind and all through thi monster all for the sake of save the monster oh of cours such an outpour such an avow is onli possibl onc in a lifetim at the hour of death for instanc on the wai to the scaffold but it wa in katya s charact and it wa such a moment in her life it wa the same impetu katya who had thrown herself on the merci of a young proflig to save her father the same katya who had just befor in her pride and chastiti sacrif herself and her maidenli modesti befor all these peopl tell of mitya s gener conduct in the hope of soften hi fate a littl and now again she sacrif herself but thi time it wa for anoth and perhap onli now perhap onli at thi moment she felt and knew how dear that other wa to her she had sacrif herself in terror for him conceiv all of a sudden that he had ruin himself by hi confess that it wa he who had commit the murder not hi brother she had sacrif herself to save him to save hi good name hi reput and yet on terribl doubt occur to on wa she ly in her descript of her former relat with mitya that wa the question no she had not intention slander him when she cri that mitya despis her for her bow down to him she believ it herself she had been firmli convinc perhap ever sinc that bow that the simpl heart mitya who even then ador her wa laugh at her and despis her she had love him with an hyster lacer love onli from pride from wound pride and that love wa not like love but more like reveng oh perhap that lacer love would have grown into real love perhap katya long for noth more than that but mitya s faithless had wound her to the bottom of her heart and her heart could not forgiv him the moment of reveng had come upon her suddenli and all that had been accumul so long and so painfulli in the offend woman s breast burst out all at onc and unexpectedli she betrai mitya but she betrai herself too and no sooner had she given full express to her feel than the tension of cours wa over and she wa overwhelm with shame hyster began again she fell on the floor sob and scream she wa carri out at that moment grushenka with a wail rush toward mitya befor thei had time to prevent her mitya she wail your serpent ha destroi you there she ha shown you what she is she shout to the judg shake with anger at a signal from the presid thei seiz her and tri to remov her from the court she wouldn t allow it she fought and struggl to get back to mitya mitya utter a cry and struggl to get to her he wa overpow ye i think the ladi who came to see the spectacl must have been satisfi the show had been a vari on then i rememb the moscow doctor appear on the scene i believ the presid had previous sent the court usher to arrang for medic aid for ivan the doctor announc to the court that the sick man wa suffer from a danger attack of brain fever and that he must be at onc remov in answer to question from the prosecutor and the counsel for the defens he said that the patient had come to him of hi own accord the dai befor yesterdai and that he had warn him that he had such an attack come on but he had not consent to be look after he wa certainli not in a normal state of mind he told me himself that he saw vision when he wa awak that he met sever person in the street who were dead and that satan visit him everi even said the doctor in conclus have given hi evid the celebr doctor withdrew the letter produc by katerina ivanovna wa ad to the materi proof after some deliber the judg decid to proce with the trial and to enter both the unexpect piec of evid given by ivan and katerina ivanovna on the protocol but i will not detail the evid of the other wit who onli repeat and confirm what had been said befor though all with their characterist peculiar i repeat all wa brought togeth in the prosecutor s speech which i shall quot immedi everi on wa excit everi on wa electrifi by the late catastroph and all were await the speech for the prosecut and the defens with intens impati fetyukovitch wa obvious shaken by katerina ivanovna s evid but the prosecutor wa triumphant when all the evid had been taken the court wa adjourn for almost an hour i believ it wa just eight o clock when the presid return to hi seat and our prosecutor ippolit kirillovitch began hi speech chapter vi the prosecutor s speech sketch of charact ippolit kirillovitch began hi speech trembl with nervous with cold sweat on hi forehead feel hot and cold all over by turn he describ thi himself afterward he regard thi speech as hi chef d uvr the chef d uvr of hi whole life as hi swan song he di it is true nine month later of rapid consumpt so that he had the right as it turn out to compar himself to a swan sing hi last song he had put hi whole heart and all the brain he had into that speech and poor ippolit kirillovitch unexpectedli reveal that at least some feel for the public welfar and the etern question lai conceal in him where hi speech realli excel wa in it sincer he genuin believ in the prison s guilt he wa accus him not as an offici duti onli and in call for vengeanc he quiver with a genuin passion for the secur of societi even the ladi in the audienc though thei remain hostil to ippolit kirillovitch admit that he made an extraordinari impress on them he began in a break voic but it soon gain strength and fill the court to the end of hi speech but as soon as he had finish he almost faint gentlemen of the juri began the prosecutor thi case ha made a stir throughout russia but what is there to wonder at what is there so peculiarli horrifi in it for us we ar so accustom to such crime that s what s so horribl that such dark deed have ceas to horrifi us what ought to horrifi us is that we ar so accustom to it and not thi or that isol crime what ar the caus of our indiffer our lukewarm attitud to such deed to such sign of the time omin of an unenvi futur is it our cynic is it the prematur exhaust of intellect and imagin in a societi that is sink into decai in spite of it youth is it that our moral principl ar shatter to their foundat or is it perhap a complet lack of such principl among us i cannot answer such question nevertheless thei ar disturb and everi citizen not onli must but ought to be harass by them our newborn and still timid press ha done good servic to the public alreadi for without it we should never have heard of the horror of unbridl violenc and moral degrad which ar continu made known by the press not mere to those who attend the new juri court establish in the present reign but to everi on and what do we read almost daili of thing besid which the present case grow pale and seem almost commonplac but what is most import is that the major of our nation crime of violenc bear wit to a widespread evil now so gener among us that it is difficult to contend against it on dai we see a brilliant young offic of high societi at the veri outset of hi career in a cowardli underhand wai without a pang of conscienc murder an offici who had onc been hi benefactor and the servant girl to steal hi own iou and what readi monei he could find on him it will come in handi for my pleasur in the fashion world and for my career in the futur after murder them he put pillow under the head of each of hi victim he goe awai next a young hero decor for braveri kill the mother of hi chief and benefactor like a highwayman and to urg hi companion to join him he assert that she love him like a son and so will follow all hi direct and take no precaut grant that he is a monster yet i dare not sai in these dai that he is uniqu anoth man will not commit the murder but will feel and think like him and is as dishonor in soul in silenc alon with hi conscienc he ask himself perhap what is honor and isn t the condemn of bloodsh a prejudic perhap peopl will cry out against me that i am morbid hyster that it is a monstrou slander that i am exagger let them sai so and heaven i should be the first to rejoic if it were so oh don t believ me think of me as morbid but rememb my word if onli a tenth if onli a twentieth part of what i sai is true even so it s aw look how our young peopl commit suicid without ask themselv hamlet s question what there is beyond without a sign of such a question as though all that relat to the soul and to what await us beyond the grave had long been eras in their mind and buri under the sand look at our vice at our proflig fyodor pavlovitch the luckless victim in the present case wa almost an innoc babe compar with mani of them and yet we all knew him he live among us ye on dai perhap the lead intellect of russia and of europ will studi the psycholog of russian crime for the subject is worth it but thi studi will come later at leisur when all the tragic topsi turvydom of to dai is farther behind us so that it s possibl to examin it with more insight and more imparti than i can do now we ar either horrifi or pretend to be horrifi though we realli gloat over the spectacl and love strong and eccentr sensat which tickl our cynic pamper idl or like littl children we brush the dread ghost awai and hide our head in the pillow so as to return to our sport and merriment as soon as thei have vanish but we must on dai begin life in sober earnest we must look at ourselv as a societi it s time we tri to grasp someth of our social posit or at least to make a begin in that direct a great writer of the last epoch compar russia to a swift troika gallop to an unknown goal exclaim oh troika birdlik troika who invent thee and add in proud ecstasi that all the peopl of the world stand asid respectfulli to make wai for the recklessli gallop troika to pass that mai be thei mai stand asid respectfulli or no but in my poor opinion the great writer end hi book in thi wai either in an access of childish and na ve optim or simpli in fear of the censorship of the dai for if the troika were drawn by hi hero sobakevitch nozdryov tchitchikov it could reach no ration goal whoever might be drive it and those were the hero of an older gener our ar wors specimen still at thi point ippolit kirillovitch s speech wa interrupt by applaus the liber signific of thi simil wa appreci the applaus wa it s true of brief durat so that the presid did not think it necessari to caution the public and onli look sever in the direct of the offend but ippolit kirillovitch wa encourag he had never been applaud befor he had been all hi life unabl to get a hear and now he suddenli had an opportun of secur the ear of all russia what after all is thi karamazov famili which ha gain such an unenvi notorieti throughout russia he continu perhap i am exagger but it seem to me that certain fundament featur of the educ class of to dai ar reflect in thi famili pictur onli of cours in miniatur like the sun in a drop of water think of that unhappi viciou unbridl old man who ha met with such a melancholi end the head of a famili begin life of nobl birth but in a poor depend posit through an unexpect marriag he came into a small fortun a petti knave a toadi and buffoon of fairli good though undevelop intellig he wa abov all a moneylend who grew bolder with grow prosper hi abject and servil characterist disappear hi malici and sarcast cynic wa all that remain on the spiritu side he wa undevelop while hi vital wa excess he saw noth in life but sensual pleasur and he brought hi children up to be the same he had no feel for hi duti as a father he ridicul those duti he left hi littl children to the servant and wa glad to be rid of them forgot about them complet the old man s maxim wa apr s moi le d luge he wa an exampl of everyth that is oppos to civic duti of the most complet and malign individu the world mai burn for aught i care so long as i am all right and he wa all right he wa content he wa eager to go on live in the same wai for anoth twenti or thirti year he swindl hi own son and spent hi monei hi matern inherit on try to get hi mistress from him no i don t intend to leav the prison s defens altogeth to my talent colleagu from petersburg i will speak the truth myself i can well understand what resent he had heap up in hi son s heart against him but enough enough of that unhappi old man he ha paid the penalti let us rememb howev that he wa a father and on of the typic father of to dai am i unjust inde in sai that he is typic of mani modern father ala mani of them onli differ in not openli profess such cynic for thei ar better educ more cultur but their philosophi is essenti the same as hi perhap i am a pessimist but you have agre to forgiv me let us agre beforehand you need not believ me but let me speak let me sai what i have to sai and rememb someth of my word now for the children of thi father thi head of a famili on of them is the prison befor us all the rest of my speech will deal with him of the other two i will speak onli cursorili the elder is on of those modern young men of brilliant educ and vigor intellect who ha lost all faith in everyth he ha deni and reject much alreadi like hi father we have all heard him he wa a welcom guest in local societi he never conceal hi opinion quit the contrari in fact which justifi me in speak rather openli of him now of cours not as an individu but as a member of the karamazov famili anoth personag close connect with the case di here by hi own hand last night i mean an afflict idiot formerli the servant and possibl the illegitim son of fyodor pavlovitch smerdyakov at the preliminari inquiri he told me with hyster tear how the young ivan karamazov had horrifi him by hi spiritu audac everyth in the world is law accord to him and noth must be forbidden in the futur that is what he alwai taught me i believ that idiot wa driven out of hi mind by thi theori though of cours the epilept attack from which he suffer and thi terribl catastroph have help to unhing hi faculti but he drop on veri interest observ which would have done credit to a more intellig observ and that is inde why i ve mention it if there is on of the son that is like fyodor pavlovitch in charact it is ivan fyodorovitch with that remark i conclud my sketch of hi charact feel it indel to continu further oh i don t want to draw ani further conclus and croak like a raven over the young man s futur we ve seen to dai in thi court that there ar still good impuls in hi young heart that famili feel ha not been destroi in him by lack of faith and cynic which have come to him rather by inherit than by the exercis of independ thought then the third son oh he is a devout and modest youth who doe not share hi elder brother s gloomi and destruct theori of life he ha sought to cling to the idea of the peopl or to what goe by that name in some circl of our intellectu class he clung to the monasteri and wa within an ac of becom a monk he seem to me to have betrai unconsci and so earli that timid despair which lead so mani in our unhappi societi who dread cynic and it corrupt influenc and mistakenli attribut all the mischief to european enlighten to return to their nativ soil as thei sai to the bosom so to speak of their mother earth like frighten children yearn to fall asleep on the wither bosom of their decrepit mother and to sleep there for ever onli to escap the horror that terrifi them for my part i wish the excel and gift young man everi success i trust that hi youth ideal and impuls toward the idea of the peopl mai never degener as often happen on the moral side into gloomi mystic and on the polit into blind chauvin two element which ar even a greater menac to russia than the prematur decai due to misunderstand and gratuit adopt of european idea from which hi elder brother is suffer two or three peopl clap their hand at the mention of chauvin and mystic ippolit kirillovitch had been inde carri awai by hi own eloqu all thi had littl to do with the case in hand to sai noth of the fact of it be somewhat vagu but the sickli and consumpt man wa overcom by the desir to express himself onc in hi life peopl said afterward that he wa actuat by unworthi motiv in hi critic of ivan becaus the latter had on on or two occas got the better of him in argument and ippolit kirillovitch rememb it tri now to take hi reveng but i don t know whether it wa true all thi wa onli introductori howev and the speech pass to more direct consider of the case but to return to the eldest son ippolit kirillovitch went on he is the prison befor us we have hi life and hi action too befor us the fatal dai ha come and all ha been brought to the surfac while hi brother seem to stand for european and the principl of the peopl he seem to repres russia as she is oh not all russia not all god preserv us if it were yet here we have her our mother russia the veri scent and sound of her oh he is spontan he is a marvel mingl of good and evil he is a lover of cultur and schiller yet he brawl in tavern and pluck out the beard of hi boon companion oh he too can be good and nobl but onli when all goe well with him what is more he can be carri off hi feet posit carri off hi feet by nobl ideal but onli if thei come of themselv if thei fall from heaven for him if thei need not be paid for he dislik pai for anyth but is veri fond of receiv and that s so with him in everyth oh give him everi possibl good in life he couldn t be content with less and put no obstacl in hi wai and he will show that he too can be nobl he is not greedi no but he must have monei a great deal of monei and you will see how gener with what scorn of filthi lucr he will fling it all awai in the reckless dissip of on night but if he ha not monei he will show what he is readi to do to get it when he is in great need of it but all thi later let us take event in their chronolog order first we have befor us a poor abandon child run about the back yard without boot on hi feet as our worthi and esteem fellow citizen of foreign origin ala express it just now i repeat it again i yield to no on the defens of the crimin i am here to accus him but to defend him also ye i too am human i too can weigh the influenc of home and childhood on the charact but the boi grow up and becom an offic for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exil to on of the remot frontier town of russia there he led a wild life as an offic and of cours he need monei monei befor all thing and so after prolong disput he came to a settlement with hi father and the last six thousand wa sent him a letter is in exist in which he practic give up hi claim to the rest and settl hi conflict with hi father over the inherit on the payment of thi six thousand then came hi meet with a young girl of lofti charact and brilliant educ oh i do not ventur to repeat the detail you have onli just heard them honor self sacrific were shown there and i will be silent the figur of the young offic frivol and proflig do homag to true nobil and a lofti ideal wa shown in a veri sympathet light befor us but the other side of the medal wa unexpectedli turn to us immedi after in thi veri court again i will not ventur to conjectur why it happen so but there were caus the same ladi bath in tear of long conceal indign alleg that he he of all men had despis her for her action which though incauti reckless perhap wa still dictat by lofti and gener motiv he he the girl s betroth look at her with that smile of mockeri which wa more insuffer from him than from ani on and know that he had alreadi deceiv her he had deceiv her believ that she wa bound to endur everyth from him even treacheri she intention offer him three thousand roubl and clearli too clearli let him understand that she wa offer him monei to deceiv her well will you take it or not ar you so lost to shame wa the dumb question in her scrutin ey he look at her saw clearli what wa in her mind he s admit here befor you that he understood it all appropri that three thousand uncondition and squander it in two dai with the new object of hi affect what ar we to believ then the first legend of the young offic sacrif hi last farth in a nobl impuls of generos and do rever to virtu or thi other revolt pictur as a rule between two extrem on ha to find the mean but in the present case thi is not true the probabl is that in the first case he wa genuin nobl and in the second as genuin base and why becaus he wa of the broad karamazov charact that s just what i am lead up to capabl of combin the most incongru contradict and capabl of the greatest height and of the greatest depth rememb the brilliant remark made by a young observ who ha seen the karamazov famili at close quarter mr rakitin the sens of their own degrad is as essenti to those reckless unbridl natur as the sens of their lofti generos and that s true thei need continu thi unnatur mixtur two extrem at the same moment or thei ar miser and dissatisfi and their exist is incomplet thei ar wide wide as mother russia thei includ everyth and put up with everyth by the wai gentlemen of the juri we ve just touch upon that three thousand roubl and i will ventur to anticip thing a littl can you conceiv that a man like that on receiv that sum and in such a wai at the price of such shame such disgrac such utter degrad could have been capabl that veri dai of set apart half that sum that veri dai and sew it up in a littl bag and would have had the firm of charact to carri it about with him for a whole month afterward in spite of everi temptat and hi extrem need of it neither in drunken debaucheri in tavern nor when he wa fly into the countri try to get from god know whom the monei so essenti to him to remov the object of hi affect from be tempt by hi father did he bring himself to touch that littl bag why if onli to avoid abandon hi mistress to the rival of whom he wa so jealou he would have been certain to have open that bag and to have stai at home to keep watch over her and to await the moment when she would sai to him at last i am your and to fly with her far from their fatal surround but no he did not touch hi talisman and what is the reason he give for it the chief reason as i have just said wa that when she would sai i am your take me where you will he might have the wherewith to take her but that first reason in the prison s own word wa of littl weight besid the second while i have that monei on me he said i am a scoundrel not a thief for i can alwai go to my insult betroth and lai down half the sum i have fraudul appropri i can alwai sai to her you see i ve squander half your monei and shown i am a weak and immor man and if you like a scoundrel i us the prison s own express but though i am a scoundrel i am not a thief for if i had been a thief i shouldn t have brought you back thi half of the monei but should have taken it as i did the other half a marvel explan thi frantic but weak man who could not resist the temptat of accept the three thousand roubl at the price of such disgrac thi veri man suddenli develop the most stoical firm and carri about a thousand roubl without dare to touch it doe that fit in at all with the charact we have analyz no and i ventur to tell you how the real dmitri karamazov would have behav in such circumst if he realli had brought himself to put awai the monei at the first temptat for instanc to entertain the woman with whom he had alreadi squander half the monei he would have unpick hi littl bag and have taken out some hundr roubl for why should he have taken back precis half the monei that is fifteen hundr roubl why not fourteen hundr he could just as well have said then that he wa not a thief becaus he brought back fourteen hundr roubl then anoth time he would have unpick it again and taken out anoth hundr and then a third and then a fourth and befor the end of the month he would have taken the last note but on feel that if he took back onli a hundr it would answer the purpos for a thief would have stolen it all and then he would have look at thi last note and have said to himself it s realli not worth while to give back on hundr let s spend that too that s how the real dmitri karamazov as we know him would have behav on cannot imagin anyth more incongru with the actual fact than thi legend of the littl bag noth could be more inconceiv but we shall return to that later after touch upon what had come out in the proceed concern the financi relat of father and son and argu again and again that it wa utterli imposs from the fact known to determin which wa in the wrong ippolit kirillovitch pass to the evid of the medic expert in refer to mitya s fix idea about the three thousand ow him chapter vii an histor survei the medic expert have striven to convinc us that the prison is out of hi mind and in fact a maniac i maintain that he is in hi right mind and that if he had not been he would have behav more cleverli as for hi be a maniac that i would agre with but onli in on point that is hi fix idea about the three thousand yet i think on might find a much simpler caus than hi tendenc to insan for my part i agre thoroughli with the young doctor who maintain that the prison s mental faculti have alwai been normal and that he ha onli been irrit and exasper the object of the prison s continu and violent anger wa not the sum itself there wa a special motiv at the bottom of it that motiv is jealousi here ippolit kirillovitch describ at length the prison s fatal passion for grushenka he began from the moment when the prison went to the young person s lodg to beat her i us hi own express the prosecutor explain but instead of beat her he remain there at her feet that wa the begin of the passion at the same time the prison s father wa captiv by the same young person a strang and fatal coincid for thei both lost their heart to her simultan though both had known her befor and she inspir in both of them the most violent characterist karamazov passion we have her own confess i wa laugh at both of them ye the sudden desir to make a jest of them came over her and she conquer both of them at onc the old man who worship monei at onc set asid three thousand roubl as a reward for on visit from her but soon after that he would have been happi to lai hi properti and hi name at her feet if onli she would becom hi law wife we have good evid of thi as for the prison the tragedi of hi fate is evid it is befor us but such wa the young person s game the enchantress gave the unhappi young man no hope until the last moment when he knelt befor her stretch out hand that were alreadi stain with the blood of hi father and rival it wa in that posit that he wa arrest send me to siberia with him i have brought him to thi i am most to blame the woman herself cri in genuin remors at the moment of hi arrest the talent young man to whom i have refer alreadi mr rakitin character thi heroin in brief and impress term she wa disillus earli in life deceiv and ruin by a betroth who seduc and abandon her she wa left in poverti curs by her respect famili and taken under the protect of a wealthi old man whom she still howev consid as her benefactor there wa perhap much that wa good in her young heart but it wa embitt too earli she becam prudent and save monei she grew sarcast and resent against societi after thi sketch of her charact it mai well be understood that she might laugh at both of them simpli from mischief from malic after a month of hopeless love and moral degrad dure which he betrai hi betroth and appropri monei entrust to hi honor the prison wa driven almost to frenzi almost to mad by continu jealousi and of whom hi father and the worst of it wa that the crazi old man wa allur and entic the object of hi affect by mean of that veri three thousand roubl which the son look upon as hi own properti part of hi inherit from hi mother of which hi father wa cheat him ye i admit it wa hard to bear it might well drive a man to mad it wa not the monei but the fact that thi monei wa us with such revolt cynic to ruin hi happi then the prosecutor went on to describ how the idea of murder hi father had enter the prison s head and illustr hi theori with fact at first he onli talk about it in tavern he wa talk about it all that month ah he like be alwai surround with compani and he like to tell hi companion everyth even hi most diabol and danger idea he like to share everi thought with other and expect for some reason that those he confid in will meet him with perfect sympathi enter into all hi troubl and anxieti take hi part and not oppos him in anyth if not he fli into a rage and smash up everyth in the tavern then follow the anecdot about captain snegiryov those who heard the prison began to think at last that he might mean more than threat and that such a frenzi might turn threat into action here the prosecutor describ the meet of the famili at the monasteri the convers with alyosha and the horribl scene of violenc when the prison had rush into hi father s hous just after dinner i cannot posit assert the prosecutor continu that the prison fulli intend to murder hi father befor that incid yet the idea had sever time present itself to him and he had deliber on it for that we have fact wit and hi own word i confess gentlemen of the juri he ad that till to dai i have been uncertain whether to attribut to the prison consciou premedit i wa firmli convinc that he had pictur the fatal moment beforehand but had onli pictur it contempl it as a possibl he had not definit consid when and how he might commit the crime but i wa onli uncertain till to dai till that fatal document wa present to the court just now you yourselv heard that young ladi s exclam it is the plan the program of the murder that is how she defin that miser drunken letter of the unhappi prison and in fact from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder wa premedit it wa written two dai befor and so we know now for a fact that forti eight hour befor the perpetr of hi terribl design the prison swore that if he could not get monei next dai he would murder hi father in order to take the envelop with the note from under hi pillow as soon as ivan had left as soon as ivan had gone awai you hear that so he had thought everyth out weigh everi circumst and he carri it all out just as he had written it the proof of premedit is conclus the crime must have been commit for the sake of the monei that is state clearli that is written and sign the prison doe not deni hi signatur i shall be told he wa drunk when he wrote it but that doe not diminish the valu of the letter quit the contrari he wrote when drunk what he had plan when sober had he not plan it when sober he would not have written it when drunk i shall be ask then why did he talk about it in tavern a man who premedit such a crime is silent and keep it to himself ye but he talk about it befor he had form a plan when he had onli the desir onli the impuls to it afterward he talk less about it on the even he wrote that letter at the metropoli tavern contrari to hi custom he wa silent though he had been drink he did not plai billiard he sat in a corner talk to no on he did inde turn a shopman out of hi seat but that wa done almost unconsci becaus he could never enter a tavern without make a disturb it is true that after he had taken the final decis he must have felt apprehens that he had talk too much about hi design beforehand and that thi might lead to hi arrest and prosecut afterward but there wa noth for it he could not take hi word back but hi luck had serv him befor it would serv him again he believ in hi star you know i must confess too that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastroph to morrow i shall try and borrow the monei from everi on as he write in hi peculiar languag and if thei won t give it to me there will be bloodsh here ippolit kirillovitch pass to a detail descript of all mitya s effort to borrow the monei he describ hi visit to samsonov hi journei to lyagavi harass jeer at hungri after sell hi watch to pai for the journei though he tell us he had fifteen hundr roubl on him a like stori tortur by jealousi at have left the object of hi affect in the town suspect that she would go to fyodor pavlovitch in hi absenc he return at last to the town to find to hi joi that she had not been near hi father he accompani her himself to her protector strang to sai he doesn t seem to have been jealou of samsonov which is psycholog interest then he hasten back to hi ambush in the back garden and there learn that smerdyakov is in a fit that the other servant is ill the coast is clear and he know the signal what a temptat still he resist it he goe off to a ladi who ha for some time been resid in the town and who is highli esteem among us madam hohlakov that ladi who had long watch hi career with compass gave him the most judici advic to give up hi dissip life hi unseemli love affair the wast of hi youth and vigor in pot hous debaucheri and to set off to siberia to the gold mine that would be an outlet for your turbul energi your romant charact your thirst for adventur after describ the result of thi convers and the moment when the prison learnt that grushenka had not remain at samsonov s the sudden frenzi of the luckless man worn out with jealousi and nervou exhaust at the thought that she had deceiv him and wa now with hi father ippolit kirillovitch conclud by dwell upon the fatal influenc of chanc had the maid told him that her mistress wa at mokro with her former lover noth would have happen but she lost her head she could onli swear and protest her ignor and if the prison did not kill her on the spot it wa onli becaus he flew in pursuit of hi fals mistress but note frantic as he wa he took with him a brass pestl why that why not some other weapon but sinc he had been contempl hi plan and prepar himself for it for a whole month he would snatch up anyth like a weapon that caught hi ey he had realiz for a month past that ani object of the kind would serv as a weapon so he instantli without hesit recogn that it would serv hi purpos so it wa by no mean unconsci by no mean involuntarili that he snatch up that fatal pestl and then we find him in hi father s garden the coast is clear there ar no wit dark and jealousi the suspicion that she wa there with him with hi rival in hi arm and perhap laugh at him at that moment took hi breath awai and it wa not mere suspicion the decept wa open obviou she must be there in that light room she must be behind the screen and the unhappi man would have us believ that he stole up to the window peep respectfulli in and discreetli withdrew for fear someth terribl and immor should happen and he tri to persuad us of that us who understand hi charact who know hi state of mind at the moment and that he knew the signal by which he could at onc enter the hous at thi point ippolit kirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaust the suspect connect of smerdyakov with the murder he did thi veri circumstanti and everi on realiz that although he profess to despis that suspicion he thought the subject of great import chapter viii a treatis on smerdyakov to begin with what wa the sourc of thi suspicion ippolit kirillovitch began the first person who cri out that smerdyakov had commit the murder wa the prison himself at the moment of hi arrest yet from that time to thi he had not brought forward a singl fact to confirm the charg nor the faintest suggest of a fact the charg is confirm by three person onli the two brother of the prison and madam svyetlov the elder of these brother express hi suspicion onli to dai when he wa undoubtedli suffer from brain fever but we know that for the last two month he ha complet share our convict of hi brother s guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea but of that later the younger brother ha admit that he ha not the slightest fact to support hi notion of smerdyakov s guilt and ha onli been led to that conclus from the prison s own word and the express of hi face ye that astound piec of evid ha been brought forward twice to dai by him madam svyetlov wa even more astound what the prison tell you you must believ he is not a man to tell a lie that is all the evid against smerdyakov produc by these three person who ar all deepli concern in the prison s fate and yet the theori of smerdyakov s guilt ha been nois about ha been and is still maintain is it credibl is it conceiv here ippolit kirillovitch thought it necessari to describ the person of smerdyakov who had cut short hi life in a fit of insan he depict him as a man of weak intellect with a smatter of educ who had been thrown off hi balanc by philosoph idea abov hi level and certain modern theori of duti which he learnt in practic from the reckless life of hi master who wa also perhap hi father fyodor pavlovitch and theoret from variou strang philosoph convers with hi master s elder son ivan fyodorovitch who readili indulg in thi divers probabl feel dull or wish to amus himself at the valet s expens he spoke to me himself of hi spiritu condit dure the last few dai at hi father s hous ippolit kirillovitch explain but other too have born wit to it the prison himself hi brother and the servant grigori that is all who knew him well moreov smerdyakov whose health wa shaken by hi attack of epilepsi had not the courag of a chicken he fell at my feet and kiss them the prison himself ha told us befor he realiz how damag such a statement wa to himself he is an epilept chicken he declar about him in hi characterist languag and the prison chose him for hi confid we have hi own word for it and he frighten him into consent at last to act as a spy for him in that capac he deceiv hi master reveal to the prison the exist of the envelop with the note in it and the signal by mean of which he could get into the hous how could he help tell him inde he would have kill me i could see that he would have kill me he said at the inquiri trembl and shake even befor us though hi tormentor wa by that time arrest and could do him no harm he suspect me at everi instant in fear and trembl i hasten to tell him everi secret to pacifi him that he might see that i had not deceiv him and let me off aliv those ar hi own word i wrote them down and i rememb them when he began shout at me i would fall on my knee he wa natur veri honest and enjoi the complet confid of hi master ever sinc he had restor him some monei he had lost so it mai be suppos that the poor fellow suffer pang of remors at have deceiv hi master whom he love as hi benefactor person sever afflict with epilepsi ar so the most skill doctor tell us alwai prone to continu and morbid self reproach thei worri over their wicked thei ar torment by pang of conscienc often entir without caus thei exagger and often invent all sort of fault and crime and here we have a man of that type who had realli been driven to wrong do by terror and intimid he had besid a strong presenti that someth terribl would be the outcom of the situat that wa develop befor hi ey when ivan fyodorovitch wa leav for moscow just befor the catastroph smerdyakov besought him to remain though he wa too timid to tell him plainli what he fear he confin himself to hint but hi hint were not understood it must be observ that he look on ivan fyodorovitch as a protector whose presenc in the hous wa a guarante that no harm would come to pass rememb the phrase in dmitri karamazov s drunken letter i shall kill the old man if onli ivan goe awai so ivan fyodorovitch s presenc seem to everi on a guarante of peac and order in the hous but he went awai and within an hour of hi young master s departur smerdyakov wa taken with an epilept fit but that s perfectli intellig here i must mention that smerdyakov oppress by terror and despair of a sort had felt dure those last few dai that on of the fit from which he had suffer befor at moment of strain might be come upon him again the dai and hour of such an attack cannot of cours be foreseen but everi epilept can feel beforehand that he is like to have on so the doctor tell us and so as soon as ivan fyodorovitch had driven out of the yard smerdyakov depress by hi lone and unprotect posit went to the cellar he went down the stair wonder if he would have a fit or not and what if it were to come upon him at onc and that veri apprehens that veri wonder brought on the spasm in hi throat that alwai preced such attack and he fell unconsci into the cellar and in thi perfectli natur occurr peopl try to detect a suspicion a hint that he wa sham an attack on purpos but if it were on purpos the question aris at onc what wa hi motiv what wa he reckon on what wa he aim at i sai noth about medicin scienc i am told mai go astrai the doctor were not abl to discrimin between the counterfeit and the real that mai be so but answer me on question what motiv had he for such a counterfeit could he had he been plot the murder have desir to attract the attent of the household by have a fit just befor you see gentlemen of the juri on the night of the murder there were five person in fyodor pavlovitch s fyodor pavlovitch himself but he did not kill himself that s evid then hi servant grigori but he wa almost kill himself the third person wa grigori s wife marfa ignatyevna but it would be simpli shame to imagin her murder her master two person ar left the prison and smerdyakov but if we ar to believ the prison s statement that he is not the murder then smerdyakov must have been for there is no other altern no on els can be found that is what account for the art astound accus against the unhappi idiot who commit suicid yesterdai had a shadow of suspicion rest on ani on els had there been ani sixth person i am persuad that even the prison would have been asham to accus smerdyakov and would have accus that sixth person for to charg smerdyakov with that murder is perfectli absurd gentlemen let us lai asid psycholog let us lai asid medicin let us even lai asid logic let us turn onli to the fact and see what the fact tell us if smerdyakov kill him how did he do it alon or with the assist of the prison let us consid the first altern that he did it alon if he had kill him it must have been with some object for some advantag to himself but not have a shadow of the motiv that the prison had for the murder hatr jealousi and so on smerdyakov could onli have murder him for the sake of gain in order to appropri the three thousand roubl he had seen hi master put in the envelop and yet he tell anoth person and a person most close interest that is the prison everyth about the monei and the signal where the envelop lai what wa written on it what it wa ti up with and abov all told him of those signal by which he could enter the hous did he do thi simpli to betrai himself or to invit to the same enterpris on who would be anxiou to get that envelop for himself ye i shall be told but he betrai it from fear but how do you explain thi a man who could conceiv such an audaci savag act and carri it out tell fact which ar known to no on els in the world and which if he held hi tongu no on would ever have guess no howev cowardli he might be if he had plot such a crime noth would have induc him to tell ani on about the envelop and the signal for that wa as good as betrai himself beforehand he would have invent someth he would have told some lie if he had been forc to give inform but he would have been silent about that for on the other hand if he had said noth about the monei but had commit the murder and stolen the monei no on in the world could have charg him with murder for the sake of robberi sinc no on but he had seen the monei no on but he knew of it exist in the hous even if he had been accus of the murder it could onli have been thought that he had commit it from some other motiv but sinc no on had observ ani such motiv in him beforehand and everi on saw on the contrari that hi master wa fond of him and honor him with hi confid he would of cours have been the last to be suspect peopl would have suspect first the man who had a motiv a man who had himself declar he had such motiv who had made no secret of it thei would in fact have suspect the son of the murder man dmitri fyodorovitch had smerdyakov kill and rob him and the son been accus of it that would of cours have suit smerdyakov yet ar we to believ that though plot the murder he told that son dmitri about the monei the envelop and the signal is that logic is that clear when the dai of the murder plan by smerdyakov came we have him fall downstair in a feign fit with what object in the first place that grigori who had been intend to take hi medicin might put it off and remain on guard see there wa no on to look after the hous and in the second place i suppos that hi master see that there wa no on to guard him and in terror of a visit from hi son might redoubl hi vigil and precaut and most of all i suppos that he smerdyakov disabl by the fit might be carri from the kitchen where he alwai slept apart from all the rest and where he could go in and out as he like to grigori s room at the other end of the lodg where he wa alwai put shut off by a screen three pace from their own bed thi wa the immemori custom establish by hi master and the kind heart marfa ignatyevna whenev he had a fit there ly behind the screen he would most like to keep up the sham have begun groan and so keep them awak all night as grigori and hi wife testifi and all thi we ar to believ that he might more conveni get up and murder hi master but i shall be told that he sham ill on purpos that he might not be suspect and that he told the prison of the monei and the signal to tempt him to commit the murder and when he had murder him and had gone awai with the monei make a nois most like and wake peopl smerdyakov got up am i to believ and went in what for to murder hi master a second time and carri off the monei that had alreadi been stolen gentlemen ar you laugh i am asham to put forward such suggest but incred as it seem that s just what the prison alleg when he had left the hous had knock grigori down and rais an alarm he tell us smerdyakov got up went in and murder hi master and stole the monei i won t press the point that smerdyakov could hardli have reckon on thi beforehand and have foreseen that the furiou and exasper son would simpli come to peep in respectfulli though he knew the signal and beat a retreat leav smerdyakov hi booti gentlemen of the juri i put thi question to you in earnest when wa the moment when smerdyakov could have commit hi crime name that moment or you can t accus him but perhap the fit wa a real on the sick man suddenli recov heard a shout and went out well what then he look about him and said why not go and kill the master and how did he know what had happen sinc he had been ly unconsci till that moment but there s a limit to these flight of fanci quit so some astut peopl will tell me but what if thei were in agreement what if thei murder him togeth and share the monei what then a weighti question truli and the fact to confirm it ar astound on commit the murder and take all the troubl while hi accomplic li on on side sham a fit appar to arous suspicion in everi on alarm in hi master and alarm in grigori it would be interest to know what motiv could have induc the two accomplic to form such an insan plan but perhap it wa not a case of activ complic on smerdyakov s part but onli of passiv acquiesc perhap smerdyakov wa intimid and agre not to prevent the murder and forese that he would be blame for let hi master be murder without scream for help or resist he mai have obtain permiss from dmitri karamazov to get out of the wai by sham a fit you mai murder him as you like it s noth to me but as thi attack of smerdyakov s wa bound to throw the household into confus dmitri karamazov could never have agre to such a plan i will waiv that point howev suppos that he did agre it would still follow that dmitri karamazov is the murder and the instig and smerdyakov is onli a passiv accomplic and not even an accomplic but mere acquiesc against hi will through terror but what do we see as soon as he is arrest the prison instantli throw all the blame on smerdyakov not accus him of be hi accomplic but of be himself the murder he did it alon he sai he murder and rob him it wa the work of hi hand strang sort of accomplic who begin to accus on anoth at onc and think of the risk for karamazov after commit the murder while hi accomplic lai in bed he throw the blame on the invalid who might well have resent it and in self preserv might well have confess the truth for he might well have seen that the court would at onc judg how far he wa respons and so he might well have reckon that if he were punish it would be far less sever than the real murder but in that case he would have been certain to make a confess yet he ha not done so smerdyakov never hint at their complic though the actual murder persist in accus him and declar that he had commit the crime alon what s more smerdyakov at the inquiri volunt the statement that it wa he who had told the prison of the envelop of note and of the signal and that but for him he would have known noth about them if he had realli been a guilti accomplic would he so readili have made thi statement at the inquiri on the contrari he would have tri to conceal it to distort the fact or minim them but he wa far from distort or minim them no on but an innoc man who had no fear of be charg with complic could have act as he did and in a fit of melancholi aris from hi diseas and thi catastroph he hang himself yesterdai he left a note written in hi peculiar languag i destroi myself of my own will and inclin so as to throw no blame on ani on what would it have cost him to add i am the murder not karamazov but that he did not add did hi conscienc lead him to suicid and not to avow hi guilt and what follow note for three thousand roubl were brought into the court just now and we were told that thei were the same that lai in the envelop now on the tabl befor us and that the wit had receiv them from smerdyakov the dai befor but i need not recal the pain scene though i will make on or two comment select such trivial on as might not be obviou at first sight to everi on and so mai be overlook in the first place smerdyakov must have given back the monei and hang himself yesterdai from remors and onli yesterdai he confess hi guilt to ivan karamazov as the latter inform us if it were not so inde why should ivan fyodorovitch have kept silenc till now and so if he ha confess then why i ask again did he not avow the whole truth in the last letter he left behind know that the innoc prison had to face thi terribl ordeal the next dai the monei alon is no proof a week ago quit by chanc the fact came to the knowledg of myself and two other person in thi court that ivan fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent coupon of five thousand each that is ten thousand in all to the chief town of the provinc to be chang i onli mention thi to point out that ani on mai have monei and that it can t be prove that these note ar the same as were in fyodor pavlovitch s envelop ivan karamazov after receiv yesterdai a commun of such import from the real murder did not stir why didn t he report it at onc why did he put it all off till morn i think i have a right to conjectur why hi health had been give wai for a week past he had admit to a doctor and to hi most intim friend that he wa suffer from hallucin and see phantom of the dead he wa on the ev of the attack of brain fever by which he ha been stricken down to dai in thi condit he suddenli heard of smerdyakov s death and at onc reflect the man is dead i can throw the blame on him and save my brother i have monei i will take a roll of note and sai that smerdyakov gave them me befor hi death you will sai that wa dishonor it s dishonor to slander even the dead and even to save a brother true but what if he slander him unconsci what if final unhing by the sudden new of the valet s death he imagin it realli wa so you saw the recent scene you have seen the wit s condit he wa stand up and wa speak but where wa hi mind then follow the document the prison s letter written two dai befor the crime and contain a complet program of the murder why then ar we look for ani other program the crime wa commit precis accord to thi program and by no other than the writer of it ye gentlemen of the juri it went off without a hitch he did not run respectfulli and timidli awai from hi father s window though he wa firmli convinc that the object of hi affect wa with him no that is absurd and unlik he went in and murder him most like he kill him in anger burn with resent as soon as he look on hi hate rival but have kill him probabl with on blow of the brass pestl and have convinc himself after care search that she wa not there he did not howev forget to put hi hand under the pillow and take out the envelop the torn cover of which li now on the tabl befor us i mention thi fact that you mai note on to my think veri characterist circumst had he been an experienc murder and had he commit the murder for the sake of gain onli would he have left the torn envelop on the floor as it wa found besid the corps had it been smerdyakov for instanc murder hi master to rob him he would have simpli carri awai the envelop with him without troubl himself to open it over hi victim s corps for he would have known for certain that the note were in the envelop thei had been put in and seal up in hi presenc and had he taken the envelop with him no on would ever have known of the robberi i ask you gentlemen would smerdyakov have behav in that wai would he have left the envelop on the floor no thi wa the action of a frantic murder a murder who wa not a thief and had never stolen befor that dai who snatch the note from under the pillow not like a thief steal them but as though seiz hi own properti from the thief who had stolen it for that wa the idea which had becom almost an insan obsess in dmitri karamazov in regard to that monei and pounc upon the envelop which he had never seen befor he tore it open to make sure whether the monei wa in it and ran awai with the monei in hi pocket even forget to consid that he had left an astound piec of evid against himself in that torn envelop on the floor all becaus it wa karamazov not smerdyakov he didn t think he didn t reflect and how should he he ran awai he heard behind him the servant cry out the old man caught him stop him and wa fell to the ground by the brass pestl the prison move by piti leapt down to look at him would you believ it he tell us that he leapt down out of piti out of compass to see whether he could do anyth for him wa that a moment to show compass no he jump down simpli to make certain whether the onli wit of hi crime were dead or aliv ani other feel ani other motiv would be unnatur note that he took troubl over grigori wipe hi head with hi handkerchief and convinc himself he wa dead he ran to the hous of hi mistress daze and cover with blood how wa it he never thought that he wa cover with blood and would be at onc detect but the prison himself assur us that he did not even notic that he wa cover with blood that mai be believ that is veri possibl that alwai happen at such moment with crimin on on point thei will show diabol cun while anoth will escap them altogeth but he wa think at that moment of on thing onli where wa she he want to find out at onc where she wa so he ran to her lodg and learnt an unexpect and astound piec of new she had gone off to mokro to meet her first lover chapter ix the gallop troika the end of the prosecutor s speech ippolit kirillovitch had chosen the histor method of exposit belov by all nervou orat who find in it limit a check on their own eager rhetor at thi moment in hi speech he went off into a dissert on grushenka s first lover and brought forward sever interest thought on thi theme karamazov who had been frantic jealou of everi on collaps so to speak and effac himself at onc befor thi first lover what make it all the more strang is that he seem to have hardli thought of thi formid rival but he had look upon him as a remot danger and karamazov alwai live in the present possibl he regard him as a fiction but hi wound heart grasp instantli that the woman had been conceal thi new rival and deceiv him becaus he wa anyth but a fiction to her becaus he wa the on hope of her life grasp thi instantli he resign himself gentlemen of the juri i cannot help dwell on thi unexpect trait in the prison s charact he suddenli evinc an irresist desir for justic a respect for woman and a recognit of her right to love and all thi at the veri moment when he had stain hi hand with hi father s blood for her sake it is true that the blood he had shed wa alreadi cry out for vengeanc for after have ruin hi soul and hi life in thi world he wa forc to ask himself at that same instant what he wa and what he could be now to her to that be dearer to him than hi own soul in comparison with that former lover who had return penit with new love to the woman he had onc betrai with honor offer with the promis of a reform and happi life and he luckless man what could he give her now what could he offer her karamazov felt all thi knew that all wai were bar to him by hi crime and that he wa a crimin under sentenc and not a man with life befor him thi thought crush him and so he instantli flew to on frantic plan which to a man of karamazov s charact must have appear the on inevit wai out of hi terribl posit that wai out wa suicid he ran for the pistol he had left in pledg with hi friend perhotin and on the wai as he ran he pull out of hi pocket the monei for the sake of which he had stain hi hand with hi father s gore oh now he need monei more than ever karamazov would die karamazov would shoot himself and it should be rememb to be sure he wa a poet and had burnt the candl at both end all hi life to her to her and there oh there i will give a feast to the whole world such as never wa befor that will be rememb and talk of long after in the midst of shout of wild merriment reckless gypsi song and danc i shall rais the glass and drink to the woman i ador and her new found happi and then on the spot at her feet i shall dash out my brain befor her and punish myself she will rememb mitya karamazov sometim she will see how mitya love her she will feel for mitya here we see in excess a love of effect a romant despair and sentiment and the wild reckless of the karamazov ye but there is someth els gentlemen of the juri someth that cri out in the soul throb incessantli in the mind and poison the heart unto death that someth is conscienc gentlemen of the juri it judgment it terribl torment the pistol will settl everyth the pistol is the onli wai out but beyond i don t know whether karamazov wonder at that moment what li beyond and whether karamazov could like hamlet wonder what li beyond no gentlemen of the juri thei have their hamlet but we still have our karamazov here ippolit kirillovitch drew a minut pictur of mitya s prepar the scene at perhotin s at the shop with the driver he quot numer word and action confirm by wit and the pictur made a terribl impress on the audienc the guilt of thi harass and desper man stood out clear and convinc when the fact were brought togeth what need had he of precaut two or three time he almost confess hint at it all but spoke out then follow the evid given by wit he even cri out to the peasant who drove him do you know you ar drive a murder but it wa imposs for him to speak out he had to get to mokro and there to finish hi romanc but what wa await the luckless man almost from the first minut at mokro he saw that hi invinc rival wa perhap by no mean so invinc that the toast to their new found happi wa not desir and would not be accept but you know the fact gentlemen of the juri from the preliminari inquiri karamazov s triumph over hi rival wa complet and hi soul pass into quit a new phase perhap the most terribl phase through which hi soul ha pass or will pass on mai sai with certainti gentlemen of the juri the prosecutor continu that outrag natur and the crimin heart bring their own vengeanc more complet than ani earthli justic what s more justic and punish on earth posit allevi the punish of natur and ar inde essenti to the soul of the crimin at such moment as it salvat from despair for i cannot imagin the horror and moral suffer of karamazov when he learnt that she love him that for hi sake she had reject her first lover that she wa summon him mitya to a new life that she wa promis him happi and when when everyth wa over for him and noth wa possibl by the wai i will note in parenthesi a point of import for the light it throw on the prison s posit at the moment thi woman thi love of hi had been till the last moment till the veri instant of hi arrest a be unattain passion desir by him but unattain yet why did he not shoot himself then why did he relinquish hi design and even forget where hi pistol wa it wa just that passion desir for love and the hope of satisfi it that restrain him throughout their revel he kept close to hi ador mistress who wa at the banquet with him and wa more charm and fascin to him than ever he did not leav her side abas himself in hi homag befor her hi passion might well for a moment stifl not onli the fear of arrest but even the torment of conscienc for a moment oh onli for a moment i can pictur the state of mind of the crimin hopelessli enslav by these influenc first the influenc of drink of nois and excit of the thud of the danc and the scream of the song and of her flush with wine sing and danc and laugh to him secondli the hope in the background that the fatal end might still be far off that not till next morn at least thei would come and take him so he had a few hour and that s much veri much in a few hour on can think of mani thing i imagin that he felt someth like what crimin feel when thei ar be taken to the scaffold thei have anoth long long street to pass down and at walk pace past thousand of peopl then there will be a turn into anoth street and onli at the end of that street the dread place of execut i fanci that at the begin of the journei the condemn man sit on hi shame cart must feel that he ha infinit life still befor him the hous reced the cart move on oh that s noth it s still far to the turn into the second street and he still look boldli to right and to left at those thousand of callous curiou peopl with their ey fix on him and he still fanci that he is just such a man as thei but now the turn come to the next street oh that s noth noth there s still a whole street befor him and howev mani hous have been pass he will still think there ar mani left and so to the veri end to the veri scaffold thi i imagin is how it wa with karamazov then thei ve not had time yet he must have thought i mai still find some wai out oh there s still time to make some plan of defens and now now she is so fascin hi soul wa full of confus and dread but he manag howev to put asid half hi monei and hide it somewher i cannot otherwis explain the disappear of quit half of the three thousand he had just taken from hi father s pillow he had been in mokro more than onc befor he had carous there for two dai togeth alreadi he knew the old big hous with all it passag and outbuild i imagin that part of the monei wa hidden in that hous not long befor the arrest in some crevic under some floor in some corner under the roof with what object i shall be ask why the catastroph mai take place at onc of cours he hadn t yet consid how to meet it he hadn t the time hi head wa throb and hi heart wa with her but monei monei wa indispens in ani case with monei a man is alwai a man perhap such foresight at such a moment mai strike you as unnatur but he assur us himself that a month befor at a critic and excit moment he had halv hi monei and sewn it up in a littl bag and though that wa not true as we shall prove directli it show the idea wa a familiar on to karamazov he had contempl it what s more when he declar at the inquiri that he had put fifteen hundr roubl in a bag which never exist he mai have invent that littl bag on the inspir of the moment becaus he had two hour befor divid hi monei and hidden half of it at mokro till morn in case of emerg simpli not to have it on himself two extrem gentlemen of the juri rememb that karamazov can contempl two extrem and both at onc we have look in the hous but we haven t found the monei it mai still be there or it mai have disappear next dai and be in the prison s hand now in ani case he wa at her side on hi knee befor her she wa ly on the bed he had hi hand stretch out to her and he had so entir forgotten everyth that he did not even hear the men come to arrest him he hadn t time to prepar ani line of defens in hi mind he wa caught unawar and confront with hi judg the arbit of hi destini gentlemen of the juri there ar moment in the execut of our duti when it is terribl for us to face a man terribl on hi account too the moment of contempl that anim fear when the crimin see that all is lost but still struggl still mean to struggl the moment when everi instinct of self preserv rise up in him at onc and he look at you with question and suffer ey studi you your face your thought uncertain on which side you will strike and hi distract mind frame thousand of plan in an instant but he is still afraid to speak afraid of give himself awai thi purgatori of the spirit thi anim thirst for self preserv these humili moment of the human soul ar aw and sometim arous horror and compass for the crimin even in the lawyer and thi wa what we all wit then at first he wa thunderstruck and in hi terror drop some veri compromis phrase blood i ve deserv it but he quickli restrain himself he had not prepar what he wa to sai what answer he wa to make he had noth but a bare denial readi i am not guilti of my father s death that wa hi fenc for the moment and behind it he hope to throw up a barricad of some sort hi first compromis exclam he hasten to explain by declar that he wa respons for the death of the servant grigori onli of that bloodsh i am guilti but who ha kill my father gentlemen who ha kill him who can have kill him if not i do you hear he ask us that us who had come to ask him that question do you hear that phrase utter with such prematur hast if not i the anim cun the na vet the karamazov impati of it i didn t kill him and you mustn t think i did i want to kill him gentlemen i want to kill him he hasten to admit he wa in a hurri in a terribl hurri but still i am not guilti it is not i murder him he conced to us that he want to murder him as though to sai you can see for yourselv how truth i am so you ll believ all the sooner that i didn t murder him oh in such case the crimin is often amazingli shallow and credul at that point on of the lawyer ask him as it were incident the most simpl question wasn t it smerdyakov kill him then as we expect he wa horribl angri at our have anticip him and caught him unawar befor he had time to pave the wai to choos and snatch the moment when it would be most natur to bring in smerdyakov s name he rush at onc to the other extrem as he alwai doe and began to assur us that smerdyakov could not have kill him wa not capabl of it but don t believ him that wa onli hi cun he didn t realli give up the idea of smerdyakov on the contrari he meant to bring him forward again for inde he had no on els to bring forward but he would do that later becaus for the moment that line wa spoil for him he would bring him forward perhap next dai or even a few dai later choos an opportun to cry out to us you know i wa more skeptic about smerdyakov than you you rememb that yourselv but now i am convinc he kill him he must have done and for the present he fall back upon a gloomi and irrit denial impati and anger prompt him howev to the most inept and incred explan of how he look into hi father s window and how he respectfulli withdrew the worst of it wa that he wa unawar of the posit of affair of the evid given by grigori we proceed to search him the search anger but encourag him the whole three thousand had not been found on him onli half of it and no doubt onli at that moment of angri silenc the fiction of the littl bag first occur to him no doubt he wa consciou himself of the improb of the stori and strove painfulli to make it sound more like to weav it into a romanc that would sound plausibl in such case the first duti the chief task of the investig lawyer is to prevent the crimin be prepar to pounc upon him unexpectedli so that he mai blurt out hi cherish idea in all their simplic improb and inconsist the crimin can onli be made to speak by the sudden and appar incident commun of some new fact of some circumst of great import in the case of which he had no previou idea and could not have foreseen we had such a fact in readi that wa grigori s evid about the open door through which the prison had run out he had complet forgotten about that door and had not even suspect that grigori could have seen it the effect of it wa amaz he leapt up and shout to us then smerdyakov murder him it wa smerdyakov and so betrai the basi of the defens he wa keep back and betrai it in it most improb shape for smerdyakov could onli have commit the murder after he had knock grigori down and run awai when we told him that grigori saw the door wa open befor he fell down and had heard smerdyakov behind the screen as he came out of hi bedroom karamazov wa posit crush my esteem and witti colleagu nikolai parfenovitch told me afterward that he wa almost move to tear at the sight of him and to improv matter the prison hasten to tell us about the much talk of littl bag so be it you shall hear thi romanc gentlemen of the juri i have told you alreadi why i consid thi romanc not onli an absurd but the most improb invent that could have been brought forward in the circumst if on tri for a bet to invent the most unlik stori on could hardli find anyth more incred the worst of such stori is that the triumphant romanc can alwai be put to confus and crush by the veri detail in which real life is so rich and which these unhappi and involuntari stori teller neglect as insignific trifl oh thei have no thought to spare for such detail their mind ar concentr on their grand invent as a whole and fanci ani on dare to pull them up for a trifl but that s how thei ar caught the prison wa ask the question where did you get the stuff for your littl bag and who made it for you i made it myself and where did you get the linen the prison wa posit offend he thought it almost insult to ask him such a trivial question and would you believ it hi resent wa genuin but thei ar all like that i tore it off my shirt then we shall find that shirt among your linen to morrow with a piec torn off and onli fanci gentlemen of the juri if we realli had found that torn shirt and how could we have fail to find it in hi chest of drawer or trunk that would have been a fact a materi fact in support of hi statement but he wa incap of that reflect i don t rememb it mai not have been off my shirt i sew it up in on of my landladi s cap what sort of a cap it wa an old cotton rag of her ly about and do you rememb that clearli no i don t and he wa angri veri angri and yet imagin not rememb it at the most terribl moment of man s life for instanc when he is be led to execut he rememb just such trifl he will forget anyth but some green roof that ha flash past him on the road or a jackdaw on a cross that he will rememb he conceal the make of that littl bag from hi household he must have rememb hi humili fear that some on might come in and find him needl in hand how at the slightest sound he slip behind the screen there is a screen in hi lodg but gentlemen of the juri why do i tell you all thi all these detail trifl cri ippolit kirillovitch suddenli just becaus the prison still persist in these absurd to thi moment he ha not explain anyth sinc that fatal night two month ago he ha not ad on actual illumin fact to hi former fantast statement all those ar trivial you must believ it on my honor oh we ar glad to believ it we ar eager to believ it even if onli on hi word of honor ar we jackal thirst for human blood show us a singl fact in the prison s favor and we shall rejoic but let it be a substanti real fact and not a conclus drawn from the prison s express by hi own brother or that when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to point to the littl bag in the dark too we shall rejoic at the new fact we shall be the first to repudi our charg we shall hasten to repudi it but now justic cri out and we persist we cannot repudi anyth ippolit kirillovitch pass to hi final peror he look as though he wa in a fever he spoke of the blood that cri for vengeanc the blood of the father murder by hi son with the base motiv of robberi he point to the tragic and glare consist of the fact and whatev you mai hear from the talent and celebr counsel for the defens ippolit kirillovitch could not resist ad whatev eloqu and touch appeal mai be made to your sensibl rememb that at thi moment you ar in a templ of justic rememb that you ar the champion of our justic the champion of our holi russia of her principl her famili everyth that she hold sacr ye you repres russia here at thi moment and your verdict will be heard not in thi hall onli but will re cho throughout the whole of russia and all russia will hear you as her champion and her judg and she will be encourag or dishearten by your verdict do not disappoint russia and her expect our fatal troika dash on in her headlong flight perhap to destruct and in all russia for long past men have stretch out implor hand and call a halt to it furiou reckless cours and if other nation stand asid from that troika that mai be not from respect as the poet would fain believ but simpli from horror from horror perhap from disgust and well it is that thei stand asid but mayb thei will ceas on dai to do so and will form a firm wall confront the hurri apparit and will check the frenzi rush of our lawless for the sake of their own safeti enlighten and civil alreadi we have heard voic of alarm from europ thei alreadi begin to sound do not tempt them do not heap up their grow hatr by a sentenc justifi the murder of a father by hi son though ippolit kirillovitch wa genuin move he wound up hi speech with thi rhetor appeal and the effect produc by him wa extraordinari when he had finish hi speech he went out hurriedli and as i have mention befor almost faint in the adjoin room there wa no applaus in the court but seriou person were pleas the ladi were not so well satisfi though even thei were pleas with hi eloqu especi as thei had no apprehens as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust in fetyukovitch he will speak at last and of cours carri all befor him everi on look at mitya he sat silent through the whole of the prosecutor s speech clench hi teeth with hi hand clasp and hi head bow onli from time to time he rais hi head and listen especi when grushenka wa spoken of when the prosecutor mention rakitin s opinion of her a smile of contempt and anger pass over hi face and he murmur rather audibl the bernard when ippolit kirillovitch describ how he had question and tortur him at mokro mitya rais hi head and listen with intens curios at on point he seem about to jump up and cry out but control himself and onli shrug hi shoulder disdainfulli peopl talk afterward of the end of the speech of the prosecutor s feat in examin the prison at mokro and jeer at ippolit kirillovitch the man could not resist boast of hi clever thei said the court wa adjourn but onli for a short interv a quarter of an hour or twenti minut at most there wa a hum of convers and exclam in the audienc i rememb some of them a weighti speech a gentleman in on group observ grave he brought in too much psycholog said anoth voic but it wa all true the absolut truth ye he is first rate at it he sum it all up ye he sum us up too chime in anoth voic do you rememb at the begin of hi speech make out we were all like fyodor pavlovitch and at the end too but that wa all rot and obscur too he wa a littl too much carri awai it s unjust it s unjust no it wa smartli done anywai he s had long to wait but he s had hi sai ha ha what will the counsel for the defens sai in anoth group i heard he had no busi to make a thrust at the petersburg man like that appeal to your sensibl do you rememb ye that wa awkward of him he wa in too great a hurri he is a nervou man we laugh but what must the prison be feel ye what must it be for mitya in a third group what ladi is that the fat on with the lorgnett sit at the end she is a gener s wife divorc i know her that s why she ha the lorgnett she is not good for much oh no she is a piquant littl woman two place beyond her there is a littl fair woman she is prettier thei caught him smartli at mokro didn t thei eh oh it wa smart enough we ve heard it befor how often he ha told the stori at peopl s hous and he couldn t resist do it now that s vaniti he is a man with a grievanc he he ye and quick to take offens and there wa too much rhetor such long sentenc ye he tri to alarm us he kept try to alarm us do you rememb about the troika someth about thei have hamlet but we have so far onli karamazov that wa cleverli said that wa to propiti the liber he is afraid of them ye and he is afraid of the lawyer too ye what will fetyukovitch sai whatev he sai he won t get round our peasant don t you think so a fourth group what he said about the troika wa good that piec about the other nation and that wa true what he said about other nation not stand it what do you mean why in the english parliament a member got up last week and speak about the nihilist ask the ministri whether it wa not high time to interven to educ thi barbar peopl ippolit wa think of him i know he wa he wa talk about that last week not an easi job not an easi job why not why we d shut up kronstadt and not let them have ani corn where would thei get it in america thei get it from america now nonsens but the bell rang all rush to their place fetyukovitch mount the tribun chapter x the speech for the defens an argument that cut both wai all wa hush as the first word of the famou orat rang out the ey of the audienc were fasten upon him he began veri simpli and directli with an air of convict but not the slightest trace of conceit he made no attempt at eloqu at patho or emot phrase he wa like a man speak in a circl of intim and sympathet friend hi voic wa a fine on sonor and sympathet and there wa someth genuin and simpl in the veri sound of it but everi on realiz at onc that the speaker might suddenli rise to genuin patho and pierc the heart with untold power hi languag wa perhap more irregular than ippolit kirillovitch s but he spoke without long phrase and inde with more precis on thing did not pleas the ladi he kept bend forward especi at the begin of hi speech not exactli bow but as though he were about to dart at hi listen bend hi long spine in half as though there were a spring in the middl that enabl him to bend almost at right angl at the begin of hi speech he spoke rather disconnectedli without system on mai sai deal with fact separ though at the end these fact form a whole hi speech might be divid into two part the first consist of critic in refut of the charg sometim malici and sarcast but in the second half he suddenli chang hi tone and even hi manner and at onc rose to patho the audienc seem on the look out for it and quiver with enthusiasm he went straight to the point and began by sai that although he practic in petersburg he had more than onc visit provinci town to defend prison of whose innoc he had a convict or at least a preconceiv idea that is what ha happen to me in the present case he explain from the veri first account in the newspap i wa struck by someth which strongli prepossess me in the prison s favor what interest me most wa a fact which often occur in legal practic but rare i think in such an extrem and peculiar form as in the present case i ought to formul that peculiar onli at the end of my speech but i will do so at the veri begin for it is my weak to go to work directli not keep my effect in reserv and econom my materi that mai be imprud on my part but at least it s sincer what i have in my mind is thi there is an overwhelm chain of evid against the prison and at the same time not on fact that will stand critic if it is examin separ as i follow the case more close in the paper my idea wa more and more confirm and i suddenli receiv from the prison s rel a request to undertak hi defens i at onc hurri here and here i becam complet convinc it wa to break down thi terribl chain of fact and to show that each piec of evid taken separ wa unprov and fantast that i undertook the case so fetyukovitch began gentlemen of the juri he suddenli protest i am new to thi district i have no preconceiv idea the prison a man of turbul and unbridl temper ha not insult me but he ha insult perhap hundr of person in thi town and so prejud mani peopl against him beforehand of cours i recogn that the moral sentiment of local societi is justli excit against him the prison is of turbul and violent temper yet he wa receiv in societi here he wa even welcom in the famili of my talent friend the prosecutor nb at these word there were two or three laugh in the audienc quickli suppress but notic by all all of us knew that the prosecutor receiv mitya against hi will sole becaus he had somehow interest hi wife a ladi of the highest virtu and moral worth but fanci caprici and fond of oppos her husband especi in trifl mitya s visit howev had not been frequent nevertheless i ventur to suggest fetyukovitch continu that in spite of hi independ mind and just charact my oppon mai have form a mistaken prejudic against my unfortun client oh that is so natur the unfortun man ha onli too well deserv such prejudic outrag moral and still more outrag tast is often relentless we have in the talent prosecutor s speech heard a stern analysi of the prison s charact and conduct and hi sever critic attitud to the case wa evid and what s more he went into psycholog subtleti into which he could not have enter if he had the least consciou and malici prejudic against the prison but there ar thing which ar even wors even more fatal in such case than the most malici and conscious unfair attitud it is wors if we ar carri awai by the artist instinct by the desir to creat so to speak a romanc especi if god ha endow us with psycholog insight befor i start on my wai here i wa warn in petersburg and wa myself awar that i should find here a talent oppon whose psycholog insight and subtleti had gain him peculiar renown in legal circl of recent year but profound as psycholog is it s a knife that cut both wai laughter among the public you will of cours forgiv me my comparison i can t boast of eloqu but i will take as an exampl ani point in the prosecutor s speech the prison run awai in the garden in the dark climb over the fenc wa seiz by the servant and knock him down with a brass pestl then he jump back into the garden and spent five minut over the man try to discov whether he had kill him or not and the prosecutor refus to believ the prison s statement that he ran to old grigori out of piti no he sai such sensibl is imposs at such a moment that s unnatur he ran to find out whether the onli wit of hi crime wa dead or aliv and so show that he had commit the murder sinc he would not have run back for ani other reason here you have psycholog but let us take the same method and appli it to the case the other wai round and our result will be no less probabl the murder we ar told leapt down to find out as a precaut whether the wit wa aliv or not yet he had left in hi murder father s studi as the prosecutor himself argu an amaz piec of evid in the shape of a torn envelop with an inscript that there had been three thousand roubl in it if he had carri that envelop awai with him no on in the world would have known of that envelop and of the note in it and that the monei had been stolen by the prison those ar the prosecutor s own word so on on side you see a complet absenc of precaut a man who ha lost hi head and run awai in a fright leav that clew on the floor and two minut later when he ha kill anoth man we ar entitl to assum the most heartless and calcul foresight in him but even admit thi wa so it is psycholog subtleti i suppos that discern that under certain circumst i becom as bloodthirsti and keen sight as a caucasian eagl while at the next i am as timid and blind as a mole but if i am so bloodthirsti and cruelli calcul that when i kill a man i onli run back to find out whether he is aliv to wit against me why should i spend five minut look after my victim at the risk of encount other wit why soak my handkerchief wipe the blood off hi head so that it mai be evid against me later if he were so cold heart and calcul why not hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestl so as to kill him outright and reliev himself of all anxieti about the wit again though he ran to see whether the wit wa aliv he left anoth wit on the path that brass pestl which he had taken from the two women and which thei could alwai recogn afterward as their and prove that he had taken it from them and it is not as though he had forgotten it on the path drop it through careless or hast no he had flung awai hi weapon for it wa found fifteen pace from where grigori lai why did he do so just becaus he wa griev at have kill a man an old servant and he flung awai the pestl with a curs as a murder weapon that s how it must have been what other reason could he have had for throw it so far and if he wa capabl of feel grief and piti at have kill a man it show that he wa innoc of hi father s murder had he murder him he would never have run to anoth victim out of piti then he would have felt differ hi thought would have been center on self preserv he would have had none to spare for piti that is beyond doubt on the contrari he would have broken hi skull instead of spend five minut look after him there wa room for piti and good feel just becaus hi conscienc had been clear till then here we have a differ psycholog i have purpos resort to thi method gentlemen of the juri to show that you can prove anyth by it it all depend on who make us of it psycholog lure even most seriou peopl into romanc and quit unconsci i am speak of the abus of psycholog gentlemen sound of approv and laughter at the expens of the prosecutor were again audibl in the court i will not repeat the speech in detail i will onli quot some passag from it some lead point chapter xi there wa no monei there wa no robberi there wa on point that struck everi on in fetyukovitch s speech he flatli deni the exist of the fatal three thousand roubl and consequ the possibl of their have been stolen gentlemen of the juri he began everi new and unprejud observ must be struck by a characterist peculiar in the present case name the charg of robberi and the complet imposs of prove that there wa anyth to be stolen we ar told that monei wa stolen three thousand roubl but whether those roubl ever exist nobodi know consid how have we heard of that sum and who ha seen the note the onli person who saw them and state that thei had been put in the envelop wa the servant smerdyakov he had spoken of it to the prison and hi brother ivan fyodorovitch befor the catastroph madam svyetlov too had been told of it but not on of these three person had actual seen the note no on but smerdyakov had seen them here the question aris if it s true that thei did exist and that smerdyakov had seen them when did he see them for the last time what if hi master had taken the note from under hi bed and put them back in hi cash box without tell him note that accord to smerdyakov s stori the note were kept under the mattress the prison must have pull them out and yet the bed wa absolut unrumpl that is carefulli record in the protocol how could the prison have found the note without disturb the bed how could he have help soil with hi blood stain hand the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been purpos made but i shall be ask what about the envelop on the floor ye it s worth sai a word or two about that envelop i wa somewhat surpris just now to hear the highli talent prosecutor declar of himself of himself observ that but for that envelop but for it be left on the floor no on in the world would have known of the exist of that envelop and the note in it and therefor of the prison s have stolen it and so that torn scrap of paper is by the prosecutor s own admiss the sole proof on which the charg of robberi rest otherwis no on would have known of the robberi nor perhap even of the monei but is the mere fact that that scrap of paper wa ly on the floor a proof that there wa monei in it and that that monei had been stolen yet it will be object smerdyakov had seen the monei in the envelop but when when had he seen it for the last time i ask you that i talk to smerdyakov and he told me that he had seen the note two dai befor the catastroph then why not imagin that old fyodor pavlovitch lock up alon in impati and hyster expect of the object of hi ador mai have while awai the time by break open the envelop and take out the note what s the us of the envelop he mai have ask himself she won t believ the note ar there but when i show her the thirti rainbow color note in on roll it will make more impress you mai be sure it will make her mouth water and so he tear open the envelop take out the monei and fling the envelop on the floor consciou of be the owner and untroubl by ani fear of leav evid listen gentlemen could anyth be more like than thi theori and such an action why is it out of the question but if anyth of the sort could have taken place the charg of robberi fall to the ground if there wa no monei there wa no theft of it if the envelop on the floor mai be taken as evid that there had been monei in it why mai i not maintain the opposit that the envelop wa on the floor becaus the monei had been taken from it by it owner but i shall be ask what becam of the monei if fyodor pavlovitch took it out of the envelop sinc it wa not found when the polic search the hous in the first place part of the monei wa found in the cash box and secondli he might have taken it out that morn or the even befor to make some other us of it to give or send it awai he mai have chang hi idea hi plan of action complet without think it necessari to announc the fact to smerdyakov beforehand and if there is the barest possibl of such an explan how can the prison be so posit accus of have commit murder for the sake of robberi and of have actual carri out that robberi thi is encroach on the domain of romanc if it is maintain that someth ha been stolen the thing must be produc or at least it exist must be prove beyond doubt yet no on had ever seen these note not long ago in petersburg a young man of eighteen hardli more than a boi who carri on a small busi as a costermong went in broad daylight into a moneychang s shop with an ax and with extraordinari typic audac kill the master of the shop and carri off fifteen hundr roubl five hour later he wa arrest and except fifteen roubl he had alreadi manag to spend the whole sum wa found on him moreov the shopman on hi return to the shop after the murder inform the polic not onli of the exact sum stolen but even of the note and gold coin of which that sum wa made up and those veri note and coin were found on the crimin thi wa follow by a full and genuin confess on the part of the murder that s what i call evid gentlemen of the juri in that case i know i see i touch the monei and cannot deni it exist is it the same in the present case and yet it is a question of life and death ye i shall be told but he wa carous that night squander monei he wa shown to have had fifteen hundr roubl where did he get the monei but the veri fact that onli fifteen hundr could be found and the other half of the sum could nowher be discov show that that monei wa not the same and had never been in ani envelop by strict calcul of time it wa prove at the preliminari inquiri that the prison ran straight from those women servant to perhotin s without go home and that he had been nowher so he had been all the time in compani and therefor could not have divid the three thousand in half and hidden half in the town it s just thi consider that ha led the prosecutor to assum that the monei is hidden in some crevic at mokro why not in the dungeon of the castl of udolpho gentlemen isn t thi supposit realli too fantast and too romant and observ if that supposit break down the whole charg of robberi is scatter to the wind for in that case what could have becom of the other fifteen hundr roubl by what miracl could thei have disappear sinc it s prove the prison went nowher els and we ar readi to ruin a man s life with such tale i shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteen hundr that he had and everi on knew that he wa without monei befor that night who knew it prai the prison ha made a clear and unflinch statement of the sourc of that monei and if you will have it so gentlemen of the juri noth can be more probabl than that statement and more consist with the temper and spirit of the prison the prosecutor is charm with hi own romanc a man of weak will who had brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingli offer by hi betroth could not we ar told have set asid half and sewn it up but would even if he had done so have unpick it everi two dai and taken out a hundr and so would have spent it all in a month all thi you will rememb wa put forward in a tone that brook no contradict but what if the thing happen quit differ what if you ve been weav a romanc and about quit a differ kind of man that s just it you have invent quit a differ man i shall be told perhap there ar wit that he spent on on dai all that three thousand given him by hi betroth a month befor the catastroph so he could not have divid the sum in half but who ar these wit the valu of their evid ha been shown in court alreadi besid in anoth man s hand a crust alwai seem larger and no on of these wit count that monei thei all judg simpli at sight and the wit maximov ha testifi that the prison had twenti thousand in hi hand you see gentlemen of the juri psycholog is a two edg weapon let me turn the other edg now and see what come of it a month befor the catastroph the prison wa entrust by katerina ivanovna with three thousand roubl to send off by post but the question is is it true that thei were entrust to him in such an insult and degrad wai as wa proclaim just now the first statement made by the young ladi on the subject wa differ perfectli differ in the second statement we heard onli cri of resent and reveng cri of long conceal hatr and the veri fact that the wit gave her first evid incorrectli give us a right to conclud that her second piec of evid mai have been incorrect also the prosecutor will not dare not hi own word touch on that stori so be it i will not touch on it either but will onli ventur to observ that if a lofti and high principl person such as that highli respect young ladi unquestion is if such a person i sai allow herself suddenli in court to contradict her first statement with the obviou motiv of ruin the prison it is clear that thi evid ha been given not imparti not coolli have not we the right to assum that a reveng woman might have exagger much ye she mai well have exagger in particular the insult and humili of her offer him the monei no it wa offer in such a wai that it wa possibl to take it especi for a man so easi go as the prison abov all as he expect to receiv shortli from hi father the three thousand roubl that he reckon wa ow to him it wa unreflect of him but it wa just hi irrespons want of reflect that made him so confid that hi father would give him the monei that he would get it and so could alwai dispatch the monei entrust to him and repai the debt but the prosecutor refus to allow that he could the same dai have set asid half the monei and sewn it up in a littl bag that s not hi charact he tell us he couldn t have had such feel but yet he talk himself of the broad karamazov natur he cri out about the two extrem which a karamazov can contempl at onc karamazov is just such a two side natur fluctuat between two extrem that even when move by the most violent crave for riotou gayeti he can pull himself up if someth strike him on the other side and on the other side is love that new love which had flame up in hi heart and for that love he need monei oh far more than for carous with hi mistress if she were to sai to him i am your i won t have fyodor pavlovitch then he must have monei to take her awai that wa more import than carous could a karamazov fail to understand it that anxieti wa just what he wa suffer from what is there improb in hi lai asid that monei and conceal it in case of emerg but time pass and fyodor pavlovitch did not give the prison the expect three thousand on the contrari the latter heard that he meant to us thi sum to seduc the woman he the prison love if fyodor pavlovitch doesn t give the monei he thought i shall be put in the posit of a thief befor katerina ivanovna and then the idea present itself to him that he would go to katerina ivanovna lai befor her the fifteen hundr roubl he still carri round hi neck and sai i am a scoundrel but not a thief so here we have alreadi a twofold reason why he should guard that sum of monei as the appl of hi ey why he shouldn t unpick the littl bag and spend it a hundr at a time why should you deni the prison a sens of honor ye he ha a sens of honor grant that it s misplac grant it s often mistaken yet it exist and amount to a passion and he ha prove that but now the affair becom even more complex hi jealou torment reach a climax and those same two question tortur hi fever brain more and more if i repai katerina ivanovna where can i find the mean to go off with grushenka if he behav wildli drank and made disturb in the tavern in the cours of that month it wa perhap becaus he wa wretch and strain beyond hi power of endur these two question becam so acut that thei drove him at last to despair he sent hi younger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubl but without wait for a repli burst in himself and end by beat the old man in the presenc of wit after that he had no prospect of get it from ani on hi father would not give it him after that beat the same even he struck himself on the breast just on the upper part of the breast where the littl bag wa and swore to hi brother that he had the mean of not be a scoundrel but that still he would remain a scoundrel for he foresaw that he would not us that mean that he wouldn t have the charact that he wouldn t have the will power to do it why why doe the prosecutor refus to believ the evid of alexei karamazov given so genuin and sincer so spontan and convincingli and why on the contrari doe he forc me to believ in monei hidden in a crevic in the dungeon of the castl of udolpho the same even after hi talk with hi brother the prison wrote that fatal letter and that letter is the chief the most stupend proof of the prison have commit robberi i shall beg from everi on and if i don t get it i shall murder my father and shall take the envelop with the pink ribbon on it from under hi mattress as soon as ivan ha gone a full program of the murder we ar told so it must have been he it ha all been done as he wrote cri the prosecutor but in the first place it s the letter of a drunken man and written in great irrit secondli he write of the envelop from what he ha heard from smerdyakov again for he ha not seen the envelop himself and thirdli he wrote it inde but how can you prove that he did it did the prison take the envelop from under the pillow did he find the monei did that monei exist inde and wa it to get monei that the prison ran off if you rememb he ran off post hast not to steal but to find out where she wa the woman who had crush him he wa not run to carri out a program to carri out what he had written that is not for an act of premedit robberi but he ran suddenli spontan in a jealou furi ye i shall be told but when he got there and murder him he seiz the monei too but did he murder him after all the charg of robberi i repudi with indign a man cannot be accus of robberi if it s imposs to state accur what he ha stolen that s an axiom but did he murder him without robberi did he murder him at all is that prove isn t that too a romanc chapter xii and there wa no murder either allow me gentlemen of the juri to remind you that a man s life is at stake and that you must be care we have heard the prosecutor himself admit that until to dai he hesit to accus the prison of a full and consciou premedit of the crime he hesit till he saw that fatal drunken letter which wa produc in court to dai all wa done as written but i repeat again he wa run to her to seek her sole to find out where she wa that s a fact that can t be disput had she been at home he would not have run awai but would have remain at her side and so would not have done what he promis in the letter he ran unexpectedli and accident and by that time veri like he did not even rememb hi drunken letter he snatch up the pestl thei sai and you will rememb how a whole edific of psycholog wa built on that pestl why he wa bound to look at that pestl as a weapon to snatch it up and so on and so on a veri commonplac idea occur to me at thi point what if that pestl had not been in sight had not been ly on the shelf from which it wa snatch by the prison but had been put awai in a cupboard it would not have caught the prison s ey and he would have run awai without a weapon with empti hand and then he would certainli not have kill ani on how then can i look upon the pestl as a proof of premedit ye but he talk in the tavern of murder hi father and two dai befor on the even when he wrote hi drunken letter he wa quiet and onli quarrel with a shopman in the tavern becaus a karamazov could not help quarrel forsooth but my answer to that is that if he wa plan such a murder in accord with hi letter he certainli would not have quarrel even with a shopman and probabl would not have gone into the tavern at all becaus a person plot such a crime seek quiet and retir seek to effac himself to avoid be seen and heard and that not from calcul but from instinct gentlemen of the juri the psycholog method is a two edg weapon and we too can us it as for all thi shout in tavern throughout the month don t we often hear children or drunkard come out of tavern shout i ll kill you but thei don t murder ani on and that fatal letter isn t that simpli drunken irrit too isn t that simpli the shout of the brawler outsid the tavern i ll kill you i ll kill the lot of you why not why could it not be that what reason have we to call that letter fatal rather than absurd becaus hi father ha been found murder becaus a wit saw the prison run out of the garden with a weapon in hi hand and wa knock down by him therefor we ar told everyth wa done as he had plan in write and the letter wa not absurd but fatal now thank god we ve come to the real point sinc he wa in the garden he must have murder him in those few word sinc he wa then he must li the whole case for the prosecut he wa there so he must have and what if there is no must about it even if he wa there oh i admit that the chain of evid the coincid ar realli suggest but examin all these fact separ regardless of their connect why for instanc doe the prosecut refus to admit the truth of the prison s statement that he ran awai from hi father s window rememb the sarcasm in which the prosecutor indulg at the expens of the respect and piou sentiment which suddenli came over the murder but what if there were someth of the sort a feel of religi aw if not of filial respect my mother must have been prai for me at that moment were the prison s word at the preliminari inquiri and so he ran awai as soon as he convinc himself that madam svyetlov wa not in hi father s hous but he could not convinc himself by look through the window the prosecutor object but why couldn t he why the window open at the signal given by the prison some word might have been utter by fyodor pavlovitch some exclam which show the prison that she wa not there why should we assum everyth as we imagin it as we make up our mind to imagin it a thousand thing mai happen in realiti which elud the subtlest imagin ye but grigori saw the door open and so the prison certainli wa in the hous therefor he kill him now about that door gentlemen of the juri observ that we have onli the statement of on wit as to that door and he wa at the time in such a condit that but suppos the door wa open suppos the prison ha li in deni it from an instinct of self defens natur in hi posit suppos he did go into the hous well what then how doe it follow that becaus he wa there he commit the murder he might have dash in run through the room might have push hi father awai might have struck him but as soon as he had made sure madam svyetlov wa not there he mai have run awai rejoic that she wa not there and that he had not kill hi father and it wa perhap just becaus he had escap from the temptat to kill hi father becaus he had a clear conscienc and wa rejoic at not have kill him that he wa capabl of a pure feel the feel of piti and compass and leapt off the fenc a minut later to the assist of grigori after he had in hi excit knock him down with terribl eloqu the prosecutor ha describ to us the dread state of the prison s mind at mokro when love again lai befor him call him to new life while love wa imposs for him becaus he had hi father s bloodstain corps behind him and beyond that corps retribut and yet the prosecutor allow him love which he explain accord to hi method talk about hi drunken condit about a crimin be taken to execut about it be still far off and so on and so on but again i ask mr prosecutor have you not invent a new person is the prison so coars and heartless as to be abl to think at that moment of love and of dodg to escap punish if hi hand were realli stain with hi father s blood no no no as soon as it wa made plain to him that she love him and call him to her side promis him new happi oh then i protest he must have felt the impuls to suicid doubl trebl and must have kill himself if he had hi father s murder on hi conscienc oh no he would not have forgotten where hi pistol lai i know the prison the savag stoni heartless ascrib to him by the prosecutor is inconsist with hi charact he would have kill himself that s certain he did not kill himself just becaus hi mother s prayer had save him and he wa innoc of hi father s blood he wa troubl he wa griev that night at mokro onli about old grigori and prai to god that the old man would recov that hi blow had not been fatal and that he would not have to suffer for it why not accept such an interpret of the fact what trustworthi proof have we that the prison is ly but we shall be told at onc again there is hi father s corps if he ran awai without murder him who did murder him here i repeat you have the whole logic of the prosecut who murder him if not he there s no on to put in hi place gentlemen of the juri is that realli so is it posit actual true that there is no on els at all we ve heard the prosecutor count on hi finger all the person who were in that hous that night thei were five in number three of them i agre could not have been respons the murder man himself old grigori and hi wife there ar left then the prison and smerdyakov and the prosecutor dramat exclaim that the prison point to smerdyakov becaus he had no on els to fix on that had there been a sixth person even a phantom of a sixth person he would have abandon the charg against smerdyakov at onc in shame and have accus that other but gentlemen of the juri why mai i not draw the veri opposit conclus there ar two person the prison and smerdyakov why can i not sai that you accus my client simpli becaus you have no on els to accus and you have no on els onli becaus you have determin to exclud smerdyakov from all suspicion it s true inde smerdyakov is accus onli by the prison hi two brother and madam svyetlov but there ar other who accus him there ar vagu rumor of a question of a suspicion an obscur report a feel of expect final we have the evid of a combin of fact veri suggest though i admit inconclus in the first place we have precis on the dai of the catastroph that fit for the genuin of which the prosecutor for some reason ha felt oblig to make a care defens then smerdyakov s sudden suicid on the ev of the trial then the equal startl evid given in court to dai by the elder of the prison s brother who had believ in hi guilt but ha to dai produc a bundl of note and proclaim smerdyakov as the murder oh i fulli share the court s and the prosecutor s convict that ivan karamazov is suffer from brain fever that hi statement mai realli be a desper effort plan in delirium to save hi brother by throw the guilt on the dead man but again smerdyakov s name is pronounc again there is a suggest of mysteri there is someth unexplain incomplet and perhap it mai on dai be explain but we won t go into that now of that later the court ha resolv to go on with the trial but meantim i might make a few remark about the charact sketch of smerdyakov drawn with subtleti and talent by the prosecutor but while i admir hi talent i cannot agre with him i have visit smerdyakov i have seen him and talk to him and he made a veri differ impress on me he wa weak in health it is true but in charact in spirit he wa by no mean the weak man the prosecutor ha made him out to be i found in him no trace of the timid on which the prosecutor so insist there wa no simplic about him either i found in him on the contrari an extrem mistrust conceal under a mask of na vet and an intellig of consider rang the prosecutor wa too simpl in take him for weak mind he made a veri definit impress on me i left him with the convict that he wa a distinctli spite creatur excess ambiti vindict and intens enviou i made some inquiri he resent hi parentag wa asham of it and would clench hi teeth when he rememb that he wa the son of stink lizaveta he wa disrespect to the servant grigori and hi wife who had care for him in hi childhood he curs and jeer at russia he dream of go to franc and becom a frenchman he us often to sai that he hadn t the mean to do so i fanci he love no on but himself and had a strang high opinion of himself hi concept of cultur wa limit to good cloth clean shirt front and polish boot believ himself to be the illegitim son of fyodor pavlovitch there is evid of thi he might well have resent hi posit compar with that of hi master s legitim son thei had everyth he noth thei had all the right thei had the inherit while he wa onli the cook he told me himself that he had help fyodor pavlovitch to put the note in the envelop the destin of that sum a sum which would have made hi career must have been hate to him moreov he saw three thousand roubl in new rainbow color note i ask him about that on purpos oh bewar of show an ambiti and enviou man a larg sum of monei at onc and it wa the first time he had seen so much monei in the hand of on man the sight of the rainbow color note mai have made a morbid impress on hi imagin but with no immedi result the talent prosecutor with extraordinari subtleti sketch for us all the argument for and against the hypothesi of smerdyakov s guilt and ask us in particular what motiv he had in feign a fit but he mai not have been feign at all the fit mai have happen quit natur but it mai have pass off quit natur and the sick man mai have recov not complet perhap but still regain conscious as happen with epilept the prosecutor ask at what moment could smerdyakov have commit the murder but it is veri easi to point out that moment he might have wake up from deep sleep for he wa onli asleep an epilept fit is alwai follow by a deep sleep at that moment when the old grigori shout at the top of hi voic parricid that shout in the dark and still mai have wake smerdyakov whose sleep mai have been less sound at the moment he might natur have wake up an hour befor get out of bed he goe almost unconsci and with no definit motiv toward the sound to see what s the matter hi head is still cloud with hi attack hi faculti ar half asleep but onc in the garden he walk to the light window and he hear terribl new from hi master who would be of cours glad to see him hi mind set to work at onc he hear all the detail from hi frighten master and gradual in hi disord brain there shape itself an idea terribl but seduct and irresist logic to kill the old man take the three thousand and throw all the blame on to hi young master a terribl lust of monei of booti might seiz upon him as he realiz hi secur from detect oh these sudden and irresist impuls come so often when there is a favor opportun and especi with murder who have had no idea of commit a murder beforehand and smerdyakov mai have gone in and carri out hi plan with what weapon why with ani stone pick up in the garden but what for with what object why the three thousand which mean a career for him oh i am not contradict myself the monei mai have exist and perhap smerdyakov alon knew where to find it where hi master kept it and the cover of the monei the torn envelop on the floor just now when the prosecutor wa explain hi subtl theori that onli an inexperienc thief like karamazov would have left the envelop on the floor and not on like smerdyakov who would have avoid leav a piec of evid against himself i thought as i listen that i wa hear someth veri familiar and would you believ it i have heard that veri argument that veri conjectur of how karamazov would have behav precis two dai befor from smerdyakov himself what s more it struck me at the time i fanci that there wa an artifici simplic about him that he wa in a hurri to suggest thi idea to me that i might fanci it wa my own he insinu it as it were did he not insinu the same idea at the inquiri and suggest it to the talent prosecutor i shall be ask what about the old woman grigori s wife she heard the sick man moan close by all night ye she heard it but that evid is extrem unreli i knew a ladi who complain bitterli that she had been kept awak all night by a dog in the yard yet the poor beast it appear had onli yelp onc or twice in the night and that s natur if ani on is asleep and hear a groan he wake up annoi at be wake but instantli fall asleep again two hour later again a groan he wake up and fall asleep again and the same thing again two hour later three time altogeth in the night next morn the sleeper wake up and complain that some on ha been groan all night and keep him awak and it is bound to seem so to him the interv of two hour of sleep he doe not rememb he onli rememb the moment of wake so he feel he ha been wake up all night but why why ask the prosecutor did not smerdyakov confess in hi last letter why did hi conscienc prompt him to on step and not to both but excus me conscienc impli penit and the suicid mai not have felt penit but onli despair despair and penit ar two veri differ thing despair mai be vindict and irreconcil and the suicid lai hi hand on himself mai well have felt redoubl hatr for those whom he had envi all hi life gentlemen of the juri bewar of a miscarriag of justic what is there unlik in all i have put befor you just now find the error in my reason find the imposs the absurd and if there is but a shade of possibl but a shade of probabl in my proposit do not condemn him and is there onli a shade i swear by all that is sacr i fulli believ in the explan of the murder i have just put forward what troubl me and make me indign is that of all the mass of fact heap up by the prosecut against the prison there is not a singl on certain and irrefut and yet the unhappi man is to be ruin by the accumul of these fact ye the accumul effect is aw the blood the blood drip from hi finger the bloodstain shirt the dark night resound with the shout parricid and the old man fall with a broken head and then the mass of phrase statement gestur shout oh thi ha so much influenc it can so bia the mind but gentlemen of the juri can it bia your mind rememb you have been given absolut power to bind and to loos but the greater the power the more terribl it respons i do not draw back on iota from what i have said just now but suppos for on moment i agre with the prosecut that my luckless client had stain hi hand with hi father s blood thi is onli hypothesi i repeat i never for on instant doubt of hi innoc but so be it i assum that my client is guilti of parricid even so hear what i have to sai i have it in my heart to sai someth more to you for i feel that there must be a great conflict in your heart and mind forgiv my refer to your heart and mind gentlemen of the juri but i want to be truth and sincer to the end let us all be sincer at thi point the speech wa interrupt by rather loud applaus the last word inde were pronounc with a note of such sincer that everi on felt that he realli might have someth to sai and that what he wa about to sai would be of the greatest consequ but the presid hear the applaus in a loud voic threaten to clear the court if such an incid were repeat everi sound wa hush and fetyukovitch began in a voic full of feel quit unlik the tone he had us hitherto chapter xiii a corrupt of thought it s not onli the accumul of fact that threaten my client with ruin gentlemen of the juri he began what is realli damn for my client is on fact the dead bodi of hi father had it been an ordinari case of murder you would have reject the charg in view of the trivial the incomplet and the fantast charact of the evid if you examin each part of it separ or at least you would have hesit to ruin a man s life simpli from the prejudic against him which he ha ala onli too well deserv but it s not an ordinari case of murder it s a case of parricid that impress men s mind and to such a degre that the veri trivial and incomplet of the evid becom less trivial and less incomplet even to an unprejud mind how can such a prison be acquit what if he commit the murder and get off unpunish that is what everi on almost involuntarili instinct feel at heart ye it s a fear thing to shed a father s blood the father who ha begotten me love me not spare hi life for me griev over my ill from childhood up troubl all hi life for my happi and ha live in my joi in my success to murder such a father that s inconceiv gentlemen of the juri what is a father a real father what is the mean of that great word what is the great idea in that name we have just indic in part what a true father is and what he ought to be in the case in which we ar now so deepli occupi and over which our heart ar ach in the present case the father fyodor pavlovitch karamazov did not correspond to that concept of a father to which we have just refer that s the misfortun and inde some father ar a misfortun let us examin thi misfortun rather more close we must shrink from noth gentlemen of the juri consid the import of the decis you have to make it s our particular duti not to shrink from ani idea like children or frighten women as the talent prosecutor happili express it but in the cours of hi heat speech my esteem oppon and he wa my oppon befor i open my lip exclaim sever time oh i will not yield the defens of the prison to the lawyer who ha come down from petersburg i accus but i defend also he exclaim that sever time but forgot to mention that if thi terribl prison wa for twenti three year so grate for a mere pound of nut given him by the onli man who had been kind to him as a child in hi father s hous might not such a man well have rememb for twenti three year how he ran in hi father s back yard without boot on hi feet and with hi littl trouser hang by on button to us the express of the kind heart doctor herzenstub oh gentlemen of the juri why need we look more close at thi misfortun why repeat what we all know alreadi what did my client meet with when he arriv here at hi father s hous and why depict my client as a heartless egoist and monster he is uncontrol he is wild and unruli we ar try him now for that but who is respons for hi life who is respons for hi have receiv such an unseemli bring up in spite of hi excel disposit and hi grate and sensit heart did ani on train him to be reason wa he enlighten by studi did ani on love him ever so littl in hi childhood my client wa left to the care of provid like a beast of the field he thirst perhap to see hi father after long year of separ a thousand time perhap he mai recal hi childhood have driven awai the loathsom phantom that haunt hi childish dream and with all hi heart he mai have long to embrac and to forgiv hi father and what await him he wa met by cynic taunt suspicion and wrangl about monei he heard noth but revolt talk and viciou precept utter daili over the brandi and at last he saw hi father seduc hi mistress from him with hi own monei oh gentlemen of the juri that wa cruel and revolt and that old man wa alwai complain of the disrespect and cruelti of hi son he slander him in societi injur him calumni him bought up hi unpaid debt to get him thrown into prison gentlemen of the juri peopl like my client who ar fierc unruli and uncontrol on the surfac ar sometim most frequent inde exceedingli tender heart onli thei don t express it don t laugh don t laugh at my idea the talent prosecutor laugh mercilessli just now at my client for love schiller love the sublim and beauti i should not have laugh at that in hi place ye such natur oh let me speak in defens of such natur so often and so cruelli misunderstood these natur often thirst for tender good and justic as it were in contrast to themselv their unruli their feroc thei thirst for it unconsci passion and fierc on the surfac thei ar painfulli capabl of love woman for instanc and with a spiritu and elev love again do not laugh at me thi is veri often the case in such natur but thei cannot hide their passion sometim veri coars and that is conspicu and is notic but the inner man is unseen their passion ar quickli exhaust but by the side of a nobl and lofti creatur that seemingli coars and rough man seek a new life seek to correct himself to be better to becom nobl and honor sublim and beauti howev much the express ha been ridicul i said just now that i would not ventur to touch upon my client s engag but i mai sai half a word what we heard just now wa not evid but onli the scream of a frenzi and reveng woman and it wa not for her oh not for her to reproach him with treacheri for she ha betrai him if she had had but a littl time for reflect she would not have given such evid oh do not believ her no my client is not a monster as she call him the lover of mankind on the ev of hi crucifixion said i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lai down hi life for hi sheep so that not on of them might be lost let not a man s soul be lost through us i ask just now what doe father mean and exclaim that it wa a great word a preciou name but on must us word honestli gentlemen and i ventur to call thing by their right name such a father as old karamazov cannot be call a father and doe not deserv to be filial love for an unworthi father is an absurd an imposs love cannot be creat from noth onli god can creat someth from noth father provok not your children to wrath the apostl write from a heart glow with love it s not for the sake of my client that i quot these sacr word i mention them for all father who ha author me to preach to father no on but as a man and a citizen i make my appeal vivo voco we ar not long on earth we do mani evil deed and sai mani evil word so let us all catch a favor moment when we ar all togeth to sai a good word to each other that s what i am do while i am in thi place i take advantag of my opportun not for noth is thi tribun given us by the highest author all russia hear us i am not speak onli for the father here present i cry aloud to all father father provok not your children to wrath ye let us first fulfil christ s injunct ourselv and onli then ventur to expect it of our children otherwis we ar not father but enemi of our children and thei ar not our children but our enemi and we have made them our enemi ourselv what measur ye mete it shall be measur unto you again it s not i who sai that it s the gospel precept measur to other accord as thei measur to you how can we blame children if thei measur us accord to our measur not long ago a servant girl in finland wa suspect of have secretli given birth to a child she wa watch and a box of which no on knew anyth wa found in the corner of the loft behind some brick it wa open and insid wa found the bodi of a new born child which she had kill in the same box were found the skeleton of two other babi which accord to her own confess she had kill at the moment of their birth gentlemen of the juri wa she a mother to her children she gave birth to them inde but wa she a mother to them would ani on ventur to give her the sacr name of mother let us be bold gentlemen let us be audaci even it s our duti to be so at thi moment and not to be afraid of certain word and idea like the moscow women in ostrovski s plai who ar scare at the sound of certain word no let us prove that the progress of the last few year ha touch even us and let us sai plainli the father is not mere he who beget the child but he who beget it and doe hi duti by it oh of cours there is the other mean there is the other interpret of the word father which insist that ani father even though he be a monster even though he be the enemi of hi children still remain my father simpli becaus he begot me but thi is so to sai the mystic mean which i cannot comprehend with my intellect but can onli accept by faith or better to sai on faith like mani other thing which i do not understand but which religion bid me believ but in that case let it be kept outsid the sphere of actual life in the sphere of actual life which ha inde it own right but also lai upon us great duti and oblig in that sphere if we want to be human christian in fact we must or ought to act onli upon convict justifi by reason and experi which have been pass through the crucibl of analysi in a word we must act ration and not as though in dream and delirium that we mai not do harm that we mai not ill treat and ruin a man then it will be real christian work not onli mystic but ration and philanthrop there wa violent applaus at thi passag from mani part of the court but fetyukovitch wave hi hand as though implor them to let him finish without interrupt the court relaps into silenc at onc the orat went on do you suppos gentlemen that our children as thei grow up and begin to reason can avoid such question no thei cannot and we will not impos on them an imposs restrict the sight of an unworthi father involuntarili suggest torment question to a young creatur especi when he compar him with the excel father of hi companion the convent answer to thi question is he begot you and you ar hi flesh and blood and therefor you ar bound to love him the youth involuntarili reflect but did he love me when he begot me he ask wonder more and more wa it for my sake he begot me he did not know me not even my sex at that moment at the moment of passion perhap inflam by wine and he ha onli transmit to me a propens to drunken that s all he s done for me why am i bound to love him simpli for beget me when he ha care noth for me all my life after oh perhap those question strike you as coars and cruel but do not expect an imposs restraint from a young mind drive natur out of the door and it will fly in at the window and abov all let us not be afraid of word but decid the question accord to the dictat of reason and human and not of mystic idea how shall it be decid why like thi let the son stand befor hi father and ask him father tell me why must i love you father show me that i must love you and if that father is abl to answer him and show him good reason we have a real normal parent relat not rest on mystic prejudic but on a ration respons and strictli humanitarian basi but if he doe not there s an end to the famili tie he is not a father to him and the son ha a right to look upon him as a stranger and even an enemi our tribun gentlemen of the juri ought to be a school of true and sound idea here the orat wa interrupt by irrepress and almost frantic applaus of cours it wa not the whole audienc but a good half of it applaud the father and mother present applaud shriek and exclam were heard from the galleri where the ladi were sit handkerchief were wave the presid began ring hi bell with all hi might he wa obvious irrit by the behavior of the audienc but did not ventur to clear the court as he had threaten even person of high posit old men with star on their breast sit on special reserv seat behind the judg applaud the orat and wave their handkerchief so that when the nois di down the presid confin himself to repeat hi stern threat to clear the court and fetyukovitch excit and triumphant continu hi speech gentlemen of the juri you rememb that aw night of which so much ha been said to dai when the son got over the fenc and stood face to face with the enemi and persecutor who had begotten him i insist most emphat it wa not for monei he ran to hi father s hous the charg of robberi is an absurd as i prove befor and it wa not to murder him he broke into the hous oh no if he had had that design he would at least have taken the precaut of arm himself beforehand the brass pestl he caught up instinct without know why he did it grant that he deceiv hi father by tap at the window grant that he made hi wai in i ve said alreadi that i do not for a moment believ that legend but let it be so let us suppos it for a moment gentlemen i swear to you by all that s holi if it had not been hi father but an ordinari enemi he would after run through the room and satisfi himself that the woman wa not there have made off post hast without do ani harm to hi rival he would have struck him push him awai perhap noth more for he had no thought and no time to spare for that what he want to know wa where she wa but hi father hi father the mere sight of the father who had hate him from hi childhood had been hi enemi hi persecutor and now hi unnatur rival wa enough a feel of hatr came over him involuntarili irresist cloud hi reason it all surg up in on moment it wa an impuls of mad and insan but also an impuls of natur irresist and unconsci like everyth in natur aveng the violat of it etern law but the prison even then did not murder him i maintain that i cry that aloud no he onli brandish the pestl in a burst of indign disgust not mean to kill him not know that he would kill him had he not had thi fatal pestl in hi hand he would have onli knock hi father down perhap but would not have kill him as he ran awai he did not know whether he had kill the old man such a murder is not a murder such a murder is not a parricid no the murder of such a father cannot be call parricid such a murder can onli be reckon parricid by prejudic but i appeal to you again and again from the depth of my soul did thi murder actual take place gentlemen of the juri if we convict and punish him he will sai to himself these peopl have done noth for my bring up for my educ noth to improv my lot noth to make me better noth to make me a man these peopl have not given me to eat and to drink have not visit me in prison and naked and here thei have sent me to penal servitud i am quit i ow them noth now and ow no on anyth for ever thei ar wick and i will be wick thei ar cruel and i will be cruel that is what he will sai gentlemen of the juri and i swear by find him guilti you will onli make it easier for him you will eas hi conscienc he will curs the blood he ha shed and will not regret it at the same time you will destroi in him the possibl of becom a new man for he will remain in hi wicked and blind all hi life but do you want to punish him fearfulli terribl with the most aw punish that could be imagin and at the same time to save him and regener hi soul if so overwhelm him with your merci you will see you will hear how he will trembl and be horror struck how can i endur thi merci how can i endur so much love am i worthi of it that s what he will exclaim oh i know i know that heart that wild but grate heart gentlemen of the juri it will bow befor your merci it thirst for a great and love action it will melt and mount upward there ar soul which in their limit blame the whole world but subdu such a soul with merci show it love and it will curs it past for there ar mani good impuls in it such a heart will expand and see that god is merci and that men ar good and just he will be horror stricken he will be crush by remors and the vast oblig laid upon him henceforth and he will not sai then i am quit but will sai i am guilti in the sight of all men and am more unworthi than all with tear of penit and poignant tender anguish he will exclaim other ar better than i thei want to save me not to ruin me oh thi act of merci is so easi for you for in the absenc of anyth like real evid it will be too aw for you to pronounc ye he is guilti better acquit ten guilti men than punish on innoc man do you hear do you hear that majest voic from the past centuri of our gloriou histori it is not for an insignific person like me to remind you that the russian court doe not exist for the punish onli but also for the salvat of the crimin let other nation think of retribut and the letter of the law we will cling to the spirit and the mean the salvat and the reform of the lost if thi is true if russia and her justic ar such she mai go forward with good cheer do not try to scare us with your frenzi troika from which all the nation stand asid in disgust not a runawai troika but the state chariot of russia will move calmli and majest to it goal in your hand is the fate of my client in your hand is the fate of russian justic you will defend it you will save it you will prove that there ar men to watch over it that it is in good hand chapter xiv the peasant stand firm thi wa how fetyukovitch conclud hi speech and the enthusiasm of the audienc burst like an irresist storm it wa out of the question to stop it the women wept mani of the men wept too even two import personag shed tear the presid submit and even postpon ring hi bell the suppress of such an enthusiasm would be the suppress of someth sacr as the ladi cri afterward the orat himself wa genuin touch and it wa at thi moment that ippolit kirillovitch got up to make certain object peopl look at him with hatr what what s the mean of it he posit dare to make object the ladi babbl but if the whole world of ladi includ hi wife had protest he could not have been stop at that moment he wa pale he wa shake with emot hi first phrase were even unintellig he gasp for breath could hardli speak clearli lost the thread but he soon recov himself of thi new speech of hi i will quot onli a few sentenc i am reproach with have woven a romanc but what is thi defens if not on romanc on the top of anoth all that wa lack wa poetri fyodor pavlovitch while wait for hi mistress tear open the envelop and throw it on the floor we ar even told what he said while engag in thi strang act is not thi a flight of fanci and what proof have we that he had taken out the monei who heard what he said the weak mind idiot smerdyakov transform into a byron hero aveng societi for hi illegitim birth isn t thi a romanc in the byron style and the son who break into hi father s hous and murder him without murder him is not even a romanc thi is a sphinx set us a riddl which he cannot solv himself if he murder him he murder him and what s the mean of hi murder him without have murder him who can make head or tail of thi then we ar admonish that our tribun is a tribun of true and sound idea and from thi tribun of sound idea is heard a solemn declar that to call the murder of a father parricid is noth but a prejudic but if parricid is a prejudic and if everi child is to ask hi father why he is to love him what will becom of us what will becom of the foundat of societi what will becom of the famili parricid it appear is onli a bogi of moscow merchant wive the most preciou the most sacr guarante for the destini and futur of russian justic ar present to us in a pervert and frivol form simpli to attain an object to obtain the justif of someth which cannot be justifi oh crush him by merci cri the counsel for the defens but that s all the crimin want and to morrow it will be seen how much he is crush and is not the counsel for the defens too modest in ask onli for the acquitt of the prison why not found a chariti in the honor of the parricid to commemor hi exploit among futur gener religion and the gospel ar correct that s all mystic we ar told and our is the onli true christian which ha been subject to the analysi of reason and common sens and so thei set up befor us a fals semblanc of christ what measur ye mete so it shall be mete unto you again cri the counsel for the defens and instantli deduc that christ teach us to measur as it is measur to us and thi from the tribun of truth and sound sens we peep into the gospel onli on the ev of make speech in order to dazzl the audienc by our acquaint with what is anywai a rather origin composit which mai be of us to produc a certain effect all to serv the purpos but what christ command us is someth veri differ he bid us bewar of do thi becaus the wick world doe thi but we ought to forgiv and to turn the other cheek and not to measur to our persecutor as thei measur to us thi is what our god ha taught us and not that to forbid children to murder their father is a prejudic and we will not from the tribun of truth and good sens correct the gospel of our lord whom the counsel for the defens deign to call onli the crucifi lover of human in opposit to all orthodox russia which call to him for thou art our god at thi the presid interven and check the over zealou speaker beg him not to exagger not to overstep the bound and so on as presid alwai do in such case the audienc too wa uneasi the public wa restless there were even exclam of indign fetyukovitch did not so much as repli he onli mount the tribun to lai hi hand on hi heart and with an offend voic utter a few word full of digniti he onli touch again lightli and iron on romanc and psycholog and in an appropri place quot jupit you ar angri therefor you ar wrong which provok a burst of approv laughter in the audienc for ippolit kirillovitch wa by no mean like jupit then propo of the accus that he wa teach the young gener to murder their father fetyukovitch observ with great digniti that he would not even answer as for the prosecutor s charg of utter unorthodox opinion fetyukovitch hint that it wa a person insinu and that he had expect in thi court to be secur from accus damag to my reput as a citizen and a loyal subject but at these word the presid pull him up too and fetyukovitch conclud hi speech with a bow amid a hum of approb in the court and ippolit kirillovitch wa in the opinion of our ladi crush for good then the prison wa allow to speak mitya stood up but said veri littl he wa fearfulli exhaust physic and mental the look of strength and independ with which he had enter in the morn had almost disappear he seem as though he had pass through an experi that dai which had taught him for the rest of hi life someth veri import he had not understood till then hi voic wa weak he did not shout as befor in hi word there wa a new note of humil defeat and submiss what am i to sai gentlemen of the juri the hour of judgment ha come for me i feel the hand of god upon me the end ha come to an er man but befor god i repeat to you i am innoc of my father s blood for the last time i repeat it wasn t i kill him i wa er but i love what is good everi instant i strove to reform but i live like a wild beast i thank the prosecutor he told me mani thing about myself that i did not know but it s not true that i kill my father the prosecutor is mistaken i thank my counsel too i cri listen to him but it s not true that i kill my father and he needn t have suppos it and don t believ the doctor i am perfectli sane onli my heart is heavi if you spare me if you let me go i will prai for you i will be a better man i give you my word befor god i will and if you will condemn me i ll break my sword over my head myself and kiss the piec but spare me do not rob me of my god i know myself i shall rebel my heart is heavi gentlemen spare me he almost fell back in hi place hi voic broke he could hardli articul the last phrase then the judg proceed to put the question and began to ask both side to formul their conclus but i will not describ the detail at last the juri rose to retir for consult the presid wa veri tire and so hi last charg to the juri wa rather feebl be imparti don t be influenc by the eloqu of the defens but yet weigh the argument rememb that there is a great respons laid upon you and so on and so on the juri withdrew and the court adjourn peopl could get up move about exchang their accumul impress refresh themselv at the buffet it wa veri late almost on o clock in the night but nobodi went awai the strain wa so great that no on could think of repos all wait with sink heart though that is perhap too much to sai for the ladi were onli in

who were convinc that an acquitt wa inevit some were pleas other frown while some were simpli deject not want him to be acquit fetyukovitch himself wa confid of hi success he wa surround by peopl congratul him and fawn upon him there ar he said to on group as i wa told afterward there ar invis thread bind the counsel for the defens with the juri on feel dure on s speech if thei ar be form i wa
