bad friend why do you sai that becaus it is true i am charm to my friend on dai and forget all about them the next i dont know what impel me but i wa nettl and i said foolishli and not in the best of tast yet you seem to be invari charm to dr bauerstein instantli i regret my word her face stiffen i had the impress of a steel curtain come down and blot out the real woman without a word she turn and went swiftli up the stair whilst i stood like an idiot gape after her i wa recal to other matter by a fright row go on below i could hear poirot shout and expound i wa vex to think that my diplomaci had been in vain the littl man appear to be take the whole hous into hi confid a proceed of which i for on doubt the wisdom onc again i could not help regret that my friend wa so prone to lose hi head in moment of excit i step briskli down the stair the sight of me calm poirot almost immedi i drew him asid my dear fellow i said is thi wise sure you dont want the whole hous to know of thi occurr you ar actual plai into the crimin hand you think so hast i am sure of it well well my friend i will be guid by you good although unfortun it is a littl too late now sure he look so crestfallen and abash that i felt quit sorri though i still thought my rebuk a just and wise on well he said at last let us go mon ami you have finish here for the moment ye you will walk back with me to the villag willingli he pick up hi littl suitcas and we went out through the open window in the drawingroom cynthia murdoch wa just come in and poirot stood asid to let her pass excus me mademoisel on minut ye she turn inquiringli did you ever make up mr inglethorp medicin a slight flush rose in her face as she answer rather constrainedli no onli her powder the flush deepen as cynthia repli oh ye i did make up some sleep powder for her onc these poirot produc the empti box which had contain powder she nod can you tell me what thei were sulphon veron no thei were bromid powder ah thank you mademoisel good morn as we walk briskli awai from the hous i glanc at him more than onc i had often befor notic that if anyth excit him hi ey turn green like a cat thei were shine like emerald now my friend he broke out at last i have a littl idea a veri strang and probabl utterli imposs idea and yetit fit in i shrug my shoulder i privat thought that poirot wa rather too much given to these fantast idea in thi case sure the truth wa onli too plain and appar so that is the explan of the blank label on the box i remark veri simpl as you said i realli wonder that i did not think of it myself poirot did not appear to be listen to me thei have made on more discoveri laba he observ jerk hi thumb over hi shoulder in the direct of style mr well told me as we were go upstair what wa it lock up in the desk in the boudoir thei found a will of mr inglethorp date befor her marriag leav her fortun to alfr inglethorp it must have been made just at the time thei were engag it came quit as a surpris to wellsand to john cavendish also it wa written on on of those print will form and wit by two of the servantsnot dorca did mr inglethorp know of it he sai not on might take that with a grain of salt i remark sceptic all these will ar veri confus tell me how did those scribbl word on the envelop help you to discov that a will wa made yesterdai afternoon poirot smile mon ami have you ever when write a letter been arrest by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word ye often i suppos everi on ha exactli and have you not in such a case tri the word onc or twice on the edg of the blottingpap or a spare scrap of paper to see if it look right well that is what mr inglethorp did you will notic that the word possess is spelt first with on s and subsequ with twocorrectli to make sure she had further tri it in a sentenc thu i am possess now what did that tell me it told me that mr inglethorp had been write the word possess that afternoon and have the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind the possibl of a willa document almost certain to contain that wordoccur to me at onc thi possibl wa confirm by a further circumst in the gener confus the boudoir had not been swept that morn and near the desk were sever trace of brown mould and earth the weather had been perfectli fine for some dai and no ordinari boot would have left such a heavi deposit i stroll to the window and saw at onc that the begonia bed had been newli plant the mould in the bed wa exactli similar to that on the floor of the boudoir and also i learnt from you that thei had been plant yesterdai afternoon i wa now sure that on or possibl both of the gardenersfor there were two set of footprint in the bedhad enter the boudoir for if mr inglethorp had mere wish to speak to them she would in all probabl have stood at the window and thei would not have come into the room at all i wa now quit convinc that she had made a fresh will and had call the two garden in to wit her signatur event prove that i wa right in my supposit that wa veri ingeni i could not help admit i must confess that the conclus i drew from those few scribbl word were quit erron he smile you gave too much rein to your imagin imagin is a good servant and a bad master the simplest explan is alwai the most like anoth pointhow did you know that the kei of the despatchcas had been lost i did not know it it wa a guess that turn out to be correct you observ that it had a piec of twist wire through the handl that suggest to me at onc that it had possibl been wrench off a flimsi keyr now if it had been lost and recov mr inglethorp would at onc have replac it on her bunch but on her bunch i found what wa obvious the duplic kei veri new and bright which led me to the hypothesi that somebodi els had insert the origin kei in the lock of the despatchcas ye i said alfr inglethorp without doubt poirot look at me curious you ar veri sure of hi guilt well natur everi fresh circumst seem to establish it more clearli on the contrari said poirot quietli there ar sever point in hi favour oh come now ye i see onli on and that that he wa not in the hous last night bad shot as you english sai you have chosen the on point that to my mind tell against him how is that becaus if mr inglethorp knew that hi wife would be poison last night he would certainli have arrang to be awai from the hous hi excus wa an obvious trump up on that leav us two possibl either he knew what wa go to happen or he had a reason of hi own for hi absenc and that reason i ask sceptic poirot shrug hi shoulder how should i know discredit without doubt thi mr inglethorp i should sai is somewhat of a scoundrelbut that doe not of necess make him a murder i shook my head unconvinc we do not agre eh said poirot well let us leav it time will show which of us is right now let us turn to other aspect of the case what do you make of the fact that all the door of the bedroom were bolt on the insid well i consid on must look at it logic true i should put it thi wai the door were boltedour own ey have told us thatyet the presenc of the candl greas on the floor and the destruct of the will prove that dure the night someon enter the room you agre so far perfectli put with admir clear proce well i said encourag as the person who enter did not do so by the window nor by miracul mean it follow that the door must have been open from insid by mr inglethorp herself that strengthen the convict that the person in question wa her husband she would natur open the door to her own husband poirot shook hi head why should she she had bolt the door lead into hi rooma most unusu proceed on her partsh had had a most violent quarrel with him that veri afternoon no he wa the last person she would admit but you agre with me that the door must have been open by mr inglethorp herself there is anoth possibl she mai have forgotten to bolt the door into the passag when she went to bed and have got up later toward morn and bolt it then poirot is that serious your opinion no i do not sai it is so but it might be now to turn to anoth featur what do you make of the scrap of convers you overheard between mr cavendish and her motherinlaw i had forgotten that i said thoughtfulli that is as enigmat as ever it seem incred that a woman like mr cavendish proud and retic to the last degre should interfer so violent in what wa certainli not her affair precis it wa an astonish thing for a woman of her breed to do it is certainli curiou i agre still it is unimport and need not be taken into account a groan burst from poirot what have i alwai told you everyth must be taken into account if the fact will not fit the theorylet the theori go well we shall see i said nettl ye we shall see we had reach leastwai cottag and poirot usher me upstair to hi own room he offer me on of the tini russian cigarett he himself occasion smoke i wa amus to notic that he stow awai the us match most carefulli in a littl china pot my momentari annoy vanish poirot had place our two chair in front of the open window which command a view of the villag street the fresh air blew in warm and pleasant it wa go to be a hot dai suddenli my attent wa arrest by a weedi look young man rush down the street at a great pace it wa the express on hi face that wa extraordinarya curiou mingl of terror and agit look poirot i said he leant forward tien he said it is mr mace from the chemist shop he is come here the young man came to a halt befor leastwai cottag and after hesit a moment pound vigor at the door a littl minut cri poirot from the window i come motion to me to follow him he ran swiftli down the stair and open the door mr mace began at onc oh mr poirot im sorri for the inconveni but i heard that youd just come back from the hall ye we have the young man moisten hi dry lip hi face wa work curious it all over the villag about old mr inglethorp dy so suddenli thei do sai he lower hi voic cautiouslythat it poison poirot face remain quit impass onli the doctor can tell us that mr mace ye exactlyof cours the young man hesit and then hi agit wa too much for him he clutch poirot by the arm and sank hi voic to a whisper just tell me thi mr poirot it isntit isnt strychnin is it i hardli heard what poirot repli someth evid of a noncommitt natur the young man depart and as he close the door poirot ey met mine ye he said nod grave he will have evid to give at the inquest we went slowli upstair again i wa open my lip when poirot stop me with a gestur of hi hand not now not now mon ami i have need of reflect my mind is in some disorderwhich is not well for about ten minut he sat in dead silenc perfectli still except for sever express motion of hi eyebrow and all the time hi ey grew steadili greener at last he heav a deep sigh it is well the bad moment ha pass now all is arrang and classifi on must never permit confus the case is not clear yetno for it is of the most complic it puzzl me me hercul poirot there ar two fact of signific and what ar thei the first is the state of the weather yesterdai that is veri import but it wa a gloriou dai i interrupt poirot your pull my leg not at all the thermomet regist degre in the shade do not forget that my friend it is the kei to the whole riddl and the second point i ask the import fact that monsieur inglethorp wear veri peculiar cloth ha a black beard and us glass poirot i cannot believ you ar seriou i am absolut seriou my friend but thi is childish no it is veri moment and suppos the coron juri return a verdict of wil murder against alfr inglethorp what becom of your theori then thei would not be shaken becaus twelv stupid men had happen to make a mistak but that will not occur for on thing a countri juri is not anxiou to take respons upon itself and mr inglethorp stand practic in the posit of local squir also he ad placidli i should not allow it you would not allow it no i look at the extraordinari littl man divid between annoy and amus he wa so tremend sure of himself as though he read my thought he nod gentli oh ye mon ami i would do what i sai he got up and laid hi hand on my shoulder hi physiognomi underw a complet chang tear came into hi ey in all thi you see i think of that poor mr inglethorp who is dead she wa not extravagantli lovedno but she wa veri good to us belgiansi ow her a debt i endeavour to interrupt but poirot swept on let me tell you thi hast she would never forgiv me if i let alfr inglethorp her husband be arrest nowwhen a word from me could save him chapter vi the inquest in the interv befor the inquest poirot wa unfail in hi activ twice he wa closet with mr well he also took long walk into the countri i rather resent hi not take me into hi confid the more so as i could not in the least guess what he wa drive at it occur to me that he might have been make inquiri at raikess farm so find him out when i call at leastwai cottag on wednesdai even i walk over there by the field hope to meet him but there wa no sign of him and i hesit to go right up to the farm itself as i walk awai i met an ag rustic who leer at me cunningli youm from the hall baint you he ask ye im look for a friend of mine whom i thought might have walk thi wai a littl chap as wave hi hand when he talk on of them belgi from the villag ye i said eagerli he ha been here then oh ay he been here right enough moren onc too friend of your is he ah you gentlemen from the hallyoun a pretti lot and he leer more jocos than ever why do the gentlemen from the hall come here often i ask as carelessli as i could he wink at me knowingli on doe mister name no name mind and a veri liber gentleman too oh thank you sir im sure i walk on sharpli evelyn howard had been right then and i experienc a sharp twing of disgust as i thought of alfr inglethorp liber with anoth woman monei had that piquant gipsi face been at the bottom of the crime or wa it the baser mainspr of monei probabl a judici mixtur of both on on point poirot seem to have a curiou obsess he onc or twice observ to me that he thought dorca must have made an error in fix the time of the quarrel he suggest to her repeatedli that it wa and not oclock when she had heard the voic but dorca wa unshaken quit an hour or even more had elaps between the time when she had heard the voic and oclock when she had taken tea to her mistress the inquest wa held on fridai at the stylit arm in the villag poirot and i sat togeth not be requir to give evid the preliminari were gone through the juri view the bodi and john cavendish gave evid of identif further question he describ hi awaken in the earli hour of the morn and the circumst of hi mother death the medic evid wa next taken there wa a breathless hush and everi ey wa fix on the famou london specialist who wa known to be on of the greatest author of the dai on the subject of toxicolog in a few brief word he sum up the result of the postmortem shorn of it medic phraseolog and technic it amount to the fact that mr inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnin poison judg from the quantiti recov she must have taken not less than threequart of a grain of strychnin but probabl on grain or slightli over is it possibl that she could have swallow the poison by accid ask the coron i should consid it veri unlik strychnin is not us for domest purpos as some poison ar and there ar restrict place on it sale doe anyth in your examin lead you to determin how the poison wa administ no you arriv at style befor dr wilkin i believ that is so the motor met me just outsid the lodg gate and i hurri there as fast as i could will you relat to us exactli what happen next i enter mr inglethorp room she wa at that moment in a typic tetan convuls she turn toward me and gasp out alfredalfr could the strychnin have been administ in mr inglethorp afterdinn coffe which wa taken to her by her husband possibl but strychnin is a fairli rapid drug in it action the symptom appear from on to two hour after it ha been swallow it is retard under certain condit none of which howev appear to have been present in thi case i presum mr inglethorp took the coffe after dinner about eight oclock wherea the symptom did not manifest themselv until the earli hour of the morn which on the face of it point to the drug have been taken much later in the even mr inglethorp wa in the habit of drink a cup of cocoa in the middl of the night could the strychnin have been administ in that no i myself took a sampl of the cocoa remain in the saucepan and had it analys there wa no strychnin present i heard poirot chuckl softli besid me how did you know i whisper listen i should sayth doctor wa continuingthat i would have been consider surpris at ani other result why simpli becaus strychnin ha an unusu bitter tast it can be detect in a solut of in and can onli be disguis by some strongli flavour substanc cocoa would be quit powerless to mask it on of the juri want to know if the same object appli to coffe no coffe ha a bitter tast of it own which would probabl cover the tast of strychnin then you consid it more like that the drug wa administ in the coffe but that for some unknown reason it action wa delai ye but the cup be complet smash there is no possibl of analyz it content thi conclud dr bauerstein evid dr wilkin corrobor it on all point sound as to the possibl of suicid he repudi it utterli the deceas he said suffer from a weak heart but otherwis enjoi perfect health and wa of a cheer and wellbalanc disposit she would be on of the last peopl to take her own life lawrenc cavendish wa next call hi evid wa quit unimport be a mere repetit of that of hi brother just as he wa about to step down he paus and said rather hesitatingli i should like to make a suggest if i mai he glanc deprecatingli at the coron who repli briskli certainli mr cavendish we ar here to arriv at the truth of thi matter and welcom anyth that mai lead to further elucid it is just an idea of mine explain lawrenc of cours i mai be quit wrong but it still seem to me that my mother death might be account for by natur mean how do you make that out mr cavendish my mother at the time of her death and for some time befor it wa take a tonic contain strychnin ah said the coron the juri look up interest i believ continu lawrenc that there have been case where the cumul effect of a drug administ for some time ha end by caus death also is it not possibl that she mai have taken an overdos of her medicin by accid thi is the first we have heard of the deceas take strychnin at the time of her death we ar much oblig to you mr cavendish dr wilkin wa recal and ridicul the idea what mr cavendish suggest is quit imposs ani doctor would tell you the same strychnin is in a certain sens a cumul poison but it would be quit imposs for it to result in sudden death in thi wai there would have to be a long period of chronic symptom which would at onc have attract my attent the whole thing is absurd and the second suggest that mr inglethorp mai have inadvert taken an overdos three or even four dose would not have result in death mr inglethorp alwai had an extra larg amount of medicin made up at a time as she dealt with coot the cash chemist in tadminst she would have had to take veri nearli the whole bottl to account for the amount of strychnin found at the postmortem then you consid that we mai dismiss the tonic as not be in ani wai instrument in caus her death certainli the supposit is ridicul the same juryman who had interrupt befor here suggest that the chemist who made up the medicin might have commit an error that of cours is alwai possibl repli the doctor but dorca who wa the next wit call dispel even that possibl the medicin had not been newli made up on the contrari mr inglethorp had taken the last dose on the dai of her death so the question of the tonic wa final abandon and the coron proceed with hi task have elicit from dorca how she had been awaken by the violent ring of her mistresss bell and had subsequ rous the household he pass to the subject of the quarrel on the preced afternoon dorcass evid on thi point wa substanti what poirot and i had alreadi heard so i will not repeat it here the next wit wa mari cavendish she stood veri upright and spoke in a low clear and perfectli compos voic in answer to the coron question she told how her alarm clock have arous her at as usual she wa dress when she wa startl by the sound of someth heavi fall that would have been the tabl by the bed comment the coron i open my door continu mari and listen in a few minut a bell rang violent dorca came run down and woke my husband and we all went to my motherinlaw room but it wa lock the coron interrupt her i realli do not think we need troubl you further on that point we know all that can be known of the subsequ happen but i should be oblig if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the dai befor i there wa a faint insol in her voic she rais her hand and adjust the ruffl of lace at her neck turn her head a littl as she did so and quit spontan the thought flash across my mind she is gain time ye i understand continu the coron deliber that you were sit read on the bench just outsid the long window of the boudoir that is so is it not thi wa new to me and glanc sidewai at poirot i fanci that it wa new to him as well there wa the faintest paus the mere hesit of a moment befor she answer ye that is so and the boudoir window wa open wa it not sure her face grew a littl paler as she answer ye then you cannot have fail to hear the voic insid especi as thei were rais in anger in fact thei would be more audibl where you were than in the hall possibl will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel i realli do not rememb hear anyth do you mean to sai you did not hear voic oh ye i heard the voic but i did not hear what thei said a faint spot of colour came into her cheek i am not in the habit of listen to privat convers the coron persist and you rememb noth at all noth mr cavendish not on strai word or phrase to make you realiz that it wa a privat convers she paus and seem to reflect still outwardli as calm as ever ye i rememb mr inglethorp said somethingi do not rememb exactli whatabout caus scandal between husband and wife ah the coron leant back satisfi that correspond with what dorca heard but excus me mr cavendish although you realiz it wa a privat convers you did not move awai you remain where you were i caught the momentari gleam of her tawni ey as she rais them i felt certain that at that moment she would willingli have torn the littl lawyer with hi insinu into piec but she repli quietli enough no i wa veri comfort where i wa i fix my mind on my book and that is all you can tell us that is all the examin wa over though i doubt if the coron wa entir satisfi with it i think he suspect that mari cavendish could tell more if she chose ami hill shop assist wa next call and depos to have sold a will form on the afternoon of the th to william earl undergarden at style william earl and man succeed her and testifi to wit a document man fix the time at about william wa of the opinion that it wa rather earlier cynthia murdoch came next

that he should not be arrest i dare sai observ summerhay sarcast japp wa regard poirot with comic perplex cant you go a littl further mr poirot a wink as good as a nodfrom you youv been on the spotand the yard doesnt want to make ani mistak you know poirot nod grave that is exactli what i thought well i will tell you thi us your warrant arrest mr inglethorp but it will bring you no kudosth case against him will be dismiss at onc comm a and he snap hi finger express japp face grew grave though summerhay gave an incredul snort as for me i wa liter dumb with astonish i could onli conclud that poirot wa mad japp had taken out a handkerchief and wa gentli dab hi brow i darent do it mr poirot id take your word but there other over me wholl be ask what the devil i mean by it cant you give me a littl more to go on poirot reflect a moment it can be done he said at last i admit i do not wish it it forc my hand i would have prefer to work in the dark just for the present but what you sai is veri justth word of a belgian policeman whose dai is past is not enough and alfr inglethorp must not be arrest that i have sworn as my friend hast here know see then my good japp you go at onc to style well in about half an hour were see the coron and the doctor first good call for me in passingth last hous in the villag i will go with you at style mr inglethorp will give you or if he refusesa is probablei will give you such proof that shall satisfi you that the case against him could not possibl be sustain is that a bargain that a bargain said japp heartili and on behalf of the yard im much oblig to you though im bound to confess i cant at present see the faintest possibl loophol in the evid but you alwai were a marvel so long then moosier the two detect strode awai summerhay with an incredul grin on hi face well my friend cri poirot befor i could get in a word what do you think mon dieu i had some warm moment in that court i did not figur to myself that the man would be so pighead as to refus to sai anyth at all decidedli it wa the polici of an imbecil hm there ar other explan besid that of imbecil i remark for if the case against him is true how could he defend himself except by silenc why in a thousand ingeni wai cri poirot see sai that it is i who have commit thi murder i can think of seven most plausibl stori far more convinc than mr inglethorp stoni denial i could not help laugh my dear poirot i am sure you ar capabl of think of seventi but serious in spite of what i heard you sai to the detect you sure cannot still believ in the possibl of alfr inglethorp innoc why not now as much as befor noth ha chang but the evid is so conclus ye too conclus we turn in at the gate of leastwai cottag and proceed up the now familiar stair ye ye too conclus continu poirot almost to himself real evid is usual vagu and unsatisfactori it ha to be examinedsift but here the whole thing is cut and dri no my friend thi evid ha been veri cleverli manufacturedso cleverli that it ha defeat it own end how do you make that out becaus so long as the evid against him wa vagu and intang it wa veri hard to disprov but in hi anxieti the crimin ha drawn the net so close that on cut will set inglethorp free i wa silent and in a minut or two poirot continu let us look at the matter like thi here is a man let us sai who set out to poison hi wife he ha live by hi wit as the sai goe presum therefor he ha some wit he is not altogeth a fool well how doe he set about it he goe boldli to the villag chemist and purchas strychnin under hi own name with a trump up stori about a dog which is bound to be prove absurd he doe not emploi the poison that night no he wait until he ha had a violent quarrel with her of which the whole household is cognis and which natur direct their suspicion upon him he prepar no defenceno shadow of an alibi yet he know the chemist assist must necessarili come forward with the fact bah do not ask me to believ that ani man could be so idiot onli a lunat who wish to commit suicid by caus himself to be hang would act so stilli do not see i began neither do i see i tell you mon ami it puzzl me mehercul poirot but if you believ him innoc how do you explain hi bui the strychnin veri simpli he did not bui it but mace recogn him i beg your pardon he saw a man with a black beard like mr inglethorp and wear glass like mr inglethorp and dress in mr inglethorp rather notic cloth he could not recogn a man whom he had probabl onli seen in the distanc sinc you rememb he himself had onli been in the villag a fortnight and mr inglethorp dealt princip with coot in tadminst then you think mon ami do you rememb the two point i laid stress upon leav the first on for the moment what wa the second the import fact that alfr inglethorp wear peculiar cloth ha a black beard and us glass i quot exactli now suppos anyon wish to pass himself off as john or lawrenc cavendish would it be easi no i said thoughtfulli of cours an actor but poirot cut me short ruthlessli and why would it not be easi i will tell you my friend becaus thei ar both cleanshaven men to make up successfulli as on of these two in broad daylight it would need an actor of geniu and a certain initi facial resembl but in the case of alfr inglethorp all that is chang hi cloth hi beard the glass which hide hi eyesthos ar the salient point about hi person appear now what is the first instinct of the crimin to divert suspicion from himself is it not so and how can he best do that by throw it on someon els in thi instanc there wa a man readi to hi hand everybodi wa predispos to believ in mr inglethorp guilt it wa a foregon conclus that he would be suspect but to make it a sure thing there must be tangibl proofsuch as the actual bui of the poison and that with a man of the peculiar appear of mr inglethorp wa not difficult rememb thi young mace had never actual spoken to mr inglethorp how should he doubt that the man in hi cloth with hi beard and hi glass wa not alfr inglethorp it mai be so i said fascin by poirot eloqu but if that wa the case why doe he not sai where he wa at six oclock on mondai even ah why inde said poirot calm down if he were arrest he probabl would speak but i do not want it to come to that i must make him see the graviti of hi posit there is of cours someth discredit behind hi silenc if he did not murder hi wife he is nevertheless a scoundrel and ha someth of hi own to conceal quit apart from the murder what can it be i muse won over to poirot view for the moment although still retain a faint convict that the obviou deduct wa the correct on can you not guess ask poirot smile no can you oh ye i had a littl idea sometim agoand it ha turn out to be correct you never told me i said reproachfulli poirot spread out hi hand apologet pardon me mon ami you were not precis sympathiqu he turn to me earnestli tell meyou see now that he must not be arrest perhap i said doubtfulli for i wa realli quit indiffer to the fate of alfr inglethorp and thought that a good fright would do him no harm poirot who wa watch me intent gave a sigh come my friend he said chang the subject apart from mr inglethorp how did the evid at the inquest strike you oh pretti much what i expect did noth strike you as peculiar about it my thought flew to mari cavendish and i hedg in what wai well mr lawrenc cavendish evid for instanc i wa reliev oh lawrenc no i dont think so he alwai a nervou chap hi suggest that hi mother might have been poison accident by mean of the tonic she wa take that did not strike you as strang hein no i cant sai it did the doctor ridicul it of cours but it wa quit a natur suggest for a layman to make but monsieur lawrenc is not a layman you told me yourself that he had start by studi medicin and that he had taken hi degre ye that true i never thought of that i wa rather startl it is odd poirot nod from the first hi behaviour ha been peculiar of all the household he alon would be like to recogn the symptom of strychnin poison and yet we find him the onli member of the famili to uphold strenuous the theori of death from natur caus if it had been monsieur john i could have understood it he ha no technic knowledg and is by natur unimagin but monsieur lawrenceno and now todai he put forward a suggest that he himself must have known wa ridicul there is food for thought in thi mon ami it veri confus i agre then there is mr cavendish continu poirot that anoth who is not tell all she know what do you make of her attitud i dont know what to make of it it seem inconceiv that she should be shield alfr inglethorp yet that is what it look like poirot nod reflect ye it is queer on thing is certain she overheard a good deal more of that privat convers than she wa will to admit and yet she is the last person on would accus of stoop to eavesdrop exactli on thing her evid ha shown me i made a mistak dorca wa quit right the quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon about four oclock as she said i look at him curious i had never understood hi insist on that point ye a good deal that wa peculiar came out todai continu poirot dr bauerstein now what wa he do up and dress at that hour in the morn it is astonish to me that no on comment on the fact he ha insomnia i believ i said doubtfulli which is a veri good or a veri bad explan remark poirot it cover everyth and explain noth i shall keep my ey on our clever dr bauerstein ani more fault to find with the evid i inquir satir mon ami repli poirot grave when you find that peopl ar not tell you the truthlook out now unless i am much mistaken at the inquest todai onli oneat most two person were speak the truth without reserv or subterfug oh come now poirot i wont cite lawrenc or mr cavendish but there johnand miss howard sure thei were speak the truth both of them my friend on i grant you but both hi word gave me an unpleas shock miss howard evid unimport as it wa had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occur to me to doubt her sincer still i had a great respect for poirot sagacityexcept on the occas when he wa what i describ to myself as foolishli pighead do you realli think so i ask miss howard had alwai seem to me so essenti honestalmost uncomfort so poirot gave me a curiou look which i could not quit fathom he seem to speak and then check himself miss murdoch too i continu there noth untruth about her no but it wa strang that she never heard a sound sleep next door wherea mr cavendish in the other wing of the build distinctli heard the tabl fall well she young and she sleep soundli ah ye inde she must be a famou sleeper that on i did not quit like the tone of hi voic but at that moment a smart knock reach our ear and look out of the window we perceiv the two detect wait for us below poirot seiz hi hat gave a feroci twist to hi moustach and carefulli brush an imaginari speck of dust from hi sleev motion me to preced him down the stair there we join the detect and set out for style i think the appear of the two scotland yard men wa rather a shockespeci to john though of cours after the verdict he had realiz that it wa onli a matter of time still the presenc of the detect brought the truth home to him more than anyth els could have done poirot had confer with japp in a low tone on the wai up and it wa the latter functionari who request that the household with the except of the servant should be assembl togeth in the drawingroom i realiz the signific of thi it wa up to poirot to make hi boast good person i wa not sanguin poirot might have excel reason for hi belief in inglethorp innoc but a man of the type of summerhay would requir tangibl proof and these i doubt if poirot could suppli befor veri long we had all troop into the drawingroom the door of which japp close poirot polit set chair for everi on the scotland yard men were the cynosur of all ey i think that for the first time we realiz that the thing wa not a bad dream but a tangibl realiti we had read of such thingsnow we ourselv were actor in the drama tomorrow the daili paper all over england would blazon out the new in stare headlin mysteri tragedi in essex wealthi ladi poison there would be pictur of style snapshot of the famili leav the inquestth villag photograph had not been idl all the thing that on had read a hundr timesth that happen to other peopl not to oneself and now in thi hous a murder had been commit in front of us were the detect in charg of the case the wellknown glib phraseolog pass rapidli through my mind in the interv befor poirot open the proceed i think everi on wa a littl surpris that it should be he and not on of the offici detect who took the initi mesdam and messieur said poirot bow as though he were a celebr about to deliv a lectur i have ask you to come here all togeth for a certain object that object it concern mr alfr inglethorp inglethorp wa sit a littl by himselfi think unconsci everi on had drawn hi chair slightli awai from himand he gave a faint start as poirot pronounc hi name mr inglethorp said poirot address him directli a veri dark shadow is rest on thi houseth shadow of murder inglethorp shook hi head sadli my poor wife he murmur poor emili it is terribl i do not think monsieur said poirot pointedli that you quit realiz how terribl it mai befor you and as inglethorp did not appear to understand he ad mr inglethorp you ar stand in veri grave danger the two detect fidget i saw the offici caution anyth you sai will be us in evid against you actual hover on summerhay lip poirot went on do you understand now monsieur no what do you mean i mean said poirot deliber that you ar suspect of poison your wife a littl gasp ran round the circl at thi plain speak good heaven cri inglethorp start up what a monstrou idea ipoison my dearest emili i do not thinkpoirot watch him narrowlythat you quit realiz the unfavour natur of your evid at the inquest mr inglethorp know what i have now told you do you still refus to sai where you were at six oclock on mondai afternoon with a groan alfr inglethorp sank down again and buri hi face in hi hand poirot approach and stood over him speak he cri menacingli with an effort inglethorp rais hi face from hi hand then slowli and deliber he shook hi head you will not speak no i do not believ that anyon could be so monstrou as to accus me of what you sai poirot nod thoughtfulli like a man whose mind is made up soit he said then i must speak for you alfr inglethorp sprang up again you how can you speak you do not know he broke off abruptli poirot turn to face us mesdam and messieur i speak listen i hercul poirot affirm that the man who enter the chemist shop and purchas strychnin at six oclock on mondai last wa not mr inglethorp for at six oclock on that dai mr inglethorp wa escort mr raik back to her home from a neighbour farm i can produc no less than five wit to swear to have seen them togeth either at six or just after and as you mai know the abbei farm mr raikess home is at least two and a half mile distant from the villag there is absolut no question as to the alibi chapter viii fresh suspicion there wa a moment stupefi silenc japp who wa the least surpris of ani of us wa the first to speak my word he cri your the good and no mistak mr poirot these wit of your ar all right i suppos voil i have prepar a list of themnam and address you must see them of cours but you will find it all right im sure of that japp lower hi voic im much oblig to you a pretti mare nest arrest him would have been he turn to inglethorp but if youll excus me sir why couldnt you sai all thi at the inquest i will tell you why interrupt poirot there wa a certain rumour a most malici and utterli untru on interrupt alfr inglethorp in an agit voic and mr inglethorp wa anxiou to have no scandal reviv just at present am i right quit right inglethorp nod with my poor emili not yet buri can you wonder i wa anxiou that no more ly rumour should be start between you and me sir remark japp id sooner have ani amount of rumour than be arrest for murder and i ventur to think your poor ladi would have felt the same and if it hadnt been for mr poirot here arrest you would have been as sure as egg is egg i wa foolish no doubt murmur inglethorp but you do not know inspector how i have been persecut and malign and he shot a bale glanc at evelyn howard now sir said japp turn briskli to john i should like to see the ladi bedroom pleas and after that ill have a littl chat with the servant dont you bother about anyth mr poirot here will show me the wai as thei all went out of the room poirot turn and made me a sign to follow him upstair there he caught me by the arm and drew me asid quick go to the other wing stand therejust thi side of the baiz door do not move till i come then turn rapidli he rejoin the two detect i follow hi instruct take up my posit by the baiz door and wonder what on earth lai behind the request why wa i to stand in thi particular spot on guard i look thoughtfulli down the corridor in front of me an idea struck me with the except of cynthia murdoch everi on room wa in thi left wing had that anyth to do with it wa i to report who came or went i stood faithfulli at my post the minut pass nobodi came noth happen it must have been quit twenti minut befor poirot rejoin me you have not stir no iv stuck here like a rock noth happen ah wa he pleas or disappoint youv seen noth at all no but you have probabl heard someth a big bumpeh mon ami no is it possibl ah but i am vex with myself i am not usual clumsi i made but a slight gesturei know poirot gestureswith the left hand and over went the tabl by the bed he look so childishli vex and crestfallen that i hasten to consol him never mind old chap what doe it matter your triumph downstair excit you i can tell you that wa a surpris to us all there must be more in thi affair of inglethorp with mr raik than we thought to make him hold hi tongu so persist what ar you go to do now where ar the scotland yard fellow gone down to interview the servant i show them all our exhibit i am disappoint in japp he ha no method hullo i said look out of the window here dr bauerstein i believ your right about that man poirot i dont like him he is clever observ poirot medit oh clever as the devil i must sai i wa overjoi to see him in the plight he wa in on tuesdai you never saw such a spectacl and i describ the doctor adventur he look a regular scarecrow plaster with mud from head to foot you saw him then ye of cours he didnt want to come init wa just after dinnerbut mr inglethorp insist what poirot caught me violent by the shoulder wa dr bauerstein here on tuesdai even here and you never told me why did you not tell me why why he appear to be in an absolut frenzi my dear poirot i expostul i never thought it would interest you i didnt know it wa of ani import import it is of the first import so dr bauerstein wa here on tuesdai nightth night of the murder hast do you not see that alter everythingeveryth i had never seen him so upset loosen hi hold of me he mechan straighten a pair of candlestick still murmur to himself ye that alter everythingeveryth suddenli he seem to come to a decis allon he said we must act at onc where is mr cavendish john wa in the smokingroom poirot went straight to him mr cavendish i have some import busi in tadminst a new clue mai i take your motor why of cours do you mean at onc if you pleas john rang the bell and order round the car in anoth ten minut we were race down the park and along the high road to tadminst now poirot i remark resignedli perhap you will tell me what all thi is about well mon ami a good deal you can guess for yourself of cours you realiz that now mr inglethorp is out of it the whole posit is greatli chang we ar face to face with an entir new problem we know now that there is on person who did not bui the poison we have clear awai the manufactur clue now for the real on i have ascertain that anyon in the household with the except of mr cavendish who wa plai tenni with you could have person mr inglethorp on mondai even in the same wai we have hi statement that he put the coffe down in the hall no on took much notic of that at the inquestbut now it ha a veri differ signific we must find out who did take that coffe to mr inglethorp eventu or who pass through the hall whilst it wa stand there from your account there ar onli two peopl whom we can posit sai did not go near the coffeemr cavendish and mademoisel cynthia ye that is so i felt an inexpress lighten of the heart mari cavendish could certainli not rest under suspicion in clear alfr inglethorp continu poirot i have been oblig to show my hand sooner than i intend as long as i might be thought to be pursu him the crimin would be off hi guard now he will be doubli care yesdoubl care he turn to me abruptli tell me hast you yourselfhav you no suspicion of anybodi i hesit to tell the truth an idea wild and extravag in itself had onc or twice that morn flash through my brain i had reject it as absurd nevertheless it persist you couldnt call it a suspicion i murmur it so utterli foolish come now urg poirot encouragingli do not fear speak your mind you should alwai pai attent to your instinct well then i blurt out it absurdbut i suspect miss howard of not tell all she know miss howard yesyoul laugh at me not at all why should i i cant help feel i continu blunderingli that weve rather left her out of the possibl suspect simpli on the strength of her have been awai from the place but after all she wa onli fifteen mile awai a car would do it in half an hour can we sai posit that she wa awai from style on the night of the murder ye my friend said poirot unexpectedli we can on of my first action wa to ring up the hospit where she wa work well well i learnt that miss howard had been on afternoon duti on tuesdai and thata convoi come in unexpectedlysh had kindli offer to remain on night duti which offer wa gratefulli accept that dispos of that oh i said rather nonpluss realli i continu it her extraordinari vehem against inglethorp that start me off suspect her i cant help feel shed do anyth against him and i had an idea she might know someth about the destroi of the will she might have burnt the new on mistak it for the earlier on in hi favour she is so terribl bitter against him you consid her vehem unnatur ye she is so veri violent i wonder realli whether she is quit sane on that point poirot shook hi head energet no no you ar on a wrong tack there there is noth weakmind or degener about miss howard she is an excel specimen of wellbalanc english beef and brawn she is saniti itself yet her hatr of inglethorp seem almost a mania my idea wasa veri ridicul on no doubtthat she had intend to poison himand that in some wai mr inglethorp got hold of it by mistak but i dont at all see how it could have been done the whole thing is absurd and ridicul to the last degre still you ar right in on thing it is alwai wise to suspect everybodi until you can prove logic and to your own satisfact that thei ar innoc now what reason ar there against miss howard have deliber poison mr inglethorp why she wa devot to her i exclaim tcha tcha cri poirot irrit you argu like a child if miss howard were capabl of poison the old ladi she would be quit equal capabl of simul devot no we must look elsewher you ar perfectli correct in your assumpt that her vehem against alfr inglethorp is too violent to be natur but you ar quit wrong in the deduct you draw from it i have drawn my own deduct which i believ to be correct but i will not speak of them at present he paus a minut then went on now to my wai of think there is on insuper object to miss howard be the murderess and that is that in no possibl wai could mr inglethorp death benefit miss howard now there is no murder without a motiv i reflect could not mr inglethorp have made a will in her favour poirot shook hi head but you yourself suggest that possibl to mr well poirot smile that wa for a reason i did not want to mention the name of the person who wa actual in my mind miss howard occupi veri much the same posit so i us her name instead still mr inglethorp might have done so why that will made on the afternoon of her death mai but poirot shake of the head wa so energet that i stop no my friend i have certain littl idea of my own about that will but i can tell you thi muchit wa not in miss howard favour i accept hi assur though i did not realli see how he could be so posit about the matter well i said with a sigh we will acquit miss howard then it is partli your fault that i ever came to suspect her it wa what you said about her evid at the inquest that set me off poirot look puzzl what did i sai about her evid at the inquest dont you rememb when i cite her and john cavendish as be abov suspicion ohahy he seem a littl confus but recov himself by the wai hast there is someth i want you to do for me certainli what is it next time you happen to be alon with lawrenc cavendish i want you to sai thi to him i have a messag for you from poirot he sai find the extra coffeecup and you can rest in peac noth more noth less find the extra coffeecup and you can rest in peac is that right i ask much mystifi excel but what doe it mean ah that i will leav you to find out you have access to the fact just sai that to him and see what he sai veri wellbut it all extrem mysteri we were run into tadminst now and poirot direct the car to the analyt chemist poirot hop down briskli and went insid in a few minut he wa back again there he said that is all my busi what were you do there i ask in live curios i left someth to be analys ye but what the sampl of cocoa i took from the saucepan in the bedroom but that ha alreadi been test i cri stupefi dr bauerstein had it test and you yourself laugh at the possibl of there be strychnin in it i know dr bauerstein had it test repli poirot quietli well then well i have a fanci for have it analys again that is all and not anoth word on the subject could i drag out of him thi proceed of poirot in respect of the cocoa puzzl me intens i could see neither rhyme nor reason in it howev my confid in him which at on time had rather wane wa fulli restor sinc hi belief in alfr inglethorp innoc had been so triumphantli vindic the funer of mr inglethorp took place the follow dai and on mondai as i came down to a late breakfast john drew me asid and inform me that mr inglethorp wa leav that morn to take up hi quarter at the stylit arm until he should have complet hi plan and realli it a great relief to think he go hast continu my honest friend it wa bad enough befor when we thought hed done it but im hang if it isnt wors now when we all feel guilti for have been so down on the fellow the fact is weve treat him abomin of cours thing did look black against him i dont see how anyon could blame us for jump to the conclus we did still there it is we were in the wrong and now there a beastli feel that on ought to make amend which is difficult when on doesnt like the fellow a bit better than on did befor the whole thing damn awkward and im thank he had the tact to take himself off it a good thing style wasnt the mater to leav to him couldnt bear to think of the fellow lord it here he welcom to her monei youll be abl to keep up the place all right i ask oh ye there ar the death duti of cours but half my father monei goe with the place and lawrenc will stai with us for the present so there is hi share as well we shall be pinch at first of cours becaus as i onc told you i am in a bit of a hole financi myself still the johnni will wait now in the gener relief at inglethorp approach departur we had

lawrenc who had murder alfr inglethorp with a croquet mallet but it wa absurd of john to make such a fuss about it and to go shout out i tell you i wont have it i woke up with a start at onc i realiz that i wa in a veri awkward predica for about twelv feet awai from me john and mari cavendish were stand face each other and thei were evid quarrel and quit as evid thei were unawar of my vicin for befor i could move or speak john repeat the word which had arous me from my dream i tell you mari i wont have it mari voic came cool and liquid have you ani right to critic my action it will be the

choos you defi me no but i deni your right to critic my action have you no friend of whom i should disapprov john fell back a pace the colour eb slowli from hi face what do you mean he said in an unsteadi voic you see said mari quietli you do see dont you that you have no right to dictat to me as to the choic of my friend john glanc at her pleadingli a stricken look on hi face no right have i no right mari he said unsteadili he stretch out hi hand mari for a moment i thought she waver a softer express came over her face then suddenli she turn almost fierc awai none she wa walk awai when john sprang after her and caught her by the arm maryhi voic wa veri quiet nowar you in love with thi fellow bauerstein she hesit and suddenli there swept across her face a strang express old as the hill yet with someth etern young about it so might some egyptian sphinx have smile she freed herself quietli from hi arm and spoke over her shoulder perhap she said and then swiftli pass out of the littl glade leav john stand there as though he had been turn to stone rather ostentati i step forward crackl some dead branch with my feet as i did so john turn luckili he took it for grant that i had onli just come upon the scene hullo hast have you seen the littl fellow safe back to hi cottag quaint littl chap is he ani good though realli he wa consid on of the finest detect of hi dai oh well i suppos there must be someth in it then what a rotten world it is though you find it so i ask good lord ye there thi terribl busi to start with scotland yard men in and out of the hous like a jackinthebox never know where thei wont turn up next scream headlin in everi paper in the countrydamn all journalist i sai do you know there wa a whole crowd stare in at the lodg gate thi morn sort of madam tussaud chamber of horror busi that can be seen for noth pretti thick isnt it cheer up john i said soothingli it cant last for ever cant it though it can last long enough for us never to be abl to hold up our head again no no your get morbid on the subject enough to make a man morbid to be stalk by beastli journalist and stare at by gape moonfac idiot wherev he goe but there wors than that what john lower hi voic have you ever thought hastingsit a nightmar to mewho did it i cant help feel sometim it must have been an accid becausebecausewho could have done it now inglethorp out of the wai there no on els no on i mean excepton of us ye inde that wa nightmar enough for ani man on of us ye sure it must be so unless a new idea suggest itself to my mind rapidli i consid it the light increas poirot mysteri do hi hintsthei all fit in fool that i wa not to have thought of thi possibl befor and what a relief for us all no john i said it isnt on of us how could it be i know but still who els is there cant you guess no i look cautious round and lower my voic dr bauerstein i whisper imposs not at all but what earthli interest could he have in my mother death that i dont see i confess but ill tell you thi poirot think so poirot doe he how do you know i told him of poirot intens excit on hear that dr bauerstein had been at style on the fatal night and ad he said twice that alter everyth and iv been think you know inglethorp said he had put down the coffe in the hall well it wa just then that bauerstein arriv isnt it possibl that as inglethorp brought him through the hall the doctor drop someth into the coffe in pass hm said john it would have been veri riski ye but it wa possibl and then how could he know it wa her coffe no old fellow i dont think that will wash but i had rememb someth els your quit right that wasnt how it wa done listen and i then told him of the cocoa sampl which poirot had taken to be analys john interrupt just as i had done but look here bauerstein had had it analys alreadi ye ye that the point i didnt see it either until now dont you understand bauerstein had it analysedthat just it if bauerstein the murder noth could be simpler than for him to substitut some ordinari cocoa for hi sampl and send that to be test and of cours thei would find no strychnin but no on would dream of suspect bauerstein or think of take anoth sampleexcept poirot i ad with belat recognit ye but what about the bitter tast that cocoa wont disguis well weve onli hi word for that and there ar other possibl he admittedli on of the world greatest toxicologist on of the world greatest what sai it again he know more about poison than almost anybodi i explain well my idea is that perhap he found some wai of make strychnin tasteless or it mai not have been strychnin at all but some obscur drug no on ha ever heard of which produc much the same symptom hm ye that might be said john but look here how could he have got at the cocoa that wasnt downstair no it wasnt i admit reluctantli and then suddenli a dread possibl flash through my mind i hope and prai it would not occur to john also i glanc sidewai at him he wa frown perplexedli and i drew a deep breath of relief for the terribl thought that had flash across my mind wa thi that dr bauerstein might have had an accomplic yet sure it could not be sure no woman as beauti as mari cavendish could be a murderess yet beauti women had been known to poison and suddenli i rememb that first convers at tea on the dai of my arriv and the gleam in her ey as she had said that poison wa a woman weapon how agit she had been on that fatal tuesdai even had mr inglethorp discov someth between her and bauerstein and threaten to tell her husband wa it to stop that denunci that the crime had been commit then i rememb that enigmat convers between poirot and evelyn howard wa thi what thei had meant wa thi the monstrou possibl that evelyn had tri not to believ ye it all fit in no wonder miss howard had suggest hush it up now i understood that unfinish sentenc of her emili herself and in my heart i agre with her would not mr inglethorp have prefer to go unaveng rather than have such terribl dishonour fall upon the name of cavendish there anoth thing said john suddenli and the unexpect sound of hi voic made me start guiltili someth which make me doubt if what you sai can be true what that i ask thank that he had gone awai from the subject of how the poison could have been introduc into the cocoa why the fact that bauerstein demand a postmortem he neednt have done so littl wilkin would have been quit content to let it go at heart diseas ye i said doubtfulli but we dont know perhap he thought it safer in the long run someon might have talk afterward then the home offic might have order exhum the whole thing would have come out then and he would have been in an awkward posit for no on would have believ that a man of hi reput could have been deceiv into call it heart diseas ye that possibl admit john still he ad im blest if i can see what hi motiv could have been i trembl look here i said i mai be altogeth wrong and rememb all thi is in confid oh of coursethat goe without sai we had walk as we talk and now we pass through the littl gate into the garden voic rose near at hand for tea wa spread out under the sycamoretre as it had been on the dai of my arriv cynthia wa back from the hospit and i place my chair besid her and told her of poirot wish to visit the dispensari of cours id love him to see it hed better come to tea there on dai i must fix it up with him he such a dear littl man but he is funni he made me take the brooch out of my tie the other dai and put it in again becaus he said it wasnt straight i laugh it quit a mania with him ye isnt it we were silent for a minut or two and then glanc in the direct of mari cavendish and drop her voic cynthia said mr hast ye after tea i want to talk to you her glanc at mari had set me think i fanci that between these two there exist veri littl sympathi for the first time it occur to me to wonder about the girl futur mr inglethorp had made no provis of ani kind for her but i imagin that john and mari would probabl insist on her make her home with themat ani rate until the end of the war john i knew wa veri fond of her and would be sorri to let her go john who had gone into the hous now reappear hi goodnatur face wore an unaccustom frown of anger confound those detect i cant think what theyr after theyv been in everi room in the houseturn thing insid out and upsid down it realli is too bad i suppos thei took advantag of our all be out i shall go for that fellow japp when i next see him lot of paul pry grunt miss howard lawrenc opin that thei had to make a show of do someth mari cavendish said noth after tea i invit cynthia to come for a walk and we saunter off into the wood togeth well i inquir as soon as we were protect from pry ey by the leafi screen with a sigh cynthia flung herself down and toss off her hat the sunlight pierc through the branch turn the auburn of her hair to quiver gold mr hastingsy ar alwai so kind and you know such a lot it struck me at thi moment that cynthia wa realli a veri charm girl much more charm than mari who never said thing of that kind well i ask benignantli as she hesit i want to ask your advic what shall i do do ye you see aunt emili alwai told me i should be provid for i suppos she forgot or didnt think she wa like to dieanywai i am not provid for and i dont know what to do do you think i ought to go awai from here at onc good heaven no thei dont want to part with you im sure cynthia hesit a moment pluck up the grass with her tini hand then she said mr cavendish doe she hate me hate you i cri astonish cynthia nod ye i dont know why but she cant bear me and he cant either there i know your wrong i said warmli on the contrari john is veri fond of you oh yesjohn i meant lawrenc not of cours that i care whether lawrenc hate me or not still it rather horrid when no on love you isnt it but thei do cynthia dear i said earnestli im sure you ar mistaken look there is johnand miss howard cynthia nod rather gloomili ye john like me i think and of cours evi for all her gruff wai wouldnt be unkind to a fly but lawrenc never speak to me if he can help it and mari can hardli bring herself to be civil to me she want evi to stai on is beg her to but she doesnt want me andandi dont know what to do suddenli the poor child burst out cry i dont know what possess me her beauti perhap as she sat there with the sunlight glint down on her head perhap the sens of relief at encount someon who so obvious could have no connect with the tragedi perhap honest piti for her youth and loneli anywai i leant forward and take her littl hand i said awkwardli marri me cynthia unwittingli i had hit upon a sovereign remedi for her tear she sat up at onc drew her hand awai and said with some asper dont be silli i wa a littl annoi im not

cynthia somebodi might accept you next time goodby youv cheer me up veri much and with a final uncontrol burst of merriment she vanish through the tree think over the interview it struck me as be profoundli unsatisfactori it occur to me suddenli that i would go down to the villag and look up bauerstein somebodi ought to be keep an ey on the fellow at the same time it would be wise to allai ani suspicion he might have as to hi be suspect i rememb how poirot had reli on my diplomaci accordingli i went to the littl hous with the apart card insert in the window where i knew he lodg and tap on the door an old woman came and open it good afternoon i said pleasantli is dr bauerstein in she stare at me havent you heard heard what about him what about him he took took dead no took by the perlic by the polic i gasp do you mean theyv arrest him ye that it and i wait to hear no more but tore up the villag to find poirot chapter x the arrest to my extrem annoy poirot wa not in and the old belgian who answer my knock inform me that he believ he had gone to london i wa dumbfound what on earth could poirot be do in london wa it a sudden decis on hi part or had he alreadi made up hi mind when he part from me a few hour earlier i retrac my step to style in some annoy with poirot awai i wa uncertain how to act had he foreseen thi arrest had he not in all probabl been the caus of it those question i could not resolv but in the meantim what wa i to do should i announc the arrest openli at style or not though i did not acknowledg it to myself the thought of mari cavendish wa weigh on me would it not be a terribl shock to her for the moment i set asid utterli ani suspicion of her she could not be implicatedotherwis i should have heard some hint of it of cours there wa no possibl of be abl perman to conceal dr bauerstein arrest from her it would be announc in everi newspap on the morrow still i shrank from blurt it out if onli poirot had been access i could have ask hi advic what possess him to go post off to london in thi unaccount wai in spite of myself my opinion of hi sagac wa immeasur heighten i would never have dreamt of suspect the doctor had not poirot put it into my head ye decidedli the littl man wa clever after some reflect i decid to take john into my confid and leav him to make the matter public or not as he thought fit he gave vent to a prodigi whistl as i impart the new great scot you were right then i couldnt believ it at the time no it is astonish until you get us to the idea and see how it make everyth fit in now what ar we to do of cours it will be gener known tomorrow john reflect never mind he said at last we wont sai anyth at present there is no need as you sai it will be known soon enough but to my intens surpris on get down earli the next morn and eagerli open the newspap there wa not a word about the arrest there wa a column of mere pad about the style poison case but noth further it wa rather inexplic but i suppos that for some reason or other japp wish to keep it out of the paper it worri me just a littl for it suggest the possibl that there might be further arrest to come after breakfast i decid to go down to the villag and see if poirot had return yet but befor i could start a wellknown face block on of the window and the wellknown voic said bonjour mon ami poirot i exclaim with relief and seiz him by both hand i drag him into the room i wa never so glad to see anyon listen i have said noth to anybodi but john is that right my friend repli poirot i do not know what you ar talk about dr bauerstein arrest of cours i answer impati is bauerstein arrest then did you not know it not the least in the world but paus a moment he ad still it doe not surpris me after all we ar onli four mile from the coast the coast i ask puzzl what ha that got to do with it poirot shrug hi shoulder sure it is obviou not to me no doubt i am veri dens but i cannot see what the proxim of the coast ha got to do with the murder

look which convei a wonder piti and hi full sens of the utter absurd of such an idea do you mean to sai i ask slowli adapt myself to the new idea that dr bauerstein is a spy poirot nod have you never suspect it it never enter my head it did not strike you as peculiar that a famou london doctor should buri himself in a littl villag like thi and should be in the habit of walk about at all hour of the night fulli dress no i confess i never thought of such a thing he is of cours a german by birth said poirot thoughtfulli though he ha practic so long in thi countri that nobodi think of him as anyth but an englishman he wa natur about fifteen year ago a veri clever mana jew of cours the blackguard i cri indignantli not at all he is on the contrari a patriot think what he stand to lose i admir the man myself but i could not look at it in poirot philosoph wai and thi is the man with whom mr cavendish ha been wander about all over the countri i cri indignantli ye i should fanci he had found her veri us remark poirot so long as gossip busi itself in coupl their name togeth ani other vagari of the doctor pass unobserv then you think he never realli care for her i ask eagerlyrath too eagerli perhap under the circumst that of cours i cannot sai butshal i tell you my own privat opinion hast ye well it is thi that mr cavendish doe not care and never ha care on littl jot about dr bauerstein do you realli think so i could not disguis my pleasur i am quit sure of it and i will tell you why ye becaus she care for someon els mon ami oh what did he mean in spite of myself an agreeabl warmth spread over me i am not a vain man where women ar concern but i rememb certain evid too lightli thought of at the time perhap but which certainli seem to indic my pleas thought were interrupt by the sudden entranc of miss howard she glanc round hastili to make sure there wa no on els in the room and quickli produc an old sheet of brown paper thi she hand to poirot murmur as she did so the cryptic word on top of the wardrob then she hurriedli left the room poirot unfold the sheet of paper eagerli and utter an exclam of satisfact he spread it out on the tabl come here hast now tell me what is that initialj or l it wa a medium size sheet of paper rather dusti as though it had lain by for some time but it wa the label that wa attract poirot attent at the top it bore the print stamp of messr parkson the wellknown theatric costumi and it wa address to the debat initi cavendish esq style court style st mari essex it might be t or it might be l i said after studi the thing for a minut or two it certainli isnt a j good repli poirot fold up the paper again i also am of your wai of think it is an l depend upon it where did it come from i ask curious is it import moder so it confirm a surmis of mine have deduc it exist i set miss howard to search for it and as you see she ha been success what did she mean by on the top of the wardrob she meant repli poirot promptli that

chapter xi the case for the prosecut the trial of john cavendish for the murder of hi stepmoth took place two month later of the interven week i will sai littl but my admir and sympathi went out unfeignedli to mari cavendish she rang herself passion on her husband side scorn the mere idea of hi guilt and fought for him tooth and nail i express my admir to poirot and he nod thoughtfulli ye she is of those women who show at their best in advers it bring out all that is sweetest and truest in them her pride and her jealousi have jealousi i queri ye have you not realiz that she is an unusu jealou woman as i wa sai her pride and jealousi have been laid asid she think of noth but her husband and the terribl fate that is hang over him he spoke veri feelingli and i look at him earnestli rememb that last afternoon when he had been deliber whether or not to speak with hi tender for a woman happi i felt glad that the decis had been taken out of hi hand even now i said i can hardli believ it you see up to the veri last minut i thought it wa lawrenc poirot grin i know you did but john my old friend john everi murder is probabl somebodi old friend observ poirot philosoph you cannot mix up sentiment and reason i must sai i think you might have given me a hint perhap mon ami i did not do so just becaus he wa your old friend i wa rather disconcert by thi rememb how i had busili pass on to john what i believ to be poirot view concern bauerstein he by the wai had been acquit of the charg brought against him nevertheless although he had been too clever for them thi time and the charg of espionag could not be brought home to him hi wing were pretti well clip for the futur i ask poirot whether he thought john would be condemn to my intens surpris he repli that on the contrari he wa extrem like to be acquit but poirot i protest oh my friend have i not said to you all along that i have no proof it is on thing to know that a man is guilti it is quit anoth matter to prove him so and in thi case there is terribl littl evid that is the whole troubl i hercul poirot know but i lack the last link in my chain and unless i can find that miss link he shook hi head grave when did you first suspect john cavendish i ask after a minut or two did you not suspect him at all no inde not after that fragment of convers you overheard between mr cavendish and her motherinlaw and her subsequ lack of frank at the inquest no did you not put two and two togeth and reflect that if it wa not alfr inglethorp who wa quarrel with hi wifeand you rememb he strenuous deni it at the inquestit must be either lawrenc or john now if it wa lawrenc mari cavendish conduct wa just as inexplic but if on the other hand it wa john the whole thing wa explain quit natur so i cri a light break in upon me it wa john who quarrel with hi mother that afternoon exactli and you have known thi all along certainli mr cavendish behaviour could onli be explain that wai and yet you sai he mai be acquit poirot shrug hi shoulder certainli i do at the polic court proceed we shall hear the case for the prosecut but in all probabl hi solicitor will advis him to reserv hi defenc that will be sprung upon us at the trial andah by the wai i have a word of caution to give you my friend i must not appear in the case what no offici i have noth to do with it until i have found that last link in my chain i must remain behind the scene mr cavendish must think i am work for her husband not against him i sai that plai it a bit low down i protest not at all we have to deal with a most clever and unscrupul man and we must us ani mean in our powerotherwis he will slip through our finger that is why i have been care to remain in the background all the discoveri have been made by japp and japp will take all the credit if i am call upon to give evid at allh smile broadlyit will probabl be as a wit for the defenc i could hardli believ my ear it is quit en r gle continu poirot strang enough i

did so miss howardher mademoisel cynthia monsieur lawrenc the good dorca and anni bien we must delai our proceed a few minut until mr inglethorp arriv i have sent him a note miss howard rose immedi from her seat if that man come into the hous i leav it no no poirot went up to her and plead in a low voic final miss howard consent to return to her chair a few minut later alfr inglethorp enter the room the compani onc assembl poirot rose from hi seat with the air of a popular lectur and bow polit to hi audienc messieur mesdam as you all know i wa call in by monsieur john cavendish to investig thi case i at onc examin the bedroom of the deceas which by the advic of the doctor had been kept lock and wa consequ exactli as it had been when the tragedi occur i found first a fragment of green materi second a stain on the carpet near the window still damp thirdli an empti box of bromid powder to take the fragment of green materi first i found it caught in the bolt of the commun door between that room and the adjoin on occupi by mademoisel cynthia i hand the fragment over to the polic who did not consid it of much import nor did thei recogn it for what it wasa piec torn from a green land armlet there wa a littl stir of excit now there wa onli on person at style who work on the landmr cavendish therefor it must have been mr cavendish who enter the deceas room through the door commun with mademoisel cynthia room but that door wa bolt on the insid i cri when i examin the room ye but in the first place we have onli her word for it sinc it wa she who tri that particular door and report it fasten in the ensu confus she would have had ampl opportun to shoot the bolt across i took an earli opportun of verifi my conjectur to begin with the fragment correspond exactli with a tear in mr cavendish armlet also at the inquest mr cavendish declar that she had heard from her own room the fall of the tabl by the bed i took an earli opportun of test that statement by station my friend monsieur hast in the left wing of the build just outsid mr cavendish door i myself in compani with the polic went to the deceas room and whilst there i appar accident knock over the tabl in question but found that as i had expect monsieur hast had heard no sound at all thi confirm my belief that mr cavendish wa not speak the truth when she declar that she had been dress in her room at the time of the tragedi in fact i wa convinc that far from have been in her own room mr cavendish wa actual in the deceas room when the alarm wa given i shot a quick glanc at mari she wa veri pale but smile i proceed to reason on that assumpt mr cavendish is in her motherinlaw room we will sai that she is seek for someth and ha not yet found it suddenli mr inglethorp awaken and is seiz with an alarm paroxysm she fling out her arm overturn the bed tabl and then pull desper at the bell mr cavendish startl drop her candl scatter the greas on the carpet she pick it up and retreat quickli to mademoisel cynthia room close the door behind her she hurri out into the passag for the servant must not find her where she is but it is too late alreadi footstep ar echo along the galleri which connect the two wing what can she do quick as thought she hurri back to the young girl room and start shake her awak the hastili arous household come troop down the passag thei ar all busili batter at mr inglethorp door it occur to nobodi that mr cavendish ha not arriv with the rest butand thi is significanti can find no on who saw her come from the other wing he look at mari cavendish am i right madam she bow her head quit right monsieur you understand that if i had thought i would do my husband ani good by reveal these fact i would have done so but it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of hi guilt or innoc in a sens that is correct madam but it clear my mind of mani misconcept and left me free to see other fact in their true signific the will cri lawrenc then it wa you mari who destroi the will she shook her head and poirot shook hi also no he said quietli there is onli on person who could possibl have destroi that willmr inglethorp herself imposs i exclaim she had onli made it out that veri afternoon nevertheless mon ami it wa mr inglethorp becaus in no other wai can you account for the fact that on on of the hottest dai of the year mr inglethorp order a fire to be light in her room i gave a gasp what idiot we had been never to think of that fire as be incongru poirot wa continu the temperatur on that dai messieur wa degre in the shade yet mr inglethorp order a fire why becaus she wish to destroi someth and could think of no other wai you will rememb that in consequ of the war econom practic at style no wast paper wa thrown awai there wa therefor no mean of destroi a thick document such as a will the moment i heard of a fire be light in mr inglethorp room i leap to the conclus that it wa to destroi some import documentposs a will so the discoveri of the char fragment in the grate wa no surpris to me i did not of cours know at the time that the will in question had onli been made thi afternoon and i will admit that when i learnt that fact i fell into a grievou error i came to the conclus that mr inglethorp determin to destroi her will aros as a direct consequ of the quarrel she had that afternoon and that therefor the quarrel took place after and not befor the make of the will here as we know i wa wrong and i wa forc to abandon that idea i face the problem from a new standpoint now at oclock dorca overheard her mistress sai angrili you need not think that ani fear of public or scandal between husband and wife will deter me i conjectur and conjectur rightli that these word were address not to her husband but to mr john cavendish at oclock an hour later she us almost the same word but the standpoint is differ she admit to dorca i dont know what to do scandal between husband and wife is a dread thing at oclock she ha been angri but complet mistress of herself at oclock she is in violent distress and speak of have had a great shock look at the matter psycholog i drew on deduct which i wa convinc wa correct the second scandal she spoke of wa not the same as the firstand it concern herself let us reconstruct at oclock mr inglethorp quarrel with her son and threaten to denounc him to hi wifewho by the wai overheard the greater part of the convers at mr inglethorp in consequ of a convers on the valid of will make a will in favour of her husband which the two garden wit at oclock dorca find her mistress in a state of consider agit with a slip of papera letter dorca thinksin her hand and it is then that she order the fire in her room to be light presum then between and oclock someth ha occur to occas a complet revolut of feel sinc she is now as anxiou to destroi the will as she wa befor to make it what wa that someth as far as we know she wa quit alon dure that halfhour nobodi enter or left that boudoir what then occas thi sudden chang of sentiment on can onli guess but i believ my guess to be correct mr inglethorp had no stamp in her desk we know thi becaus later she ask dorca to bring her some now in the opposit corner of the room stood her husband desklock she wa anxiou to find some stamp and accord to my theori she tri her own kei in the desk that on of them fit i know she therefor open the desk and in search for the stamp she came across someth elsethat slip of paper which dorca saw in her hand and which assuredli wa never meant for mr inglethorp ey on the other hand mr cavendish believ that the slip of paper to which her motherinlaw clung so tenaci wa a written proof of her own husband infidel she demand it from mr inglethorp who assur her quit truli that it had noth to do with that matter mr cavendish did not believ her she thought that mr inglethorp wa shield her stepson now mr cavendish is a veri resolut woman and behind her mask of reserv she wa madli jealou of her husband she determin to get hold of that paper at all cost and in thi resolut chanc came to her aid she happen to pick up the kei of mr inglethorp despatchcas which had been lost that morn she knew that her motherinlaw invari kept all import paper in thi particular case mr cavendish therefor made her plan as onli a woman driven desper through jealousi could have done some time in the even she unbolt the door lead into mademoisel cynthia room possibl she appli oil to the hing for i found that it open quit noiselessli when i tri it she put off her project until the earli hour of the morn as be safer sinc the servant were accustom to hear her move about her room at that time she dress complet in her land kit and made her wai quietli through mademoisel cynthia room into that of mr inglethorp he paus a moment and cynthia interrupt but i should have woken up if anyon had come through my room not if you were drug mademoisel drug mai oui you rememberh address us collect againthat through all the tumult and nois next door mademoisel cynthia slept that admit of two possibl either her sleep wa feignedwhich i did not believeor her unconsci wa inde by artifici mean with thi latter idea in my mind i examin all the coffeecup most carefulli rememb that it wa mr cavendish who had brought mademoisel cynthia her coffe the night befor i took a sampl from each cup and had them analysedwith no result i had count the cup carefulli in the event of on have been remov six person had taken coffe and six cup were duli found i had to confess myself mistaken then i discov that i had been guilti of a veri grave oversight coffe had been brought in for seven person not six for dr bauerstein had been there that even thi chang the face of the whole affair for there wa now on cup miss the servant notic noth sinc anni the housemaid who took in the coffe brought in seven cup not know that mr inglethorp never drank it wherea dorca who clear them awai the follow morn found six as usualor strictli speak she found five the sixth be the on found broken in mr inglethorp room i wa confid that the miss cup wa that of mademoisel cynthia i had an addit reason for that belief in the fact that all the cup found contain sugar which mademoisel cynthia never took in her coffe my attent wa attract by the stori of anni about some salt on the trai of cocoa which she took everi night to mr inglethorp room i accordingli secur a sampl of that cocoa and sent it to be analys but that had alreadi been done by dr bauerstein said lawrenc quickli not exactli the analyst wa ask by him to report whether strychnin wa or wa not present he did not have it test as i did for a narcot for a narcot ye here is the analyst report mr cavendish administ a safe but effectu narcot to both mr inglethorp and mademoisel cynthia and it is possibl that she had a mauvai quart dheur in consequ imagin her feel when her motherinlaw is suddenli taken ill and di and immedi after she hear the word poison she ha believ that the sleep draught she administ wa perfectli harmless but there is no doubt that for on terribl moment she must have fear that mr inglethorp death lai at her door she is seiz with panic and under it influenc she hurri downstair and quickli drop the coffeecup and saucer us by mademoisel cynthia into a larg brass vase where it is discov later by monsieur lawrenc the remain of the cocoa she dare not touch too mani ey ar upon her guess at her relief when strychnin is mention and she discov that after all the tragedi is not her do we ar now abl to account for the symptom of strychnin poison be so long in make their appear a narcot taken with strychnin will delai the action of the poison for some hour poirot paus mari look up at him the colour slowli rise in her face all you have said is quit true monsieur poirot it wa the most aw hour of my life i shall never forget it but you ar wonder i understand now what i meant when i told you that you could safe confess to papa poirot eh but you would not trust me i see everyth now said lawrenc the drug cocoa taken on top of the poison coffe ampli account for the delai exactli but wa the coffe poison or wa it not we come to a littl difficulti here sinc mr inglethorp never drank it what the cry of surpris wa univers no you will rememb my speak of a stain on the carpet in mr inglethorp room there were some peculiar point about that stain it wa still damp it exhal a strong odour of coffe and imbed in the nap of the carpet i found some littl splinter of china what had happen wa plain to me for not two minut befor i had place my littl case on the tabl near the window and the tabl tilt up had deposit it upon the floor on precis the ident spot in exactli the same wai mr inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffe on reach her room the night befor and the treacher tabl had plai her the same trick what happen next is mere guess work on my part but i should sai that mr inglethorp pick up the broken cup and place it on the tabl by the bed feel in need of a stimul of some kind she heat up her cocoa and drank it off then and there now we ar face with a new problem we know the cocoa contain no strychnin the coffe wa never drunk yet the strychnin must have been administ between seven and nine oclock that even what third medium wa therea medium so suitabl for disguis the tast of strychnin that it is extraordinari no on ha thought of it poirot look round the room and then answer himself impress her medicin do you mean that the murder introduc the strychnin into her tonic i cri there wa no need to introduc it it wa alreadi therein the mixtur the strychnin that kill mr inglethorp wa the ident strychnin prescrib by dr wilkin to make that clear to you i will read you an extract from a book on dispens which i found in the dispensari of the red cross hospit at tadminst the follow prescript ha becom famou in text book strychnina sulph gri potass bromid vi aqua ad viii fiat mistura thi solut deposit in a few hour the greater part of the strychnin salt as an insolubl bromid in transpar crystal a ladi in england lost her life by take a similar mixtur the precipit strychnin collect at the bottom and in take the last dose she swallow nearli all of it now there wa of cours no bromid in dr wilkin prescript but you will rememb that i mention an empti box of bromid powder on or two of those powder introduc into the full bottl of medicin would effectu precipit the strychnin as the book describ and caus it to be taken in the last dose you will learn later that the person who usual pour out mr inglethorp medicin wa alwai extrem care not to shake the bottl but to leav the sediment at the bottom of it undisturb throughout the case there have been evid that the tragedi wa intend to take place on mondai even on that dai mr inglethorp bell wire wa neatli cut and on mondai even mademoisel cynthia wa spend the night with friend so that mr inglethorp would have been quit alon in the right wing complet shut off from help of ani kind and would have di in all probabl befor medic aid could have been summon but in her hurri to be in time for the villag entertain mr inglethorp forgot to take her medicin and the next dai she lunch awai from home so that the lastand fataldos wa actual taken twentyfour hour later than had been anticip by the murder and it is ow to that delai that the final proofth last link of the chaini now in my hand amid breathless excit he held out three thin strip of paper a letter in the murder own handwrit me ami had it been a littl clearer in it term it is possibl that mr inglethorp warn in time would have escap as it wa she realiz her danger but not the manner of it in the deathli silenc poirot piec togeth the slip of paper and clear hi throat read dearest evelyn you will be anxiou at hear noth it is all rightonli it will be tonight instead of last night you understand there a good time come onc the old woman is dead and out of the wai no on can possibl bring home the crime to me that idea of your about the bromid wa a stroke of geniu but we must be veri circumspect a fals step here my friend the letter break off doubtless the writer wa interrupt but there can be no question as to hi ident we all know thi handwrit and a howl that wa almost a scream broke the silenc you devil how did you get it a chair wa overturn poirot skip nimbl asid a quick movement on hi part and hi assail fell with a crash messieur mesdam said poirot with a flourish let me introduc you to the murder mr alfr inglethorp chapter xiii poirot explain poirot you old villain i said iv half a mind to strangl you what do you mean by deceiv me as you have done we were sit in the librari sever hectic dai lai behind us in the room below john and mari were togeth onc more while alfr inglethorp and miss howard were in custodi now at last i had poirot to myself and could reliev my still burn curios poirot did not answer me for a moment but at last he said i did not deceiv you mon ami at most i permit you to deceiv yourself ye but why well it is difficult to explain you see my friend you have a natur so honest and a counten so transpar thatenfin to conceal your feel is imposs if i had told you my idea the veri first time you saw mr alfr inglethorp that astut gentleman would havein your so express idiomsmelt a rat and then bonjour to our chanc of catch him i think that i have more diplomaci than you give me credit for my friend besought poirot i implor you do not enrag yourself your help ha been of the most invalu it is but the extrem beauti natur that you have which made me paus well i grumbl a littl mollifi i still think you might have given me a hint but i did my friend sever hint you would not take them think now did i ever sai to you that i believ john cavendish guilti did i not on the contrari tell you that he would almost certainli be acquit ye but and did i not immedi afterward speak of the difficulti of bring the murder to justic wa it not plain to you that i wa speak of two entir differ person no i said it wa not plain to me then again continu poirot at the begin did i not repeat to you sever time that i didnt want mr inglethorp arrest now that should have convei someth to you do you mean to sai you suspect him as long ago as that ye to begin with whoever els might benefit by mr inglethorp death her husband would benefit the most there wa no get awai from that when i went up to style with you that first dai i had no idea as to how the crime had been commit but from what i knew of mr inglethorp i fanci that it would be veri hard to find anyth to connect him with it when i arriv at the chateau i realiz at onc that it wa mr inglethorp who had burnt the will and there by the wai you cannot complain my friend for i tri my best to forc on you the signific of that bedroom fire in midsumm ye ye i said impati go on well my friend as i sai my view as to mr inglethorp guilt were veri much shaken there wa in fact so much evid against him that i wa inclin to believ that he had not done it when did you chang your mind when i found that the more effort i made to clear him the more effort he made to get himself arrest then when i discov that inglethorp had noth to do with mr raik and that in fact it wa john cavendish who wa interest in that quarter i wa quit sure but why simpli thi if it had been inglethorp who wa carri on an intrigu with mr raik hi silenc wa perfectli comprehens but when i discov that it wa known all over the villag that it wa john who wa attract by the farmer pretti wife hi silenc bore quit a differ interpret it wa nonsens to pretend that he wa afraid of the scandal as no possibl scandal could attach to him thi attitud of hi gave me furious to think and i wa slowli forc to the conclus that alfr inglethorp want to be arrest eh bien from that moment i wa equal determin that he should not be arrest wait a minut i dont see why he wish to be arrest becaus mon ami it is the law of your countri that a man onc acquit can never be tri again for the same offenc aha but it wa cleverhi idea assuredli he is a man of method see here he knew that in hi posit he wa bound to be suspect so he conceiv the exceedingli clever idea of prepar a lot of manufactur evid against himself he wish to be arrest he would then produc hi irreproach alibiand hei presto he wa safe for life but i still dont see how he manag to prove hi alibi and yet go to the chemist shop poirot stare at me in surpris is it possibl my poor friend you have not yet realiz that it wa miss howard who went to the chemist shop miss howard but certainli who els it wa most easi for her she is of a good height her voic is deep and manli moreov rememb she and inglethorp ar cousin and there is a distinct resembl between them especi in their gait and bear it wa simplic itself thei ar a clever pair i am still a littl fog as to how exactli the bromid busi wa done i remark bon i will reconstruct for you as far as possibl i am inclin to think that miss howard wa the master mind in that affair you rememb her onc mention that her father wa a doctor possibl she dispens hi medicin for him or she mai have taken the idea from on of the mani book ly about when mademoisel cynthia wa studi for her exam anywai she wa familiar with the fact that the addit of a bromid to a mixtur contain strychnin would caus the precipit of the latter probabl the idea came to her quit suddenli mr inglethorp had a box of bromid powder which she occasion took at night what could be easier than quietli to dissolv on or more of those powder in mr inglethorp larg size bottl of medicin when it came from coot the risk is practic nil the tragedi will not take place until nearli a fortnight later if anyon ha seen either of them touch the medicin thei will have forgotten it by that time miss howard will have engin her quarrel and depart from the hous the laps of time and her absenc will defeat all suspicion ye it wa a clever idea if thei had left it alon it is possibl the crime might never have been brought home to them but thei were not satisfi thei tri to be too cleverand that wa their undo poirot puf at hi tini cigarett hi ey fix on the ceil thei arrang a plan to throw suspicion on john cavendish by bui strychnin at the villag chemist and sign the regist in hi handwrit on mondai mr inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicin on mondai therefor at six oclock alfr inglethorp arrang to be seen by a number of peopl at a spot far remov from the villag miss howard ha previous made up a cock and bull stori about him and mr raik to account for hi hold hi tongu afterward at six oclock miss howard disguis as alfr inglethorp enter the chemist shop with her stori about a dog obtain the strychnin and write the name of alfr inglethorp in john handwrit which she had previous studi carefulli but as it will never do if john too can prove an alibi she write him an anonym notestil copi hi handwritingwhich take him to a remot spot where it is exceedingli unlik that anyon will see him so far all goe well miss howard goe back to middlingham alfr inglethorp return to style there is noth that can compromis him in ani wai sinc it is miss howard who ha the strychnin which after all is onli want as a blind to throw suspicion on john cavendish but now a hitch occur mr inglethorp doe not take her medicin that night the broken bell cynthia absencearrang by inglethorp through hi wifeal these ar wast and thenh make hi slip mr inglethorp is out and he sit down to write to hi accomplic who he fear mai be in a panic at the nonsuccess of their plan it is probabl that mr inglethorp return earlier than he expect caught in the act and somewhat flurri he hastili shut and lock hi desk he fear that if he remain in the room he mai have to open it again and that mr inglethorp might catch sight of the letter befor he could snatch it up so he goe out and walk in the wood littl dream that mr inglethorp will open hi desk and discov the incrimin document but thi as we know is what happen mr inglethorp read it and becom awar of the perfidi of her husband and evelyn howard though unfortun the sentenc about the bromid convei no warn to her mind she know that she is in dangerbut is ignor of where the danger li she decid to sai noth to her husband but sit down and write to her solicitor ask him to come on the morrow and she also determin to destroi immedi the will which she ha just made she keep the fatal letter it wa to discov that letter then that her husband forc the lock of the despatchcas ye and from the enorm risk he ran we can see how fulli he realiz it import that letter except there wa absolut noth to connect him with the crime there onli on thing i cant make out why didnt he destroi it at onc when he got hold of it becaus he did not dare take the biggest risk of allthat of keep it on hi own person i dont understand look at it from hi point of view i have discov that there were onli five short minut in which he could have taken itth five minut immedi befor our own arriv on the scene for befor that time anni wa brush the stair and would have seen anyon who pass go to the right wing figur to yourself the scene he enter the room unlock the door by mean of on of the other doorkeysthei were all much alik he hurri to the despatchcaseit is lock and the kei ar nowher to be seen that is a terribl blow to him for it mean that hi presenc in the room cannot be conceal as he had hope but he see clearli that everyth must be risk for the sake of that damn piec of evid quickli he forc the lock with a penknif and turn over the paper until he find what he is look for but now a fresh dilemma aris he dare not keep that piec of paper on him he mai be seen leav the roomh mai be search if the paper is found on him it is certain doom probabl at thi minut too he hear the sound below of mr well and john leav the boudoir he must act quickli where can he hide thi terribl slip of paper the content of the wastepaperbasket ar kept and in ani case ar sure to be examin there ar no mean of destroi it and he dare not keep it he look round and he seeswhat do you think mon ami i shook my head in a moment he ha torn the letter into long thin strip and roll them up into spill he thrust them hurriedli in amongst the other spill in the vase on the mantlepiec i utter an exclam no on would think of look there poirot continu and he will be abl at hi leisur to come back and destroi thi solitari piec of evid against him then all the time it wa in the spill vase in mr inglethorp bedroom under our veri nose i cri poirot nod ye my friend that is where i discov my last link and i ow that veri fortun discoveri to you to me ye do you rememb tell me that my hand shook as i wa straighten the ornament on the mantelpiec ye but i dont see no but i saw do you know my friend i rememb that earlier in the morn when we had been there togeth i had straighten all the object on the mantelpiec and if thei were alreadi straighten there would be no need to straighten them again unless in the meantim someon els had touch them dear me i murmur so that is the explan of your extraordinari behaviour you rush down to style and found it still there ye and it wa a race for time but i still cant understand why inglethorp wa such a fool as to leav it there when he had plenti of opportun to destroi it ah but he had no opportun i saw to that you ye do you rememb reprov me for take the household into my confid on the subject ye well my friend i saw there wa just on chanc i wa not sure then if inglethorp wa the crimin or not but if he wa i reason that he would not have the paper on him but would have hidden it somewher and by enlist the sympathi of the household i could effectu prevent hi destroi it he wa alreadi under suspicion and by make the matter public i secur the servic of about ten amateur detect who would be watch him unceasingli and be himself awar of their watch he would not dare seek further to destroi the document he wa therefor forc to depart from the hous leav it in the spill vase but sure miss howard had ampl opportun of aid him ye but miss howard did not know of the paper exist in accord with their prearrang plan she never spoke to alfr inglethorp thei were suppos to be deadli enemi and until john cavendish wa safe convict thei neither of them dare risk a meet of cours i had a watch kept on mr inglethorp hope that sooner or later he would lead me to the hidingplac but he wa too clever to take ani chanc the paper wa safe where it wa sinc no on had thought of look there in the first week it wa not like thei would do so afterward but for your lucki remark we might never have been abl to bring him to justic i understand that now but when did you first begin to suspect miss howard when i discov that she had told a lie at the inquest about the letter she had receiv from mr inglethorp why what wa there to lie about you saw that letter do you recal it gener appear yesmor or less you will recollect then that mr inglethorp wrote a veri distinct hand and left larg clear space between her word but if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notic that juli th is quit differ in thi respect do you see what i mean no i confess i dont you do not see that that letter wa not written on the th but on the ththe dai after miss howard departur the wa written in befor the to turn it into the th but why that is exactli what i ask myself why doe miss howard suppress the letter written on the th and produc thi fake on instead becaus she did not wish to show the letter of the th why again and at onc a suspicion dawn in my mind you will rememb my sai that it wa wise to bewar of peopl who were not tell you the truth and yet i cri indignantli after that you gave me two reason why miss howard could not have commit the crime and veri good reason too repli poirot for a long time thei were a stumblingblock to me until i rememb a veri signific fact that she and alfr inglethorp were cousin she could not have commit the crime singlehand but the reason against that did not debar her from be an accomplic and then there wa that rather overveh hatr of her it conceal a veri opposit emot there wa undoubtedli a tie of passion between them long befor he came to style thei had alreadi arrang their infam plotthat he should marri thi rich but rather foolish old ladi induc her to make a will leav her monei to him and then gain their end by a veri cleverli conceiv crime if all had gone as thei plan thei would probabl have left england and live togeth on their poor victim monei thei ar a veri astut and unscrupul pair while suspicion wa to be direct against him she would be make quiet prepar for a veri differ d nouement she arriv from middlingham with all the compromis item in her possess no suspicion attach to her no notic is paid to her come and go in the hous she hide the strychnin and glass in john room she put the beard in the attic she will see to it that sooner or later thei ar duli discov i dont quit see why thei tri to fix the blame on john i remark it would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to lawrenc ye but that wa mere chanc all the evid against him aros out of pure accid it must in fact have been distinctli annoi to the pair of schemer hi manner wa unfortun i observ thoughtfulli ye you realiz of cours what wa at the back of that no you did not understand that he believ mademoisel cynthia guilti of the crime no i exclaim astonish imposs not at all i myself nearli had the same idea it wa in my mind when i ask mr well that first question about the will then there were the bromid powder which she had made up and her clever male imperson as dorca recount them to us there wa realli more evid against her than anyon els you ar joke poirot no shall i tell you what made monsieur lawrenc turn so pale when he first enter hi mother room on the fatal night it wa becaus whilst hi mother lai there obvious poison he saw over your shoulder that the door into mademoisel cynthia room wa unbolt but he declar that he saw it bolt i cri exactli said poirot dryli and that wa just what confirm my suspicion that it wa not he wa shield mademoisel cynthia but why should he shield her becaus he is in love with her i laugh there poirot you ar quit wrong i happen to know for a fact that far from be in love with her he posit dislik her who told you that mon ami cynthia herself la pauvr petit and she wa concern she said that she did not mind at all then she certainli did mind veri much remark poirot thei ar like thatl femm what you sai about lawrenc is a great surpris to me i said but why it wa most obviou did not monsieur lawrenc make the sour face everi time mademoisel cynthia spoke and laugh with hi brother he had taken it into hi long head that mademoisel cynthia wa in love with monsieur john when he enter hi mother room and saw her obvious poison he jump to the conclus that mademoisel cynthia knew someth about the matter he wa nearli driven desper first he crush the coffeecup to powder under hi feet rememb that she had gone up with hi mother the night befor and he determin that there should be no chanc of test it content thenceforward he strenuous and quit uselessli upheld the theori of death from natur caus and what about the extra coffeecup i wa fairli certain that it wa mr cavendish who had hidden it but i had to make sure monsieur lawrenc did not know at all what i meant but on reflect he came to the conclus that if he could find an extra coffeecup anywher hi ladi love would be clear of suspicion and he wa perfectli right on thing more what did mr inglethorp mean by her dy word thei were of cours an accus against her husband dear me poirot i said with a sigh i think you have explain everyth i am glad it ha all end so happili even john and hi wife ar reconcil thank to me how do you meanthank to you my dear friend do you not realiz that it wa simpli and sole the trial which ha brought them togeth again that john cavendish still love hi wife i wa convinc also that she wa equal in love with him but thei had drift veri far apart it all aros from a misunderstand she marri him without love he knew it he is a sensit man in hi wai he would not forc himself upon her if she did not want him and as he withdrew her love awok but thei ar both unusu proud and their pride held them inexor apart he drift into an entangl with mr raik and she deliber cultiv the friendship of dr bauerstein do you rememb the dai of john cavendish arrest when you found me deliber over a big decis ye i quit understood your distress pardon me mon ami but you did not understand it in the least i wa try to decid whether or not i would clear john cavendish at onc i could have clear himthough it might have meant a failur to convict the real crimin thei were entir in the dark as to my real attitud up to the veri last momentwhich partli account for my success do you mean that you could have save john cavendish from be brought to trial ye my friend but i eventu decid in favour of a woman happi noth but the great danger through which thei have pass could have brought these two proud soul togeth again i look at poirot in silent amaz the coloss cheek of the littl man who on earth but poirot would have thought of a trial for murder as a restor of conjug happi i perceiv your thought mon ami said poirot smile at me no on but hercul poirot would have attempt such a thing and you ar wrong in condemn it the happi of on man and on woman is the greatest thing in all the world hi word took me back to earlier event i rememb mari as she lai white and exhaust on the sofa listen listen there had come the sound of the bell below she had start up poirot had open the door and meet her agon ey had nod gentli ye madam he said i have brought him back to you he had stood asid and as i went out i had seen the look in mari ey as john cavendish had caught hi wife in hi arm perhap you ar right poirot i said gentli ye it is the greatest thing in the world suddenli there wa a tap at the door and cynthia peep in ii onli come in i said spring up she came in but did not sit down ionli want to tell you someth ye cynthia fidget with a littl tassel for some moment then suddenli exclaim you dear kiss first me and then poirot and rush out of the room again what on earth doe thi mean i ask surpris it wa veri nice to be kiss by cynthia but the public of the salut rather impair the pleasur it mean that she ha discov monsieur lawrenc doe not dislik her as much as she thought repli poirot philosoph but here he is lawrenc at that moment pass the door eh monsieur lawrenc call poirot we must congratul you is it not so lawrenc blush and then smile awkwardli a man in love is a sorri spectacl now cynthia had look charm i sigh what is it mon ami noth i said sadli thei ar two delight women and neither of them is for you finish poirot never mind consol
