and the fashion world dismai by the murder of the honour ronald adair under most unusu and inexplic circumst the public ha alreadi learn those particular of the crime which came out in the polic investig but a good deal wa suppress upon that occas sinc the case for the prosecut wa so overwhelmingli strong that it wa not necessari to bring forward all the fact onli now at the end of nearli ten year am i allow to suppli those miss link which make up the whole of that remark chain the crime wa of interest in itself but that interest wa as noth to me compar to the inconceiv sequel which afford me the greatest shock and surpris of ani event in my adventur life even now after thi long interv i find myself thrill as i think of it and feel onc more that sudden flood of joi amaz and incredul which utterli submerg my mind let me sai to that public which ha shown some interest in those glimps which i have occasion given them of the thought and action of a veri remark man that thei ar not to blame me if i have not share my knowledg with them for i should have consid it my first duti to do so had i not been bar by a posit prohibit from hi own lip which wa onli withdrawn upon the third of last month it can be imagin that my close intimaci with sherlock holm had interest me deepli in crime and that after hi disappear i never fail to read with care the variou problem which came befor the public and i even attempt more than onc for my own privat satisfact to emploi hi method in their solut though with indiffer success there wa none howev which appeal to me like thi tragedi of ronald adair as i read the evid at the inquest which led up to a verdict of will murder against some person or person unknown i realiz more clearli than i had ever done the loss which the commun had sustain by the death of sherlock holm there were point about thi strang busi which would i wa sure have special appeal to him and the effort of the polic would have been supplement or more probabl anticip by the train observ and the alert mind of the first crimin agent in europ all dai as i drove upon my round i turn over the case in my mind and found no explan which appear to me to be adequ at the risk of tell a twicetold tale i will recapitul the fact as thei were known to the public at the conclus of the inquest the honour ronald adair wa the second son of the earl of maynooth at that time governor of on of the australian coloni adair s mother had return from australia to undergo the oper for cataract and she her son ronald and her daughter hilda were live togeth at park lane the youth move in the best societyhad so far as wa known no enemi and no particular vice he had been engag to miss edith woodlei of carstair but the engag had been broken off by mutual consent some month befor and there wa no sign that it had left ani veri profound feel behind it for the rest sic the man s life move in a narrow and convent circl for hi habit were quiet and hi natur unemot yet it wa upon thi easygo young aristocrat that death came in most strang and unexpect form between the hour of ten and eleventwenti on the night of march ronald adair wa fond of cardsplai continu but never for such stake as would hurt him he wa a member of the baldwin the cavendish and the bagatel card club it wa shown that after dinner on the dai of hi death he had plai a rubber of whist at the latter club he had also plai there in the afternoon the evid of those who had plai with himmr murrai sir john hardi and colonel moranshow that the game wa whist and that there wa a fairli equal fall of the card adair might have lost five pound but not more hi fortun wa a consider on and such a loss could not in ani wai affect him he had plai nearli everi dai at on club or other but he wa a cautiou player and usual rose a winner it came out in evid that in partnership with colonel moran he had actual won as much as four hundr and twenti pound in a sit some week befor from godfrei milner and lord balmor so much for hi recent histori as it came out at the inquest on the even of the crime he return from the club exactli at ten hi mother and sister were out spend the even with a relat the servant depos that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor gener us as hi sittingroom she had lit a fire there and as it smoke she had open the window no sound wa heard from the room until eleventwenti the hour of the return of ladi maynooth and her daughter desir to sai goodnight she attempt to enter her son s room the door wa lock on the insid and no answer could be got to their cri and knock help wa obtain and the door forc the unfortun young man wa found ly near the tabl hi head had been horribl mutil by an expand revolv bullet but no weapon of ani sort wa to be found in the room on the tabl lai two banknot for ten pound each and seventeen pound ten in silver and gold the monei arrang in littl pile of vari amount there were some figur also upon a sheet of paper with the name of some club friend opposit to them from which it wa conjectur that befor hi death he wa endeavour to make out hi loss or win at card a minut examin of the circumst serv onli to make the case more complex in the first place no reason could be given why the young man should have fasten the door upon the insid there wa the possibl that the murder had done thi and had afterward escap by the window the drop wa at least twenti feet howev and a bed of crocus in full bloom lai beneath neither the flower nor the earth show ani sign of have been disturb nor were there ani mark upon the narrow strip of grass which separ the hous from the road appar therefor it wa the young man himself who had fasten the door but how did he come by hi death no on could have climb up to the window without leav trace suppos a man had fire through the window he would inde be a remark shot who could with a revolv inflict so deadli a wound again park lane is a frequent thoroughfar there is a cab stand within a hundr yard of the hous no on had heard a shot and yet there wa the dead man and there the revolv bullet which had mushroom out as softnos bullet will and so inflict a wound which must have caus instantan death such were the circumst of the park lane mysteri which were further complic by entir absenc of motiv sinc as i have said young adair wa not known to have ani enemi and no attempt had been made to remov the monei or valuabl in the room all dai i turn these fact over in my mind endeavour to hit upon some theori which could reconcil them all and to find that line of least resist which my poor friend had declar to be the startingpoint of everi investig i confess that i made littl progress in the even i stroll across the park and found myself about six o clock at the oxford street end of park lane a group of loafer upon the pavement all stare up at a particular window direct me to the hous which i had come to see a tall thin man with colour glass whom i strongli suspect of be a plaincloth detect wa point out some theori of hi own while the other crowd round to listen to what he said i got as near him as i could but hi observ seem to me to be absurd so i withdrew again in some disgust as i did so i struck against an elderli deform man who had been behind me and i knock down sever book which he wa carri i rememb that as i pick them up i observ the titl of on of them the origin of tree worship and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophil who either as a trade or as a hobbi wa a collector of obscur volum i endeavour to apolog for the accid but it wa evid that these book which i had so unfortun maltreat were veri preciou object in the ey of their owner with a snarl of contempt he turn upon hi heel and i saw hi curv back and white sidewhisk disappear among the throng my observ of no park lane did littl to clear up the problem in which i wa interest the hous wa separ from the street by a low wall and rail the whole not more than five feet high it wa perfectli easi therefor for anyon to get into the garden but the window wa entir inaccess sinc there wa no waterpip or anyth which could help the most activ man to climb it more puzzl than ever i retrac my step to kensington i had not been in my studi five minut when the maid enter to sai that a person desir to see me to my astonish it wa none other than my strang old book collector hi sharp wizen face peer out from a frame of white hair and hi preciou volum a dozen of them at least wedg under hi right arm you re surpris to see me sir said he in a strang croak voic i acknowledg that i wa well i ve a conscienc sir and when i chanc to see you go into thi hous as i came hobbl after you i thought to myself i ll just step in and see that kind gentleman and tell him that if i wa a bit gruff in my manner there wa not ani harm meant and that i am much oblig to him for pick up my book you make too much of a trifl said i mai i ask how you knew who i wa well sir if it isn t too great a liberti i am a neighbour of your for you ll find my littl bookshop at the corner of church street and veri happi to see you i am sure mayb you collect yourself sir here s british bird and catullu and the holi wara bargain everi on of them with five volum you could just fill that gap on that second shelf it look untidi doe it not sir i move my head to look at the cabinet behind me when i turn again sherlock holm wa stand smile at me across my studi tabl i rose to my feet stare at him for some second in utter amaz and then it appear that i must have faint for the first and the last time in my life certainli a grai mist swirl befor my ey and when it clear i found my collarend undon and the tingl aftertast of brandi upon my lip holm wa bend over my chair hi flask in hi hand my dear watson said the wellrememb voic i ow you a thousand apolog i had no idea that you would be so affect i grip him by the arm holm i cri is it realli you can it inde be that you ar aliv is it possibl that you succeed in climb out of that aw abyss wait a moment said he ar you sure that you ar realli fit to discuss thing i have given you a seriou shock by my unnecessarili dramat reappear i am all right but inde holm i can hardli believ my ey good heaven to think that youyou of all menshould be stand in my studi again i grip him by the sleev and felt the thin sinewi arm beneath it well you re not a spirit anyhow said i my dear chap i m overjoi to see you sit down and tell me how you came aliv out of that dread chasm he sat opposit to me and lit a cigarett in hi old nonchal manner he wa dress in the seedi frockcoat of the book merchant but the rest of that individu lai in a pile of white hair and old book upon the tabl holm look even thinner and keener than of old but there wa a deadwhit ting in hi aquilin face which told me that hi life recent had not been a healthi on i am glad to stretch myself watson said he it is no joke when a tall man ha to take a foot off hi statur for sever hour on end now my dear fellow in the matter of these explan we have if i mai ask for your cooper a hard and danger night s work in front of us perhap it would be better if i gave you an account of the whole situat when that work is finish i am full of curios i should much prefer to hear now you ll come with me tonight when you like and where you like thi is inde like the old dai we shall have time for a mouth of dinner befor we need go well then about that chasm i had no seriou difficulti in get out of it for the veri simpl reason that i never wa in it you never were in it no watson i never wa in it my note to you wa absolut genuin i had littl doubt that i had come to the end of my career when i perceiv the somewhat sinist figur of the late professor moriarti stand upon the narrow pathwai which led to safeti i read an inexor purpos in hi grai ey i exchang some remark with him therefor and obtain hi courteou permiss to write the short note which you afterward receiv i left it with my cigarettebox and my stick and i walk along the pathwai moriarti still at my heel when i reach the end i stood at bai he drew no weapon but he rush at me and threw hi long arm around me he knew that hi own game wa up and wa onli anxiou to reveng himself upon me we totter togeth upon the brink of the fall i have some knowledg howev of baritsu or the japanes system of wrestl which ha more than onc been veri us to me i slip through hi grip and he with a horribl scream kick madli for a few second and claw the air with both hi hand but for all hi effort he could not get hi balanc and over he went with my face over the brink i saw him fall for a long wai then he struck a rock bound off and splash into the water i listen with amaz to thi explan which holm deliv between the puff of hi cigarett but the track i cri i saw with my own ey that two went down the path and none return it came about in thi wai the instant that the professor had disappear it struck me what a realli extraordinarili lucki chanc fate had place in my wai i knew that moriarti wa not the onli man who had sworn my death there were at least three other whose desir for vengeanc upon me would onli be increas by the death of their leader thei were all most danger men on or other would certainli get me on the other hand if all the world wa convinc that i wa dead thei would take liberti these men thei would soon lai themselv open and sooner or later i could destroi them then it would be time for me to announc that i wa still in the land of the live so rapidli doe the brain act that i believ i had thought thi all out befor professor moriarti had reach the bottom of the reichenbach fall i stood up and examin the rocki wall behind me in your picturesqu account of the matter which i read with great interest some month later you assert that the wall wa sheer that wa not liter true a few small foothold present themselv and there wa some indic of a ledg the cliff is so high that to climb it all wa an obviou imposs and it wa equal imposs to make my wai along the wet path without leav some track i might it is true have revers my boot as i have done on similar occas but the sight of three set of track in on direct would certainli have suggest a decept on the whole then it wa best that i should risk the climb it wa not a pleasant busi watson the fall roar beneath me i am not a fanci person but i give you my word that i seem to hear moriarti s voic scream at me out of the abyss a mistak would have been fatal more than onc as tuft of grass came out in my hand or my foot slip in the wet notch of the rock i thought that i wa gone but i struggl upward and at last i reach a ledg sever feet deep and cover with soft green moss where i could lie unseen in the most perfect comfort there i wa stretch when you my dear watson and all your follow were investig in the most sympathet and ineffici manner the circumst of my death at last when you had all form your inevit and total erron conclus you depart for the hotel and i wa left alon i had imagin that i had reach the end of my adventur but a veri unexpect occurr show me that there were surpris still in store for me a huge rock fall from abov boom past me struck the path and bound over into the chasm for an instant i thought that it wa an accid but a moment later look up i saw a man s head against the darken sky and anoth stone struck the veri ledg upon which i wa stretch within a foot of my head of cours the mean of thi wa obviou moriarti had not been alon a confederateand even that on glanc had told me how danger a man that confeder washad kept guard while the professor had attack me from a distanc unseen by me he had been a wit of hi friend s death and of my escap he had wait and then make hi wai round to the top of the cliff he had endeavour to succe where hi comrad had fail i did not take long to think about it watson again i saw that grim face look over the cliff and i knew that it wa the precursor of anoth stone i scrambl down on to the path i don t think i could have done it in cold blood it wa a hundr time more difficult than get up but i had no time to think of the danger for anoth stone sang past me as i hung by my hand from the edg of the ledg halfwai down i slip but by the bless of god i land torn and bleed upon the path i took to my heel did ten mile over the mountain in the dark and a week later i found myself in florenc with the certainti that no on in the world knew what had becom of me i had onli on confidantmi brother mycroft i ow you mani apolog my dear watson but it wa allimport that it should be thought i wa dead and it is quit certain that you would not have written so convinc an account of my unhappi end had you not yourself thought that it wa true sever time dure the last three year i have taken up my pen to write to you but alwai i fear lest your affection regard for me should tempt you to some indiscret which would betrai my secret for that reason i turn awai from you thi even when you upset my book for i wa in danger at the time and ani show of surpris and emot upon your part might have drawn attent to my ident and led to the most deplor and irrepar result as to mycroft i had to confid in him in order to obtain the monei which i need the cours of event in london did not run so well as i had hope for the trial of the moriarti gang left two of it most danger member my own most vindict enemi at liberti i travel for two year in tibet therefor and amus myself by visit lhassa and spend some dai with the head lama you mai have read of the remark explor of a norwegian name sigerson but i am sure that it never occur to you that you were receiv new of your friend i then pass through persia look in at mecca and paid a short but interest visit to the khalifa at khartoum the result of which i have commun to the foreign offic return to franc i spent some month in a research into the coaltar deriv which i conduct in a laboratori at montpelli in the south of franc have conclud thi to my satisfact and learn that onli on of my enemi wa now left in london i wa about to return when my movement were hasten by the new of thi veri remark park lane mysteri which not onli appeal to me by it own merit but which seem to offer some most peculiar person opportun i came over at onc to london call in my own person at baker street threw mr hudson into violent hyster and found that mycroft had preserv my room and my paper exactli as thei had alwai been so it wa my dear watson that at two o clock todai i found myself in my old armchair in my own old room and onli wish that i could have seen my old friend watson in the other chair which he ha so often adorn such wa the remark narr to which i listen on that april eveninga narr which would have been utterli incred to me had it not been confirm by the actual sight of the tall spare figur and the keen eager face which i had never thought to see again in some manner he had learn of my own sad bereav and hi sympathi wa shown in hi manner rather than in hi word work is the best antidot to sorrow my dear watson said he and i have a piec of work for us both tonight which if we can bring it to a success conclus will in itself justifi a man s life on thi planet in vain i beg him to tell me more you will hear and see enough befor morn he answer we have three year of the past to discuss let that suffic until halfpast nine when we start upon the notabl adventur of the empti hous it wa inde like old time when at that hour i found myself seat besid him in a hansom my revolv in my pocket and the thrill of adventur in my heart holm wa cold and stern and silent as the gleam of the streetlamp flash upon hi auster featur i saw that hi brow were drawn down in thought and hi thin lip compress i knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungl of crimin london but i wa well assur from the bear of thi master huntsman that the adventur wa a most grave onewhil the sardon smile which occasion broke through hi ascet gloom bode littl good for the object of our quest i had imagin that we were bound for baker street but holm stop the cab at the corner of cavendish squar i observ that as he step out he gave a most search glanc to right and left and at everi subsequ street corner he took the utmost pain to assur that he wa not follow our rout wa certainli a singular on holm s knowledg of the bywai of london wa extraordinari and on thi occas he pass rapidli and with an assur step through a network of mew and stabl the veri exist of which i had never known we emerg at last into a small road line with old gloomi hous which led us into manchest street and so to blandford street here he turn swiftli down a narrow passag pass through a wooden gate into a desert yard and then open with a kei the back door of a hous we enter togeth and he close it behind us the place wa pitch dark but it wa evid to me that it wa an empti hous our feet creak and crackl over the bare plank and my outstretch hand touch a wall from which the paper wa hang in ribbon holm s cold thin finger close round my wrist and led me forward down a long hall until i dimli saw the murki fanlight over the door here holm turn suddenli to the right and we found ourselv in a larg squar empti room heavili shadow in the corner but faintli lit in the centr from the light of the street beyond there wa no lamp near and the window wa thick with dust so that we could onli just discern each other s figur within my companion put hi hand upon my shoulder and hi lip close to my ear do you know where we ar he whisper sure that is baker street i answer stare through the dim window exactli we ar in camden hous which stand opposit to our own old quarter but why ar we here becaus it command so excel a view of that picturesqu pile might i troubl you my dear watson to draw a littl nearer to the window take everi precaut not to show yourself and then to look up at our old roomsth startingpoint of so mani of your littl fairytal we will see if my three year of absenc have entir taken awai my power to surpris you i crept forward and look across at the familiar window as my ey fell upon it i gave a gasp and a cry of amaz the blind wa down and a strong light wa burn in the room the shadow of a man who wa seat in a chair within wa thrown in hard black outlin upon the lumin screen of the window there wa no mistak the pois of the head the squar of the shoulder the sharp of the featur the face wa turn halfround and the effect wa that of on of those black silhouett which our grandpar love to frame it wa a perfect reproduct of holm so amaz wa i that i threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself wa stand besid me he wa quiver with silent laughter well said he good heaven i cri it is marvel i trust that ag doth not wither nor custom stale my infinit varieti said he and i recogn in hi voic the joi and pride which the artist take in hi own creation it realli is rather like me is it not i should be prepar to swear that it wa you the credit of the execut is due to monsieur oscar meunier of grenobl who spent some dai in do the mould it is a bust in wax the rest i arrang myself dure my visit to baker street thi afternoon but why becaus my dear watson i had the strongest possibl reason for wish certain peopl to think that i wa there when i wa realli elsewher and you thought the room were watch i knew that thei were watch by whom by my old enemi watson by the charm societi whose leader li in the reichenbach fall you must rememb that thei knew and onli thei knew that i wa still aliv sooner or later thei believ that i should come back to my room thei watch them continu and thi morn thei saw me arriv how do you know becaus i recogn their sentinel when i glanc out of my window he is a harmless enough fellow parker by name a garrot by trade and a remark perform upon the jew sharp i care noth for him but i care a great deal for the much more formid person who wa behind him the bosom friend of moriarti the man who drop the rock over the cliff the most cun and danger crimin in london that is the man who is after me tonight watson and that is the man who is quit unawar that we ar after him my friend s plan were gradual reveal themselv from thi conveni retreat the watcher were be watch and the tracker track that angular shadow up yonder wa the bait and we were the hunter in silenc we stood togeth in the dark and watch the hurri figur who pass and repass in front of us holm wa silent and motionless but i could tell that he wa keenli alert and that hi ey were fix intent upon the stream of passersbi it wa a bleak and boister night and the wind whistl shrilli down the long street mani peopl were move to and fro most of them muffl in their coat and cravat onc or twice it seem to me that i had seen the same figur befor and i especi notic two men who appear to be shelter themselv from the wind in the doorwai of a hous some distanc up the street i tri to draw my companion s attent to them but he gave a littl ejacul of impati and continu to stare into the street more than onc he fidget with hi feet and tap rapidli with hi finger upon the wall it wa evid to me that he wa becom uneasi and that hi plan were not work out altogeth as he had hope at last as midnight approach and the street gradual clear he pace up and down the room in uncontrol agit i wa about to make some remark to him when i rais my ey to the light window and again experienc almost as great a surpris as befor i clutch holm s arm and point upward the shadow ha move i cri it wa inde no longer the profil but the back which wa turn toward us three year had certainli not smooth the asper of hi temper or hi impati with a less activ intellig than hi own of cours it ha move said he am i such a farcic bungler watson that i should erect an obviou dummi and expect that some of the sharpest men in europ would be deceiv by it we have been in thi room two hour and mr hudson ha made some chang in that figur eight time or onc in everi quarter of an hour she work it from the front so that her shadow mai never be seen ah he drew in hi breath with a shrill excit intak in the dim light i saw hi head thrown forward hi whole attitud rigid with attent outsid the street wa absolut desert those two men might still be crouch in the doorwai but i could no longer see them all wa still and dark save onli that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figur outlin upon it centr again in the utter silenc i heard that thin sibil note which spoke of intens suppress excit an instant later he pull me back into the blackest corner of the room and i felt hi warn hand upon my lip the finger which clutch me were quiver never had i known my friend more move and yet the dark street still stretch lone and motionless befor us but suddenli i wa awar of that which hi keener sens had alreadi distinguish a low stealthi sound came to my ear not from the direct of baker street but from the back of the veri hous in which we lai conceal a door open and shut an instant later step crept down the passagestep which were meant to be silent but which reverber harshli through the empti hous holm crouch back against the wall and i did the same my hand close upon the handl of my revolv peer through the gloom i saw the vagu outlin of a man a shade blacker than the black of the open door he stood for an instant and then he crept forward crouch menac into the room he wa within three yard of us thi sinist figur and i had brace myself to meet hi spring befor i realiz that he had no idea of our presenc he pass close besid us stole over to the window and veri softli and noiselessli rais it for half a foot as he sank to the level of thi open the light of the street no longer dim by the dusti glass fell full upon hi face the man seem to be besid himself with excit hi two ey shone like star and hi featur were work convuls he wa an elderli man with a thin project nose a high bald forehead and a huge grizzl moustach an opera hat wa push to the back of hi head and an even dress shirtfront gleam out through hi open overcoat hi face wa gaunt and swarthi score with deep savag line in hi hand he carri what appear to be a stick but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metal clang then from the pocket of hi overcoat he drew a bulki object and he busi himself in some task which end with a loud sharp click as if a spring or bolt had fallen into it place still kneel upon the floor he bent forward and threw all hi weight and strength upon some lever with the result that there came a long whirl grind nois end onc more in a power click he straighten himself then and i saw that what he held in hi hand wa a sort of gun with a curious misshapen butt he open it at the breech put someth in and snap the breechlock then crouch down he rest the end of the barrel upon the ledg of the open window and i saw hi long moustach droop over the stock and hi ey gleam as it peer along the sight i heard a littl sigh of satisfact as he cuddl the butt into hi shoulder and saw that amaz target the black man on the yellow ground stand clear at the end of hi foresight for an instant he wa rigid and motionless then hi finger tighten on the trigger there wa a strang loud whiz and a long silveri tinkl of broken glass at that instant holm sprang like a tiger on to the marksman s back and hurl him flat upon hi face he wa up again in a moment and with convuls strength he seiz holm by the throat but i struck him on the head with the butt of my revolv and he drop again upon the floor i fell upon him and as i held him my comrad blew a shrill call upon a whistl there wa the clatter of run feet upon the pavement and two policemen in uniform with on plaincloth detect rush through the front entranc and into the room that you lestrad said holm ye mr holm i took the job myself it s good to see you back in london sir i think you want a littl unoffici help three

tiger there ar some tree watson which grow to a certain height and then suddenli develop some unsightli eccentr you will see it often in human i have a theori that the individu repres in hi develop the whole process of hi ancestor and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stand for some strong influenc which came into the line of hi pedigre the person becom as it were the epitom of the histori of hi own famili it is sure rather fanci well i don t insist upon it whatev the caus colonel moran began to go wrong without ani open scandal he still made india too hot to hold him he retir came to london and again acquir an evil name it wa at thi time that he wa sought out by professor moriarti to whom for a time he wa chief of the staff moriarti suppli him liber with monei and us him onli in on or two veri highclass job which no ordinari crimin could have undertaken you mai have some recollect of the death of mr stewart of lauder in not well i am sure moran wa at the bottom of it but noth could be prove so cleverli wa the colonel conceal that even when the moriarti gang wa broken up we could not incrimin him you rememb at that date when i call upon you in your room how i put up the shutter for fear of airgun no doubt you thought me fanci i knew exactli what i wa do for i knew of the exist of thi remark gun and i knew also that on of the best shot in the world would be behind it when we were in switzerland he follow us with moriarti and it wa undoubtedli he who gave me that evil five minut on the reichenbach ledg you mai think that i read the paper with some attent dure my sojourn in franc on the lookout for ani chanc of lai him by the heel so long as he wa free in london my life would realli not have been worth live night and dai the shadow would have been over me and sooner or later hi chanc must have come what could i do i could not shoot him at sight or i should myself be in the dock there wa no us appeal to a magistr thei cannot interfer on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion so i could do noth but i watch the crimin new know that sooner or later i should get him then came the death of thi ronald adair my chanc had come at last know what i did wa it not certain that colonel moran had done it he had plai card with the lad he had follow him home from the club he had shot him through the open window there wa not a doubt of it the bullet alon ar enough to put hi head in a noos i came over at onc i wa seen by the sentinel who would i knew direct the colonel s attent to my presenc he could not fail to connect my sudden return with hi crime and to be terribl alarm i wa sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the wai at onc and would bring round hi murder weapon for that purpos i left him an excel mark in the window and have warn the polic that thei might be neededbi the wai watson you spot their presenc in that doorwai with uner accuracyi took up what seem to me to be a judici post for observ never dream that he would choos the same spot for hi attack now my dear watson doe anyth remain for me to explain ye said i you have not made it clear what wa colonel moran s motiv in murder the honour ronald adair ah my dear watson there we come into those realm of conjectur where the most logic mind mai be at fault each mai form hi own hypothesi upon the present evid and your is as like to be correct as mine you have form on then i think that it is not difficult to explain the fact it came out in evid that colonel moran and young adair had between them won a consider amount of monei now moran undoubtedli plai foulof that i have long been awar i believ that on the dai of the murder adair had discov that moran wa cheat veri like he had spoken to him privat and had threaten to expos him unless he voluntarili resign hi membership of the club and promis not to plai card again it is unlik that a youngster like adair would at onc make a hideou scandal by expos a well known man so much older than himself probabl he act as i suggest the exclus from hi club would mean ruin to moran who live by hi illgotten cardgain he therefor murder adair who at the time wa endeavour to work out how much monei he should himself return sinc he could not profit by hi partner s foul plai he lock the door lest the ladi should surpris him and insist upon know what he wa do with these name and coin will it pass i have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth it will be verifi or disprov at the trial meanwhil come what mai colonel moran will troubl us no more the famou airgun of von herder will embellish the scotland yard museum and onc again mr sherlock holm is free to devot hi life to examin those interest littl problem which the complex life of london so plentifulli present the adventur

remain with my prison and i am bound to warn him that anyth he mai sai will appear in evid against him i wish noth better said our client all i ask is that you should hear and recogn the absolut truth lestrad look at hi watch i ll give you half an hour said he i must explain first said mcfarlan that i knew noth of mr jona oldacr hi name wa familiar to me for mani year ago my parent were acquaint with him but thei drift apart i wa veri much surpris therefor when yesterdai about three o clock in the afternoon he walk into my offic in the citi but i wa still more astonish when he told me the object of hi visit he had in hi hand sever sheet of a notebook cover with scribbl writingher thei areand he laid them on my tabl here is my will said he i want you mr mcfarlan to cast it into proper legal shape i will sit here while you do so i set myself to copi it and you can imagin my astonish when i found that with some reserv he had left all hi properti to me he wa a strang littl ferretlik man with white eyelash and when i look up at him i found hi keen grai ey fix upon me with an amus express i could hardli believ my own as i read the term of the will but he explain that he wa a bachelor with hardli ani live relat that he had known my parent in hi youth and that he had alwai heard of me as a veri deserv young man and wa assur that hi monei would be in worthi hand of cours i could onli stammer out my thank the will wa duli finish sign and wit by my clerk thi is it on the blue paper and these slip as i have explain ar the rough draft mr jona oldacr then inform me that there were a number of documentsbuild leas titlede mortgag scrip and so forthwhich it wa necessari that i should see and understand he said that hi mind would not be easi until the whole thing wa settl and he beg me to come out to hi hous at norwood that night bring the will with me and to arrang matter rememb my boi not on word to your parent about the affair until everyth is settl we will keep it as a littl surpris for them he wa veri insist upon thi point and made me promis it faithfulli you can imagin mr holm that i wa not in a humour to refus him anyth that he might ask he wa my benefactor and all my desir wa to carri out hi wish in everi particular i sent a telegram home therefor to sai that i had import busi on hand and that it wa imposs for me to sai how late i might be mr oldacr had told me that he would like me to have supper with him at nine as he might not be home befor that hour i had some difficulti in find hi hous howev and it wa nearli halfpast befor i reach it i found him on moment said holm who open the door a middleag woman who wa i suppos hi housekeep and it wa she i presum who mention your name exactli said mcfarlan prai proce mcfarlan wipe hi damp brow and then continu hi narr i wa shown by thi woman into a sittingroom where a frugal supper wa laid out afterward mr jona oldacr led me into hi bedroom in which there stood a heavi safe thi he open and took out a mass of document which we went over togeth it wa between eleven and twelv when we finish he remark that we must not disturb the housekeep he show me out through hi own french window which had been open all thi time wa the blind down ask holm i will not be sure but i believ that it wa onli half down ye i rememb how he pull it up in order to swing open the window i could not find my stick and he said never mind my boi i shall see a good deal of you now i hope and i will keep your stick until you come back to claim it i left him there the safe open and the paper made up in packet upon the tabl it wa so late that i could not get back to blackheath so i spent the night at the anerlei arm and i knew noth more until i read of thi horribl affair in the morn anyth more that you would like to ask mr holm said lestrad whose eyebrow had gone up onc or twice dure thi remark explan not until i have been to blackheath you mean to norwood said lestrad oh ye no doubt that is what i must have meant said holm with hi enigmat smile lestrad had learn by more experi than he would care to acknowledg that that brain could cut through that which wa impenetr to him i saw him look curious at my companion i think i should like to have a word with you present mr sherlock holm said he now mr mcfarlan two of my constabl ar at the door and there is a fourwheel wait the wretch young man aros and with a last beseech glanc at us walk from the room the offic conduct him to the cab but lestrad remain holm had pick up the page which form the rough draft of the will and wa look at them with the keenest interest upon hi face there ar some point about that document lestrad ar there not said he push them over the offici look at them with a puzzl express i can read the first few line and these in the middl of the second page and on or two at the end those ar as clear as print said he but the write in between is veri bad and there ar three place where i cannot read it at all what do you make of that said holm well what do you make of it that it wa written in a train the good write repres station the bad write movement and the veri bad write pass over point a scientif expert would pronounc at onc that thi wa drawn up on a suburban line sinc nowher save in the immedi vicin of a great citi could there be so quick a success of point grant that hi whole journei wa occupi in draw up the will then the train wa an express onli stop onc between norwood and london bridg lestrad began to laugh you ar too mani for me when you begin to get on your theori mr holm said he how doe thi bear on the case well it corrobor the young man s stori to the extent that the will wa drawn up by jona oldacr in hi journei yesterdai it is curiousi it notthat a man should draw up so import a document in so haphazard a fashion it suggest that he did not think it wa go to be of much practic import if a man drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effect he might do it so well he drew up hi own death warrant at the same time said lestrad oh you think so don t you well it is quit possibl but the case is not clear to me yet not clear well if that isn t clear what could be clear here is a young man who learn suddenli that if a certain older man di he will succe to a fortun what doe he do he sai noth to anyon but he arrang that he shall go out on some pretext to see hi client that night he wait until the onli other person in the hous is in bed and then in the solitud of a man s room he murder him burn hi bodi in the woodpil and depart to a neighbour hotel the bloodstain in the room and also on the stick ar veri slight it is probabl that he imagin hi crime to be a bloodless on and hope that if the bodi were consum it would hide all trace of the method of hi deathtrac which for some reason must have point to him is not all thi obviou it strike me my good lestrad as be just a trifl too obviou said holm you do not add imagin to your other great qualiti but if you could for on moment put yourself in the place of thi young man would you choos the veri night after the will had been made to commit your crime would it not seem danger to you to make so veri close a relat between the two incid again would you choos an occas when you ar known to be in the hous when a servant ha let you in and final would you take the great pain to conceal the bodi and yet leav your own stick as a sign that you were the crimin confess lestrad that all thi is veri unlik as to the stick mr holm you know as well as i do that a crimin is often flurri and doe such thing which a cool man would avoid he wa veri like afraid to go back to the room give me anoth theori that would fit the fact i could veri easili give you half a dozen said holm here for exampl is a veri possibl and even probabl on i make you a free present of it the older man is show document which ar of evid valu a pass tramp see them through the window the blind of which is onli half down exit the solicitor enter the tramp he seiz a stick which he observ there kill oldacr and depart after burn the bodi why should the tramp burn the bodi for the matter of that why should mcfarlan to hide some evid possibl the tramp want to hide that ani murder at all had been commit and why did the tramp take noth becaus thei were paper that he could not negoti lestrad shook hi head though it seem to me that hi manner wa less absolut assur than befor well mr sherlock holm you mai look for your tramp and while you ar find him we will hold on to our man the futur will show which is right just notic thi point mr holm that so far as we know none of the paper were remov and that the prison is the on man in the world who had no reason for remov them sinc he wa heiratlaw and would come into them in ani case my friend seem struck by thi remark i don t mean to deni that the evid is in some wai veri strongli in favour of your theori said he i onli wish to point out that there ar other theori possibl as you sai the futur will decid goodmorn i dare sai that in the cours of the dai i shall drop in at norwood and see how you ar get on when the detect depart my friend rose and made hi prepar for the dai s work with the alert air of a man who ha a congeni task befor him my first movement watson said he as he bustl into hi frockcoat must as i said be in the direct of blackheath and why not norwood becaus we have in thi case on singular incid come close to the heel of anoth singular incid the polic ar make the mistak of concentr their attent upon the second becaus it happen to be the on which is actual crimin but it is evid to me that the logic wai to approach the case is to begin by try to throw some light upon the first incidentth curiou will so suddenli made and to so unexpect an heir it mai do someth to simplifi what follow no my dear fellow i don t think you can help me there is no prospect of danger or i should not dream of stir out without you i trust that when i see you in the even i will be abl to report that i have been abl to do someth for thi unfortun youngster who ha thrown himself upon my protect it wa late when my friend return and i could see by a glanc at hi haggard and anxiou face that the high hope with which he had start had not been fulfil for an hour he drone awai upon hi violin endeavour to sooth hi own ruffl spirit at last he flung down the instrument and plung into a detail account of hi misadventur it s all go wrong watsonal as wrong as it can go i kept a bold face befor lestrad but upon my soul i believ that for onc the fellow is on the right track and we ar on the wrong all my instinct ar on wai and all the fact ar the other and i much fear that british juri have not yet attain that pitch of intellig when thei will give the prefer to my theori over lestrad s fact did you go to blackheath ye watson i went there and i found veri quickli that the late lament oldacr wa a pretti consider blackguard the father wa awai in search of hi son the mother wa at homea littl fluffi blueei person in a tremor of fear and indign of cours she would not admit even the possibl of hi guilt but she would not express either surpris or regret over the fate of oldacr on the contrari she spoke of him with such bitter that she wa unconsci consider strengthen the case of the polic for of cours if her son had heard her speak of the man in thi fashion it would predispos him toward hatr and violenc he wa more like a malign and cun ap than a human be said she and he alwai wa ever sinc he wa a young man you knew him at that time said i ye i knew him well in fact he wa an old suitor of mine thank heaven that i had the sens to turn awai from him and to marri a better if poorer man i wa engag to him mr holm when i heard a shock stori of how he had turn a cat loos in an aviari and i wa so horrifi at hi brutal cruelti that i would have noth more to do with him she rummag in a bureau and present she produc a photograph of a woman shamefulli defac and mutil with a knife that is my own photograph she said he sent it to me in that state with hi curs upon my wed morn well said i at least he ha forgiven you now sinc he ha left all hi properti to your son neither my son nor i want anyth from jona oldacr dead or aliv she cri with a proper spirit there is a god in heaven mr holm and that same god who ha punish that wick man will show in hi own good time that my son s hand ar guiltless of hi blood well i tri on or two lead but could get at noth which would help our hypothesi and sever point which would make against it i gave it up at last and off i went to norwood thi place deep dene hous is a big modern villa of stare brick stand back in it own ground with a laurelclump lawn in front of it to the right and some distanc back from the road wa the timberyard which had been the scene of the fire here s a rough plan on a leaf of my notebook thi window on the left is the on which open into oldacr s room you can look into it from the road you see that is about the onli bit of consol i have had todai lestrad wa not there but hi head constabl did the honour thei had just found a great treasuretrov thei had spent the morn rake among the ash of the burn woodpil and besid the char organ remain thei had secur sever discolour metal disc i examin them with care and there wa no doubt that thei were trouser button i even distinguish that on of them wa mark with the name of hyam who wa oldacr tailor i then work the lawn veri carefulli for sign and trace but thi drought ha made everyth as hard as iron noth wa to be seen save that some bodi or bundl had been drag through a low privet hedg which is in a line with the woodpil all that of cours fit in with the offici theori i crawl about the lawn with an august sun on my back but i got up at the end of an hour no wiser than befor well after thi fiasco i went into the bedroom and examin that also the bloodstain were veri slight mere smear and discolour but undoubtedli fresh the stick had been remov but there also the mark were slight there is no doubt about the stick belong to our client he admit it footmark of both men could be made out on the carpet but none of ani third person which again is a trick for the other side thei were pile up their score all the time and we were at a standstil onli on littl gleam of hope did i getand yet it amount to noth i examin the content of the safe most of which had been taken out and left on the tabl the paper had been made up into seal envelop on or two of which had been open by the polic thei were not so far as i could judg of ani great valu nor did the bankbook show that mr oldacr wa in such veri affluent circumst but it seem to me that all the paper were not there there were allus to some deedsposs the more valuablewhich i could not find thi of cours if we could definit prove it would turn lestrad s argument against himself for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would shortli inherit it final have drawn everi other cover and pick up no scent i tri my luck with the housekeep mr lexington is her namea littl dark silent person with suspici and sidelong ey she could tell us someth if she wouldi am convinc of it but she wa as close as wax ye she had let mr mcfarlan in at halfpast nine she wish her hand had wither befor she had done so she had gone to bed at halfpast ten her room wa at the other end of the hous and she could hear noth of what had pass mr mcfarlan had left hi hat and to the best of her belief hi stick in the hall she had been awaken by the alarm of fire her poor dear master had certainli been murder had he ani enemi well everi man had enemi but mr oldacr kept himself veri much to himself and onli met peopl in the wai of busi she had seen the button and wa sure that thei belong to the cloth which he had worn last night the woodpil wa veri dry for it had not rain for a month it burn like tinder and by the time she reach the spot noth could be seen but flame she and all the firemen smell the burn flesh from insid it she knew noth of the paper nor of mr oldacr s privat affair so my dear watson there s my report of a failur and yetand yet he clench hi thin hand in a paroxysm of convict i know it s all wrong i feel it in my bone there is someth that ha not come out and that housekeep know it there wa a sort of sulki defianc in her ey which onli goe with guilti knowledg howev there s no good talk ani more about it watson but unless some lucki chanc come our wai i fear that the norwood disappear case will not figur in that chronicl of our success which i forese that a patient public will sooner or later have to endur sure said i the man s appear would go far with ani juri that is a danger argument my dear watson you rememb that terribl murder bert steven who want us to get him off in wa there ever a more mildmann sundayschool young man it is true unless we succe in establish an altern theori thi man is lost you can hardli find a flaw in the case which can now be present against him and all further investig ha serv to strengthen it by the wai there is on curiou littl point about those paper which mai serv us as the startingpoint for an inquiri on look over the bankbook i found that the low state of the balanc wa princip due to larg check which have been made out dure the last year to mr corneliu i confess that i should be interest to know who thi mr corneliu mai be with whom a retir builder ha such veri larg transact is it possibl that he ha had a hand in the affair corneliu might be a broker but we have found no scrip to correspond with these larg payment fail ani other indic my research must now take the direct of an inquiri at the bank for the gentleman who ha cash these check but i fear my dear fellow that our case will end inglori by lestrad hang our client which will certainli be a triumph for scotland yard i do not know how far sherlock holm took ani sleep that night but when i came down to breakfast i found him pale and harass hi bright ey the brighter for the dark shadow round them the carpet round hi chair wa litter with cigaretteend and with the earli edit of the morn paper an open telegram lai upon the tabl what do you think of thi watson he ask toss it across it wa from norwood and ran as follow import fresh evid to hand mcfarlan s guilt definit establish advis you to abandon case lestrad thi sound seriou said i it is lestrad s littl cockadoodl of

nerv forc for digest he would sai in answer to my medic remonstr i wa not surpris therefor when thi morn he left hi untouch meal behind him and start with me for norwood a crowd of morbid sightseer were still gather round deep dene hous which wa just such a suburban villa as i had pictur within the gate lestrad met us hi face flush with victori hi manner grossli triumphant well mr holm have you prove us to be wrong yet have you found your tramp he cri i have form no conclus whatev my companion answer but we form our yesterdai and now it prove to be correct so you must acknowledg that we have been a littl in front of you thi time mr holm you certainli have the air of someth unusu have occur said holm lestrad laugh loudli you don t like be beaten ani more than the rest of us do said he a man can t expect alwai to have it hi own wai can he dr watson step thi wai if you pleas gentlemen and i think i can convinc you onc for all that it wa john mcfarlan who did thi crime he led us through the passag and out into a dark hall beyond thi is where young mcfarlan must have come out to get hi hat after the crime wa done said he now look at thi with dramat sudden he struck a match and by it light expos a stain of blood upon the whitewash wall as he held the match nearer i saw that it wa more than a stain it wa the wellmark print of a thumb look at that with your magnifi glass mr holm ye i am do so you ar awar that no two thumbmark ar alik i have heard someth of the kind well then will you pleas compar that print with thi wax impress of young mcfarlan s right thumb taken by my order thi morn as he held the waxen print close to the bloodstain it did not take a magnifi glass to see that the two were undoubtedli from the same thumb it wa evid to me that our unfortun client wa lost that is final said lestrad ye that is final i involuntarili echo it is final said holm someth in hi tone caught my ear and i turn to look at him an extraordinari chang had come over hi face it wa writh with inward merriment hi two ey were shine like star it seem to me that he wa make desper effort to restrain a convuls attack of laughter dear me dear me he said at last well now who would have thought it and how decept appear mai be to be sure such a nice young man to look at it is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment is it not lestrad ye some of us ar a littl too much inclin to be cocksur mr holm said lestrad the man s insol wa madden but we could not resent it what a providenti thing that thi young man should press hi right thumb against the wall in take hi hat from the peg such a veri natur action too if you come to think of it holm wa outwardli calm but hi whole bodi gave a wriggl of suppress excit as he spoke by the wai lestrad who made thi remark discoveri it wa the housekeep mr lexington who drew the night constabl s attent to it where wa the night constabl he remain on guard in the bedroom where the crime wa commit so as to see that noth wa touch but why didn t the polic see thi mark yesterdai well we had no particular reason to make a care examin of the hall besid it s not in a veri promin place as you see no noof cours not i suppos there is no doubt that the mark wa there yesterdai lestrad look at holm as if he thought he wa go out of hi mind i confess that i wa myself surpris both at hi hilari manner and at hi rather wild observ i don t know whether you think that mcfarlan came out of jail in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evid against himself said lestrad i leav it to ani expert in the world whether that is not the mark of hi thumb it is unquestion the mark of hi thumb there that s enough said lestrad i am a practic man mr holm and when i have got my evid i come to my conclus if you have anyth to sai you will find me write my report in the sittingroom holm had recov hi equanim though i still seem to detect gleam of amus in hi express dear me thi is a veri sad develop watson is it not said he and yet there ar singular point about it which hold out some hope for our client i am delight to hear it said i heartili i wa afraid it wa all up with him i would hardli go so far as to sai that my dear watson the fact is that there is on realli seriou flaw in thi evid to which our friend attach so much import inde holm what is it onli thi that i know that that mark wa not there when i examin the hall yesterdai and now watson let us have a littl stroll round in the sunshin with a confus brain but with a heart into which some warmth of hope wa return i accompani my friend in a walk round the garden holm took each face of the hous in turn and examin it with great interest he then led the wai insid and went over the whole build from basement to attic most of the room were unfurnish but none the less holm inspect them all minut final on the top corridor which ran outsid three unten bedroom he again wa seiz with a spasm of merriment there ar realli some veri uniqu featur about thi case watson said he i think it

you chaf me a littl some hour ago when the sun seem on your side of the hedg so you must not grudg me a littl pomp and ceremoni now might i ask you watson to open that window and then to put a match to the edg of the straw i did so and driven by the draught a coil of grai smoke swirl down the corridor while the dry straw crackl and flame now we must see if we can find thi wit for you lestrad might i ask you all to join in the cry of fire now then on two three fire we all yell thank you i will troubl you onc again fire just onc more gentlemen and all togeth fire the shout must have rung over norwood it had hardli di awai when an amaz thing happen a door suddenli flew open out of what appear to be solid wall at the end of the corridor and a littl wizen man dart out of it like a rabbit out of it burrow capit said holm calmli watson a bucket of water over the straw that will do lestrad allow me to present you with your princip miss wit mr jona oldacr the detect stare at the newcom with blank amaz the latter wa blink in the bright light of the corridor and peer at us and at the smoulder fire it wa an odiou facecrafti viciou malign with shifti lightgrai ey and white lash what s thi then said lestrad at last what have you been do all thi time eh oldacr gave an uneasi laugh shrink back from the furiou red face of the angri detect i have done no harm no harm you have done your best to get an innoc man hang if it wasn t for thi gentleman here i am not sure that you would not have succeed the wretch creatur began to whimper i am sure sir it wa onli my practic joke oh a joke wa it you won t find the laugh on your side i promis you take him down and keep him in the sittingroom until i come mr holm he continu when thei had gone i could not speak befor the constabl but i don t mind sai in the presenc of dr watson that thi is the brightest thing that you have done yet though it is a mysteri to me how you did it you have save an innoc man s life and you have prevent a veri grave scandal which would have ruin my reput in the forc holm smile and clap lestrad upon the shoulder instead of be ruin my good sir you will find that your reput ha been enorm enhanc just make a few alter in that report which you were write and thei will understand how hard it is to throw dust in the ey of inspector lestrad and you don t want your name to appear not at all the work is it own reward perhap i shall get the credit also at some distant dai when i permit my zealou historian to lai out hi foolscap onc moreeh watson well now let us see where thi rat ha been lurk a lathandplast partit had been run across the passag six feet from the end with a door cunningli conceal in it it wa lit within by slit under the eav a few articl of furnitur and a suppli of food and water were within togeth with a number of book and paper there s the advantag of be a builder said holm as we came out he wa abl to fix up hi own littl hidingplac without ani confederatesav of cours that preciou housekeep of hi whom i should lose no time in ad to your bag lestrad i ll take your advic but how did you know of thi place mr holm i made up my mind that the fellow wa in hide in the hous when i pace on corridor and found it six feet shorter than the correspond on below it wa pretti clear where he wa i thought he had not the nerv to lie quiet befor an alarm of fire we could of cours have gone in and taken him but it amus me to make him reveal himself besid i ow you a littl mystif lestrad for your chaff in the morn well sir you certainli got equal with me on that but how in the world did you know that he wa in the hous at all the thumbmark lestrad you said it wa final and so it wa in a veri differ sens i knew it had not been there the dai befor i pai a good deal of attent to matter of detail as you mai have observ and i had examin the hall and wa sure that the wall wa clear therefor it had been put on dure the night but how veri simpli when those packet were seal up jona oldacr got mcfarlan to secur on of the seal by put hi thumb upon the soft wax it would be done so quickli and so natur that i daresai the young man himself ha no recollect of it veri like it just so happen and oldacr had himself no notion of the us he would put it to brood over the case in that den of hi it suddenli struck him what absolut damn evid he could make against mcfarlan by us that thumbmark it wa the simplest thing in the world for him to take a wax impress from the seal to moisten it in as much blood as he could get from a pinprick and to put the mark upon the wall dure the night either with hi own hand or with that of hi housekeep if you examin among those document which he took with him into hi retreat i will lai you a wager that you find the seal with the thumbmark upon it wonder said lestrad wonder it s all as clear as crystal as you put it but what is the object of thi deep decept mr holm it wa amus to me to see how the detect s overbear manner had chang suddenli to that of a child ask question of it teacher well i don t think that is veri hard to explain a veri deep malici vindict person is the gentleman who is now wait us downstair you know that he wa onc refus by mcfarlan s mother you don t i told you that you should go to blackheath first and norwood afterward well thi injuri as he would consid it ha rankl in hi wick scheme brain and all hi life he ha long for vengeanc but never seen hi chanc dure the last year or two thing have gone against himsecret specul i thinkand he find himself in a bad wai he determin to swindl hi creditor and for thi purpos he pai larg check to a certain mr corneliu who is i imagin himself under anoth name i have not trace these check yet but i have no doubt that thei were bank under that name at some provinci town where oldacr from time to time led a doubl exist he intend to chang hi name altogeth draw thi monei and vanish start life again elsewher well that s like enough it would strike him that in disappear he might throw all pursuit off hi track and at the same time have an ampl and crush reveng upon hi old sweetheart if he could give the impress that he had been murder by her onli child it wa a masterpiec of villaini and he carri it out like a master the idea of the will which would give an obviou motiv for the crime the secret visit unknown to hi own parent the retent of the stick the blood and the anim remain and button in the woodpil all were admir it wa a net from which it seem to me a few hour ago that there wa no possibl escap but he had not that suprem gift of the artist the knowledg of when to stop he wish to improv that which wa alreadi perfectto draw the rope tighter yet round the neck of hi unfortun victimand so he ruin all let us descend lestrad there ar just on or two question that i would ask him the malign creatur wa seat in hi own parlour with a policeman upon each side of him it wa a joke my good sira practic joke noth more he whine incessantli i assur you sir that i simpli conceal myself in order to see the effect of my disappear and i am sure that you would not be so unjust as to imagin that i would have allow ani harm to befal poor young mr mcfarlan that s for a juri to decid said lestrad anyhow we shall have you on a charg of conspiraci if not for attempt murder and you ll probabl find that your creditor will impound the bank account of mr corneliu said holm the littl man start and turn hi malign ey upon my friend i have to thank you for a good deal said he perhap i ll pai my debt some dai holm smile indulg i fanci that for some few year you will find your time veri fulli occupi said he by the wai what wa it you put into the woodpil besid your old trouser a dead dog or rabbit or what you won t tell dear me how veri unkind of you well well i daresai that a coupl of rabbit would account both for the blood and for the char ash if ever you write an account watson you can make rabbit serv your turn the adventur of the danc men holm had been seat for some hour in silenc with hi long thin back curv over a chemic vessel in which he wa brew a particularli malodor product hi head wa sunk upon hi breast and he look from my point of view like a strang lank bird with dull grai plumag and a black topknot so watson said he suddenli you do not propos to invest in south african secur i gave a start of astonish accustom as i wa to holm s curiou faculti thi sudden intrus into my most intim thought wa utterli inexplic how on earth do you know that i ask he wheel round upon hi stool with a steam testtub in hi hand and a gleam of amus in hi deepset ey now watson confess yourself utterli taken aback said he i am i ought to make you sign a paper to that effect why becaus in five minut you will sai that it is all so absurdli simpl i am sure that i shall sai noth of the kind you see my dear watson he prop hi testtub in the rack and began to lectur with the air of a professor address hi class it is not realli difficult to construct a seri of infer each depend upon it predecessor and each simpl in itself if after do so on simpli knock out all the central infer and present on s audienc with the startingpoint and the conclus on mai produc a startl though possibl a meretrici effect now it wa not realli difficult by an inspect of the groov between your left forefing and thumb to feel sure that you did not propos to invest your small capit in the gold field i see no connect veri like not but i can quickli show you a close connect here ar the miss link of the veri simpl chain you had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you return from the club last night you put chalk there when you plai billiard to steadi the cue you never plai billiard except with thurston you told me four week ago that thurston had an option on some south african properti which would expir in a month and which he desir you to share with him your check book is lock in my drawer and you have not ask for the kei you do not propos to invest your monei in thi manner how absurdli simpl i cri quit so said he a littl nettl everi problem becom veri childish when onc it is explain to you here is an unexplain on see what you can make of that friend watson he toss a sheet of paper upon the tabl and turn onc more to hi chemic analysi i look with amaz at the absurd hieroglyph upon the paper why holm it is a child s draw i cri oh that s your idea what els should it be that is what mr hilton cubitt of ride thorp manor norfolk is veri anxiou to know thi littl conundrum came by the first post and he wa to follow by the next train there s a ring at the bell watson i should not be veri much surpris if thi were he a heavi step wa heard upon the stair and an instant later there enter a tall ruddi cleanshaven gentleman whose clear ey and florid cheek told of a life led far from the fog of baker street he seem to bring a whiff of hi strong fresh brace eastcoast air with him as he enter have shaken hand with each of us he wa about to sit down when hi ey rest upon the paper with the curiou mark which i had just examin and left upon the tabl well mr holm what do you make of these he cri thei told me that you were fond of queer mysteri and i don t think you can find a queerer on than that i sent the paper on ahead so that you might have time to studi it befor i came it is certainli rather a curiou product said holm at first sight it would appear to be some childish prank it consist of a number of absurd littl figur danc across the paper upon which thei ar drawn why should you attribut ani import to so grotesqu an object i never should mr holm but my wife doe it is frighten her to death she sai noth but i can see terror in her ey that s why i want to sift the matter to the bottom holm held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it it wa a page torn from a notebook the mark were done in pencil and ran in thi wai graphic holm examin it for some time and then fold it carefulli up he place it in hi pocketbook thi promis to be a most interest and unusu case said he you gave me a few particular in your letter mr hilton cubitt but i should be veri much oblig if you would kindli go over it all again for the benefit of my friend dr watson i m not much of a storytel said our visitor nervous clasp and unclasp hi great strong hand you ll just ask me anyth that i don t make clear i ll begin at the time of my marriag last year but i want to sai first of all that though i m not a rich man my peopl have been at ride thorp for a matter of five centuri and there is no better known famili in the counti of norfolk last year i came up to london for the jubile and i stop at a boardinghous in russel squar becaus parker the vicar of our parish wa stai in it there wa an american young ladi therepatrick wa the nameelsi patrick in some wai we becam friend until befor my month wa up i wa as much in love as man could be we were quietli marri at a registri offic and we return to norfolk a wed coupl you ll think it veri mad mr holm that a man of a good old famili should marri a wife in thi fashion know noth of her past or of her peopl but if you saw her and knew her it would help you to understand she wa veri straight about it wa elsi i can t sai that she did not give me everi chanc of get out of it if i wish to do so i have had some veri disagre associ in my life said she i wish to forget all about them i would rather never allud to the past for it is veri pain to me if you take me hilton you will take a woman who ha noth that she need be person asham of but you will have to be content with my word for it and to allow me to be silent as to all that pass up to the time when i becam your if these condit ar too hard then go back to norfolk and leav me to the lone life in which you found me it wa onli the dai befor our wed that she said those veri word to me i told her that i wa content to take her on her own term and i have been as good as my word well we have been marri now for a year and veri happi we have been but about a month ago at the end of june i saw for the first time sign of troubl on dai my wife receiv a letter from america i saw the american stamp she turn deadli white read the letter and threw it into the fire she made no allus to it afterward and i made none for a promis is a promis but she ha never known an easi hour from that moment there is alwai a look of fear upon her facea look as if she were wait and expect she would do better to trust me she would find that i wa her best friend but until she speak i can sai noth mind you she is a truth woman mr holm and whatev troubl there mai have been in her past life it ha been no fault of her i am onli a simpl norfolk squir but there is not a man in england who rank hi famili honour more highli than i do she know it well and she knew it well befor she marri me she would never bring ani stain upon itof that i am sure well now i come to the queer part of my stori about a week agoit wa the tuesdai of last weeki found on on of the windowsil a number of absurd littl danc figur like these upon the paper thei were scrawl with chalk i thought that it wa the stableboi who had drawn them but the lad swore he knew noth about it anyhow thei had come there dure the night i had them wash out and i onli mention the matter to my wife afterward to my surpris she took it veri serious and beg me if ani more came to let her see them none did come for a week and then yesterdai morn i found thi paper ly on the sundial in the garden i show it to elsi and down she drop in a dead faint sinc then she ha look like a woman in a dream half daze and with terror alwai lurk in her ey it wa then that i wrote and sent the paper to you mr holm it wa not a thing that i could take to the polic for thei would have laugh at me but you will tell me what to do i am not a rich man but if there is ani danger threaten my littl woman i would spend my last copper to shield her he wa a fine creatur thi man of the old english soilsimpl straight and gentl with hi great earnest blue ey and broad come face hi love for hi wife and hi trust in her shone in hi featur holm had listen to hi stori with the utmost attent and now he sat for some time in silent thought don t you think mr cubitt said he at last that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife and to ask her to share her secret with you hilton cubitt shook hi massiv head a promis is a promis mr holm if elsi wish to tell me she would if not it is not for me to forc her confid but i am justifi in take my own lineand i will then i will help you with all my heart in the first place have you heard of ani stranger be seen in your neighbourhood no i presum that it is a veri quiet place ani fresh face would caus comment in the immedi neighbourhood ye but we have sever small wateringplac not veri far awai and the farmer take in lodger these hieroglyph have evid a mean if it is a pure arbitrari on it mai be imposs for us to solv it if on the other hand it is systemat i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it but thi particular sampl is so short that i can do noth and the fact which you have brought me ar so indefinit that we have no basi for an investig i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen lookout and that you take an exact copi of ani fresh danc men which mai appear it is a thousand piti that we have not a reproduct of those which were done in chalk upon the windowsil make a discreet inquiri also as to ani stranger in the neighbourhood when you have collect some fresh evid come to me again that is the best advic which i can give you mr hilton cubitt if there ar ani press fresh develop i shall be alwai readi to run down and see you in your norfolk home the interview left sherlock holm veri thought and sever time in the next few dai i saw him take hi slip of paper from hi notebook and look long and earnestli at the curiou figur inscrib upon it he made no allus to the affair howev until on afternoon a fortnight or so later i wa go out when he call me back you had better stai here watson why becaus i had a wire from hilton cubitt thi morn you rememb hilton cubitt of the danc men he wa to reach liverpool street at onetwenti he mai be here at ani moment i gather from hi wire that there have been some new incid of import we had not long to wait for our norfolk squir came straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him he wa look worri and depress with tire ey and a line forehead it s get on my nerv thi busi mr holm said he as he sank like a weari man into an armchair it s bad enough to feel that you ar surround by unseen unknown folk who have some kind of design upon you but when in addit to that you know that it is just kill your wife by inch then it becom as much as flesh and blood can endur she s wear awai under itjust wear awai befor my ey ha she said anyth yet no mr holm she ha not and yet there have been time when the poor girl ha want to speak and yet could not quit bring herself to take the plung i have tri to help her but i daresai i did it clumsili and scare her from it she ha spoken about my old famili and our reput in the counti and our pride in our unsulli honour and i alwai felt it wa lead to the point but somehow it turn off befor we got there but you have found out someth for yourself a good deal mr holm i have sever fresh dancingmen pictur for you to examin and what is more import i have seen the fellow what the man who draw them ye i saw him at hi work but i will tell you everyth in order when i got back after my visit to you the veri first thing i saw next morn wa a fresh crop of danc men thei had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the toolhous which stand besid the lawn in full view of the front window i took an exact copi and here it is he unfold a paper and laid it upon the tabl here is a copi of the hieroglyph graphic excel said holm excel prai continu when i had

and letter so complet absorb in hi task that he had evid forgotten my presenc sometim he wa make progress and whistl and sang at hi work sometim he wa puzzl and would sit for long spell with a furrow brow and a vacant ey final he sprang from hi chair with a cry of satisfact and walk up and down the room rub hi hand togeth then he wrote a long telegram upon a cabl form if my answer to thi is as i hope you will have a veri pretti case to add to your collect watson said he i expect that we shall be abl to go down to norfolk tomorrow and to take our friend some veri definit new as to the secret

there wa a delai in that answer telegram and two dai of impati follow dure which holm prick up hi ear at everi ring of the bell on the even of the second there came a letter from hilton cubitt all wa quiet with him save that a long inscript had appear that morn upon the pedest of the sundial he inclos a copi of it which is here reproduc graphic holm bent over thi grotesqu friez for some minut and then suddenli sprang to hi feet with an exclam of surpris and dismai hi face wa haggard with anxieti we have let thi affair go far enough said he is there a train to north walsham tonight i turn up the timet the last had just gone then we shall breakfast earli and take the veri first in the morn said holm our presenc is most urgent need ah here is our expect cablegram on moment mr hudson there mai be an answer no that is quit as i expect thi messag make it even more essenti that we should not lose an hour in let hilton cubitt know how matter stand for it is a singular and a danger web in which our simpl norfolk squir is entangl so inde it prove and as i come to the dark conclus of a stori which had seem to me to be onli childish and bizarr i experi onc again the dismai and horror with which i wa fill would that i had some brighter end to commun to my reader but these ar the chronicl of fact and i must follow to their dark crisi the strang chain of event which for some dai made ride thorp manor a household word through the length and breadth of england we had hardli alight at north walsham and mention the name of our destin when the stationmast hurri toward us i suppos that you ar the detect from london said he a look of annoy pass over holm s face what make you think such a thing becaus inspector martin from norwich ha just pass through but mayb you ar the surgeon she s not deador wasn t by last account you mai be in time to save her yetthough it be for the gallow holm s brow wa dark with anxieti we ar go to ride thorp manor said he but we have heard noth of what ha pass there it s a terribl busi said the stationmast thei ar shot both mr hilton cubitt and hi wife she shot him and then herselfso the servant sai he s dead and her life is despair of dear dear on of the oldest famili in the counti of norfolk and on of the most honour without a word holm hurri to a carriag and dure the long seven mile drive he never open hi mouth seldom have i seen him so utterli despond he had been uneasi dure all our journei from town and i had observ that he had turn over the morn paper with anxiou attent but now thi sudden realiz of hi worst fear left him in a blank melancholi he lean back in hi seat lost in gloomi specul yet there wa much around to interest us for we were pass through as singular a countrysid as ani in england where a few scatter cottag repres the popul of todai while on everi hand enorm squaretow church bristl up from the flat green landscap and told of the glori and prosper of old east anglia at last the violet rim of the german ocean appear over the green edg of the norfolk coast and the driver point with hi whip to two old brick and timber gabl which project from a grove of tree that s ride thorp manor said he as we drove up to the portico front door i observ in front of it besid the tenni lawn the black toolhous and the pedestal sundial with which we had such strang associ a dapper littl man with a quick alert manner and a wax moustach had just descend from a high dogcart he introduc himself as inspector martin of the norfolk constabulari and he wa consider astonish when he heard the name of my companion why mr holm the crime wa onli commit at three thi morn how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot as soon as i i anticip it i came in the hope of prevent it then you must have import evid of which we ar ignor for thei were said to be a most unit coupl i have onli the evid of the danc men said holm i will explain the matter to you later meanwhil sinc it is too late to prevent thi tragedi i am veri anxiou that i should us the knowledg which i possess in order to insur that justic be done will you associ me in your investig or will you prefer that i should act independ i should be proud to feel that we were act togeth mr holm said the inspector earnestli in that case i should be glad to hear the evid and to examin the premis without an instant of unnecessari delai inspector martin had the good sens to allow my friend to do thing in hi own fashion and content himself with carefulli note the result the local surgeon an old whitehair man had just come down from mr hilton cubitt s room and he report that her injuri were seriou but not necessarili fatal the bullet had pass through the front of her brain and it would probabl be some time befor she could regain conscious on the question of whether she had been shot or had shot herself he would not ventur to express ani decid opinion certainli the bullet had been discharg at veri close quarter there wa onli the on pistol found in the room two barrel of which had been empti mr hilton cubitt had been shot through the heart it wa equal conceiv that he had shot her and then himself or that she had been the crimin for the revolv lai upon the floor midwai between them ha he been move ask holm we have move noth except the ladi we could not leav her ly wound upon the floor how long have you been here doctor sinc four o clock anyon els ye the constabl here and you have touch noth noth you have act with great discret who sent for you the housemaid saunder wa it she who gave the alarm she and mr king the cook where ar thei now in the kitchen i believ then i think we had better hear their stori at onc the old hall oakpanel and highwindow had been turn into a court of investig holm sat in a great oldfashion chair hi inexor ey gleam out of hi haggard face i could read in them a set purpos to devot hi life to thi quest until the client whom he had fail to save should at last be aveng the trim inspector martin the old grayhead countri doctor myself and a stolid villag policeman made up the rest of that strang compani the two women told their stori clearli enough thei had been arous from their sleep by the sound of an explos which had been follow a minut later by a second on thei slept in adjoin room and mr king had rush in to saunder togeth thei had descend the stair the door of the studi wa open and a candl wa burn upon the tabl their master lai upon hi face in the centr of the room he wa quit dead near the window hi wife wa crouch her head lean against the wall she wa horribl wound and the side of her face wa red with blood she breath heavili but wa incap of sai anyth the passag as well as the room wa full of smoke and the smell of powder the window wa certainli shut and fasten upon the insid both women were posit upon the point thei had at onc sent for the doctor and for the constabl then with the aid of the groom and the stableboi thei had convei their injur mistress to her room both she and her husband had occupi the bed she wa clad in her dressh in hi dressinggown over hi nightcloth noth had been move in the studi so far as thei knew there had never been ani quarrel between husband and wife thei had alwai look upon them as a veri unit coupl these were the main point of the servant evid in answer to inspector martin thei were clear that everi door wa fasten upon the insid and that no on could have escap from the hous in answer to holm thei both rememb that thei were consciou of the smell of powder from the moment that thei ran out of their room upon the top floor i commend that fact veri carefulli to your attent said holm to hi profession colleagu and now i think that we ar in a posit to undertak a thorough examin of the room the studi prove to be a small chamber line on three side with book and with a writingt face an ordinari window which look out upon the garden our first attent wa given to the bodi of the unfortun squir whose huge frame lai stretch across the room hi disord dress show that he had been hastili arous from sleep the bullet had been fire at him from the front and had remain in hi bodi after penetr the heart hi death had certainli been instantan and painless there wa no powdermark either upon hi dressinggown or on hi hand accord to the countri surgeon the ladi had stain upon her face but none upon her hand the absenc of the latter mean noth though it presenc mai mean everyth said holm unless the powder from a badli fit cartridg happen to spurt backward on mai fire mani shot without leav a sign i would suggest that mr cubitt s bodi mai now be remov i suppos doctor you have not recov the bullet which wound the ladi a seriou oper will be necessari befor that can be done but there ar still four cartridg in the revolv two have been fire and two wound inflict so that each bullet can be account for so it would seem said holm perhap you can account also for the bullet which ha so obvious struck the edg of the window he had turn suddenli and hi long thin finger wa point to a hole which had been drill right through the lower windowsash about an inch abov the bottom by georg cri the inspector how ever did you see that becaus i look for it wonder said the countri doctor you ar certainli right sir then a third shot ha been fire and therefor a third person must have been present but who could that have been and how could he have got awai that is the problem which we ar now about to solv said sherlock holm you rememb inspector martin when the servant said that on leav their room thei were at onc consciou of a smell of powder i remark that the point wa an extrem import on ye sir but i confess i did not quit follow you it suggest that at the time of the fire the window as well as the door of the room had been open otherwis the fume of powder could not have been blown so rapidli through the hous a draught in the room wa necessari for that both door and window were onli open for a veri short time howev how do you prove that becaus the candl wa not gutter capit cri the inspector capit feel sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedi i conceiv that there might have been a third person in the affair who stood outsid thi open and fire through it ani shot direct at thi person might hit the sash i look and there sure enough wa the bullet mark but how came the window to be shut and fasten the woman s first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window but halloa what is thi it wa a ladi s handbag which stood upon the studi tablea trim littl handbag of crocodileskin and silver holm open it and turn the content out there were twenti fiftypound note of the bank of england held togeth by an indiarubb bandnoth els thi must be preserv for it will figur in the trial said holm as he hand the bag with it content to the inspector it is now necessari that we should try to throw some light upon thi third bullet which ha clearli from the splinter of the wood been fire from insid the room i should like to see mr king the cook again you said mr king that you were awaken by a loud explos when you said that did you mean that it seem to you to be louder than the second on well sir it waken me from my sleep so it is hard to judg but it did seem veri loud you don t think that it might have been two shot fire almost at the same instant i am sure i couldn t sai sir i believ that it wa undoubtedli so i rather think inspector martin that we have now exhaust all that thi room can teach us if you will kindli step round with me we shall see what fresh evid the garden ha to offer a flowerb extend up to the studi window and we all broke into an exclam as we approach it the flower were trampl down and the soft soil wa imprint all over with footmark larg masculin feet thei were with peculiarli long sharp toe holm hunt about among the grass and leav like a retriev after a wound bird then with a cry of satisfact he bent forward and pick up a littl brazen cylind i thought so said he the revolv had an ejector and here is the third cartridg i realli think inspector martin that our case is almost complet the countri inspector s face had shown hi intens amaz at the rapid and master progress of holm s investig at first he had shown some disposit to assert hi own posit but now he wa overcom with admir and readi to follow without question wherev holm led whom do you suspect he ask i ll go into that later there ar sever point in thi problem which i have not been abl to explain to you yet now that i have got so far i had best proce on my own line and then clear the whole matter up onc and for all just as you wish mr holm so long as we get our man i have no desir to make mysteri but it is imposs at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explan i have the thread of thi affair all in my hand even if thi ladi should never recov conscious we can still reconstruct the event of last night and insur that justic be done first of all i wish to know whether there is ani inn in thi neighbourhood known as elrig s the servant were crossquest but none of them had heard of such a place the stableboi threw a light upon the matter by rememb that a farmer of that name live some mile off in the direct of east ruston is it a lone farm veri lone sir perhap thei have not heard yet of all that happen here dure the night mayb not sir holm thought for a littl and then a curiou smile plai over hi face saddl a hors my lad said he i shall wish you to take a note to elrig s farm he took from hi pocket the variou slip of the danc men with these in front of him he work for some time at the studyt final he hand a note to the boi with direct to put it into the hand of the person to whom it wa address and especi to answer no question of ani sort which might be put to him i saw the outsid of the note address in straggl irregular charact veri unlik holm s usual precis hand it wa consign to mr ab slanei elrig farm east ruston norfolk i think inspector holm remark that you would do well to telegraph for an escort as if my calcul prove to be correct you mai have a particularli danger prison to convei to the counti jail the boi who take thi note could no doubt forward your telegram if there is an afternoon train to town watson i think we should do well to take it as i have a chemic analysi of some interest to finish and thi investig draw rapidli to a close when the youth had been dispatch with the note sherlock holm gave hi instruct to the servant if ani visitor were to call ask for mr hilton cubitt no inform should be given as to her condit but he wa to be shown at onc into the drawingroom he impress these point upon them with the utmost earnest final he led the wai into the drawingroom with the remark that the busi wa now out of our hand and that we must while awai the time as best we might until we could see what wa in store for us the doctor had depart to hi patient and onli the inspector and myself remain i think that i can help you to pass an hour in an interest and profit manner said holm draw hi chair up to the tabl and spread out in front of him the variou paper upon which were record the antic of the danc men as to you friend watson i ow you everi aton for have allow your natur curios to remain so long unsatisfi to you inspector the whole incid mai appeal as a remark profession studi i must tell you first of all the interest circumst connect with the previou consult which mr hilton cubitt ha had with me in baker street he then shortli recapitul the fact which have alreadi been record i have here in front of me these singular product at which on might smile had thei not prove themselv to be the forerunn of so terribl a tragedi i am fairli familiar with all form of secret write and am myself the author of a trifl monograph upon the subject in which i analyz on hundr and sixti separ cipher but i confess that thi is entir new to me the object of those who invent the system ha appar been to conceal that these charact convei a messag and to give the idea that thei ar the mere random sketch of children have onc recogn howev that the symbol stood for letter and have appli the rule which guid us in all form of secret write the solut wa easi enough the first messag submit to me wa so short that it wa imposs for me to do more than to sai with some confid that the symbol xxx stood for e as you ar awar e is the most common letter in the english alphabet and it predomin to so mark an extent that even in a short sentenc on would expect to find it most often out of fifteen symbol in the first messag four were the same so it wa reason to set thi down as e it is true that in some case the figur wa bear a flag and in some case not but it wa probabl from the wai in which the flag were distribut that thei were us to break the sentenc up into word i accept thi as a hypothesi and note that e wa repres by xxx but now came the real difficulti of the inquiri the order of the english letter after e is by no mean well mark and ani preponder which mai be shown in an averag of a print sheet mai be revers in a singl short sentenc speak roughli t a o i n s h r d and l ar the numer order in which letter occur but t a o and i ar veri nearli abreast of each other and it would be an endless task to try each combin until a mean wa arriv at i therefor wait for fresh materi in my second interview with mr hilton cubitt he wa abl to give me two other short sentenc and on messag which appearedsinc there wa no flagto be a singl word here ar the symbol now in the singl word i have alreadi got the two e s come second and fourth in a word of five letter it might be sever or lever or never there can be no question that the latter as a repli to an appeal is far the most probabl and the circumst point to it be a repli written by the ladi accept it as correct we ar now abl to sai that the symbol stand respect for n v and r even now i wa in consider difficulti but a happi thought put me in possess of sever other letter it occur to me that if these appeal came as i expect from someon who had been intim with the ladi in her earli life a combin which contain two e s with three letter between might veri well stand for the name elsi on examin i found that such a combin form the termin of the messag which wa three time repeat it wa certainli some appeal to elsi in thi wai i had got my l s and i but what appeal could it be there were onli four letter in the word which preced elsi and it end in e sure the word must be come i tri all other four letter end in e but could find none to fit the case so now i wa in possess of c o and m and i wa in a posit to attack the first messag onc more divid it into word and put dot for each symbol which wa still unknown so treat it work out in thi fashion m er e slne now the first letter can onli be a which is a most us discoveri sinc it occur no fewer than three time in thi short sentenc and the h is also appar in the second word now it becom am here ae slane or fill in the obviou vacanc in the name am here ab slanei i had so mani letter now that i could proce with consider confid to the second messag which work out in thi fashion a elri es here i could onli make sens by put t and g for the miss letter and suppos that the name wa that of some hous or inn at which the writer wa stai inspector martin and i had listen with the utmost interest to the full and clear account of how my friend had produc result which had led to so complet a command over our difficulti what did you do then sir ask the inspector i had everi reason to suppos that thi ab slanei wa an american sinc ab is an american contract and sinc a letter from america had been the startingpoint of all the troubl i had also everi caus to think that there wa some crimin secret in the matter the ladi s allus to her past and her refus to take her husband into her confid both point in that direct i therefor cabl to my friend wilson hargreav of the new york polic bureau who ha more than onc made us of my knowledg of london crime i ask him whether the name of ab slanei wa known to him here is hi repli the most danger crook in chicago on the veri even upon which i had hi answer hilton cubitt sent me the last messag from slanei work with known letter it took thi form elsi rear to meet thy go the addit of a p and a d complet a messag which show me that the rascal wa proceed from persuas to threat and my knowledg of the crook of chicago prepar me to find that he might veri rapidli put hi word into action i at onc came to norfolk with my friend and colleagu dr watson but unhappili onli in time to find that the worst had alreadi occur it is a privileg to be associ with you in the handl of a case said the inspector warmli you will excus me howev if i speak frankli to you you ar onli answer to yourself but i have to answer to my superior if thi ab slanei live at elrig s is inde the murder and if he ha made hi escap while i am seat here i should certainli get into seriou troubl you need not be uneasi he will not try to escap how do you know to fly would be a confess of guilt then let us go arrest him i expect him here everi instant but why should he come becaus i have written and ask him but thi is incred mr holm why should he come becaus you have ask him would not such a request rather rous hi suspicion and caus him to fly i think i have known how to frame the letter said sherlock holm in fact if i am not veri much mistaken here is the gentleman himself come up the drive a man wa stride up the path which led to the door he wa a tall handsom swarthi fellow clad in a suit of grai flannel with a panama hat a bristl black beard and a great aggress hook nose and flourish a cane as he walk he swagger up a path as if as if the place belong to him and we heard hi loud confid peal at the bell i think gentlemen said holm quietli that we had best take up our posit behind the door everi precaut is necessari when deal with such a fellow you will need your handcuff inspector you can leav the talk to me we wait in silenc for a minuteon of those minut which on can never forget then the door open and the man step in in an instant holm clap a pistol to hi head and martin slip the handcuff over hi wrist it wa all done so swiftli and deftli that the fellow wa helpless befor he knew that he wa attack he glare from on to the other of us with a pair of blaze black ey then he burst into a bitter laugh well gentlemen you have the drop on me thi time i seem to have knock up against someth hard but i came here in answer to a letter from mr hilton cubitt don t tell me that she is in thi don t tell me that she help to set a trap for me mr hilton cubitt wa serious injur and is at death s door the man gave a hoars cry of grief which rang through the hous you re crazi he cri fierc it wa he that wa hurt not she who would have hurt littl elsi i mai have threaten hergod forgiv mebut i would not have touch a hair of her pretti head take it backyou sai that she is not hurt she wa found badli wound by the side of her dead husband he sank with a deep groan on the sette and buri hi face in hi manacl hand for five minut he wa silent then he rais hi face onc more and spoke with the cold composur of despair i have noth to hide from you gentlemen said he if i shot the man he had hi shot at me and there s no murder in that but if you think i could have hurt that woman then you don t know either me or her i tell you there wa never a man in thi world love a woman more than i love her i had a right to her she wa pledg to me year ago who wa thi englishman that he should come between us i tell you that i had the first right to her and that i wa onli claim my own she broke awai from your influenc when she found the man that you ar said holm sternli she fled from america to avoid you and she marri an honour gentleman in england you dog her and follow her and made her life a miseri to her in order to induc her to abandon the husband whom she love and respect in order to fly with you whom she fear and hate you have end by bring about the death of a nobl man and drive hi wife to suicid that is your record in thi busi mr ab slanei and you will answer for it to the law if elsi di i care noth what becom of me said the american he open on of hi hand and look at a note crumpl up in hi palm see here mister he cri with a gleam of suspicion in hi ey you re not try to scare me over thi ar you if the ladi is hurt as bad as you sai who wa it that wrote thi note he toss it forward on to the tabl i wrote it to bring you here you wrote it there wa no on on earth outsid the joint who knew the secret of the danc men how came you to write it what on man can invent anoth can discov said holm there is a cab come to convei you to norwich mr slanei but meanwhil you have time to make some small repar for the injuri you have wrought ar you awar that mr hilton cubitt ha herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband and that it wa onli my presenc here and the knowledg which i happen to possess which ha save her from the accus the least that you ow her is to make it clear to the whole world that she wa in no wai directli or indirectli respons for hi tragic end i ask noth better said the american i guess the veri best case i can make for myself is the absolut nake truth it is my duti to warn you that it will be us against you cri the inspector with the magnific fair plai of the british crimin law slanei shrug hi shoulder i ll chanc that said he first of all i want you gentlemen to understand that i have known thi ladi sinc she wa a child there were seven of us in a gang in chicago and elsi s father wa the boss of the joint he wa a clever man wa old patrick it wa he who invent that write which would pass as a child s scrawl unless you just happen to have the kei to it well elsi learn some of our wai but she couldn t stand the busi and she had a bit of honest monei of her own so she gave us all the slip and got awai to london she had been engag to me and she would have marri me i believ if i had taken over anoth profess but she would have noth to do with anyth on the cross it wa onli after her marriag to thi englishman that i wa abl to find out where she wa i wrote to her but got no answer after that i came over and as letter were no us i put my messag where she could read them well i have been here a month now i live in that farm where i had a room down below and could get in and out everi night and no on the wiser i tri all i could to coax elsi awai i knew that she read the messag for onc she wrote an answer under on of them then my temper got the better of me and i began to threaten her she sent me a letter then implor me to go awai and sai that it would break her heart if ani scandal should come upon her husband she said that she would come down when her husband wa asleep at three in the morn and speak with me through the end window if i would go awai afterward and leav her in peac she came down and brought monei with her try to bribe me to go thi made me mad and i caught her arm and tri to pull her through the window at that moment in rush the husband with hi revolv in hi hand elsi had sunk down upon the floor and we were face to face i wa heel also and i held up my gun to scare him off and let me get awai he fire and miss me i pull off almost at the same instant and down he drop i made awai across the garden and as i went i heard the window shut behind me that s god s truth gentlemen everi word of it and i heard no more about it until that lad came ride up with a note which made me walk in here like a jai and give myself into your hand a cab had driven up whilst the american had been talk two uniform policemen sat insid

at last to the special thing which ha caus me to ask your advic todai you must know that everi saturdai forenoon i ride on my bicycl to farnham station in order to get the to town the road from chiltern grang is a lone on and at on spot it is particularli so for it li for over a mile between charlington heath upon on side and the wood which lie round charlington hall upon the other you could not find a more lone tract of road anywher and it is quit rare to meet so much as a cart or a peasant until you reach the high road near crooksburi hill two week ago i wa pass thi place when i chanc to look back over my shoulder and about two hundr yard behind me i saw a man also on a bicycl he seem to be a middleag man with a short dark beard i look back befor i reach farnham but the man wa gone so i thought no more about it but you can imagin how surpris i wa mr holm when on my return on the mondai i saw the same man on the same stretch of road my astonish wa increas when the incid occur again exactli as befor on the follow saturdai and mondai he alwai kept hi distanc and did not molest me in ani wai but still it certainli wa veri odd i mention it to mr carruth who seem interest in what i said and told me that he had order a hors and trap so that in futur i should not pass over these lone road without some companion the hors and trap were to have come thi week but for some reason thei were not deliv and again i had to cycl to the station that wa thi morn you can think that i look out when i came to charlington heath and there sure enough wa the man exactli as he had been the two week befor he alwai kept so far from me that i could not clearli see hi face but it wa certainli someon whom i did not know he wa dress in a dark suit with a cloth cap the onli thing about hi face that i could clearli see wa hi dark beard todai i wa not alarm but i wa fill with curios and i determin to find out who he wa and what he want i slow down my machin but he slow down hi then i stop altogeth but he stop also then i laid a trap for him there is a sharp turn of the road and i pedal veri quickli round thi and then i stop and wait i expect him to shoot round and pass me befor he could stop but he never appear then i went back and look round the corner i could see a mile of road but he wa not on it to make it the more extraordinari there wa no side road at thi point down which he could have gone holm chuckl and rub hi hand thi case certainli present some featur of it own said he how much time elaps between your turn the corner and your discoveri that the road wa clear two or three minut then he could not have retreat down the road and you sai that there ar no side road none then he certainli took a footpath on on side or the other it could not have been on the side of the heath or i should have seen him so by the process of exclus we arriv at the fact that he made hi wai toward charlington hall which as i understand is situat in it own ground on on side of the road anyth els noth mr holm save that i wa so perplex that i felt i should not be happi until i had seen you and had your advic holm sat in silenc for some littl time where is the gentleman to whom you ar engag he ask at last he is in the midland electr compani at coventri he would not pai you a surpris visit oh mr holm as if i should not know him have you had ani other admir sever befor i knew cyril and sinc there wa thi dread man woodlei if you can call him an admir no on els our fair client seem a littl confus who wa he ask holm oh it mai be a mere fanci of mine but it had seem to me sometim that my employ mr carruth take a great deal of interest in me we ar thrown rather togeth i plai hi accompani in the even he ha never said anyth he is a perfect gentleman but a girl alwai know ha holm look grave what doe he do for a live he is a rich man no carriag or hors well at least he is fairli welltodo but he goe into the citi two or three time a week he is deepli interest in south

bicycl in lone countri road some secret lover beyond all doubt but there ar curiou and suggest detail about the case watson that he should appear onli at that point exactli our first effort must be to find who ar the tenant of charlington hall then again how about the connect between carruth and woodlei sinc thei appear to be men of such a differ type how came thei both to be so keen upon look up ralph smith s relat on more point what sort of a menag is it which pai doubl the market price for a gover but doe not keep a hors although six mile from the station odd watsonveri odd you will go down no my dear fellow you will go down thi mai be some trifl intrigu and i cannot break my other import research for the sake of it on mondai you will arriv earli at farnham you will conceal yourself near charlington heath you will observ these fact for yourself and act as your own judgment advis then have inquir as to the occup of the hall you will come back to me and report and now watson not anoth word of the matter until we have a few solid steppingston on which we mai hope to get across to our solut we had ascertain from the ladi that she went down upon the mondai by the train which leav waterloo at so i start earli and caught the at farnham station i had no difficulti in be direct to charlington heath it wa imposs to mistak the scene of the young ladi s adventur for the road run between the open heath on on side and an old yew hedg upon the other surround a park which is stud with magnific tree there wa a main gatewai of lichenstud stone each side pillar surmount by moulder herald emblem but besid thi central carriag drive i observ sever point where there were gap in the hedg and path lead through them the hous wa invis from the road but the surround all spoke of gloom and decai the heath wa cover with golden patch of flower gors gleam magnific in the light of the bright spring sunshin behind on of these clump i took up my posit so as to command both the gatewai of the hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side it had been desert when i left it but now i saw a cyclist ride down it from the opposit direct to that in which i had come he wa clad in a dark suit and i saw that he had a black beard on reach the end of the charlington ground he sprang from hi machin and led it through a gap in the hedg disappear from my view a quarter of an hour pass and then a second cyclist appear thi time it wa the young ladi come from the station i saw her look about her as she came to the charlington hedg an instant later the man emerg from hi hidingplac sprang upon hi cycl and follow her in all the broad landscap those were the onli move figur the grace girl sit veri straight upon her machin and the man behind her bend low over hi handlebar with a curious furtiv suggest in everi movement she look back at him and slow her pace he slow also she stop he at onc stop too keep two hundr yard behind her her next movement wa as unexpect as it wa spirit she suddenli whisk her wheel round and dash straight at him he wa as quick as she howev and dart off in desper flight present she came back up the road again her head haughtili in the air not deign to take ani further notic of her silent attend he had turn also and still kept hi distanc until the curv of the road hid them from my sight i remain in my hidingplac and it wa well that i did so for present the man reappear cycl slowli back he turn in at the hall gate and dismount from hi machin for some minut i could see him stand among the tree hi hand were rais and he seem to be settl hi neckti then he mount hi cycl and rode awai from me down the drive toward the hall i ran across the heath and peer through the tree far awai i could catch glimps of the old grai build with it bristl tudor chimnei but the drive ran through a dens shrubberi and i saw no more of my man howev it seem to me that i had done a fairli good morn s work and i walk back in high spirit to farnham the local hous agent could tell me noth about charlington hall and refer me to a well known firm in pall mall there i halt on my wai home and met with courtesi from the repres no i could not have charlington hall for the summer i wa just too late it had been let about a month ago mr williamson wa the name of the tenant he wa a respect elderli gentleman the polit agent wa afraid he could sai no more as the affair of hi client were not matter which he could discuss mr sherlock holm listen with attent to the long report which i wa abl to present to him that even but it did not elicit that word of curt prais which i had hope for and should have valu on the contrari hi auster face wa even more sever than usual as he comment upon the thing that i had done and the thing that i had not your hidingplac my dear watson wa veri faulti you should have been behind the hedg then you would have had a close view of thi interest person as it is you were some hundr of yard awai and can tell me even less than miss smith she think she doe not know the man i am convinc she doe why otherwis should he be so desper anxiou that she should not get so near him as to see hi featur you describ him as bend over the handlebar conceal again you see you realli have done remark badli he return to the hous and you want to find out who he is you come to a london hous agent what should i have done i cri with some heat gone to the nearest publichous that is the centr of countri gossip thei would have told you everi name from the master to the scullerymaid williamson it convei noth to my mind if he is an elderli man he is not thi activ cyclist who sprint awai from that young ladi s athlet pursuit what have we gain by your expedit the knowledg that the girl s stori is true i never doubt it that there is a connect between the cyclist and the hall i never doubt that either that the hall is tenant by williamson who s the better for that well well my dear sir don t look so depress we can do littl more until next saturdai and in the meantim i mai make on or two inquiri myself next morn we had a note from miss smith recount shortli and accur the veri incid which i had seen but the pith of the letter lai in the postscript i am sure that you will respect my confid mr holm when i tell you that my place here ha becom difficult ow to the fact that my employ ha propos marriag to me i am convinc that hi feel ar most deep and most honour at the same time my promis is of cours given he took my refus veri serious but also veri gentli you can understand howev that the situat is a littl strain our young friend seem to be get into deep water said holm thoughtfulli as he finish the letter the case certainli present more featur of interest and more possibl of develop than i had origin thought i should be none the wors for a quiet peac dai in the countri and i am inclin to run down thi afternoon and test on or two theori which i have form holm s quiet dai in the countri had a singular termin for he arriv at baker street late in the even with a cut lip and a discolour lump upon hi forehead besid a gener air of dissip which would have made hi own person the fit object of a scotland yard investig he wa immens tickl by hi own adventur and laugh heartili as he recount them i get so littl activ exercis that it is alwai a treat said he you ar awar that i have some profici in the good old british sport of box occasion it is of servic todai for exampl i should have come to veri ignomini grief without it i beg him to tell me what had occur i found that countri pub which i had alreadi recommend to your notic and there i made my discreet inquiri i wa in the bar and a garrul landlord wa give me all that i want williamson is a whitebeard man and he live alon with a small staff of servant at the hall there is some rumor that he is or ha been a clergyman but on or two incid of hi short resid at the hall struck me as peculiarli unecclesiast i have alreadi made some inquiri at a cleric agenc and thei tell me that there wa a man of that name in order whose career ha been a singularli dark on the landlord further inform me that there ar usual weekend visitor a warm lot sir at the hall and especi on gentleman with a red moustach mr woodlei by name who wa alwai there we had got as far as thi when who should walk in but the gentleman himself who had been drink hi beer in the taproom and had heard the whole convers who wa i what did i want what did i mean by ask question he had a fine flow of languag and hi adject were veri vigor he end a string of abus by a viciou backhand which i fail to entir avoid the next few minut were delici it wa a straight left against a slog ruffian i emerg as you see me mr woodlei went home in a cart so end my countri trip and it must be confess that howev enjoy my dai on the surrei border ha not been much more profit than your own the thursdai brought us anoth letter from our client you will not be surpris mr holm said she to hear that i am leav mr carruth s employ even the high pai cannot reconcil me to the discomfort of my situat on saturdai i come up to town and i do not intend to return mr carruth ha got a trap and so the danger of the lone road if there ever were ani danger ar now over as to the special caus of my leav it is not mere the strain situat with mr carruth but it is the reappear of that odiou man mr woodlei he wa alwai hideou but he look more aw than ever now for he appear to have had an accid and he is much disfigur i saw him out of the window but i am glad to sai i did not meet him he had a long talk with mr carruth who seem much excit afterward woodlei must be stai in the neighbourhood for he did not sleep here and yet i caught a glimps of him again thi morn slink about in the shrubberi i would sooner have a savag wild anim loos about the place i loath and fear him more than i can sai how can mr carruth endur such a creatur for a moment howev all my troubl will be over on saturdai so i trust watson so i trust said holm grave there is some deep intrigu go on round that littl woman and it is our duti to see that no on molest her upon that last journei i think watson that we must spare time to run down togeth on saturdai morn and make sure that thi curiou and inclus investig ha no untoward end i confess that i had not up to now taken a veri seriou view of the case which had seem to me rather grotesqu and bizarr than danger that a man should lie in wait for and follow a veri handsom woman is no unheardof thing and if he ha so littl audac that he not onli dare not address her but even fled from her approach he wa not a veri formid assail the ruffian woodlei wa a veri differ person but except on on occas he had not molest our client and now he visit the hous of carruth without intrud upon her presenc the man on the bicycl wa doubtless a member of those weekend parti at the hall of which the publican had spoken but who he wa or what he want wa as obscur as ever it wa the sever of holm s manner and the fact that he slip a revolv into hi pocket befor leav our room which impress me with the feel that tragedi might prove to lurk behind thi curiou train of event a raini night had been follow by a gloriou morn and the heathcov countrysid with the glow clump of flower gors seem all the more beauti to ey which were weari of the dun and drab and slate grai of london holm and i walk along the broad sandi road inhal the fresh morn air and rejoic in the music of the bird and the fresh breath of the spring from a rise of the road on the shoulder of crooksburi hill we could see the grim hall bristl out from amidst the ancient oak which old as thei were were still younger than the build which thei surround holm point down the long tract of road which wound a reddish yellow band between the brown of the heath and the bud green of the wood far awai a black dot we could see a vehicl move in our direct holm gave an exclam of impati i have given a margin of half an hour said he if that is her trap she must be make for the earlier train i fear watson that she will be past charlington befor we can possibl meet her from the instant that we pass the rise we could no longer see the vehicl but we hasten onward at such a pace that my sedentari life began to tell upon me and i wa compel to fall behind holm howev wa alwai in train for he had inexhaust store of nervou energi upon which to draw hi springi step never slow until suddenli when he wa a hundr yard in front of me he halt and i saw him throw up hi hand with a gestur of grief and despair at the same instant an empti dogcart the hors canter the rein trail appear round the curv of the road and rattl swiftli toward us too late watson too late cri holm as i ran pant to hi side fool that i wa not to allow for that

own affair but if you round on your pal to thi plaincloth copper it will be the worst dai s work that ever you did your rever need not be excit said holm light a cigarett the case is clear enough against you and all i ask is a few detail for my privat curios howev if there s ani difficulti in your tell me i ll do the talk and then you will see how far you have a chanc of hold back your secret in the first place three of you came from south africa on thi gamey williamson you carruth and woodlei lie number on said the old man i never saw either of them until two month ago and i have never been in africa in my life so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it mr busybodi holm what he sai is true said carruth well well two of you came over hi rever is our own homemad articl you had known ralph smith in south africa you had reason to believ he would not live long you found out that hi niec would inherit hi fortun how s thateh carruth nod and williamson swore she wa next of kin no doubt and you were awar that the old fellow would make no will couldn t read or write said carruth so you came over the two of you and hunt up the girl the idea wa that on of you wa to marri her and the other have a share of the plunder for some reason woodlei wa chosen as the husband why wa that we plai card for her on the voyag he won i see you got the young ladi into your servic and there woodlei wa to do the court she recogn the drunken brute that he wa and would have noth to do with him meanwhil your arrang wa rather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the ladi you could no longer bear the idea of thi ruffian own her no by georg i couldn t there wa a quarrel between you he left you in a rage and began to make hi own plan independ of you it strike me williamson there isn t veri much that we can tell thi gentleman cri carruth with a bitter laugh ye we quarrel and he knock me down i am level with him on that anyhow then i lost sight of him that wa when he pick up with thi outcast padr here i found that thei had set up housekeep togeth at thi place on the line that she had to pass for the station i kept my ey on her after that for i knew there wa some devilri in the wind i saw them from time to time for i wa anxiou to know what thei were after two dai ago woodlei came up to my hous with thi cabl which show that ralph smith wa dead he ask me if i would stand by the bargain i said i would not he ask me if i would marri the girl myself and give him a share i said i would willingli do so but that she would not have me he said let us get her marri first and after a week or two she mai see thing a bit differ i said i would have noth to do with violenc so he went off curs like the foulmouth blackguard that he wa and swear that he would have her yet she wa leav me thi weekend and i had got a trap to take her to the station but i wa so uneasi in my mind that i follow her on my bicycl she had got a start howev and befor i could catch her the mischief wa done the first thing i knew about it wa when i saw you two gentlemen drive back in her dogcart holm rose and toss the end of hi cigarett into the grate i have been veri obtus watson said he when in your report you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrang hi neckti in the shrubberi that alon should have told me all howev we mai congratul ourselv upon a curiou and in some respect a uniqu case i perceiv three of the counti constabulari in the drive and i am glad to see that the littl ostler is abl to keep pace with them so it is like that neither he nor the interest bridegroom will be perman damag by their morn s adventur i think watson that in your medic capac you might wait upon miss smith and tell her that if she is suffici recov we shall be happi to escort her to her mother s home if she is not quit convalesc you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young electrician in the midland would probabl complet the cure as to you mr carruth i think that you have done what you could to make amend for your share in an evil plot there is my card sir and if my evid can be of help in your trial it shall be at your dispos in the whirl of our incess activ it ha often been difficult for me as the reader ha probabl observ to round off my narr and to give those final detail which the curiou might expect each case ha been the prelud to anoth and the crisi onc over the actor have pass for ever out of our busi live i find howev a short note at the end of my manuscript deal with thi case in which i have put it upon record that miss violet smith did inde inherit a larg fortun and that she is now the wife of cyril morton the senior partner of morton kennedi the famou westminst electrician williamson and woodlei were both tri for abduct and assault the former get seven year the latter ten of the fate of carruth i have no record but i am sure that hi assault wa not view veri grave by the court sinc woodlei had the reput of be a most danger ruffian and i think that a few month were suffici to satisfi the demand of justic the adventur of the priori school we have had some dramat entranc and exit upon our small stage at baker street but i cannot recollect anyth more sudden and startl than the first appear of thorneycroft huxtabl ma phd etc hi card which seem too small to carri the weight of hi academ distinct preced him by

founder and princip huxtabl s sidelight on horac mai possibl recal my name to your memori the priori is without except the best and most select preparatori school in england lord leverstok the earl of blackwat sir cathcart soamesthei all have intrust their son to me but i felt that my school had reach it zenith when week ago the duke of holderness sent mr jame wilder hi secretari with intim that young lord saltir ten year old hi onli son and heir wa about to be commit to my charg littl did i think that thi would be the prelud to the most crush misfortun of my life on mai st the boi arriv that be the begin of the summer term he wa a charm youth and he soon fell into our wai i mai tell youi trust that i am not indiscreet but halfconfid ar absurd in such a casethat he wa not entir happi at home it is an open secret that the duke s marri life had not been a peac on and the matter had end in a separ by mutual consent the duchess take up her resid in the south of franc thi had occur veri shortli befor and the boi s sympathi ar known to have been strongli with hi mother he mope after her departur from holderness hall and it wa for thi reason that the duke desir to send him to my establish in a fortnight the boi wa quit at home with us and wa appar absolut happi he wa last seen on the night of mai ththat is the night of last mondai hi room wa on the second floor and wa approach through anoth larger room in which two boi were sleep these boi saw and heard noth so that it is certain that young saltir did not pass out that wai hi window wa open and there is a stout ivi plant lead to the ground we could trace no footmark below but it is sure that thi is the onli possibl exit hi absenc wa discov at seven o clock on tuesdai morn hi bed had been slept in he had dress himself fulli befor go off in hi usual school suit of black eton jacket and dark grai trouser there were no sign that anyon had enter the room and it is quit certain that anyth in the natur of cri or a struggl would have been heard sinc caunter the elder boi in the inner room is a veri light sleeper when lord saltir s disappear wa discov i at onc call a roll of the whole establishmentboi master and servant it wa then that we ascertain that lord saltir had not been alon in hi flight heidegg the german master wa miss hi room wa on the second floor at the farther end of the build face the same wai as lord saltir s hi bed had also been slept in but he had appar gone awai partli dress sinc hi shirt and sock were ly on the floor he had undoubtedli let himself down by the ivi for we could see the mark of hi feet where he had land on the lawn hi bicycl wa kept in a small shed besid thi lawn and it also wa gone he had been with me for two year and came with the best refer but he wa a silent moros man not veri popular either with master or boi no trace could be found of the fugit and now on thursdai morn we ar as ignor as we were on tuesdai inquiri wa of cours made at onc at holderness hall it is onli a few mile awai and we imagin that in some sudden attack of homesick he had gone back to hi father but noth had been heard of him the duke is greatli agit and as to me you have seen yourselv the state of nervou prostrat to which the suspens and the respons have reduc me mr holm if ever you put forward your full power i implor you to do so now for never in your life could you have a case which is more worthi of them sherlock holm had listen with the utmost intent to the statement of the unhappi schoolmast hi drawn brow and the deep furrow between them show that he need no exhort to concentr all hi attent upon a problem which apart from the tremend interest involv must appeal so directli to hi love of the complex and the unusu he now drew out hi notebook and jot down on or two memoranda you have been veri remiss in not come to me sooner said he sever you start me on my investig with a veri seriou handicap it is inconceiv for exampl that thi ivi and thi lawn would have yield noth to an expert observ i am not to blame mr holm hi grace wa extrem desir to avoid all public scandal he wa afraid of hi famili unhappi be drag befor the world he ha a deep horror of anyth of the kind but there ha been some offici investig ye sir and it ha prove most disappoint an appar clue wa at onc obtain sinc a boi and a young man were report to have been seen leav a neighbour station by an earli train onli last night we had new that the coupl had been hunt down in liverpool and thei prove to have no connect whatev with the matter in hand then it wa that in my despair and disappoint after a sleepless night i came straight to you by the earli train i suppos the local investig wa relax while thi fals clue wa be follow up it wa entir drop so that three dai have been wast the affair ha been most deplor handl i feel it and admit it and yet the problem should be capabl of ultim solut i shall be veri happi to look into it have you been abl to trace ani connect between the miss boi and thi german master none at all wa he in the master s class no he never exchang a word with him so far as i know that is certainli veri singular had the boi a bicycl no wa ani other bicycl miss no is that certain quit well now you do not mean to serious suggest that thi german rode off upon a bicycl in the dead of the night bear the boi in hi arm certainli not then what is the theori in your mind the bicycl mai have been a blind it mai have been hidden somewher and the pair gone off on foot quit so but it seem rather an absurd blind doe it not were there other bicycl in thi shed sever would he not have hidden a coupl had he desir to give the idea that thei had gone off upon them i suppos he would of cours he would the blind theori won t do but the incid is an admir startingpoint for an investig after all a bicycl is not an easi thing to conceal or to destroi on other question did anyon call to see the boi on the dai befor he disappear no did he get ani letter ye on letter from whom from hi father do you open the boi letter no how do you know it wa from the father the coat of arm wa on the envelop and it wa address in the duke s peculiar stiff hand besid the duke rememb have written when had he a letter befor that not for sever dai had he ever on from franc no never you see the point of my question of cours either the boi wa carri off by forc or he went of hi own free will in the latter case you would expect that some prompt from outsid would be need to make so young a lad do such a thing if he ha had no visitor that prompt must have come in letter henc i try to find out who were hi correspond i fear i cannot help you much hi onli correspond so far as i know wa hi own father who wrote to him on the veri dai of hi disappear were the relat between father and son veri friendli hi grace is never veri friendli with anyon he is complet immers in larg public question and is rather inaccess to all ordinari emot but he wa alwai kind to the boi in hi own wai but the sympathi of the latter were with the mother ye did he sai so no the duke then good heaven no then how could you know i have had some confidenti talk with mr jame wilder hi grace s secretari it wa he who gave me the inform about lord saltir s feel i see by the wai that last letter of the dukeswa it found in the boi s room after he wa gone no he had taken it with him i think mr holm it is time that we were leav for euston i will order a fourwheel in a quarter of an hour we shall be at your servic if you ar telegraph home mr huxtabl it would be well to allow the peopl in your neighbourhood to imagin that the inquiri is still go on in liverpool or wherev els that red her led your pack in the meantim i will do a littl quiet work at your own door and perhap the scent is not so cold but that two old hound like watson and myself mai get a sniff of it that even found us in the cold brace atmospher of the peak countri in which dr huxtabl s famou school is situat it wa alreadi dark when we reach it a card wa ly on the hall tabl and the butler whisper someth to hi master who turn to us with agit in everi heavi featur the duke is here said he the duke and mr wilder ar in the studi come gentlemen and i will introduc you i wa of cours familiar with the pictur of the famou statesman but the man himself wa veri differ from hi represent he wa a tall and state person scrupul dress with a drawn thin face and a nose which wa grotesqu curv and long hi complexion wa of a dead pallor which wa more startl by contrast with a long dwindl beard of vivid red which flow down over hi white waistcoat with hi watchchain gleam through it fring such wa the state presenc who look stonili at us from the centr of dr huxtabl s hearthrug besid him stood a veri young man whom i understood to be wilder the privat secretari he wa small nervou alert with intellig lightblu ey and mobil featur it wa he who at onc in an incis and posit tone open the convers i call thi morn dr huxtabl too late to prevent you from start for london i learn that your object wa to invit mr sherlock holm to undertak the conduct of thi case hi grace is surpris dr huxtabl that you should have taken such a step without consult him when i learn that the polic had fail hi grace is by no mean convinc that the polic have fail but sure mr wilder you ar well awar dr huxtabl that hi grace is particularli anxiou to avoid all public scandal he prefer to take as few peopl as possibl into hi confid the matter can be easili remedi said the browbeaten doctor mr sherlock holm can return to london by the morn train hardli that doctor hardli that said holm in hi blandest voic thi northern air is invigor and pleasant so i propos to spend a few dai upon your moor and to occupi my mind as best i mai whether i have the shelter of your roof or of the villag inn is of cours for you to decid i could see that the unfortun doctor wa in the last stage of indecis from which he wa rescu by the deep sonor voic of the redbeard duke which boom out like a dinnergong i agre with mr wilder dr huxtabl that you would have done wise to consult me but sinc mr holm ha alreadi been taken into your confid it would inde be absurd that we should not avail ourselv of hi servic far from go to the inn mr holm i should be pleas if you would come and stai with me at holderness hall i thank your grace for the purpos of my investig i think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mysteri just as you like mr holm ani inform which mr wilder or i can give you is of cours at your dispos it will probabl be necessari for me to see you at the hall said holm i would onli ask you now sir whether you have form ani explan in your own mind as to the mysteri disappear of your son no sir i have not excus me if i allud to that which is pain to you but i have no altern do you think that the duchess had anyth to do with the matter the great minist show percept hesit i do not think so he said at last the other most obviou explan is that the child ha been kidnap for the purpos of levi ransom you have not had ani demand of the sort no sir on more question your grace i understand that you wrote to your son upon the dai when thi incid occur no i wrote upon the dai befor exactli but he receiv it on that dai ye wa there anyth in your letter which might have unbalanc him or induc him to take such a step no sir certainli not did you post that letter yourself the nobleman s repli wa interrupt by hi secretari who broke in with some heat hi grace is not in the habit of post letter himself said he thi letter wa laid with other upon the studi tabl and i myself put them in the postbag you ar sure thi on wa among them ye i observ it how mani letter did your grace write that dai twenti or thirti i have a larg correspond but sure thi is somewhat irrelev not entir said holm for my own part the duke continu i have advis the polic to turn their attent to the south of franc i have alreadi said that i do not believ that the duchess would encourag so monstrou an action but the lad had the most wronghead opinion and it is possibl that he mai have fled to her aid and abet by thi german i think dr huxtabl that we will now return to the hall i could see that there were other question which holm would have wish to put but the nobleman s abrupt manner show that the interview wa at an end it wa evid that to hi intens aristocrat natur thi discuss of hi intim famili affair with a stranger wa most abhorr and that he fear lest everi fresh question would throw a fiercer light into the discreetli shadow corner of hi ducal histori when the nobleman and hi secretari had left my friend flung himself at onc with characterist eager into the investig the boi s chamber wa carefulli examin and yield noth save the absolut convict that it wa onli through the window that he could have escap the german master s room and effect gave no further clue in hi case a trailer of ivi had given wai under hi weight and we saw by the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn where hi heel had come down that on dint in the short green grass wa the onli materi wit left of thi inexplic nocturn flight sherlock holm left the hous alon and onli return after eleven he had obtain a larg ordnanc map of the neighbourhood and thi he brought into my room where he laid it out on the bed and have balanc the lamp in the middl of it he began to smoke over it and occasion to point out object of interest with the reek amber of hi pipe graphic holm map of the neighborhood of the school thi case grow upon me watson said he there ar decidedli some point of interest in connect with it in thi earli stage i want you to realiz those geograph featur which mai have a good deal to do with our investig look at thi map thi dark squar is the priori school i ll put a pin in it now thi line is the main road you see that it run east and west past the school and you see also that there is no side road for a mile either wai if these two folk pass awai by road it wa thi road graphic exactli by a singular and happi chanc we ar abl to some extent to check what pass along thi road dure the night in question at thi point where my pipe is now rest a counti constabl wa on duti from twelv to six it is as you perceiv the first crossroad on the east side thi man declar that he wa not absent from hi post for an instant and he is posit that neither boi nor man could have gone that wai unseen i have spoken with thi policeman tonight and he appear to me to be a perfectli reliabl person that block thi end we have now to deal with the other there is an inn here the red bull the landladi of which wa ill she had sent to mackleton for a doctor but he did not arriv until morn be absent at anoth case the peopl at the inn were alert all night await hi come and on or other of them seem to have continu had an ey upon the road thei declar that no on pass if their evid is good then we ar fortun enough to be abl to block the west and also to be abl to sai that the fugit did not us the road at all but the bicycl i object quit so we will come to the bicycl present to continu our reason if these peopl did not go by the road thei must have travers the countri to the north of the hous or to the south of the hous that is certain let us weigh the on against the other on the south of the hous is as you perceiv a larg district of arabl land cut up into small field with stone wall between them there i admit that a bicycl is imposs we can dismiss the idea we turn to the countri on the north here there li a grove of tree mark as the rag shaw and on the farther side stretch a great roll moor lower gill moor extend for ten mile and slope gradual upward here at on side of thi wilder is holderness hall ten mile by road but onli six across the moor it is a peculiarli desol plain a few moor farmer have small hold where thei rear sheep and cattl except these the plover and the curlew ar the onli inhabit until you come to the chesterfield high road there is a church there you see a few cottag and an inn beyond that the hill becom precipit sure it is here to the north that our quest must lie but the bicycl i persist well well said holm impati a good cyclist doe not need a high road the moor is intersect with path and the moon wa at the full halloa what is thi there wa an agit knock at the door and an instant afterward dr huxtabl wa in the room in hi hand he held a blue cricketcap with a white chevron on the peak at last we have a clue he cri thank heaven at last we ar on the dear boi s track it is hi cap where wa it found in the van of the gipsi who camp on the moor thei left on tuesdai todai the polic trace them down and examin their caravan thi wa found how do thei account for it thei shuffl and liedsaid that thei found it on the moor on tuesdai morn thei know where he is the rascal thank good thei ar all safe under lock and kei either the fear of the law or the duke s purs will certainli get out of them all that thei know so far so good said holm when the doctor had at last left the room it at least bear out the theori that it is on the side of the lower gill moor that we must hope for result the polic have realli done noth local save the arrest of these gipsi look here watson there is a watercours across the moor you see it mark here in the map in some part it widen into a morass thi is particularli so in the region between holderness hall and the school it is vain to look elsewher for track in thi dry weather but at that point there is certainli a chanc of some record be left i will call you earli tomorrow morn and you and i will try if we can throw some littl light upon the mysteri the dai wa just break when i woke to find the long thin form of holm by my bedsid he wa fulli dress and had appar alreadi been out i have done the lawn and the bicycl shed said he i have also had a rumbl through the rag shaw now watson there is cocoa readi in the next room i must beg you to hurri for we have a great dai befor us hi ey shone and hi cheek wa flush with the exhilar of the master workman who see hi work lie readi befor him a veri differ holm thi activ alert man from the introspect and pallid dreamer of baker street i felt as i look upon that suppl figur aliv with nervou energi that it wa inde a strenuou dai that await us and yet it open in the blackest disappoint with high hope we struck across the peati russet moor intersect with a thousand sheep path until we came to the broad lightgreen belt which mark the morass between us and holderness certainli if the lad had gone homeward he must have pass thi and he could not pass it without leav hi trace but no sign of him or the german could be seen with a darken face my friend strode along the margin eagerli observ of everi muddi stain upon the mossi surfac sheepmark there were in profus and at on place some mile down cow had left their track noth more check number on said holm look gloomili over the roll expans of the moor there is anoth morass down yonder and a narrow neck between halloa halloa halloa what have we here we had come on a small black ribbon of pathwai in the middl of it clearli mark on the sodden soil wa the track of a bicycl hurrah i cri we have it but holm wa shake hi head and hi face wa puzzl and expect rather than joyou a bicycl certainli but not the bicycl said he i am familiar with fortytwo differ impress left by tire thi as you perceiv is a dunlop with a patch upon the outer cover heidegg s tire were palmer s leav longitudin stripe avel the mathemat master wa sure upon the point therefor it is not heidegg s track the boi s then possibl if we could prove a bicycl to have been in hi possess but thi we have utterli fail to do thi track as you perceiv wa made by a rider who wa go from the direct of the school or toward it no no my dear watson the more deepli sunk impress is of cours the hind wheel upon which the weight rest you perceiv sever place where it ha pass across and obliter the more shallow mark of the front on it wa undoubtedli head awai from the school it mai or mai not be connect with our inquiri but we will follow it backward befor we go ani farther we did so and at the end of a few hundr yard lost the track as we emerg from the boggi portion of the moor follow the path backward we pick out anoth spot where a spring trickl across it here onc again wa the mark of the bicycl though nearli obliter by the hoof of cow after that there wa no sign but the path ran right on into rag shaw the wood which back on to the school from thi wood the cycl must have emerg holm sat down on a boulder and rest hi chin in hi hand i had smoke two cigarett befor he move well well said he at last it is of cours possibl that a cun man might chang the tire of hi bicycl in order to leav unfamiliar track a crimin who wa capabl of such a thought is a man whom i should be proud to do busi with we will leav thi question undecid and hark back to our morass again for we have left a good deal unexplor we continu our systemat survei of the edg of the sodden portion of the moor and soon our persever wa glorious reward right across the lower part of the bog lai a miri path holm gave a cry of delight as he approach it an impress like a fine bundl of telegraph wire ran down the centr of it it wa the palmer tire here is herr heidegg sure enough cri holm exultantli my reason seem to have been pretti sound watson i congratul you but we have a long wai still to go kindli walk clear of the path now let us follow the trail i fear that it will not lead veri far we found howev as we advanc that thi portion of the moor is intersect with soft patch and though we frequent lost sight of the track we alwai succeed in pick it up onc more do you observ said holm that the rider is now undoubtedli forc the pace there can be no doubt of it look at thi impress where you get both tire clear the on is as deep as the other that can onli mean that the rider is throw hi weight on to the handlebar as a man doe when he is sprint by jove he ha had a fall there wa a broad irregular smudg cover some yard of the track then there were a few footmark and the tire reappear onc more a sideslip i suggest holm held up a crumpl branch of flower gors to my horror i perceiv that the yellow blossom were all dabbl with crimson on the path too and among the heather were dark stain of clot blood bad said holm bad stand clear watson not an unnecessari footstep what do i read here he fell woundedh stood uph remountedh proceed but there is no other track cattl on thi side path he wa sure not gore by a bull imposs but i see no trace of anyon els we must push on watson sure with stain as well as the track to guid us he cannot escap us now our search wa not a veri long on the track of the tire began to curv fantast upon the wet and shine path suddenli as i look ahead the gleam of metal caught my ey from amid the thick gorsebush out of them we drag a bicycl palmertir on pedal bent and the whole front of it horribl smear and slobber with blood on the other side of the bush a shoe wa project we ran round and there lai the unfortun rider he wa a tall man fullbeard with spectacl on glass of which had been knock out the caus of hi death wa a fright blow upon the head which had crush in part of hi skull that he could have gone on after receiv such an injuri said much for the vital and courag of the man he wore shoe but no sock and hi open coat disclos a nightshirt beneath it it wa undoubtedli the german master holm turn the bodi over rever and examin it with great attent he then sat in deep thought for a time and i could see by hi ruffl brow that thi grim discoveri had not in hi opinion advanc us much in our inquiri it is a littl difficult to know what to do watson said he at last my own inclin ar to push thi inquiri on for we have alreadi lost so much time that we cannot afford to wast anoth hour on the other hand we ar bound to inform the polic of the discoveri and to see that thi poor fellow s bodi is look after i could take a note back but i need your compani and assist wait a bit there is a fellow cut peat up yonder bring him over here and he will guid the polic i brought the peasant across and holm dispatch the frighten man with a note to dr huxtabl now watson said he we have pick up two clue thi morn on is the bicycl with the palmer tire and we see what that ha led to the other is the bicycl with the patch dunlop befor we start to investig that let us try to realiz what we do know so as to make

that you were in a ship there wa a bunk at on end a seachest map and chart a pictur of the sea unicorn a line of logbook on a shelf all exactli as on would expect to find it in a captain s room and there in the middl of it wa the man himselfhi face twist like a lost soul in torment and hi great brindl beard stuck upward in hi agoni right through hi broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven

some abras some trifl displac which can be detect by the scientif searcher it is incred that thi bloodbespatt room contain no trace which could have aid us i understand howev from the inquest that there were some object which you fail to overlook the young inspector winc at my companion s iron comment i wa a fool not to call you in at the time mr holm howev that s past prai for now ye there were sever object in the room which call for special attent on wa the harpoon with which the deed wa commit it had been snatch down from a rack on the wall two other remain there and there wa a vacant place for the third on the stock wa engrav ss sea unicorn dunde thi seem to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of furi and that the murder had seiz the first weapon which came in hi wai the fact that the crime wa commit at two in the morn and yet peter carei wa fulli dress suggest that he had an appoint with the murder which is born out by the fact that a bottl of rum and two dirti glass stood upon the tabl ye said holm i think that both infer ar permiss wa there ani other spirit but rum in the room ye there wa a tantalu contain brandi and whiski on the seachest it is of no import to us howev sinc the decant were full and it had therefor not been us for all that it presenc ha some signific said holm howev let us hear some more about the object which do seem to you to

a fourwheel hopkin we shall be readi to start for forest row in a quarter of an hour alight at the small waysid station we drove for some mile through the remain of widespread wood which were onc part of that great forest which for so long held the saxon invad at bayth impenetr weald for sixti year the bulwark of britain vast section of it have been clear for thi is the seat of the first ironwork of the countri and the tree have been fell to smelt the or now the richer field of the north have absorb the trade and noth save these ravag grove and great scar in the earth show the work of the past here in a clear upon the green slope of a hill stood a long low stone hous approach by a curv drive run through the field nearer the road and surround on three side by bush wa a small outhous on window and the door face in our direct it wa the scene of the murder stanlei hopkin led us first to the hous where he introduc us to a haggard grayhair woman the widow of the murder man whose gaunt and deeplin face with the furtiv look of terror in the depth of her redrim ey told of the year of hardship and illusag which she had endur with her wa her daughter a pale fairhair girl whose ey blaze defiantli at us as she told us that she wa glad that her father wa dead and that she bless the hand which had struck him down it wa a terribl household that black peter carei had made for himself and it wa with a sens of relief that we found ourselv in the sunlight again and make our wai along a path which had been worn across the field by the feet of the dead man the outhous wa the simplest of dwell woodenwal shingleroof on window besid the door and on on the farther side stanlei hopkin drew the kei from hi pocket and had stoop to the lock when he paus with a look of attent and surpris upon hi face someon ha been tamper with it he said there could be no doubt of the fact the woodwork wa cut and the scratch show white through the paint as if thei had been that instant done holm had been examin the window someon ha tri to forc thi also whoever it wa ha fail to make hi wai in he must have been a veri poor burglar thi is a most extraordinari thing said the inspector i could swear that these mark were not here yesterdai even some curiou person from the villag perhap i suggest veri unlik few of them would dare to set foot in the ground far less try to forc their wai into the cabin what do you think of it mr holm i think that fortun is veri kind to us you mean that the person will come again it is veri probabl he came expect to find the door open he tri to get in with the blade of a veri small penknif he could not manag it what would he do come again next night with a more us tool so i should sai it will be our fault if we ar not there to receiv him meanwhil let me see the insid of the cabin the trace of the tragedi had been remov but the furnitur within the littl room still stood as it had been on the night of the crime for two hour with most intens concentr holm examin everi object in turn but hi face show that hi quest wa not a success on onc onli he paus in hi patient investig have you taken anyth off thi shelf hopkin no i have move noth someth ha been taken there is less dust in thi corner of the shelf than elsewher it mai have been a book ly on it side it mai have been a box well well i can do noth more let us walk in these beauti wood watson and give a few hour to the bird and the flower we shall meet you here later hopkin and see if we can come to closer quarter with the gentleman who ha paid thi visit in the night it wa past eleven o clock when we form our littl ambuscad hopkin wa for leav the door of the hut open but holm wa of the opinion that thi would rous the suspicion of the stranger the lock wa a perfectli simpl on and onli a strong blade wa need to push it back holm also suggest that we should wait not insid the hut but outsid it among the bush which grew round the farther window in thi wai we should be abl to watch our man if he struck a light and see what hi object wa in thi stealthi nocturn visit it wa a long and melancholi vigil and yet brought with it someth of the thrill which the hunter feel when he li besid the waterpool and wait for the come of the thirsti beast of prei what savag creatur wa it which might steal upon us out of the dark wa it a fierc tiger of crime which could onli be taken fight hard with flash fang and claw or would it prove to be some skulk jackal danger onli to the weak and unguard in absolut silenc we crouch amongst the bush wait for whatev might come at first the step of a few belat villag or the sound of voic from the villag lighten our vigil but on by on these interrupt di awai and an absolut still fell upon us save for the chime of the distant church which told us of the progress of the night and for the rustl and whisper of a fine rain fall amid the foliag which roof us in halfpast two had chime and it wa the darkest hour which preced the dawn when we all start as a low but sharp click came from the direct of the gate someon had enter the drive again there wa a long silenc and i had begun to fear that it wa a fals alarm when a stealthi step wa heard upon the other side of the hut and a moment later a metal scrape and clink the man wa try to forc the lock thi time hi skill wa greater or hi tool wa better for there wa a sudden snap and the creak of the hing then a match wa struck and next instant the steadi light from a candl fill the interior of the hut through the gauz curtain our ey were all rivet upon the scene within the nocturn visitor wa a young man frail and thin with a black moustach which intensifi the deadli pallor of hi face he could not have been much abov twenti year of ag i have never seen ani human be who appear to be in such a pitiabl fright for hi teeth were visibl chatter and he wa shake in everi limb he wa dress like a gentleman in norfolk jacket and knickerbock with a cloth cap upon hi head we watch him stare round with frighten ey then he laid the candleend upon the tabl and disappear from our view into on of the corner he return with a larg book on of the logbook which form a line upon the shelv lean on the tabl he rapidli turn over the leav of thi volum until he came to the entri which he sought then with an angri gestur of hi clench hand he close the book replac it in the corner and put out the light he had hardli turn to leav the hut when hopkin s hand wa on the fellow s collar and i heard hi loud gasp of terror as he understood that he wa taken the candl wa relit and there wa our wretch captiv shiver and cower in the grasp of the detect he sank down upon the seachest and look helplessli from on of us to the other now my fine fellow said stanlei hopkin who ar you and what do you want here the man pull himself togeth and face us with an effort at selfcomposur you ar detect i suppos said he you imagin i am connect with the death of captain peter carei i assur you that i am innoc we ll see about that said hopkin first of all what is your name it is john hoplei neligan i saw holm and hopkin exchang a quick glanc what ar you do here can i speak confidenti no certainli not why should i tell you if you have no answer it mai go badli with you at the trial the young man winc well i will tell you he said why should i not and yet i hate to think of thi old scandal gain a new leas of life did you ever hear of dawson and neligan i could see from hopkin s face that he never had but holm wa keenli interest you mean the west countri banker said he thei fail for a million ruin half the counti famili of cornwal and neligan disappear exactli neligan wa my father at last we were get someth posit and yet it seem a long gap between an abscond banker and captain peter carei pin against the wall with on of hi own harpoon we all listen intent to the young man s word it wa my father who wa realli concern dawson had retir i wa onli ten year of ag at the time but i wa old enough to feel the shame and horror of it all it ha alwai been said that my father stole all the secur and fled it is not true it wa hi belief that if he were given time in which to realiz them all would be well and everi creditor paid in full he start in hi littl yacht for norwai just befor the warrant wa issu for hi arrest i can rememb that last night when he bade farewel to my mother he left us a list of the secur he wa take and he swore that he would come back with hi honour clear and that none who had trust him would suffer well no word wa ever heard from him again both the yacht and he vanish utterli we believ my mother and i that he and it with the secur that he had taken with him were at the bottom of the sea we had a faith friend howev who is a busi man and it wa he who discov some time ago that some of the secur which my father had with him had reappear on the london market you can imagin our amaz i spent month in try to trace them and at last after mani doubt and difficulti i discov that the origin seller had been captain peter carei the owner of thi hut natur i made some inquiri about the man i found that he had been in command of a whaler which wa due to return from the arctic sea at the veri time when my father wa cross to norwai the autumn of that year wa a stormi on and there wa a long success of southerli gale my father s yacht mai well have been blown to the north and there met by captain peter carei s ship if that were so what had becom of my father in ani case if i could prove from peter carei s evid how these secur came on the market it would be a proof that my father had not sold them and that he had no view to person profit when he took them i came down to sussex with the intent of see the captain but it wa at thi moment that hi terribl death occur i read at the inquest a descript of hi cabin in which it state that the old logbook of hi vessel were preserv in it it struck me that if i could see what occur in the month of august on board the sea unicorn i might settl the mysteri of my father s fate i tri last night to get at these logbook but wa unabl to open the door tonight i tri again and succeed but i find that the page which deal with that month

fear that the scrambl egg ar cold howev you will enjoi the rest of your breakfast all the better will you not for the thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant conclus stanlei hopkin wa speechless with amaz i don t know what to sai mr holm he blurt out at last with a veri red face it seem to me that i have been make a fool of myself from the begin i understand now what i should never have forgotten that i am the pupil and you ar the master even now i see what you have done but i don t know how you did it or what it signifi well well said holm goodhumouredli we all learn by experi and your lesson thi time is that you should never lose sight of the altern you were so absorb in young neligan that you could not spare a thought to patrick cairn the true murder of peter carei the hoars voic of the seaman broke in on our convers see here mister said he i make no complaint of be manhandl in thi fashion but i would have you call thing by their right name you sai i murder peter carei i sai i kill peter carei and there s all the differ mayb you don t believ what i sai mayb you think i am just sling you a yarn not at all said holm let us hear what you have to sai it s soon told and by the lord everi word of it is truth i knew black peter and when he pull out hi knife i whip a harpoon through him sharp for i knew that it wa him or me that s how he di you can call it murder anyhow i d as soon die with a rope round my neck as with black peter s knife in my heart how came you there ask holm i ll tell it you from the begin just sit me up a littl so as i can speak easi it wa in that it happenedaugust of that year peter carei wa master of the sea unicorn and i wa spare harpoon we were come out of the icepack on our wai home with head wind and a week s southerli gale when we pick up a littl craft that had been blown north there wa on man on hera landsman the crew had thought she would founder and had made for the norwegian coast in the dinghi i guess thei were all drown well we took him on board thi man and he and the skipper had some long talk in the cabin all the baggag we took off with him wa on tin box so far as i know the man s name wa never mention and on the second night he disappear as if he had never been it wa given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavi weather that we were have onli on man knew what had happen to him and that wa me for with my own ey i saw the skipper tip up hi heel and put him over the rail in the middl watch of a dark night two dai befor we sight the shetland light well i kept my knowledg to myself and wait to see what would come of it when we got back to scotland it wa easili hush up and nobodi ask ani question a stranger di by accid and it wa nobodi s busi to inquir shortli after peter carei gave up the sea and it wa long year befor i could find where he wa i guess that he had done the deed for the sake of what wa in that tin box and that he could afford now to pai me well for keep my mouth shut i found out where he wa through a sailor man that had met him in london and down i went to squeez him the first night he wa reason enough and wa readi to give me what would make me free of the sea for life we were to fix it all two night later when i came i found him three part drunk and in a vile temper we sat down and we drank and we yarn about old time but the more he drank the less i like the look on hi face i spot that harpoon upon the wall and i thought i might need it befor i wa through then at last he broke out at me spit and curs with murder in hi ey and a great claspknif in hi hand he had not time to get it from the sheath befor i had the harpoon through him heaven what a yell he gave and hi face get between me and my sleep i stood there with hi blood splash round me and i wait for a bit but all wa quiet so i took heart onc more i look round and there wa the tin box on the shelf i had as much right to it as peter carei anyhow so i took it with me and left the hut like a fool i left my baccypouch upon the tabl now i ll tell you the queerest part of the whole stori i had hardli got outsid the hut when i heard someon come and i hid among the bush a man came slink along went into the hut gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost and leg it as hard as he could run until he wa out of sight who he wa or what he want is more than i can tell for my part i walk ten mile got a train at tunbridg well and so reach london and no on the wiser well when i came to examin the box i found there wa no monei in it and noth but paper that i would not dare to sell i had lost my hold on black peter and wa strand in london without a shill there wa onli my trade left i saw these advertis about harpoon and high wage so i went to the ship agent and thei sent me here that s all i know and i sai again that if i kill black peter the law should give me thank for i save them the price of a hempen rope a veri clear statement said holm rise and light hi pipe i think hopkin that you should lose no time in convei your prison to a place of safeti thi room is not well adapt for a cell and mr patrick cairn occupi too larg a proport of our carpet mr holm said hopkin i do not know how to express my gratitud even now i do not understand how you attain thi result simpli by have the good fortun to get the right clue from the begin it is veri possibl if i had known about thi notebook it might have led awai my thought as it did your but all i heard point in the on direct the amaz strength the skill in the us of the harpoon the rum and water the sealskin tobaccopouch with the coars tobaccoal these point to a seaman and on who had been a whaler i wa convinc that the initi pc upon the pouch were a coincid and not those of peter carei sinc he seldom smoke and no pipe wa found in hi cabin you rememb that i ask whether whiski and brandi were in the cabin you said thei were how mani landsmen ar there who would drink rum when thei could get these other spirit ye i wa certain it wa a seaman and how did you find him my dear sir the problem had becom a veri simpl on if it were a seaman it could onli be a seaman who had been with him on the sea unicorn so far as i could learn he had sail in no other ship i spent three dai in wire to dunde and at the end of that time i had ascertain the name of the crew of the sea unicorn in when i found patrick cairn among the harpoon my research wa near it end i argu that the man wa probabl in london and that he would desir to leav the countri for a time i therefor spent some dai in the east end devis an arctic expedit put forth tempt term for harpoon who would serv under captain basiland behold the result wonder cri hopkin wonder you must obtain the releas of young neligan as soon as possibl said holm i confess that i think you ow him some apolog the tin box must be return to him but of cours the secur which peter carei ha sold ar lost forev there s the cab hopkin and you can remov your man if you want me for the trial my address and that of watson will be somewher in norwayi ll send particular later the adventur of charl augustu milverton it is year sinc the incid of which i speak took place and yet it is with diffid that i allud to them for a long time even with the utmost discret and retic it would have been imposs to make the fact public but now the princip person concern is beyond the reach of human law and with due suppress the stori mai be told in such fashion as to injur no on it record an absolut uniqu experi in the career both of mr sherlock holm

exactli that s what i said but then when the man commit burglari in order to break imag which ar not hi own that bring it awai from the doctor and on to the policeman holm sat up again burglari thi is more interest let me hear the detail lestrad took out hi offici notebook and refresh hi memori from it page the first case report wa four dai ago said he it wa at the shop of mors hudson who ha a place for the sale of pictur and statu in the kennington road the assist had left the front shop for an instant when he heard a crash and hurri in he found a plaster bust of napoleon which stood with sever other work of art upon the counter ly shiver into fragment he rush out into the road but although sever passersbi declar that thei had notic a man run out of the shop he could neither see anyon nor could he find ani mean of identifi the rascal it seem to be on of those senseless act of hooligan which occur from time to time and it wa report to the constabl on the beat as such the plaster cast wa not worth more than a few shill and the whole affair appear to be too childish for ani particular investig the second case howev wa more seriou and also more singular it occur onli last night in kennington road and within a few hundr yard of mors hudson s shop there live a wellknown medic practition name dr barnicot who ha on of the largest practic upon the south side of the thame hi resid and princip consultingroom is at kennington road but he ha a branch surgeri and dispensari at lower brixton road two mile awai thi dr barnicot is an enthusiast admir of napoleon and hi hous is full of book pictur and relic of the french emperor some littl time ago he purchas from mors hudson two duplic plaster cast of the famou head of napoleon by the french sculptor devin on of these he place in hi hall in the hous at kennington road and the other on the mantelpiec of the surgeri at lower brixton well when dr barnicot came down thi morn he wa astonish to find that hi hous had been burgl dure the night but that noth had been taken save the plaster head from the hall it had been carri out and had been dash savag against the garden wall under which it splinter fragment were discov holm rub hi hand thi is certainli veri novel said he i thought it would pleas you but i have not got to the end yet dr barnicot wa due at hi surgeri at twelv o clock and you can imagin hi amaz when on arriv there he found that the window had been open in the night and that the broken piec of hi second bust were strewn all over the room it had been smash to atom where it stood in neither case were there ani sign which could give us a clue as to the crimin or lunat who had done the mischief now mr holm you have got the fact thei ar singular not to sai grotesqu said holm mai i ask whether the two bust smash in dr barnicot s room were the exact duplic of the on which wa destroi in mors hudson s shop thei were taken from the same mould such a fact must tell against the theori that the man who break them is influenc by ani gener hatr of napoleon consid how mani hundr of statu of the great emperor must exist in london it is too much to suppos such a coincid as that a promiscu iconoclast should chanc to begin upon three specimen of the same bust well i thought as you do said lestrad on the other hand thi mors hudson is the purveyor of bust in that part of london and these three were the onli on which had been in hi shop for year so although as you sai there ar mani hundr of statu in london it is veri probabl that these three were the onli on in that district therefor a local fanat would begin with them what do you think dr watson there ar no limit to the possibl of monomania i answer there is the condit which the modern french psychologist have call the ide fix which mai be trifl in charact and accompani by complet saniti in everi other wai a man who had read deepli about napoleon or who had possibl receiv some hereditari famili injuri through the great war might conceiv form such an ide fix and under it influenc be capabl of ani fantast outrag that won t do my dear watson said holm shake hi head for no amount of ide fix would enabl your interest monomaniac to find out where these bust were situat well how do you explain it i don t attempt to do so i would onli observ that there is a certain method in the gentleman s eccentr proceed for exampl in dr barnicot s hall where a sound might arous the famili the bust wa taken outsid befor be broken wherea in the surgeri where there wa less danger of an alarm it wa smash where it stood the affair seem absurdli trifl and yet i dare call noth trivial when i reflect that some of my most classic case have had the least promis commenc you will rememb watson how the dread busi of the abernetti famili wa first brought to my notic by the depth which the parslei had sunk into the butter upon a hot dai i can t afford therefor to smile at your three broken bust lestrad and i shall be veri much oblig to you if you will let me hear of ani fresh develop of so singular a chain of event the develop for which my friend had ask came in a quicker and an infinit more tragic form than he could have imagin i wa still dress in my bedroom next morn when there wa a tap at the door and holm enter a telegram in hi hand he read it aloud come instantli pitt street kensington lestrad what is it then i ask don t knowmai be anyth but i suspect it is the sequel of the stori of the statu in that case our friend the imagebreak ha begun oper in anoth quarter of london there s coffe on the tabl watson and i have a cab at the door in half an hour we had reach pitt street a quiet littl backwat just besid on of the briskest current of london life no wa on of a row all flatchest respect and most unromant dwell as we drove up we found the rail in front of the hous line by a curiou crowd holm whistl by georg it s attempt murder at the least noth less will hold the london messageboi there s a deed of violenc indic in that fellow s round shoulder and outstretch neck what s thi watson the top step swill down and the other on dry footstep enough anyhow well well there s lestrad at the front window and we shall soon know all about it the offici receiv us with a veri grave face and show us into a sittingroom where an exceedingli unkempt and agit elderli man clad in a flannel dressinggown wa pace up and down he wa introduc to us as the owner of the housemr horac harker of the central press syndic it s the napoleon bust busi again said lestrad you seem interest last night mr holm so i thought perhap you would be glad to be present now that the affair ha taken a veri much graver turn what ha it turn to then to murder mr harker will you tell these gentlemen exactli what ha occur the man in the dressinggown turn upon us with a most melancholi face it s an extraordinari thing said he that all my life i have been collect other peopl s new and now that a real piec of new ha come my own wai i am so confus and bother that i can t put two word togeth if i had come in here as a journalist i should have interview myself and had two column in everi even paper as it is i am give awai valuabl copi by tell my stori over and over to a string of differ peopl and i can make no us of it myself howev i ve heard your name mr sherlock holm and if you ll onli explain thi queer busi i shall be paid for my troubl in tell you the stori holm sat down and listen it all seem to centr round that bust of napoleon which i bought for thi veri room about four month ago i pick it up cheap from hard brother two door from the high street station a great deal of my journalist work is done at night and i often write until the earli morn so it wa todai i wa sit in my den which is at the back of the top of the hous about three o clock when i wa convinc that i heard some sound downstair i listen but thei were not repeat and i conclud that thei came from outsid then suddenli about five minut later there came a most horribl yellth most dread sound mr holm that ever i heard it will ring in my ear as long as i live i sat frozen with horror for a minut or two then i seiz the poker and went downstair when i enter thi room i found the window wide open and i at onc observ that the bust wa gone from the mantelpiec why ani burglar should take such a thing pass my understand for it wa onli a plaster cast and of no real valu whatev you can see for yourself that anyon go out through that open window could reach the front doorstep by take a long stride thi wa clearli what the burglar had done so i went round and open the door step out into the dark i nearli fell over a dead man who wa ly there i ran back for a light and there wa the poor fellow a great gash in hi throat and the whole place swim in blood he lai on hi back hi knee drawn up and hi mouth horribl open i shall see him in my dream i had just time to blow on my policewhistl and then i must have faint for i knew noth more until i found the policeman stand over me in the hall well who wa the murder man ask holm there s noth to show who he wa said lestrad you shall see the bodi at the mortuari but we have made noth of it up to now he is a tall man sunburn veri power not more than thirti he is poorli dress and yet doe not appear to be a labour a hornhandl clasp knife wa ly in a pool of blood besid him whether it wa the weapon which did the deed or whether it belong to the dead man i do not know there wa no name on hi cloth and noth in hi pocket save an appl some string a shill map of london and a photograph here it is it wa evid taken by a snapshot from a small camera it repres an alert sharpfeatur simian man with thick eyebrow and a veri peculiar project of the lower part of the face like the muzzl of a baboon and what becam of the bust ask holm after a care studi of thi pictur we had new of it just befor you came it ha been found in the front garden of an empti hous in campden hous road it wa broken into fragment i am go round now to see it will you come certainli i must just take on look round he examin the carpet and the window the fellow had either veri long leg or wa a most activ man said he with an area beneath it wa no mean feat to reach that window ledg and open that window get back wa compar simpl ar you come with us to see the remain of your bust mr harker the disconsol journalist had seat himself at a writingt i must try and make someth of it said he though i have no doubt that the first edit of the even paper ar out alreadi with full detail it s like my luck you rememb when the stand fell at doncast well i wa the onli journalist in the stand and my journal the onli on that had no account of it for i wa too shaken to write it and now i ll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep as we left the room we heard hi pen travel shrilli over the foolscap the spot where the fragment of the bust had been found wa onli a few hundr yard awai for the first time our ey rest upon thi present of the great emperor which seem to rais such frantic and destruct hatr in the mind of the unknown it lai scatter in splinter shard upon the grass holm pick up sever of them and examin them carefulli i wa convinc from hi intent face and hi purpos manner that at last he wa upon a clue well ask lestrad holm shrug hi shoulder we have a long wai to go yet said he and yetand yetwel we have some suggest fact to act upon the possess of thi trifl bust wa worth more in the ey of thi strang crimin than a human life that is on point then there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the hous or immedi outsid the hous if to break it wa hi sole object he wa rattl and bustl by meet thi other fellow he hardli knew what he wa do well that s like enough but i wish to call your attent veri particularli to the posit of thi hous in the garden of which the bust wa destroi lestrad look about him it wa an empti hous and so he knew that he would not be disturb in the garden ye but there is anoth empti hous farther up the street which he must have pass befor he came to thi on why did he not break it there sinc it is evid that everi yard that he carri it increas the risk of someon meet him i give it up said lestrad holm point to the street lamp abov our head he could see what he wa do here and he could not there that wa hi reason by jove that s true said the detect now that i come to think of it dr barnicot s bust wa broken not far from hi red lamp well mr holm what ar we to do with that fact to rememb itto docket it we mai come on someth later which will bear upon it what step do you propos to take now lestrad the most practic wai of get at it in my opinion is to identifi the dead man there should be no difficulti about that when we have found who he is and who hi associ ar we should have a good start in learn what he wa do in pitt street last night and who it wa who met him and kill him on the doorstep of mr horac harker don t you think so no doubt and yet it is not quit the wai in which i should approach the case what would you do then oh you must not let me influenc you in ani wai i suggest that you go on your line and i on mine we can compar note afterward and each will supplement the other veri good said lestrad if you ar go back to pitt street you might see mr horac harker tell him for me that i have quit made up my mind and that it is certain that a danger homicid lunat with napoleon delus wa in hi hous last night it will be us for hi articl lestrad stare you don t serious believ that holm smile don t i well perhap i don t but i am sure that it will interest mr horac harker and the subscrib of the central press syndic now watson i think that we shall find that we have a long and rather complex dai s work befor us i should be glad lestrad if you could make it conveni to meet us at baker street at six o clock thi even until then i should like to keep thi photograph found in the dead man s pocket it is possibl that i mai have to ask your compani and assist upon a small expedit which will have be undertaken tonight if my chain of reason should prove to be correct until then goodby and good luck sherlock holm and i walk togeth to the high street where we stop at the shop of hard brother whenc the bust had been purchas a young assist inform us that mr hard would be absent until afternoon and that he wa himself a newcom who could give us no inform holm s face show hi disappoint and annoy well well we can t expect to have it all our own wai watson he said at last we must come back in the afternoon if mr hard will not be here until then i am as you have no doubt surmis endeavour to trace these bust to their sourc in order to find if there is not someth peculiar which mai account for their remark fate let us make for mr mors hudson of the kennington road and see if he can throw ani light upon the problem a drive of an hour brought us to the picturedeal s establish he wa a small stout man with a red face and a pepperi manner ye sir on my veri counter sir said he what we pai rate and tax for i don t know when ani ruffian can come in and break on s good ye sir it wa i who sold dr barnicot hi two statu disgrac sir a nihilist plotthat s what i make it no on but an anarchist would go about break statu red republicansthat s what i call em who did i get the statu from i don t see what that ha to do with it well if you realli want to know i got them from gelder co in church street stepnei thei ar a wellknown hous in the trade and have been thi twenti year how mani had i threetwo and on ar threetwo of dr barnicot s and on smash in broad daylight on my own counter do i know that photograph no i don t ye i do though why it s beppo he wa a kind of italian piecework man who made himself us in the shop he could carv a bit and gild and frame and do odd job the fellow left me last week and i ve heard noth of him sinc no i don t know where he came from nor where he went to i had noth against him while he wa here he wa gone two dai befor the bust wa smash well that s all we could reason expect from mors hudson said holm as we emerg from the shop we have thi beppo as a common factor both in kennington and in kensington so that is worth a tenmil drive now watson let us make for gelder co of stepnei the sourc and origin of the bust i shall be surpris if we don t get some help down there in rapid success we pass through the fring of fashion london hotel london theatric london literari london commerci london and final maritim london till we came to a riversid citi of a hundr thousand soul where the tenement hous swelter and reek with the outcast of europ here in a broad thoroughfar onc the abod of wealthi citi merchant we found the sculptur work for which we search outsid wa a consider yard full of monument masonri insid wa a larg room in which fifti worker were carv or mould the manag a big blond german receiv us civilli and gave a clear answer to all holm s question a refer to hi book show that hundr of cast had been taken from a marbl copi of devin s head of napoleon but that the three which had been sent to mors hudson a year or so befor had been half of a batch of six the other three be sent to hard brother of kensington there wa no reason why those six should be differ from ani of the other cast he could suggest no possibl caus why anyon should wish to destroi themin fact he laugh at the idea their wholesal price wa six shill but the retail would get twelv or more the cast wa taken in two mould from each side of the face and then these two profil of plaster of pari were join togeth to make the complet bust the work wa usual done by italian in the room we were in when finish the bust were put on a tabl in the passag to dry and afterward store that wa all he could tell us but the product of the photograph had a remark effect upon the manag hi face flush with anger and hi brow knot over hi blue teuton ey ah the rascal he cri ye inde i know him veri well thi ha alwai been a respect establish and the onli time that we have ever had the polic in it wa over thi veri fellow it wa more than a year ago now he knife anoth italian in the street and then he came to the work with the polic on hi heel and he wa taken here beppo wa hi namehi second name i never knew serv me right for engag a man with such a face but he wa a good workmanon of the best what did he get the man live and he got off with a year i have no doubt he is out now but he ha not dare to show hi nose here we have a cousin of hi here and i daresai he could tell you where he is no no cri holm not a word to the cousinnot a word i beg of you the matter is veri import and the farther i go with it the more import it seem to grow when you refer in your ledger to the sale of those cast i observ that the date wa june rd of last year could you give me the date when beppo wa arrest i could tell you roughli by the paylist the manag answer ye he continu after some turn over of page he wa paid last on mai th thank you said holm i don t think that i need intrud upon your time and patienc ani more with a last word of caution that he should sai noth as to our research we turn our face westward onc more the afternoon wa far advanc befor we were abl to snatch a hasti luncheon at a restaur a newsbil at the entranc announc kensington outrag murder by a madman and the content of the paper show that mr horac harker had got hi account into print after all two column were occupi with a highli sensat and floweri render of the whole incid holm prop it against the cruetstand and read it while he at onc or twice he chuckl thi is all right watson said he listen to thi it is satisfactori to know that there can be no differ of opinion upon thi case sinc mr lestrad on of the most experienc member of the offici forc and mr sherlock holm the well known consult expert have each come to the conclus that the grotesqu seri of incid which have end in so tragic a fashion aris from lunaci rather than from deliber crime no explan save mental aberr can cover the fact the press watson is a most valuabl institut if you onli know how to us it and now if you have quit finish we will hark back to kensington and see what the manag of hard brother ha to sai on the matter the founder of that great emporium prove to be a brisk crisp littl person veri dapper and quick with a clear head and a readi tongu ye sir i have alreadi read the account in the even paper mr horac harker is a custom of our we suppli him with the bust some month ago we order three bust of that sort from gelder co of stepnei thei ar all sold now to whom oh i daresai by consult our sale book we could veri easili tell you ye we have the entri here on to mr harker you see and on to mr josiah brown of laburnum lodg laburnum vale chiswick and on to mr sandeford of lower grove road read no i have never seen thi face which you show me in the photograph you would hardli forget it would you sir for i ve seldom seen an uglier have we ani italian on the staff ye sir we have sever among our workpeopl and cleaner i daresai thei might get a peep at that sale book if thei want to there is no particular reason for keep a watch upon that book well well it s a veri strang busi and i hope that you will let me know if anyth come of your inquiri holm had taken sever note dure mr hard s evid and i could see that he wa thoroughli satisfi by the turn which affair were take he made no remark howev save that unless we hurri we should be late for our appoint with lestrad sure enough when we reach baker street the detect wa alreadi there and we found him pace up and down in a fever of impati hi look of import show that hi dai s work had not been in vain well he ask what luck mr holm we have had a veri busi dai and not entir a wast on my friend explain we have seen both the retail and also the wholesal manufactur i can trace each of the bust now from the begin the bust cri lestrad well well you have your own method mr sherlock holm and it is not for me to sai a word against them but i think i have done a better dai s work than you i have identifi the dead man you don t sai so and found a caus for the crime splendid we have an inspector who make a specialti of saffron hill and the italian quarter well thi dead man had some cathol emblem round hi neck and that along with hi colour made me think he wa from the south inspector hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him hi name is pietro venucci from napl and he is on of the greatest cutthroat in london he is connect with the mafia which as you know is a secret polit societi enforc it decre by murder now you see how the affair begin to clear up the other fellow is probabl an italian also and a member of the mafia he ha broken the rule in some fashion pietro is set upon hi track probabl the photograph we found in hi pocket is the man himself so that he mai not knife the wrong person he dog the fellow he see him enter a hous he wait outsid for him and in the scuffl he receiv hi own deathwound how is that mr sherlock holm holm clap hi hand approvingli excel lestrad excel he cri but i didn t quit follow your explan of the destruct of the bust the bust you never can get those bust out of your head after all that is noth petti larceni six month at the most it is the murder that we ar realli investig and i tell you that i am gather all the thread into my hand and the next stage is a veri simpl on i shall go down with hill to the italian quarter find the man whose photograph we have got and arrest him on the charg of murder will you come with us i think not i fanci we can attain our end in a simpler wai i can t sai for certain becaus it all dependswel it all depend upon a factor which is complet outsid our control but i have great hopesin fact the bet is exactli two to onethat if you will come with us tonight i shall be abl to help you to lai him by the heel in the italian quarter no i fanci chiswick is an address which is more like to find him if you will come with me to chiswick tonight lestrad i ll promis to go to the italian quarter with you tomorrow and no harm will be done by the delai and now i think that a few hour sleep would do us all good for i do not propos to leav befor eleven o clock and it is unlik that we shall be back befor morn you ll dine with us lestrad and then you ar welcom to the sofa until it is time for us to start in the meantim watson i should be glad if you would ring for an express messeng for i have a letter to send and it is import that it should go at onc holm spent the even in rummag among the file of the old daili paper with which on of our lumberroom wa pack when at last he descend it wa with triumph in hi ey but he said noth to either of us as to the result of hi research for my own part i had follow step by step the method by which he had trace the variou wind of thi complex case and though i could not yet perceiv the goal which we would reach i understood clearli that holm expect thi grotesqu crimin to make an attempt upon the two remain bust on of which i rememb wa at chiswick no doubt the object of our journei wa to catch him in the veri act and i could not but admir the cun with which my friend had insert a wrong clue in the even paper so as to give the fellow the idea that he could continu hi scheme with impun i wa not surpris when holm suggest that i should take my revolv with me he had himself pick up the load huntingcrop which wa hi favourit weapon a fourwheel wa at the door at eleven and in it we drove to a spot at the other side of hammersmith bridg here the cabman wa direct to wait a short walk brought us to a seclud road fring with pleasant hous each stand in it own ground in the light of a street lamp we read laburnum villa upon the gatepost of on of them the occup had evid retir to rest for all wa dark save for a fanlight over the hall door which shed a singl blur circl on to the garden path the wooden fenc which separ the ground from the road threw a dens black shadow upon the inner side and here it wa that we crouch i fear that you ll have a long wait holm whisper we mai thank our star that it is not rain i don t think we can even ventur to smoke to pass the time howev it s a two to on chanc that we get someth to pai us for our troubl it prove howev that our vigil wa not to be so long as holm had led us to fear and it end in a veri sudden and singular fashion in an instant without the least sound to warn us of hi come the garden gate swung open and a lith dark figur as swift and activ as an ap rush up the garden path we saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the hous there wa a long paus dure which we held our breath and then a veri gentl creak sound came to our ear the window wa be open the nois ceas and again there wa a long silenc the fellow wa make hi wai into the hous we saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern insid the room what he sought wa evid not there for again we saw the flash through anoth blind and then through anoth let us get to the open window we will nab him as he climb out lestrad whisper but befor we could move the man had emerg again as he came out into the glimmer patch of light we saw that he carri someth white under hi arm he look stealthili all round him the silenc of the desert street reassur him turn hi back upon us he laid down hi burden and the next instant there wa the sound of a sharp tap follow by a clatter and rattl the man wa so intent upon what he wa do that he never heard our step as we stole across the grass plot with the bound of a tiger holm wa on hi back and an instant later lestrad and i had him by either wrist and the handcuff had been fasten as we turn him over i saw a hideou sallow face with writh furiou featur glare up at us and i knew that it wa inde the man of the photograph whom we had secur but it wa not our prison to whom holm wa give hi attent squat on the doorstep he wa engag in most carefulli examin that which the man had brought from the hous it wa a bust of napoleon like the on which we had seen that morn and it had been broken into similar fragment carefulli holm held each separ shard to the light but in no wai did it differ from ani other shatter piec of plaster he had just complet hi examin when the hall light flew up the door open and the owner of the hous a jovial rotund figur in shirt and trouser present himself mr josiah brown i suppos said holm ye sir and you no doubt ar mr sherlock holm i had the note which you sent by the express messeng and i did exactli what you told me we lock everi door on the insid and await develop well i m veri glad to see that you have got the rascal i hope gentlemen that you will come in and have some refresh howev lestrad wa anxiou to get hi man into safe quarter so within a few minut our cab had been summon and we were all four upon our wai to london not a word would our captiv sai but he glare at us from the shadow of hi mat hair and onc when my hand seem within hi reach he snap at it like a hungri wolf we stai long enough at the policest to learn that a search of hi cloth reveal noth save a few shill and a long sheath knife the handl of which bore copiou trace of recent blood that s all right said lestrad as we part hill know all these gentri and he will give a name to him you ll find that my theori of the mafia will work out all right but i m sure i am exceedingli oblig to you mr holm for the workmanlik wai in which you laid hand upon him i don t quit understand it all yet i fear it is rather too late an hour for explan said holm besid there ar on or two detail which ar not finish off and it is on of those case which ar worth work out to the veri end if you will come round onc more to my room at six o clock tomorrow i think i shall be abl to show you that even now you have not grasp the entir mean of thi busi which present some featur which make it absolut origin in the histori of crime if ever i permit you to chronicl ani more of my littl problem watson i forese that you will enliven your page by an account of the singular adventur of the napoleon bust when we met again next even lestrad wa furnish with much inform concern our prison hi name it appear wa beppo second name unknown he wa a wellknown ne erdowel among the italian coloni he had onc been a skil sculptor and had earn an honest live but he had taken to evil cours and had twice alreadi been in jailonc for a petti theft and onc as we had alreadi heard for stab a fellowcountryman he could talk english perfectli well hi reason for destroi the bust were still unknown and he refus to answer ani question upon the subject but the polic had discov that these same bust might veri well have been made by hi own hand sinc he wa engag in thi class of work at the establish of gelder co to all thi inform much of which we alreadi knew holm listen with polit attent but i who knew him so well could clearli see that hi thought were elsewher and i detect a mixtur of mingl uneasi and expect beneath that mask which he wa wont to assum at last he start in hi chair and hi ey brighten there had been a ring at the bell a minut later we heard step upon the stair and an elderli redfac man with grizzl sidewhisk wa usher in in hi right hand he carri an oldfashion carpetbag which he place upon the tabl is mr sherlock holm here my friend bow and smile mr sandeford of read i suppos said he ye sir i fear that i am a littl late but the train were awkward you wrote to me about a bust that is in my

much surpris at your letter for i could not imagin how you knew that i own such a thing of cours you must have been surpris but the explan is veri simpl mr hard of hard brother said that thei had sold you their last copi and he gave me your address oh that wa it wa it did he tell you what i paid for it no he did not well i am an honest man though not a veri rich on i onli gave fifteen shill for the bust and i think you ought to know that befor i take ten pound from you i am sure the scrupl doe you honour mr sandeford but i have name that price so i intend to stick to it well it is veri handsom of you mr holm i brought the bust up with me as you ask me to do here it is he open hi bag and at last we saw place upon our tabl a complet specimen of that bust which we had alreadi seen more than onc in fragment holm took a paper from hi pocket and laid a tenpound note upon the tabl you will kindli sign that paper mr sandeford in the presenc of these wit it is simpli to sai that you transfer everi possibl right that you ever had in the bust to me i am a method man you see and you never know what turn event might take afterward thank you mr sandeford here is your monei and i wish you a veri good even when our visitor had disappear sherlock holm s movement were such as to rivet our attent he began by take a clean white cloth from a drawer and lai it over the tabl then he place hi newli acquir bust in the centr of the cloth final he pick up hi huntingcrop and struck napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the head the figur broke into fragment and holm bent eagerli over the shatter remain next instant with a loud shout of triumph he held up on splinter in which a round dark object wa fix like a plum in a pud gentlemen he cri let me introduc you to the famou black pearl of the borgia lestrad and i sat silent for a moment and then with a spontan impuls we both broke at clap as at the wellwrought crisi of a plai a flush of colour sprang to holm s pale cheek and he bow to us like the master dramatist who receiv the homag of hi audienc it wa at such moment that for an instant he ceas to be a reason machin and betrai hi human love for admir and applaus the same singularli proud and reserv natur which turn awai with disdain from popular notorieti wa capabl of be move to it depth by spontan wonder and prais from a friend ye gentlemen said he it is the most famou pearl now exist in the world and it ha been my good fortun by a connect chain of induct reason to trace it from the princ of colonna s bedroom at the dacr hotel where it wa lost to the interior of thi the last of the six bust of napoleon which were manufactur by gelder co of stepnei you will rememb lestrad the sensat caus by the disappear of thi valuabl jewel and the vain effort of the london polic to recov it i wa myself consult upon the case but i wa unabl to throw ani light upon it suspicion fell upon the maid of the princess who wa an italian and it wa prove that she had a brother in london but we fail to trace ani connect between them the maid s name wa lucretia venucci and there is no doubt in my mind that thi pietro who wa murder two night ago wa the brother i have been look up the date in the old file of the paper and i find that the disappear of the pearl wa exactli two dai befor the arrest of beppo for some crime of violencean event which took place in the factori of gelder co at the veri moment when these bust were be made now you clearli see the sequenc of event though you see them of cours in the invers order to the wai in which thei present themselv to me beppo had the pearl in hi possess he mai have stolen it from pietro he mai have been pietro s confeder he mai have been the gobetween of pietro and hi sister it is of no consequ to us which is the correct solut the main fact is that he had the pearl and at that moment when it wa on hi person he wa pursu by the polic he made for the factori in which he work and he knew that he had onli a few minut in which to conceal thi enorm valuabl prize which would otherwis be found on him when he wa search six plaster cast of napoleon were dry in the passag on of them wa still soft in an instant beppo a skil workman made a small hole in the wet plaster drop in the pearl and with a few touch cover over the apertur onc more it wa an admir hidingplac no on could possibl find it but beppo wa condemn to a year s imprison and in the meanwhil hi six bust were scatter over london he could not tell which contain hi treasur onli by break them could he see even shake would tell him noth for as the plaster wa wet it wa probabl that the pearl would adher to ita in fact it ha done beppo did not despair and he conduct hi search with consider ingenu and persever through a cousin who work with gelder he found out the retail firm who had bought the bust he manag to find employ with mors hudson and in that wai track down three of them the pearl wa not there then with the help of some italian employe he succeed in find out where the other three bust had gone the first wa at harker s there he wa dog by hi confeder who held beppo respons for the loss of the pearl and he stab him in the scuffl which follow if he wa hi confeder why should he carri hi photograph i ask as a mean of trace him if he wish to inquir about him from ani third person that wa the obviou reason well after the murder i calcul that beppo would probabl hurri rather than delai hi movement he would fear that the polic would read hi secret and so he hasten on befor thei should get ahead of him of cours i could not sai that he had not found the pearl in harker s bust i had not even conclud for certain that it wa the pearl but it wa evid to me that he wa look for someth sinc he carri the bust past the other hous in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlook it sinc harker s bust wa on in three the chanc were exactli as i told youtwo to on against the pearl be insid it there remain two bust and it wa obviou that he would go for the london on first i warn the inmat of the hous so as to avoid a second tragedi and we went down with the happiest result by that time of cours i knew for certain that it wa the borgia pearl that we were after the name of the murder man link the on event with the other there onli remain a singl bustth read oneand the pearl must be there i bought it in your presenc from the ownerand there it li we sat in silenc for a moment well said lestrad i ve seen you handl a good mani case mr holm but i don t know that i ever knew a more workmanlik on than that we re not jealou of you at

white to the root of hi hair i have told you everyth sir noth to add noth at all sir well then i must make some suggest to you when you sat down on that chair yesterdai did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room bannist s face wa ghastli no sir certainli not it is onli a suggest said holm suav i frankli admit that i am unabl to prove it but it seem probabl enough sinc the moment that mr soam s back wa turn you releas the man who wa hide in that bedroom bannist lick hi dry lip there wa no man sir ah that s a piti bannist up to now you mai have spoken the truth but now i know that you have li the man s face set in sullen defianc there wa no man sir come come bannist no sir there wa no on in that case you can give us no further inform would you pleas remain in the room stand over there near the bedroom door now soam i am go to ask you to have the great kind to go up to the room of young gilchrist and to ask him to step down into your an instant later the tutor return bring with him the student he wa a fine figur of a man tall lith and agil with a springi step and a pleasant open face hi troubl blue ey glanc at each of us and final rest with an express of blank dismai upon bannist in the farther corner just close the door said holm now mr gilchrist we ar all quit alon here and no on need ever know on word of what pass between us we can be perfectli frank with each other we want to know mr gilchrist how you an honour man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterdai the unfortun young man stagger back and cast a look full of horror and reproach at bannist no no mr gilchrist sir i never said a wordnev on word cri the servant no but you have now said holm now sir you must see that after bannist s word your posit is hopeless and that your onli chanc li in a frank confess for a moment gilchrist with uprais hand tri to control hi writh featur the next he had thrown himself on hi knee besid the tabl and buri hi face in hi hand he had burst into a storm of passion sob come come said holm kindli it is human to err and at least no on can accus you of be a callou crimin perhap it would be easier for you if i were to tell mr soam what occur and you can check me where i am wrong shall i do so well well don t troubl to answer listen and see that i do you no injustic from the moment mr soam that you said to me that no on not even bannist could have told that the paper were in your room the case began to take a definit shape in my mind the printer on could of cours dismiss he could examin the paper in hi own offic the indian i also thought noth of if the proof were in a roll he could not possibl know what thei were on the other hand it seem an unthink coincid that a man should dare to enter the room and that by chanc on that veri dai the paper were on the tabl i dismiss that the man who enter knew that the paper were there how did he know when i approach your room i examin the window you amus me by suppos that i wa contempl the possibl of someon have in broad daylight under the ey of all these opposit room forc himself through it such an idea wa absurd i wa measur how tall a man would need to be in order to see as he pass what paper were on the central tabl i am six feet high and i could do it with an effort no on less than that would have a chanc alreadi you see i had reason to think that if on of your three student wa a man of unusu height he wa the most worth watch of the three i enter and i took you into my confid as to the suggest of the side tabl of the centr tabl i could make noth until in your descript of gilchrist you mention that he wa a longdist jumper then the whole thing came to me in an instant and i onli need certain corrobor proof which i speedili obtain what happen with sic thi thi young fellow had emploi hi afternoon at the athlet ground where he had been practis the jump he return carri hi jumpingsho which ar provid as you ar awar with sever sharp spike as he pass your window he saw by mean of hi great height these proof upon your tabl and conjectur what thei were no harm would have been done had it not been that as he pass your door he perceiv the kei which had been left by the careless of your servant a sudden impuls came over him to enter and see if thei were inde the proof it wa not a danger exploit for he could alwai pretend that he had simpli look in to ask a question well when he saw that thei were inde the proof it wa then that he yield to temptat he put hi shoe on the tabl what wa it you put on that chair near the window glove said the young man holm look triumphantli at bannist he put hi glove on the chair and he took the proof sheet by sheet to copi them he thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him as we know he came back by the side gate suddenli he heard him at the veri door there wa no possibl escap he forgot hi glove but he caught up hi shoe and dart into the bedroom you observ that the scratch on that tabl is slight at on side but deepen in the direct of the bedroom door that in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that direct and that the culprit had taken refug there the earth round the spike had been left on the tabl and a second sampl wa loosen and fell in the bedroom i mai add that i walk out to the athlet ground thi

said soam but why did you chang your purpos gilchrist point to bannist there is the man who set me in the right path said he come now bannist said holm it will be clear to you from what i have said that onli you could have let thi young man out sinc you were left in the room and must have lock the door when you went out as to hi escap by that window it wa incred can you not clear up the last

manuscript volum which contain our work for the year i confess that it is veri difficult for me out of such a wealth of materi to select the case which ar most interest in themselv and at the same time most conduc to a displai of those peculiar power for which my friend wa famou as i turn over the page i see my note upon the repuls stori of the red leech and the terribl death of crosbi the banker here also i find an account of the addleton tragedi and the singular content of the ancient british barrow the famou smithmortim success case come also within thi period and so doe the track and arrest of huret the boulevard assassinan exploit which won for holm an autograph letter of thank from the french presid and the order of the legion of honour each of these would furnish a narr but on the whole i am of opinion that none of them unit so mani singular point of interest as the episod of yoxlei old place which includ not onli the lament death of young willoughbi smith but also those subsequ develop which threw so curiou a light upon the caus of the crime it wa a wild tempestu night toward the close of novemb holm and i sat togeth in silenc all the even he engag with a power len

motiv here s a man deadther s no deni thatbut so far as i can see no reason on earth why anyon should wish him harm holm lit hi cigar and lean back in hi chair let us hear about it said he i ve got my fact pretti clear said stanlei hopkin all i want now is to know what thei all mean the stori so far as i can make it out is like thi some year ago thi countri hous yoxlei old place wa taken by an elderli man who gave the name of professor coram he wa an invalid keep hi bed half the time and the other half hobbl round the hous with a stick or be push about the ground by the garden in a bath chair he wa well like by the few neighbour who call upon him and he ha the reput down there of be a veri learn man hi household us to consist of an elderli housekeep mr marker and of a maid susan tarlton these have both been with him sinc hi arriv and thei seem to be women of excel charact the professor is write a learn book and he found it necessari about a year ago to engag a secretari the first two that he tri were not success but the third mr willoughbi smith a veri young man straight from the univers seem to have been just what hi employ want hi work consist in write all the morn to the professor s dictat and he usual spent the even in hunt up refer and passag which bore upon the next dai s work thi willoughbi smith ha noth against him either as a boi at uppingham or as a young man at cambridg i have seen hi testimoni and from the first he wa a decent quiet hardwork fellow with no weak spot in him at all and yet thi is the lad who ha met hi death thi morn in the professor s studi under circumst which can point onli to murder the wind howl and scream at the window holm and i drew closer to the fire while the young inspector slowli and point by point develop hi singular narr if you were to search all england said he i don t suppos you could find a household more selfcontain or freer from outsid influenc whole week would pass and not on of them go past the garden gate the professor wa buri in hi work and exist for noth els young smith knew nobodi in the neighbourhood and live veri much as hi employ did the two women had noth to take them from the hous mortim the garden who wheel the bath chair is an armi pensioneran old crimean man of excel charact he doe not live in the hous but in a threeroom cottag at the other end of the garden those ar the onli peopl that you would find within the ground of yoxlei old place at the same time the gate of the garden is a hundr yard from the main london to chatham road it open with a latch and there is noth to prevent anyon from walk in now i will give you the evid of susan tarlton who is the onli person who can sai anyth posit about the matter it wa in the forenoon between eleven and twelv she wa engag at the moment in hang some curtain in the upstair front bedroom professor coram wa still in bed for when the weather is bad he seldom rise befor middai the housekeep wa busi with some work in the back of the hous willoughbi smith had been in hi bedroom which he us as a sittingroom but the maid heard him at that moment pass along the passag and descend to the studi immedi below her she did not see him but she sai that she could not be mistaken in hi quick firm tread she did not hear the studi door close but a minut or so later there wa a dread cry in the room below it wa a wild hoars scream so strang and unnatur that it might have come either from a man or a woman at the same instant there wa a heavi thud which shook the old hous and then all wa silenc the maid stood petrifi for a moment and then recov her courag she ran downstair the studi door wa shut and she open it insid young mr willoughbi smith wa stretch upon the floor at first she could see no injuri but as she tri to rais him she saw that blood wa pour from the undersid of hi neck it wa pierc by a veri small but veri deep wound which had divid the carotid arteri the instrument with which the injuri had been inflict lai upon the carpet besid him it wa on of those small sealingwax knive to be found on oldfashion writingt with an ivori handl and a stiff blade it wa part of the fit of the professor s own desk at first the maid thought that young smith wa alreadi dead but on pour some water from the caraf over hi forehead he open hi ey for an instant the professor he murmur it wa she the maid is prepar to swear that those were the exact word he tri desper to sai someth els and he held hi right hand up in the air then he fell back dead in the meantim the housekeep had also arriv upon the scene but she wa just too late to catch the young man s dy word leav susan with the bodi she hurri to the professor s room he wa sit up in bed horribl agit for he had heard enough to convinc him that someth terribl had occur mr marker is prepar to swear that the professor wa still in hi nightcloth and inde it wa imposs for him to dress without the help of mortim whose order were to come at twelv o clock the professor declar that he heard the distant cry but that he know noth more he can give no explan of the young man s last word the professorit wa she but imagin that thei were the outcom of delirium he believ that willoughbi smith had not an enemi in the world and can give no reason for the crime hi first action wa to send mortim the garden for the local polic a littl later the chief constabl sent for me noth wa move befor i got there and strict order were given that no on should walk upon the path lead to the hous it wa a splendid chanc of put your theori into practic mr sherlock holm there wa realli noth want except mr sherlock holm said my companion with a somewhat bitter smile well let us hear about it what sort of a job did you make of it i must ask you first mr holm to glanc at thi rough plan which will give you a gener idea of the posit of the professor s studi and the variou point of the case it will help you in follow my investig he unfold the rough chart which i here reproduc graphic and he laid it across holm s knee i rose and stand behind holm studi it over hi shoulder it is veri rough of cours and it onli deal with the point which seem to me to be essenti all the rest you will see later for yourself now first of all presum that the assassin enter the hous how did he or she come in undoubtedli by the garden path and the back door from which there is direct access to the studi ani other wai would have been exceedingli complic the escap must have also been made along that line for of the two other exit from the room on wa block by susan as she ran downstair and the other lead straight to the professor s bedroom i therefor direct my attent at onc to the garden path which wa satur with recent rain and would certainli show ani footmark my examin show me that i wa deal with a cautiou and expert crimin no footmark were to be found on the path there could be no question howev that someon had pass along the grass border which line the path and that he had done so in order to avoid leav a track i could not find anyth in the natur of a distinct impress but the grass wa trodden down and someon had undoubtedli pass it could onli have been the murder sinc neither the garden nor anyon els had been there that morn and the rain had onli begun dure the night on moment said holm where doe thi path lead to to the road how long is it a hundr yard or so at the point where the path pass through the gate you could sure pick up the track unfortun the path wa tile at that point well on the road itself no it wa all trodden into mire tuttut well then these track upon the grass were thei come or go it wa imposs to sai there wa never ani outlin a larg foot or a small you could not distinguish holm gave an ejacul of impati it ha been pour rain and blow a hurrican ever sinc said he it will be harder to read now than that palimpsest well well it can t be help what did you do hopkin after you had made certain that you had made certain of noth i think i made certain of a good deal mr holm i knew that someon had enter the hous cautious from without i next examin the corridor it is line with cocoanut mat and had taken no impress of ani kind thi brought me into the studi itself it is a scantili furnish room the main articl is a larg writingt with a fix bureau thi bureau consist of a doubl column of drawer with a central small cupboard between them the drawer were open the cupboard lock the drawer it seem were alwai open and noth of valu wa kept in them there were some paper of import in the cupboard but there were no sign that thi had been tamper with and the professor assur me that noth wa miss it is certain that no robberi ha been commit i come now to the bodi of the young man it wa found near the bureau and just to the left of it as mark upon that chart the stab wa on the right side of the neck and from behind forward so that it is almost imposs that it could have been selfinflict unless he fell upon the knife said holm exactli the idea cross my mind but we found the knife some feet awai from the bodi so that seem imposs then of cours there ar the man s own dy word and final there wa thi veri import piec of evid which wa found clasp in the dead man s right hand from hi pocket stanlei hopkin drew a small paper packet he unfold it and disclos a golden pincenez with two broken end of black silk cord dangl from the end of it willoughbi smith had excel sight he ad there can be no question that thi wa snatch from the face or the person of the assassin sherlock holm took the glass into hi hand and examin them with the utmost attent and interest he held them on hi nose endeavour to read through them went to the window and stare up the street with them look at them most minut in the full light of the lamp and final with a chuckl seat himself at the tabl and wrote a few line upon a sheet of paper which he toss across to stanlei hopkin that s the best i can do for you said he it mai prove to be of some us the astonish detect read the note aloud it ran as follow want a woman of good address attir like a ladi she ha a remark thick nose with ey which ar set close upon either side of it she ha a pucker forehead a peer express and probabl round shoulder there ar indic that she ha had recours to an optician at least twice dure the last few month as her glass ar of remark strength and as optician ar not veri numer there should be no difficulti in trace her holm smile at the astonish of hopkin which must have been reflect upon my featur sure my deduct ar simplic itself said he it would be difficult to name ani articl which afford a finer field for infer than a pair of glass especi so remark a pair as these that thei belong to a woman i infer from their delicaci and also of cours from the last word of the dy man as to her be a person of refin and well dress thei ar as you perceiv handsom mount in solid gold and it is inconceiv that anyon who wore such glass could be slatternli in other respect you will find that the clip ar too wide for your nose show that the ladi s nose wa veri broad at the base thi sort of nose is usual a short and coars on but there is a suffici number of except to prevent me from be dogmat or from insist upon thi point in my descript my own face is a narrow on and yet i find that i cannot get my ey into the centr nor near the centr of these glass therefor the ladi s ey ar set veri near to the side of the nose you will perceiv watson that the glass ar concav and of unusu strength a ladi whose vision ha been so extrem contract all her life is sure to have the physic characterist of such vision which ar seen in the forehead the eyelid and the shoulder ye i said i can follow each of your argument i confess howev that i am unabl to understand how you arriv at the doubl visit to the optician holm took the glass in hi hand you will perceiv he said that the clip ar line with tini band of cork to soften the pressur upon the nose on of these is discolour and worn to some slight extent but the other is new evid on ha fallen off and been replac i should judg that the older of them ha not been there more than a few month thei exactli correspond so i gather that the ladi went back to the same establish for the second by georg it s marvel cri hopkin in an ecstasi of admir to think that i had all that evid in my hand and never knew it i had intend howev to go the round of the london optician of cours you would meanwhil have you anyth more to tell us about the case noth mr holm i think that you know as much as i do nowprob more we have had inquiri made as to ani stranger seen on the countri road or at the railwai station we have heard of none what beat me is the utter want of all object in the crime not a ghost of a motiv can anyon suggest ah there i am not in a posit to help you but i suppos you want us to come out tomorrow if it is not ask too much mr holm there s a train from chare cross to chatham at six in the morn and we should be at yoxlei old place between eight and nine then we shall take it your case ha certainli some featur of great interest and i shall be delight to look into it well it s nearli on and we had best get a few hour sleep i daresai you can manag all right on the sofa in front of the fire i ll light my spirit lamp and give you a cup of coffe befor we start the gale had blown itself out next dai but it wa a bitter morn when we start upon our journei we saw the cold winter sun rise over the dreari marsh of the thame and the long sullen reach of the river which i shall ever associ with our pursuit of the andaman island in the earlier dai of our career after a long and weari journei we alight at a small station some mile from chatham while a hors wa be put into a trap at the local inn we snatch a hurri breakfast and so we were all readi for busi when we at last arriv at yoxlei old place a constabl met us at the garden gate well wilson ani new no sirnoth no report of ani stranger seen no sir down at the station thei ar certain that no stranger either came or went yesterdai have you had inquiri made at inn and lodg ye sir there is no on that we cannot account for well it s onli a reason walk to

well i think we have exhaust the path let us go farther thi garden door is usual kept open i suppos then thi visitor had noth to do but to walk in the idea of murder wa not in her mind or she would have provid herself with some sort of weapon instead of have to pick thi knife off the writingt she advanc along thi corridor leav no trace upon the cocoanut mat then she found herself in thi studi how long wa she there we have no mean of judg not more than a few minut sir i forgot to tell you that mr marker the housekeep had been in there tidi not veri long beforeabout a quarter of an hour she

ask me to believ that she walk along a narrow strip of grass without onc make a fals step i remark as you mai rememb that it wa a noteworthi perform in my mind i set it down as an imposs perform save in the unlik case that she had a second pair of glass i wa forc therefor to consid serious the hypothesi that she had remain within the hous on perceiv the similar of the two corridor it becam clear that she might veri easili have made such a mistak and in that case it wa evid that she must have enter the professor s room i wa keenli on the alert therefor for whatev would bear out thi supposit and i examin the room narrowli for anyth in the shape of a hidingplac the carpet seem continu and firmli nail so i dismiss the idea of a trapdoor there might well be a recess behind the book as you ar awar such devic ar common in old librari i observ that book were pile on the floor at all other point but that on bookcas wa left clear thi then might be the door i could see no mark to guid me but the carpet wa of a dun colour which lend itself veri well to examin i therefor smoke a great number of those excel cigarett and i drop the ash all over the space in front of the suspect bookcas it wa a simpl trick but exceedingli effect i then went downstair and i ascertain in your presenc watson without your perceiv the drift of my remark that professor coram s consumpt of food had increaseda on

second link for hi chain we had shaken off lord mountjam and overton had gone to consult with the other member of hi team over the misfortun which had befallen them there wa a telegraphoffic at a short distanc from the hotel we halt outsid it it s worth try watson said holm of cours with a warrant we could demand to see the counterfoil but we have not reach that stage yet i don t suppos thei rememb face in so busi a place let us ventur it i am sorri to troubl you said he in hi blandest manner to the young woman behind the grate there is some small mistak about a telegram i sent yesterdai i have had no answer and i veri much fear that i must have omit to put my name at the end could you tell me if thi wa so the young woman turn over a sheaf of counterfoil what o clock wa it she ask a littl after six whom wa it to holm put hi finger to hi lip and glanc at me the last word in it were for god s sake he whisper confidenti i am veri anxiou at get no answer the young woman separ on of

we must run down to cambridg togeth all the indic seem to me to point in that direct tell me i ask as we rattl up grai s inn road have you ani suspicion yet as to the caus of the disappear i don t think that among all our case i have known on where the motiv ar more obscur sure you don t realli imagin that he mai be kidnap in order to give inform against hi wealthi uncl i confess my dear watson that that doe not appeal to me as a veri probabl explan it struck me howev as be the on which wa most like to interest that exceedingli unpleas old person it certainli did that but what ar your altern i could mention sever you must admit that it is curiou and suggest that thi incid should occur on the ev of thi import match and should involv the onli man whose presenc seem essenti to the success of the side it mai of cours be a coincid but it is interest amateur sport is free from bet but a good deal of outsid bet goe on among the public and it is possibl that it might be worth someon s while to get at a player as the ruffian of the turf get at a racehors there is on explan a second veri obviou on is that thi young man realli is the heir of a great properti howev modest hi mean mai at present be and it is not imposs that a plot to hold him for ransom might be concoct these theori take no account of the telegram quit true watson the telegram still remain the onli solid thing with which we have to deal and we must not permit our attent to wander awai from it it is to gain light upon the purpos of thi telegram that we ar now upon our wai to cambridg the path of our investig is at present obscur but i shall be veri much surpris if befor even we have not clear it up or made a consider advanc along it it wa alreadi dark when we reach the old univers citi holm took a cab at the station

of crime sir thei must have the support of everi reason member of the commun though i cannot doubt that the offici machineri is ampli suffici for the purpos where your call is more open to critic is when you pry into the secret of privat individu when you rake up famili matter which ar better hidden and when you incident wast the time of men who ar more busi than yourself at the present moment for exampl i should be write a treatis instead of convers with you no doubt doctor and yet the convers mai prove more import than the treatis incident i mai tell you that we ar do the revers of what

here it is back again that give a radiu of ten or twelv mile and he doe it onc or sometim twice a dai no unusu thing for a doctor in practic but armstrong is not realli a doctor in practic he is a lectur and a consult but he doe not care for gener practic which distract him from hi literari work why then doe he make these long journei which must be exceedingli irksom to him and who is it that he visit hi coachman my dear watson can you doubt that it wa to him that i first appli i do not know whether it came from hi own innat deprav or from the prompt of hi master but he wa rude enough to set a dog at me neither dog nor man like the look of my stick howev and the matter fell through relat were strain after that and further inquiri out of the question all that i have learn i got from a

hope hi carriag did not imped the passag of my bicycl noth could have been more admir than hi wai of put it i at onc rode past the carriag and keep to the main road i went on for a few mile and then halt in a conveni place to see if the carriag pass there wa no sign of it howev and so it becam evid that it had turn down on of sever side road which i had observ i rode back but again saw noth of the carriag and now as you perceiv it ha return after me of cours i had at the outset no particular reason to connect these journei with the disappear of godfrei staunton and wa onli inclin to investig them on the gener ground that everyth which concern dr armstrong is at present of interest to us but now that i find he keep so keen a lookout upon anyon who mai follow him on these excurs the affair appear more import and i shall not be satisfi until i have made the matter clear we can follow him tomorrow can we it is not so easi as you seem to think you ar not familiar with cambridgeshir sceneri ar you it doe not lend itself to conceal all thi countri that i pass over tonight is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand and the man we ar follow is no fool as he veri

cord with which the ladi had been secur then he carefulli scrutin the broken and frai end where it had snap off when the burglar had drag it down when thi wa pull down the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudli he remark no on could hear it the kitchen stand right at the back of the hous how did the burglar know no on would hear it how dare he pull at a bellrop in that reckless fashion exactli mr holm exactli you put the veri question which i have ask myself again and again there can be no doubt that thi fellow must have known the hous and it habit he must have perfectli understood that the servant would all be in bed at that compar earli hour and that no on could possibl hear a bell ring in the kitchen therefor he must have been in close leagu with on of the servant sure that is evid but there ar eight servant and all of good charact other thing be equal said holm on would suspect the on at whose head the master threw a decant and yet that would involv treacheri toward the mistress to whom thi woman seem devot well well the point is a minor on and when you have randal you will probabl find no difficulti in secur hi accomplic the ladi s stori certainli seem to be corrobor if it need corrobor by everi detail which we see befor us he walk to the french window and threw it open there ar no sign here but the ground is iron hard and on would not expect them i see that these candl in the mantelpiec have been light ye it wa by their light and that of the ladi s bedroom candl that the burglar saw their wai about and what did thei take well thei did not take muchonli half a dozen articl of plate off the sideboard ladi brackenstal think that thei were themselv so disturb by the death of sir eustac that thei did not ransack the hous as thei would otherwis have done no doubt that is true and yet thei drank some wine i understand to steadi their nerv exactli these three glass upon the sideboard have been untouch i suppos ye and the bottl stand as thei left it let us look at it halloa halloa what is thi the three glass were group togeth all of them ting with wine and on of them contain some dreg of beesw the bottl stood near them twothird full and besid it lai a long deepli stain cork it appear and the dust upon the bottl show that it wa no common vintag which the murder had enjoi a chang had come over holm s manner he had lost hi listless express and again i saw an alert light of interest in hi keen deepset ey he rais the cork and examin it minut how did thei draw it he ask hopkin point to a halfopen drawer in it lai some tabl linen and a larg corkscrew did ladi brackenstal sai that screw wa us no you rememb that she wa senseless at the moment when the bottl wa open quit so as a matter of fact that screw wa not us thi bottl wa open by a pocket screw probabl contain in a knife and not more than an inch and a half long if you will examin the top of the cork you will observ that the screw wa driven in three time befor the cork wa extract it ha never been transfix thi long screw would have transfix it and drawn it up with a singl pull when you catch thi fellow you will find that he ha on of these multiplex knive in hi possess excel said hopkin but these glass do puzzl me i confess ladi brackenstal actual saw the three men drink did she not ye she wa clear about that then there is an end of it what more is to be said and yet you must admit that the three glass ar veri remark hopkin what you see noth remark well well let it pass perhap when a man ha special knowledg and special power like my own it rather encourag him to seek a complex explan when a simpler on is at hand of cours it must be a mere chanc about the glass well goodmorn hopkin i don t see that i can be of ani us to you and you appear to have your case veri clear you will let me know when randal is arrest and ani further develop which mai occur i trust that i shall soon have to congratul you upon a success conclus come watson i fanci that we mai emploi ourselv more profit at home dure our return journei i could see by holm s face that he wa much puzzl by someth which he had observ everi now and then by an effort he would throw off the impress and talk as if the matter were clear but then hi doubt would settl down upon him again and hi knit brow and abstract ey would show that hi thought had gone back onc more to the great diningroom of the abbei grang in which thi midnight tragedi had been enact at last by a sudden impuls just as our train wa crawl out of a suburban station he sprang on to the platform and pull me out after him excus me my dear fellow said he as we watch the rear carriag of our train disappear round a curv i am sorri to make you the victim of what mai seem a mere whim but on my life watson i simpli can t leav that case in thi condit everi instinct that i possess cri out against it it s wrongit s all wrongi ll swear that it s wrong and yet the ladi s stori wa complet the maid s corrobor wa suffici the detail wa fairli exact what have i to put up against that three wineglass that is all but if i had not taken thing for grant if i had examin everyth with the care which i should have shown had we approach the case de novo and had no cutanddri stori to warp my mind should i not then have found someth more definit to go upon of cours i should sit down on thi bench watson until a train for chiselhurst arriv and allow me to lai the evid befor you implor you in the first instanc to dismiss from your mind the idea that anyth which the maid or her mistress mai have said must necessarili be true the ladi s charm person must not be permit to warp our judgment sure there ar detail in her stori which if we look at in cold blood would excit our suspicion these burglar made a consider haul at sydenham a fortnight ago some account of them and of their appear wa in the paper and would natur occur to anyon who wish to invent a stori in which imaginari robber should plai a part as a matter of fact burglar who have done a good stroke of busi ar as a rule onli too glad to enjoi the proce in peac and quiet without embark on anoth peril undertak again it is unusu for burglar to oper at so earli an hour it is unusu for burglar to strike a ladi to prevent her scream sinc on would imagin that wa the sure wai to make her scream it is unusu for them to commit murder when their number ar suffici to overpow on man it is unusu for them to be content with a limit plunder when there wa much more within their reach and final i should sai that it wa veri unusu for such men to leav a bottl half empti how do all these unusu strike you watson their cumul effect is certainli consider and yet each of them is quit possibl in itself the most unusu thing of all as it seem to me is that the ladi should be ti to the chair well i am not so clear about that watson for it is evid that thei must either kill her or els secur her in such a wai that she could not give immedi notic of their escap but at ani rate i have shown have i not that there is a certain element of improb about the ladi s stori and now on the top of thi come the incid of the wineglass what about the wineglass can you see them in your mind s ey i see them clearli we ar told that three men drank from them doe that strike you as like why not there wa wine in each glass exactli but there wa beesw onli in on glass you must have notic that fact what doe that suggest to your mind the last glass fill would be most like to contain beesw not at all the bottl wa full of it and it is inconceiv that the first two glass were clear and the third heavili charg with it there ar two possibl explan and onli two on is that after the second glass wa fill the bottl wa violent agit and so the third glass receiv the beesw that doe not appear probabl no no i am sure that i am right what then do you suppos that onli two glass were us and that the dreg of both were pour into a third glass so as to give the fals impress that three peopl had been here in that wai all the beesw would be in the last glass would it not ye i am convinc that thi is so but if i have hit upon the true explan of thi on small phenomenon then in an instant the case rise from the commonplac to the exceedingli remark for it can onli mean that ladi brackenstal and her maid have deliber li to us that not on word of their stori is to be believ that thei have some veri strong reason for cover the real crimin and that we must construct our case for ourselv without ani help from them that is the mission which now li befor us and here watson is the sydenham train the household at the abbei grang were much surpris at our return but sherlock holm find that stanlei hopkin had gone off to report to headquart took possess of the diningroom lock the door upon the insid and devot himself for two hour to on of those minut and labori investig which form the solid basi on which hi brilliant edific of deduct were rear seat in a corner like an interest student who observ the demonstr of hi professor i follow everi step of that remark research the window the curtain the carpet the chair the ropeeach in turn wa minut examin and duli ponder the bodi of the unfortun baronet had been remov and all els remain as we had seen it in the morn final to my astonish holm climb up on to the massiv mantelpiec far abov hi head hung the few inch of red cord which were still attach to the wire for a long time he gaze upward at it and then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rest hi knee upon a wooden bracket on the wall thi brought hi hand within a few inch of the broken end of the rope but it wa not thi so much as the bracket itself which seem to engag hi attent final he sprang down with an ejacul of satisfact it s all right watson said he we have got our caseon of the most remark in our collect but dear me how slowwit i have been and how nearli i have commit the blunder of my lifetim now i think that with a few miss link my chain is almost complet you have got your men man watson man onli on but a veri formid person strong as a lionwit the blow that bent that poker six foot three in height activ as a squirrel dexter with hi finger final remark quickwit for thi whole ingeni stori is of hi concoct ye watson we have come upon the handiwork of a veri remark individu and yet in that bellrop he ha given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt where wa the clue well if you were to pull down a bellrop watson where would you expect it to break sure at the spot where it is attach to the wire why should it break three inch from the top as thi on ha done becaus it is frai there exactli thi end which we can examin is frai he wa cun enough to do that with hi knife but the other end is not frai you could not observ that from here but if you were on the mantelpiec you would see that it is cut clean off without ani mark of frai whatev you can reconstruct what occur the man need the rope he would not tear it down for fear of give the alarm by ring the bell what did he do he sprang up on the mantelpiec could not quit reach it put hi knee on the brackety will see the impress in the dustand so got hi knife to bear upon the cord i could not reach the place by at least three inchesfrom which i infer that he is at least three inch a bigger man than i look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair what is it blood undoubtedli it is blood thi alon put the ladi s stori out of court if she were seat on the chair when the crime wa done how come that mark no no she wa place in the chair after the death of her husband i ll wager that the black dress show a correspond mark to thi we have not yet met our waterloo watson but thi is our marengo for it begin in defeat and end in victori i should like now to have a few word with the nurs theresa we must be wari for a while if we ar to get the inform which we want she wa an interest person thi stern australian nursetaciturn suspici ungraci it took some time befor holm s pleasant manner and frank accept of all that she said thaw her into a correspond amiabl she did not attempt to conceal her hatr for her late employ ye sir it is true that he threw the decant at me i heard him call my mistress a name and i told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there then it wa that he threw it at me he might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonni bird alon he wa forev illtreat her and she too proud to complain she will not even tell me all that he ha done to her she never told me of those mark on her arm that you saw thi morn but i know veri well that thei come from a stab with a hatpin the sly devilgod forgiv me that i should speak of him so now that he is dead but a devil he wa if ever on walk the earth he wa all honei when first we met himonli eighteen month ago and we both feel as if it were eighteen year she had onli just arriv in london ye it wa her first voyagesh had never been from home befor he won her with hi titl and

we ar bound to do someth for friend hopkin just to justifi thi second visit said he i will not quit take him into my confid yet i think our next scene of oper must be the ship offic of the

sydenham but he wa like to be in that morn for instruct if we care to wait for him no mr holm had no desir to see him but would be glad to know more about hi record and charact hi record wa magnific there wa not an offic in the fleet to touch him as to hi charact he wa reliabl on duti but a wild desper fellow off the deck of hi shiphothead excit but loyal honest and kindheart that wa the pith of the inform with which holm left the offic of the adelaidesouthampton compani thenc he drove to scotland yard but instead of enter he sat in hi cab with hi brow drawn down lost in profound thought final he drove round to the chare cross telegraph offic sent off a messag and then at last we made for baker street onc more no i couldn t do it watson said he as we reenter our room onc that warrant wa made out noth on earth would save him onc or twice in my career i feel that i have done more real harm by my discoveri of the crimin than ever he had done by hi crime i have learn caution now and i had rather plai trick with the law of england than with my own conscienc let us know a littl more befor we act befor even we had a visit from inspector stanlei hopkin thing were not go veri well with him i believ that you ar a wizard mr holm i realli do sometim think that you have power that ar not human now how on earth could you know that the stolen silver wa at the bottom of that pond i didn t know it but you told me to examin it you got it then ye i got it i am veri glad if i have help you but you haven t help me you have made the affair far more difficult what sort of burglar ar thei who steal silver and then throw it into the nearest pond it wa certainli rather eccentr behaviour i wa mere go on the idea that if the silver had been taken by person who did not want itwho mere took it for a blind as it werethen thei would natur be anxiou to get rid of it but why should such an idea cross your mind well i thought it wa possibl when thei came out through the french window there wa the pond with on tempt littl hole in the ic right in front of their nose could there be a better hidingplac ah a hidingplacethat is better cri stanlei hopkin ye ye i see it all now it wa earli there were folk upon the road thei were afraid of be seen with the silver so thei sank it in the pond intend to return for it when the coast wa clear excel mr holmesthat is better than your idea of a blind quit so you have got an admir theori i have no doubt that my own idea were quit wild but you must admit that thei have end in discov the silver ye siry it wa all your do but i have had a bad setback a setback ye mr holm the randal gang were arrest in new york thi morn dear me hopkin that is certainli rather against your theori that thei commit a murder in kent last night it is fatal mr holmesabsolut fatal still there ar other gang of three besid the randal or it mai be some new gang of which the polic have never heard quit so it is perfectli possibl what ar you off ye mr holm there is no rest for me until i have got to the bottom of the busi i suppos you have no hint to give me i have given you on which well i suggest a blind but why mr holm why ah that s the question of cours

privat judgment but he ha none he must disclos all or he is a traitor to hi servic in a doubt case i would not put him in so pain a posit and so i reserv my inform until my own mind is clear upon the matter but when will that be the time ha come you will now be present at the last scene of a remark littl drama there wa a sound upon the stair and our door wa open to admit as fine a specimen of manhood as ever pass through it he wa a veri tall young man goldenmoustach blueei with a skin which had been burn by tropic sun and a springi step which show that the huge frame wa as activ as it wa

on her when we part she wa a free woman but i could never again be a free man next time i came back from sea i heard of her marriag well why shouldn t she marri whom she like titl and moneywho could carri them better than she she wa born for all that is beauti and dainti i didn t griev over her marriag i wa not such a selfish hound as that i just rejoic that good luck had come her wai and that she had not thrown herself awai on a penniless sailor that s how i love mari fraser well i never thought to see her again but last voyag i wa promot and the new boat wa not yet launch so i had to wait for a coupl of month with my peopl at sydenham on dai out in a countri lane i met theresa wright her old maid she told me all about her about him about everyth i tell you gentlemen it nearli drove me mad thi drunken hound that he should dare to rais hi hand to her whose boot he wa not worthi to lick i met theresa again then i met mari herselfand met her again then she would meet me no more but the other dai i had a notic that i wa to start on my voyag within a week and i determin that i would see her onc befor i left theresa wa alwai my friend for she love mari and hate thi villain almost as much as i did from her i learn the wai of the hous mari us to sit up read in her own littl room downstair i crept round there last night and scratch at the window at first she would not open to me but in her heart i know that now she love me and she could not leav me in the frosti night she whisper to me to come round to the big front window and i found it open befor me so as to let me into the diningroom again i heard from her own lip thing that made my blood boil and again i curs thi brute who mishandl the woman i love well gentlemen i wa stand with her just insid the window in all innoc as god is my judg when he rush like a madman into the room call her the vilest name that a man could us to a woman and welt her across the face with the stick he had in hi hand i had sprung for the poker and it wa a fair fight between us see here on my arm where hi first blow fell then it wa my turn and i went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin do you think i wa sorri not i it wa hi life or mine but far more than that it wa hi life or her for how could i leav her in the power of thi madman that wa how i kill him wa i wrong well then what would either of you gentlemen have done if you had been in my posit she had scream when he struck her and that brought old theresa down from the room abov there wa a bottl of wine on the sideboard and i open it and pour a littl between mari s lip for she wa half dead with shock then i took a drop myself theresa wa as cool as ic and it wa her plot as much as mine we must make it appear that burglar had done the thing theresa kept on repeat our stori to her mistress while i swarm up and cut the rope of the bell then i lash her in her chair and frai out the end of the rope to make it look natur els thei would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it then i gather up a few plate and pot of silver to carri out the idea of the robberi and there i left them with order to give the alarm when i had a quarter of an hour s start i drop the silver into the pond and made off for sydenham feel that for onc in my life i had done a real good night s work and that s the truth and the whole truth mr holm if it cost me my neck holm smoke for some time in silenc then he cross the room and shook our visitor by the hand that s what i think said he i know that everi word is true for you have hardli said a word which i did not know no on but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bellrop from the bracket and no on but a sailor could have made the knot with which the cord wa fasten to the chair onli onc had thi ladi been brought into contact with sailor and that wa on her voyag and it wa someon of her own class of life sinc she wa try hard to shield him and so show that she love him you see how easi it wa for me to lai my hand upon you when onc i had start upon the right trail i thought the polic never could have seen through our dodg and the polic haven t nor will thei to the best of my belief now look here captain crocker thi is a veri seriou matter though i am will to admit that you act under the most extrem provoc to which ani man could be subject i am not sure that in defenc of your own life your action will not be pronounc legitim howev that is for a british juri to decid meanwhil i have so much sympathi for you that if you choos to disappear in the next twentyfour hour i will promis you that no on will hinder you and then it will all come out certainli it will come out the sailor flush with anger what sort of propos is that to make a man i know enough of law to understand that mari would be held as accomplic do you think i would leav her alon to face the music while i slunk awai no sir let them do their worst upon me but for heaven s sake mr holm find some wai of keep my poor mari out of the court holm for a second time held out hi hand to the sailor i wa onli test you and you ring true everi time well it is a great respons that i take upon myself but i have given hopkin an excel hint and if he can t avail himself of it i can do no more see here captain crocker we ll do thi in due form of law you ar the prison watson you ar a british juri and i never met a man who wa more emin fit to repres on i am the judg now gentleman of the juri you have heard the evid do you find the prison guilti or not guilti not guilti my lord said i vox populi vox dei you ar acquit captain crocker so long as the law doe not find some other victim you ar safe from me come back to thi ladi in a year and mai her futur and your justifi us in the judgment which we have pronounc thi night the adventur of the second stain i had intend the adventur of the abbei grang to be the last of those exploit of my friend mr sherlock holm which i should ever commun to the public thi resolut of mine wa not due to ani lack of materi sinc i have note of mani hundr of case to which i have never allud nor wa it caus by ani wane interest on the part of my reader in the singular person and uniqu method of thi remark man the real reason lai in the reluct which mr holm ha shown to the continu public of hi experi so long as he wa in actual profession practic the record of hi success were of some practic valu to him but sinc he ha definit retir from london and betaken himself to studi and beefarm on the sussex down notorieti ha becom hate to him and he ha peremptorili request that hi wish in thi matter should be strictli observ it wa onli upon my repres to him that i had given a promis that the adventur of the second stain should be publish when the time were ripe and point out to him that it is onli appropri that thi long seri of episod should culmin in the most import intern case which he ha ever been call upon to handl that i at last succeed in obtain hi consent that a carefulli guard account of the incid should at last be laid befor the public if in tell the stori i seem to be somewhat vagu in certain detail the public will readili understand that there is an excel reason for my retic it wa then in a year and even in a decad that shall be nameless that upon on tuesdai morn in autumn we found two visitor of european fame within the wall of our humbl room in baker street the on auster highnos eagleei and domin wa none other than the illustri lord belling twice premier of britain the other dark clearcut and eleg hardli yet of middl ag and endow with everi beauti

from their worn and anxiou face that it wa busi of the most press import which had brought them the premier s thin bluevein hand were clasp tightli over the ivori head of hi umbrella and hi gaunt ascet face look gloomili from holm to me the european secretari pull nervous at hi moustach and fidget with the seal of hi watchchain when i discov my loss mr holm which wa at eight o clock thi morn i at onc inform the prime minist it wa at hi suggest that we have both come to you have you inform the polic no sir said the prime minist with the quick decis manner for which he wa famou we have not done so nor is it possibl that we should do so to inform the polic must in the long run mean to inform the public thi is what we particularli desir to avoid and why sir becaus the document in question is of such immens import that it public might veri easilyi might almost sai probablylead to european complic of the utmost moment it is not too much to sai that peac or war mai hang upon the issu unless it recoveri can be attend with the utmost secreci then it mai as well not be recov at all for all that is aim at by those who have taken it is that it content should be gener known i understand now mr trelawnei hope i should be much oblig if you would tell me exactli the circumst under which thi document disappear that can be done in a veri few word mr holm the letterfor it wa a letter from a foreign potentatewa receiv six dai ago it wa of such import that i have never left it in my safe but have taken it across each even to my hous in whitehal terrac and kept it in my bedroom in a lock

upon thi matter could she have guess no mr holm she could not have guessednor could anyon have guess have you lost ani document befor no sir who is there in england who did know of the exist of thi letter each member of the cabinet wa inform of it yesterdai but the pledg of secreci which attend everi cabinet meet wa increas by the solemn warn which wa given by the prime minist good heaven to think that within a few hour i should myself have lost it hi handsom face wa distort with a spasm of despair and hi hand tore at hi hair for a moment we caught a glimps of the natur man impuls ardent keenli sensit the next the aristocrat mask wa replac and the gentl voic had return besid the member of the cabinet there ar two or possibl three department offici who know of the letter no on els in england mr holm i assur you but abroad i believ that no on abroad ha seen it save the man who wrote it i am well convinc that hi ministersthat the usual offici channel have not been emploi holm consid for some littl time now sir i must ask you more particularli what thi document is and why it disappear should have such moment consequ the two statesmen exchang a quick glanc and the premier s shaggi eyebrow gather in a frown mr holm the envelop is a long thin on of pale blue colour there is a seal of red wax stamp with a crouch lion it is address in larg bold handwrit to i fear sir said holm that interest and inde essenti as these detail ar my inquiri must go more to the root of thing what wa the letter that is a state secret of the utmost import and i fear that i cannot tell you nor do i see that it is necessari if by the aid of the power which you ar said to possess you can find such an envelop as i describ with it enclosur you will have deserv well of your countri and earn ani reward which it li in our power to bestow sherlock holm rose with a smile you ar two of the most busi men in the countri said he and in my own small wai i have also a good mani call upon me i regret exceedingli that i cannot help you in thi matter and ani continu of thi interview would be a wast of time the premier sprang to hi feet with that quick fierc gleam of hi deepset ey befor which a cabinet ha cower i am not accustom sir he began but master hi anger and resum hi seat for a minut or more we all sat in silenc then the old statesman shrug hi shoulder we must accept your term mr holm no doubt you ar right and it is unreason for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entir confid i agre with you said the younger statesman then i will tell you reli entir upon your honour and that of your colleagu dr watson i mai appeal to your patriot also for i could not imagin a greater misfortun for the countri than that thi affair should come out you mai safe trust us the letter then is from a certain foreign potent who ha been ruffl by some recent coloni develop of thi countri it ha been written hurriedli and upon hi own respons entir inquiri have shown that hi minist know noth of the matter at the same time it is couch in so unfortun a manner and certain phrase in it ar of so provoc a charact that it public would undoubtedli lead to a most danger state of feel in thi countri there would be such a ferment sir that i do not hesit to sai that within a week of the public of that letter thi countri would be involv in a great war holm wrote a name upon a slip of paper and hand it to the premier exactli it wa he and it is thi letterthi letter which mai well mean the expenditur of a thousand million and the live of a hundr thousand menwhich ha becom lost in thi unaccount fashion have you inform the sender ye sir a cipher telegram ha been despatch perhap he desir the public of the letter no sir we have strong reason to believ that he alreadi understand that he ha act in an indiscreet and hothead manner it would be a greater blow to him and to hi countri than to us if thi letter were to come out if thi is so whose interest is it that the letter should come out why should anyon desir to steal it or to publish it there mr holm you take me into region of high intern polit but if you consid the european situat you will have no difficulti in perceiv the motiv the whole of europ is an arm camp there is a doubl leagu which make a fair balanc of militari power great britain hold the scale if britain were driven into war with on confederaci it would assur the supremaci of the other confederaci whether thei join in the war or not do you follow veri clearli it is then the interest of the enemi of thi potent to secur and publish thi letter so as to make a breach between hi countri and our ye sir and to whom would thi document be sent if it fell into the hand of an enemi to ani of the great chancelleri of europ it is probabl speed on it wai thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it mr trelawnei hope drop hi head on hi chest and groan aloud the premier place hi hand kindli upon hi shoulder it is your misfortun my dear fellow no on can blame you there is no precaut which you have neglect now mr holm you ar in full possess of the fact what cours do you recommend holm shook hi head mournfulli you think sir that unless thi document is recov there will be war i think it is veri probabl then sir prepar for war that is a hard sai mr holm consid the fact sir it is inconceiv that it wa taken after eleventhirti at night sinc i understand that mr hope and hi wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss wa found out it wa taken then yesterdai even between seventhirti and eleventhirti probabl near the earlier hour sinc whoever took it evid knew that it wa there and would natur secur it as earli as possibl now sir if a document of thi import were taken at that hour where can it be now no on ha ani reason to retain it it ha been pass rapidli on to those who need it what chanc have we now to overtak or even to trace it it is beyond our reach the prime minist rose from the sette what you sai is perfectli logic mr holm i feel that the matter is inde out of our hand let us presum for argument s sake that the document wa taken by the maid or by the valet thei ar both old and tri servant i understand you to sai that your room is on the second floor that there is no entranc from without and that from within no on could go up unobserv it must then be somebodi in the hous who ha taken it to whom would the thief take it to on of sever intern spi and secret agent whose name ar toler familiar to me there ar three who mai be said to be the head of their profess i will begin my research by go round and find if each of them is at hi post if on is missingespeci if he ha disappear sinc last nightw will have some indic as to where the document ha gone why should he be miss ask the european secretari he would take the letter to an embassi in london as like as not i fanci not these agent work independ and their relat with the embassi ar often strain the prime minist nod hi acquiesc i believ you ar right mr holm he would take so valuabl a prize to headquart with hi own hand i think that your cours of action is an excel on meanwhil hope we cannot neglect all our other duti on

violin sank into reveri devour sandwich at irregular hour and hardli answer the casual question which i put to him it wa evid to me that thing were not go well with him or hi quest he would sai noth of the case and it wa from the paper that i learn the particular of the inquest and the arrest with the subsequ releas of john mitton the valet of the deceas the coron s juri brought in the obviou wil murder but the parti remain as unknown as ever no motiv wa suggest the room wa full of articl of valu but none had been taken the dead man s paper had not been tamper with thei were carefulli examin and show that he wa a keen student of intern polit an indefatig gossip a remark linguist and an untir letter writer he had been on intim term with the lead politician of sever countri but noth sensat wa discov among the document which fill hi drawer as to hi relat with women thei appear to have been promiscu but superfici he had mani acquaint among them but few friend and no on whom he love hi habit were regular hi conduct inoffens hi death wa an absolut mysteri and like to remain so as to the arrest of john mitton the valet it wa a council of despair as an altern to absolut inact but no case could be sustain against him he had visit friend in hammersmith that night the alibi wa complet it is true that he start home at an hour which should have brought him to westminst befor the time when the crime wa discov but hi own explan that he had walk part of the wai seem probabl enough in view of the fine of the night he had actual arriv at twelv o clock and appear to be overwhelm by the unexpect tragedi he had alwai been on good term with hi master sever of the dead man s possessionsnot a small case of razorshad been found in the valet s box but he explain that thei had been present from the deceas and the housekeep wa abl to corrobor the stori mitton had been in luca s employ for three year it wa notic that luca did not take mitton on the contin with him sometim he visit pari for three month on end but mitton wa left in charg of the godolphin street hous as to the housekeep she had heard noth on the night of the crime if her master had a visitor he had himself admit him so for three morn the mysteri remain so far as i could follow it in the paper if holm knew more he kept hi own counsel but as he told me that inspector lestrad had taken him into hi confid in the case i knew that he wa in close touch with everi develop upon the fourth dai there appear a long telegram from pari which seem to solv the whole question a discoveri ha just been made by the parisian polic said the daili telegraph which rais the veil which hung round the tragic fate of mr eduardo luca who met hi death by violenc last mondai night at godolphin street westminst our reader will rememb that the deceas gentleman wa found stab in hi room and that some suspicion attach to hi valet but that the case broke down on an alibi yesterdai a ladi who ha been known as mme henri fournay occupi a small villa in the rue austerlitz wa report to the author by her servant as be insan an examin show she had inde develop mania of a danger and perman form on inquiri the polic have discov that mme henri fournay onli return from a journei to london on tuesdai last and there is evid to connect her with the crime at westminst a comparison of photograph ha prove conclus that m henri fournay and eduardo luca were realli on and the same person and that the deceas had for some reason live a doubl life in london and pari mme fournay who is of creol origin is of an extrem excit natur and ha suffer in the past from attack of jealousi which have amount to frenzi it is conjectur that it wa in on of these that she commit the terribl crime which ha caus such a sensat in london her movement upon the mondai night have not yet been trace but it is undoubt that a woman answer to her descript attract much attent at chare cross station on tuesdai morn by the wild of her appear and the violenc of her gestur it is probabl therefor that the crime wa either commit when insan or that it immedi effect wa to drive the unhappi woman out of her mind at present she is unabl to give ani coher account of the past and the doctor hold out no hope of the reestablish of her reason there is evid that a woman who might have been mme fournay wa seen for some hour upon mondai night watch the hous in godolphin street what do you think of that holm i had read the account aloud to him while he finish hi breakfast my dear watson said he as he rose from the tabl and pace up and down the room you ar most longsuff but if i have told you noth in the last three dai it is becaus there is noth to tell even now thi report from pari doe not help us much sure it is final as regard the man s death the man s death is a mere incidenta trivial episodein comparison with our real task which is to trace thi document and save a european catastroph onli on import thing ha happen in the last three dai and that is that noth ha happen i get report almost hourli from the govern and it is certain that nowher in europ is there ani sign of troubl now if thi letter were looseno it can t be loosebut if it isn t loos where can it be who ha it why is it held back that s the question that beat in my brain like a hammer wa it inde a coincid that luca should meet hi death on the night when the letter disappear did the letter ever reach him if so why is it not among hi paper did thi mad wife of hi carri it off with her if so is it in her hous in pari how could i search for it without the french polic have their suspicion arous it is a case my dear watson where the law is as danger to us as the crimin ar everi man s hand is against us and yet the interest at stake ar coloss should i bring it to a success conclus it will
