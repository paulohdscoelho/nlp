the green dragon in st paul churchyard transcrib note on the etext thi etext wa prepar from the pelican classic edit of leviathan which in turn wa prepar from the first edit i have tri to follow as close as possibl the origin and to give the flavour of the text that hobb himself proofread but the follow differ were unavoid hobb us capit and ital veri extens for emphasi for proper name for quotat and sometim it seem just becaus the origin ha veri extens margin note which ar us to show where he introduc the definit of word and concept to give in short the subject that a paragraph or section is deal with and to give refer to hi quotat larg but not exclus biblic to some degre these margin note seem to have been intend to serv in place of an index the origin have none thei ar all in ital he also us ital for word in other languag than english and there ar a number of greek word in the greek alphabet in the text to deal with these within the limit of plain vanilla ascii i have done the follow in thi etext i have restrict my us of full capit to those place where hobb us it except in the chapter head which i have fulli capit where hobb us a mixtur of full capit and ital where it is clear that the ital ar to indic the text is quot i have introduc quotat mark within quotat mark i have retain the capit that hobb us where ital seem to be us for emphasi or for proper name or just becaus i have capit the initi letter of the word thi ha the disadvantag that thei ar not then distinguish from those that hobb capit in plain text but the extent of hi ital would make the text veri ugli if i wa to us an underscor or slash where the margin note ar either to introduc the paragraph subject or to show where he introduc word definit i have includ them as header to the paragraph again with all word have initi capit and on a shorten line for margin refer to quot i have includ them in the text in bracket immedi next to the quotat where hobb includ refer in the main text i have left them as he put them except to chang hi squar bracket to round for the greek alphabet i have simpli substitut the nearest ordinari letter that i can and i have us initi capit for foreign languag word neither thoma hobb nor hi typesett seem to have had mani inhibit about spell and punctuat i have tri to reproduc both exactli with the except of the introduct of quotat mark in prepar the text i have

but of men consequ whereunto those person that for the most part can give no other proof of be wise take great delight to shew what thei think thei have read in men by uncharit censur of on anoth behind their back but there is anoth sai not of late understood by which thei might learn truli to read on anoth if thei would take the pain and that is nosc teipsum read thy self which wa not meant as it is now us to counten either the barbar state of men in power toward their inferior or to encourag men of low degre to a sawci behaviour toward their better but to teach us that for the similitud of the thought and passion of on man to the thought and passion of anoth whosoev looketh into himself and considereth what he doth when he doe think opin reason hope fear c and upon what ground he shall therebi read and know what ar the thought and passion of all other men upon the like occas i sai the similitud of passion which ar the same in all men desir fear hope c not the similitud or the object of the passion which ar the thing desir fear hope c for these the constitut individual and particular educ do so vari and thei ar so easi to be kept from our knowledg that the charact of man heart blot and confound as thei ar with dissembl ly counterfeit and erron doctrin ar legibl on to him that searcheth heart and though by men action wee do discov their designe sometim yet to do it without compar them with our own and distinguish all circumst by which the case mai come to be alter is to decyph without a kei and be for the most part deceiv by too much trust or by too much diffid as he that read is himself a good or evil man but let on man read anoth by hi action never so perfectli it serv him on with hi acquaint which ar but few he that is to govern a whole nation must read in himself not thi or that particular man but mankind which though it be hard to do harder than to learn ani languag or scienc yet when i shall have set down my own read orderli and perspicu the pain left anoth will be on to consid if he also find not the same in himself for thi kind of doctrin admitteth no other demonstr part of man chapter i of sens concern the thought of man i will consid them first singli and afterward in trayn or depend upon on anoth singli thei ar everi on a represent or appar of some qualiti or other accid of a bodi without us which is commonli call an object which object worketh on the ey ear and other part of man bodi and by divers of work produceth divers of appar the original of them all is that which we call sens for there is no concept in a man mind which hath not at first total or by part been begotten upon the organ of sens the rest ar deriv from that original to know the natural caus of sens is not veri necessari to the busi now in hand and i have elswher written of the same at larg nevertheless to fill each part of my present method i will briefli deliv the same in thi place the caus of sens is the external bodi or object which presseth the organ proper to each sens either immediatli as in the tast and touch or mediat as in see hear and smell which pressur by the mediat of nerv and other string and membran of the bodi continu inward to the brain and heart causeth there a resist or counterpressur or endeavour of the heart to deliv it self which endeavour becaus outward seemeth to be some matter without and thi seem or fanci is that which men call sens and consisteth as to the ey in a light or colour figur to the ear in a sound to the nostril in an odour to the tongu and palat in a savour and to the rest of the bodi in heat cold hardness softness and such other qualiti as we discern by feel all which qualiti call sensibl ar in the object that causeth them but so mani sever motion of the matter by which it presseth our organ diversli neither in us that ar press ar thei anyth el but diver motion for motion produceth noth but motion but their appar to us is fanci the same wake that dream and as press rub or strike the ey make us fanci a light and press the ear produceth a dinn so do the bodi also we see or hear produc the same by their strong though unobserv action for if those colour and sound were in the bodi or object that caus them thei could not bee sever from them as by glass and in eccho by reflect wee see thei ar where we know the thing we see is in on place the appar in anoth and though at some certain distanc the reall and veri object seem invest with the fanci it beget in us yet still the object is on thing the imag or fanci is anoth so that sens in all case is noth el but original fanci caus as i have said by the pressur that is by the motion of external thing upon our ey ear and other organ thereunto ordain but the philosophyschool through all the univers of christendom ground upon certain text of aristotl teach anoth doctrin and sai for the caus of vision that the thing seen sendeth forth on everi side a visibl speciesin english a visibl shew apparit or aspect or a be seen the receiv whereof into the ey is see and for the caus of hear that the thing heard sendeth forth an audibl speci that is an audibl aspect or audibl be seen which entr at the ear maketh hear nai for the caus of understand also thei sai the thing understood sendeth forth intellig speci that is an intellig be seen which com into the understand make us understand i sai not thi as disapprov the us of univers but becaus i am to speak hereaft of their offic in a commonwealth i must let you see on all occas by the wai what thing would be amend in them amongst which the frequenc of insignific speech is on chapter ii of imagin that when a thing li still unless somewhat el stirr it it will lye still for ever is a truth that no man doubt of but that when a thing is in motion it will etern be in motion unless somewhat el stai it though the reason be the same name that noth can chang it self is not so easili assent to for men measur not on other men but all other thing by themselv and becaus thei find themselv subject after motion to pain and lassitud think everi thing el grow weari of motion and seek repos of it own accord littl consid whether it be not some other motion wherein that desir of rest thei find in themselv consisteth from henc it is that the school sai heavi bodi fall downward out of an appetit to rest and to conserv their natur in that place which is most proper for them ascrib appetit and knowledg of what is good for their conserv which is more than man ha to thing inanim absurdli when a bodi is onc in motion it moveth unless someth el hinder it etern and whatsoev hindreth it cannot in an instant but in time and by degre quit extinguish it and as wee see in the water though the wind ceas the wave give not over rowl for a long time after so also it happeneth in that motion which is made in the internal part of a man then when he see dream c for after the object is remov or the ey shut wee still retain an imag of the thing seen though more obscur than when we see it and thi is it that latin call imagin from the imag made in see and appli the same though improperli to all the other sens but the greek call it fanci which signifi appar and is as proper to on sens as to anoth imagin therefor is noth but decai sens and is found in men and mani other live creatur as well sleep as wake memori the decai of sens in men wake is not the decai of the motion made in sens but an obscur of it in such manner as the light of the sun obscureth the light of the starr which starr do no less exercis their vertu by which thei ar visibl in the dai than in the night but becaus amongst mani stroak which our ey ear and other organ receiv from external bodi the predomin on is sensibl therefor the light of the sun be predomin we ar not affect with the action of the starr and ani object be remov from our ey though the impress it made in us remain yet other object more present succeed and work on us the imagin of the past is obscur and made weak as the voyc of a man is in the noys of the dai from whenc it followeth that the longer the time is after the sight or sens of ani object the weaker is the imagin for the continual chang of man bodi destroy in time the part which in sens were move so that the distanc of time and of place hath on and the same effect in us for as at a distanc of place that which wee look at appear dimm and without distinct of the smaller part and as voyc grow weak and inarticul so also after great distanc of time our imagin of the past is weak and wee lose for exampl of citi wee have seen mani particular street and of action mani particular circumst thi decai sens when wee would express the thing it self i mean fanci it self wee call imagin as i said befor but when we would express the decai and signifi that the sens is fade old and past it is call memori so that imagin and memori ar but on thing which for diver consider hath diver name much memori or memori of mani thing is call experi again imagin be onli of those thing which have been formerli perceiv by sens either all at onc or by part at several time the former which is the imagin the whole object as it wa present to the sens is simpl imagin as when on imagineth a man or hors which he hath seen befor the other is compound as when from the sight of a man at on time and of a hors at anoth we conceiv in our mind a centaur so when a man compoundeth the imag of hi own person with the imag of the action of an other man as when a man imagin himself a hercul or an alexand which happeneth often to them that ar much taken with read of romant it is a compound imagin and properli but a fiction of the mind there be also other imagin that rise in men though wake from the great impress made in sens as from gaze upon the sun the impress leav an imag of the sun befor our ey a long time after and from be long and vehement attent upon geometrical figur a man shall in the dark though awak have the imag of line and angl befor hi ey which kind of fanci hath no particular name as be a thing that doth not commonli fall into men discours dream the imagin of them that sleep ar those we call dream and these also as all other imagin have been befor either total or by parcel in the sens and becaus in sens the brain and nerv which ar the necessari organ of sens ar so benum in sleep as not easili to be move by the action of external object there can happen in sleep no imagin and therefor no dream but what proce from the agit of the inward part of man bodi which inward part for the connexion thei have with the brayn and other organ when thei be distemp do keep the same in motion wherebi the imagin there formerli made appear as if a man were wake save that the organ of sens be now benum so as there is no new object which can master and obscur them with a more vigor impress a dream must need be more clear in thi silenc of sens than ar our wake thought and henc it cometh to pass that it is a hard matter and by mani thought imposs to distinguish exactli between sens and dream for my part when i consid that in dream i do not often nor constantli think of the same person place object and action that i do wake nor rememb so long a trayn of coher thought dream as at other time and becaus wake i often observ the absurd of dream but never dream of the absurd of my wake thought i am well satisfi that be awak i know i dream not though when i dream i think my self awak and see dream ar caus by the distemp of some of the inward part of the bodi diver distemp must need caus differ dream and henc it is that ly cold breedeth dream of fear and raiseth the thought and imag of some fearful object the motion from the brain to the inner part and from the inner part to the brain be reciprocal and that as anger causeth heat in some part of the bodi when we ar awak so when we sleep the over heat of the same part causeth anger and raiseth up in the brain the imagin of an enemi in the same manner as natural kind when we ar awak causeth desir and desir make heat in certain other part of the bodi so also too much heat in those part while wee sleep raiseth in the brain an imagin of some kind shewn in summ our dream ar the revers of our wake imagin the motion when we ar awak begin at on end and when we dream at anoth apparit or vision the most difficult discern of a man dream from hi wake thought is then when by some accid we observ not that we have slept which is easi to happen to a man full of fearful thought and whose conscienc is much troubl and that sleepeth without the circumst of go to bed or put off hi cloth as on that noddeth in a chayr for he that taketh pain and industri lay himself to sleep in case ani uncouth and exorbit fanci come unto him cannot easili think it other than a dream we read of marcu brute on that had hi life given him by juliu caesar and wa also hi favorit and notwithstand murther him how at phillipi the night befor he gave battel to augustu caesar he saw a fearful apparit which is commonli relat by historian as a vision but consid the circumst on mai easili judg to have been but a short dream for sit in hi tent pensiv and troubl with the horrour of hi rash act it wa not hard for him slumber in the cold to dream of that which most affright him which fear as by degre it made him wake so also it must need make the apparit by degre to vanish and have no assur that he slept he could have no caus to think it a dream or ani thing but a vision and thi is no veri rare accid for even thei that be perfectli awak if thei be timor and supperstiti possess with fearful tale and alon in the dark ar subject to the like fanci and believ thei see spirit and dead men ghost walk in churchyard wherea it is either their fanci on or el the knaveri of such person as make us of such superstiti fear to pass disguis in the night to place thei would not be known to haunt from thi ignor of how to distinguish dream and other strong fanci from vision and sens did aris the greatest part of the religion of the gentil in time past that worship satyr fawn nymph and the like and now aday the opinion than rude peopl have of fayri ghost and goblin and of the power of witch for as for witch i think not that their witch craft is ani reall power but yet that thei ar justli punish for the fals belief thei have that thei can do such mischief joyn with their purpos to do it if thei can their trade be neerer to a new religion than to a craft or scienc and for fayri and walk ghost the opinion of them ha i think been on purpos either taught or not confut to keep in credit the us of exorcism of cross of holi water and other such invent of ghostli men nevertheless there is no doubt but god can make unnatural apparit but that he doe it so often as men need to fear such thing more than thei fear the stai or chang of the cours of natur which he also can stai and chang is no point of christian faith but evil men under pretext that god can do ani thing ar so bold as to sai ani thing when it serv their turn though thei think it untru it is the part of a wise man to believ them no further than right reason make that which thei sai appear credibl if thi superstiti fear of spirit were taken awai and with it prognostiqu from dream fals propheci and mani other thing depend thereon by which crafti ambiti person abus the simpl peopl men would be much more fit than thei ar for civil obedi and thi ought to be the work of the school but thei rather nourish such doctrin for not know what imagin or the sens ar what thei receiv thei teach some sai that imagin rise of themselv and have no caus other that thei rise most commonli from the will and that good thought ar blown inspir into a man by god and evil thought by the divel or that good thought ar powr infus into a man by god and evil on by the divel some sai the sens receiv the speci of thing and deliv them to the commonsens and the common sens deliv them over to the fanci and the fanci to the memori and the memori to the judgement like hand of thing from on to anoth with mani word make noth understood understand the imagin that is rays in man or ani other creatur indu with the faculti of imagin by word or other voluntari sign is that we gener call understand and is common to man and beast for a dogg by custom will understand the call or the rate of hi master and so will mani other beast that understand which is peculiar to man is the understand not on hi will but hi concept and thought by the sequel and contextur of the name of thing into affirm negat and other form of speech and of thi kind of understand i shall speak hereaft chapter iii of the consequ or trayn of imagin by consequ or trayn of thought i understand that success of on thought to anoth which is call to distinguish it from discours in word mental discours when a man thinketh on ani thing whatsoev hi next thought after is not altogeth so casual as it seem to be not everi thought to everi thought succe indiffer but as wee have no imagin whereof we have not formerli had sens in whole or in part so we have no transit from on imagin to anoth whereof we never had the like befor in our sens the reason whereof is thi all fanci ar motion within us reliqu of those made in the sens and those motion that immedi succeed on anoth in the sens continu also togeth after sens in so much as the former com again to take place and be praedomin the later followeth by coher of the matter move is such manner as water upon a plain tabl is drawn which wai ani on part of it is guid by the finger but becaus in sens to on and the same thing perceiv sometim on thing sometim anoth succeedeth it come to pass in time that in the imagin of ani thing there is no certainti what we shall imagin next on thi is certain it shall be someth that succeed the same befor at on time or anoth trayn of thought unguid thi trayn of thought or mental discours is of two sort the first is unguid without designe and inconst wherein there is no passion thought to govern and direct those that follow to it self as the end and scope of some desir or other passion in which case the thought ar said to wander and seem impertin on to anoth as in a dream such ar commonli the thought of men that ar not on without compani but also without care of ani thing though even then their thought ar as busi as at other time but without harmoni as the sound which a lute out of tune would yeeld to ani man or in tune to on that could not plai and yet in thi wild rang of the mind a man mai ofttim perceiv the wai of it and the depend of on thought upon anoth for in a discours of our present civil warr what could seem more impertin than to ask as on did what wa the valu of a roman penni yet the cohaer to me wa manifest enough for the thought of the warr introduc the thought of the deliv up the king to hi enemi the thought of that brought in the thought of the deliv up of christ and that again the thought of the penc which wa the price of that treason and thenc easili follow that malici question and all thi in a moment of time for thought is quick trayn of thought regul the second is more constant as be regul by some desir and designe for the impress made by such thing as wee desir or fear is strong and perman or if it ceas for a time of quick return so strong it is sometim as to hinder and break our sleep from desir ariseth the thought of some mean we have seen produc the like of that which we aym at and from the thought of that the thought of mean to that mean and so continu till we come to some begin within our own power and becaus the end by the greatness of the impress come often to mind in case our thought begin to wander thei ar quickli again reduc into the wai which observ by on of the seven wise men made him give men thi praecept which is now worn out respic finem that is to sai in all your action look often upon what you would have as the thing that direct all your thought in the wai to attain it remembr the trayn of regul thought is of two kind on when of an effect imagin wee seek the caus or mean that produc it and thi is common to man and beast the other is when imagin ani thing whatsoev wee seek all the possibl effect that can by it be produc that is to sai we imagin what we can do with it when wee have it of which i have not at ani time seen ani sign but in man on for thi is a curios hardli incid to the natur of ani live creatur that ha no other passion but sensual such as ar hunger thirst lust and anger in summ the discours of the mind when it is govern by designe is noth but seek or the faculti of invent which the latin call sagacita and solertia a hunt out of the caus of some effect present or past or of the effect of some present or past caus sometim a man seek what he hath lost and from that place and time wherein hee miss it hi mind run back from place to place and time to time to find where and when he had it that is to sai to find some certain and limit time and place in which to begin a method of seek again from thenc hi thought run over the same place and time to find what action or other occas might make him lose it thi we call remembr or call to mind the latin call it reminiscentia as it were a recon of our former action sometim a man know a place determin within the compass whereof hi is to seek and then hi thought run over all the part thereof in the same manner as on would sweep a room to find a jewel or as a spaniel rang the field till he find a sent or as a man should run over the alphabet to start a rime prudenc sometim a man desir to know the event of an action and then he thinketh of some like action past and the event thereof on after anoth suppos like event will follow like action as he that forese what wil becom of a crimin recon what he ha seen follow on the like crime befor have thi order of thought the crime the offic the prison the judg and the gallow which kind of thought is call foresight and prudenc or provid and sometim wisdom though such conjectur through the difficulti of observ all circumst be veri fallaci but thi is certain by how much on man ha more experi of thing past than anoth by so much also he is more prudent and hi expect the seldom fail him the present on ha a be in natur thing past have a be in the memori on but thing to come have no be at all the futur be but a fiction of the mind appli the sequel of action past to the action that ar present which with most certainti is done by him that ha most experi but not with certainti enough and though it be call prudenc when the event answereth our expect yet in it own natur it is but presumpt for the foresight of thing to come which is provid belong on to him by whose will thei ar to come from him on and supernatur proce propheci the best prophet natur is the best guesser and the best guesser he that is most vers and studi in the matter he guess at for he hath most sign to guess by sign a sign is the event anteced of the consequ and contrarili the consequ of the anteced when the like consequ have been observ befor and the oftner thei have been observ the less uncertain is the sign and therefor he that ha most experi in ani kind of business ha most sign wherebi to guess at the futur time and consequ is the most prudent and so much more prudent than he that is new in that kind of busi as not to be equal by ani advantag of natural and extemporari wit though perhap mani young men think the contrari nevertheless it is not prudenc that distinguisheth man from beast there be beast that at a year old observ more and pursu that which is for their good more prudent than a child can do at ten conjectur of the time past as prudenc is a praesumt of the futur contract from the experi of time past so there is a praesumt of thing past taken from other thing not futur but past also for he that hath seen by what cours and degre a flourish state hath first come into civil warr and then to ruin upon the sight of the ruin of ani other state will guess the like warr and the like cours have been there also but hi conjectur ha the same incertainti almost with the conjectur of the futur both be ground on upon experi there is no other act of man mind that i can rememb natur plant in him so as to need no other thing to the exercis of it but to be born a man and live with the us of hi five sens those other faculti of which i shall speak by and by and which seem proper to man on ar acquir and encreas by studi and industri and of most men learn by instruct and disciplin and proce all from the invent of word and speech for besid sens and thought and the trayn of thought the mind of man ha no other motion though by the help of speech and method the same faculty mai be improv to such a height as to distinguish men from all other live creatur whatsoev we imagin is finit therefor there is no idea or concept of anyth we call infinit no man can have in hi mind an imag of infinit magnitud nor conceiv the end and bound of the thing name have no concept of the thing but of our own inabl and therefor the name of god is us not to make us conceiv him for he is incomprehens and hi greatness and power ar unconceiv but that we mai honour him also becaus whatsoev as i said befor we conceiv ha been perceiv first by sens either all at onc or by part a man can have no thought repres ani thing not subject to sens no man therefor can conceiv ani thing but he must conceiv it in some place and indu with some determin magnitud and which mai be divid into part nor that ani thing is all in thi place and all in anoth place at the same time nor that two or more thing can be in on and the same place at onc for none of these thing ever have or can be incid to sens but ar absurd speech taken upon credit without ani signif at all from deceiv philosoph and deceiv or deceiv schoolemen chapter iv of speech original of speech the invent of print though ingeni compar with the invent of letter is no great matter but who wa the first that found the us of letter is not known he that first brought them into greec men sai wa cadmu the sonn of agenor king of phaenicia a profit invent for continu the memori of time past and the conjunct of mankind dispers into so mani and distant region of the earth and with all difficult as proceed from a watchful observ of the diver motion of the tongu palat lip and other organ of speech wherebi to make as mani differ of charact to rememb them but the most nobl and profit invent of all other wa that of speech consist of name or apel and their connexion wherebi men regist their thought recal them when thei ar past and also declar them on to anoth for mutual util and convers without which there had been amongst men neither commonwealth nor societi nor contract nor peac no more than amongst lyon bear and wolv the first author of speech wa god himself that instruct adam how to name such creatur as he present to hi sight for the scriptur goeth no further in thi matter but thi wa suffici to direct him to add more name as the experi and us of the creatur should give him occas and to joyn them in such manner by degre as to make himself understood and so by success of time so much languag might be gotten as he had found us for though not so copiou as an orat or philosoph ha need of for i do not find ani thing in the scriptur out of which directli or by consequ can be gather that adam wa taught the name of all figur number measur colour sound fanci relat much less the name of word and speech as general special affirm neg interrog opt infinit all which ar useful and least of all of entiti intention quidditi and other signific word of the school but all thi languag gotten and augment by adam and hi poster wa again lost at the tower of babel when by the hand of god everi man wa stricken for hi rebellion with an oblivion of hi former languag and be herebi forc to dispers themselv into several part of the world it must need be that the divers of tongu that now is proceed by degre from them in such manner as need the mother of all invent taught them and in tract of time grew everi where more copiou the us of speech the general us of speech is to transferr our mental discours into verbal or the trayn of our thought into a trayn of word and that for two commod whereof on is the registr of the consequ of our thought which be apt to slip out of our memori and put us to a new labour mai again be recal by such word as thei were mark by so that the first us of name is to serv for mark or note of remembr anoth is when mani us the same word to signifi by their connexion and order on to anoth what thei conceiv or think of each matter and also what thei desir fear or have ani other passion for and for thi us thei ar call sign special us of speech ar these first to regist what by cogit wee find to be the caus of ani thing present or past and what we find thing present or past mai produc or effect which in summ is acquir of art secondli to shew to other that knowledg which we have attain which is to counsel and teach on anoth thirdli to make known to other our will and purpos that we mai have the mutual help of on anoth fourthli to pleas and delight our selv and other by plai with our word for pleasur or ornament innoc abus of speech to these us there ar also four correspond abus first when men regist their thought wrong by the inconst of the signif of their word by which thei regist for their concept that which thei never conceiv and so deceiv themselv secondli when thei us word metaphor that is in other sens than that thei ar ordain for and therebi deceiv other thirdli when by word thei declar that to be their will which is not fourthli when thei us them to griev on anoth for see natur hath arm live creatur some with teeth some with horn and some with hand to griev an enemi it is but an abus of speech to griev him with the tongu unless it be on whom wee ar oblig to govern and then it is not to griev but to correct and amend the manner how speech serveth to the remembr of the consequ of caus and effect consisteth in the impos of name and the connexion of them name proper common universal of name some ar proper and singular to on on thing as peter john thi man thi tree and some ar common to mani thing as man hors tree everi of which though but on name is nevertheless the name of diver particular thing in respect of all which togeth it is call an universal there be noth in the world universal but name for the thing name ar everi on of them individu and singular on universal name is impos on mani thing for their similitud in some qualiti or other accid and wherea a proper name bringeth to mind on thing on univers recal ani on of those mani and of name universal some ar of more and some of less extent the larger comprehend the less larg and some again of equal extent comprehend each other reciproc as for exampl the name bodi is of larger signif than the word man and conprehendeth it and the name man and rational ar of equal extent comprehend mutual on anoth but here wee must take notic that by a name is not alway understood as in grammar on on word but sometim by circumlocut mani word togeth for all these word hee that in hi action observeth the law of hi countri make but on name equival to thi on word just by thi imposit of name some of larger some of stricter signif we turn the reckon of the consequ of thing imagin in the mind into a reckon of the consequ of appel for exampl a man that hath no us of speech at all such as is born and remain perfectli deaf and dumb if he set befor hi ey a triangl and by it two right angl such as ar the corner of a squar figur he mai by medit compar and find that the three angl of that triangl ar equal to those two right angl that stand by it but if anoth triangl be shewn him differ in shape from the former he cannot know without a new labour whether the three angl of that also be equal to the same but he that hath the us of word when he observ that such equal wa consequ not to the length of the side nor to ani other particular thing in hi triangl but on to thi that the side were straight and the angl three and that that wa all for which he name it a triangl will boldli conclud univers that such equal of angl is in all triangl whatsoev and regist hi invent in these general term everi triangl hath it three angl equal to two right angl and thu the consequ found in on particular come to be registr and remembr as a universal rule and discharg our mental reckon of time and place and deliv us from all labour of the mind save the first and make that which wa found true here and now to be true in all time and place but the us of word in registr our thought is in noth so evid as in number a natural fool that could never learn by heart the order of numeral word as on two and three mai observ everi stroak of the clock and nod to it or sai on on on but can never know what hour it strike and it seem there wa a time when those name of number were not in us and men were fayn to appli their finger of on or both hand to those thing thei desir to keep account of and that thenc it proceed that now our numeral word ar but ten in ani nation and in some but five and then thei begin again and he that can tell ten if he recit them out of order will lose himself and not know when he ha done much less will he be abl to add and substract and perform all other oper of arithmetiqu so that without word there is no possibl of reckon of number much less of magnitud of swiftness of forc and other thing the reckon whereof ar necessari to the be or wellb of mankind when two name ar joyn togeth into a consequ or affirm as thu a man is a live creatur or thu if he be a man he is a live creatur if the later name live creatur signifi all that the former name man signifieth then the affirm or consequ is true otherwis fals for true and fals ar attribut of speech not of thing and where speech in not there is neither truth nor falshood errour there mai be as when wee expect that which shall not be or suspect what ha not been but in neither case can a man be charg with untruth see then that truth consisteth in the right order of name in our affirm a man that seeketh precis truth had need to rememb what everi name he us stand for and to place it accordingli or el he will find himself entangl in word as a bird in limetwigg the more he struggl the more belim and therefor in geometri which is the on scienc that it hath pleas god hitherto to bestow on mankind men begin at settl the signif of their word which settl of signif thei call definit and place them in the begin of their reckon by thi it appear how necessari it is for ani man that aspir to true knowledg to examin the definit of former author and either to correct them where thei ar neglig set down or to make them himself for the errour of definit multipli themselv accord as the reckon proce and lead men into absurd which at last thei see but cannot avoyd without reckon anew from the begin in which lye the foundat of their errour from whenc it happen that thei which trust to book do as thei that cast up mani littl summ into a greater without consid whether those littl summ were rightli cast up or not and at last find the errour visibl and not mistrust their first ground know not which wai to cleer themselv but spend time in flutter over their book as bird that entr by the chimnei and find themselv inclos in a chamber flitter at the fals light of a glass window for want of wit to consid which wai thei came in so that in the right definit of name lye the first us of speech which is the acquisit of scienc and in wrong or no definit lye the first abus from which proce all fals and sensless tenet which make those men that take their instruct from the author of book and not from their own medit to be as much below the condit of ignor men as men endu with true scienc ar abov it for between true scienc and erron doctrin ignor is in the middl natural sens and imagin ar not subject to absurd natur it self cannot err and as men abound in copiousness of languag so thei becom more wise or more mad than ordinari nor is it possibl without letter for ani man to becom either excel wise or unless hi memori be hurt by diseas or ill constitut of organ excel foolish for word ar wise men counter thei do but reckon by them but thei ar the moni of fool that valu them by the author of an aristotl a cicero or a thoma or ani other doctor whatsoev if but a man subject to name subject to name is whatsoev can enter into or be consid in an account and be ad on to anoth to make a summ or substract on from anoth and leav a remaind the latin call account of moni ration and account ratiocinatio and that which we in bill or book of account call item thei call nomina that is name and thenc it seem to proce that thei extend the word ratio to the faculti of reckon in all other thing the greek have but on word logo for both speech and reason not that thei thought there wa no speech without reason but no reason without speech and the act of reason thei call syllogism which signifieth sum up of the consequ of on sai to anoth and becaus the same thing mai enter into account for diver accid their name ar to shew that divers diversli wrest and diversifi thi divers of name mai be reduc to four general head first a thing mai enter into account for matter or bodi as live sensibl rational hot cold move quiet with all which name the word matter or bodi is understood all such be name of matter secondli it mai enter into account or be consid for some accid or qualiti which we conceiv to be in it as for be move for be so long for be hot c and then of the name of the thing it self by a littl chang or wrest wee make a name for that accid which we consid and for live put into account life for move motion for hot heat for long length and the like and all such name ar the name of the accid and properti by which on matter and bodi is distinguish from anoth these ar call name abstract becaus sever not from matter but from the account of matter thirdli we bring into account the properti of our own bodi wherebi we make such distinct as when ani thing is seen by us we reckon not the thing it self but the sight the colour the idea of it in the fanci and when ani thing is heard wee reckon it not but the hear or sound on which is our fanci or concept of it by the ear and such ar name of fanci fourthli we bring into account consid and give name to name themselv and to speech for general universal special oequivocal ar name of name and affirm interrog command narrat syllogism sermon orat and mani other such ar name of speech us of name posit and thi is all the varieti of name posit which ar put to mark somewhat which is in natur or mai be feign by the mind of man as bodi that ar or mai be conceiv to be or of bodi the properti that ar or mai be feign to be or word and speech neg name with their us there be also other name call neg which ar note to signifi that a word is not the name of the thing in question as these word noth no man infinit indoc three want four and the like which ar nevertheless of us in reckon or in correct of reckon and call to mind our past cogit though thei be not name of ani thing becaus thei make us refus to admit of name not rightli us word insignific all other name ar but insignific sound and those of two sort on when thei ar new and yet their mean not explain by definit whereof there have been abound coyn by schoolemen and pusl philosoph anoth when men make a name of two name whose signif ar contradictori and inconsist as thi name an incorporeal bodi or which is all on an incorporeal substanc and a great number more for whensoev ani affirm is fals the two name of which it is compos put togeth and made on signifi noth at all for exampl if it be a fals affirm to sai a quadrangl is round the word round quadrangl signifi noth but is a meer sound so likewis if it be fals to sai that vertu can be powr or blown up and down the word inpowr vertu inblown vertu ar as absurd and insignific as a round quadrangl and therefor you shall hardli meet with a senseless and insignific word that is not made up of some latin or greek name a frenchman seldom hear our saviour call by the name of parol but by the name of verb often yet verb and parol differ no more but that on is latin the other french understand when a man upon the hear of ani speech hath those thought which the word of that speech and their connexion were ordain and constitut to signifi then he is said to understand it understand be noth el but concept caus by speech and therefor if speech be peculiar to man as for ought i know it is then is understand peculiar to him also and therefor of absurd and fals affirm in case thei be universal there can be no understand though mani think thei understand then when thei do but repeat the word softli or con them in their mind what kind of speech signifi the appetit avers and passion of man mind and of their us and abus i shall speak when i have spoken of the passion inconst name the name of such thing as affect us that is which pleas and displeas us becaus all men be not alik affect with the same thing nor the same man at all time ar in the common discours of men of inconst signif for see all name ar impos to signifi our concept and all our affect ar but concept when we conceiv the same thing differ we can hardli avoyd differ name of them for though the natur of that we conceiv be the same yet the divers of our recept of it in respect of differ constitut of bodi and prejudic of opinion give everyth a tinctur of our differ passion and therefor in reason a man bust take heed of word which besid the signif of what we imagin of their natur disposit and interest of the speaker such as ar the name of vertu and vice for on man calleth wisdom what anoth calleth fear and on cruelti what anoth justic on prodig what anoth magnanim on graviti what anoth stupid c and therefor such name can never be true ground of ani ratiocin no more can metaphor and trope of speech but these ar less danger becaus thei profess their inconst which the other do not chapter v of reason and scienc reason what it is when a man reasoneth hee doe noth el but conceiv a summ total from addit of parcel or conceiv a remaind from substract of on summ from anoth which if it be done by word is conceiv of the consequ of the name of all the part to the name of the whole or from the name of the whole and on part to the name of the other part and though in some thing as in number besid ad and substract men name other oper as multipli and divid yet thei ar the same for multipl is but addit togeth of thing equal and divis but substract of on thing as often as we can these oper ar not incid to number on but to all manner of thing that can be ad togeth and taken on out of anoth for as arithmetician teach to add and substract in number so the geometrician teach the same in line figur solid and superficial angl proport time degre of swiftness forc power and the like the logician teach the same in consequ of word ad togeth two name to make an affirm and two affirm to make a syllogism and mani syllogism to make a demonstr and from the summ or conclus of a syllogism thei substract on proposit to find the other writer of politiqu add togeth paction to find men duti and lawyer law and fact to find what is right and wrong in the action of privat men in summ in what matter soever there is place for addit and substract there also is place for reason and where these have no place there reason ha noth at all to do reason defin out of all which we mai defin that is to sai determin what that is which is meant by thi word reason when wee reckon it amongst the faculti of the mind for reason in thi sens is noth but reckon that is ad and substract of the consequ of general name agre upon for the mark and signifi of our thought i sai mark them when we reckon by our selv and signifi when we demonstr or approv our reckon to other men right reason where and as in arithmetiqu unpractis men must and professor themselv mai often err and cast up fals so also in ani other subject of reason the ablest most attent and most practis men mai deceiv themselv and inferr fals conclus not but that reason it self is alwai right reason as well as arithmetiqu is a certain and infal art but no on man reason nor the reason of ani on number of men make the certainti no more than an account is therefor well cast up becaus a great mani men have unanim approv it and therfor as when there is a controversi in an account the parti must by their own accord set up for right reason the reason of some arbitr or judg to whose sentenc thei will both stand or their controversi must either come to blow or be undecid for want of a right reason constitut by natur so is it also in all debat of what kind soever and when men that think themselv wiser than all other clamor and demand right reason for judg yet seek no more but that thing should be determin by no other men reason but their own it is as intoler in the societi of men as it is in plai after trump is turn to us for trump on everi occas that suit whereof thei have most in their hand for thei do noth el that will have everi of their passion as it come to bear swai in them to be taken for right reason and that in their own controversi bewrai their want of right reason by the claym thei lai to it the us of reason the us and end of reason is not the find of the summ and truth of on or a few consequ remot from the first definit and settl signif of name but to begin at these and proce from on consequ to anoth for there can be no certainti of the last conclus without a certainti of all those affirm and negat on which it wa ground and infer as when a master of a famili in take an account casteth up the summ of all the bill of expenc into on sum and not regard how each bill is sum up by those that give them in account nor what it is he pay for he advantag himself no more than if he allow the account in gross trust to everi of the account skill and honesti so also in reason of all other thing he that take up conclus on the trust of author and doth not fetch them from the first item in everi reckon which ar the signif of name settl by definit lose hi labour and doe not know ani thing but on beleeveth of error and absurd when a man reckon without the us of word which mai be done in particular thing as when upon the sight of ani on thing wee conjectur what wa like to have preced or is like to follow upon it if that which he thought like to follow follow not or that which he thought like to have preced it hath not preced it thi is call error to which even the most prudent men ar subject but when we reason in word of general signif and fall upon a general infer which is fals though it be commonli call error it is inde an absurd or senseless speech for error is but a decept in presum that somewhat is past or to come of which though it were not past or not to come yet there wa no imposs discover but when we make a general assert unless it be a true on the possibl of it is unconceiv and word wherebi we conceiv noth but the sound ar those we call absurd insignific and nonsens and therefor if a man should talk to me of a round quadrangl or accid of bread in chees or immateri substanc or of a free subject a free will or ani free but free from be hindr by opposit i should not sai he were in an errour but that hi word were without mean that is to sai absurd i have said befor in the second chapter that a man did excel all other anim in thi faculti that when he conceiv ani thing whatsoev he wa apt to enquir the consequ of it and what effect he could do with it and now i add thi other degre of the same excel that he can by word reduc the consequ he find to general rule call theorem or aphorism that is he can reason or reckon not on in number but in all other thing whereof on mai be ad unto or substract from anoth but thi priviledg is allai by anoth and that is by the priviledg of absurd to which no live creatur is subject but man on and of men those ar of all most subject to it that profess philosophi for it is most true that cicero sayth of them somewher that there can be noth so absurd but mai be found in the book of philosoph and the reason is manifest for there is not on of them that begin hi ratiocin from the definit or explic of the name thei ar to us which is a method that hath been us on in geometri whose conclus have therebi been made indisput caus of absurditi the first caus of absurd conclus i ascrib to the want of method in that thei begin not their ratiocin from definit that is from settl signif of their word as if thei could cast account without know the valu of the numeral word on two and three and wherea all bodi enter into account upon diver consider which i have mention in the preced chapter these consider be diversli name diver absurd proce from the confus and unfit connexion of their name into assert and therefor the second caus of absurd assert i ascrib to the give of name of bodi to accid or of accid to bodi as thei do that sai faith is infus or inspir when noth can be powr or breath into ani thing but bodi and that extens is bodi that phantasm ar spirit c the third i ascrib to the give of the name of the accid of bodi without us to the accid of our own bodi as thei do that sai the colour is in the bodi the sound is in the ayr c the fourth to the give of the name of bodi to name or speech as thei do that sai that there be thing universal that a live creatur is genu or a general thing c the fifth to the give of the name of accid to name and speech as thei do that sai the natur of a thing is in it definit a man command is hi will and the like the sixth to the us of metaphor trope and other rhetorical figur in stead of word proper for though it be lawful to sai for exampl in common speech the wai goeth or leadeth hither or thither the proverb say thi or that wherea way cannot go nor proverb speak yet in reckon and seek of truth such speech ar not to be admit the seventh to name that signifi noth but ar taken up and learn by rote from the school as hypostat transubstanti consubstanti eternalnow and the like cant of schoolemen to him that can avoyd these thing it is not easi to fall into ani absurd unless it be by the length of an account wherein he mai perhap forget what went befor for all men by natur reason alik and well when thei have good principl for who is so stupid as both to mistak in geometri and also to persist in it when anoth detect hi error to him scienc by thi it appear that reason is not as sens and memori born with us nor gotten by experi on as prudenc is but attayn by industri first in apt impos of name and secondli by get a good and orderli method in proceed from the element which ar name to assert made by connexion of on of them to anoth and so to syllogism which ar the connexion of on assert to anoth till we come to a knowledg of all the consequ of name appertain to the subject in hand and that is it men call scienc and wherea sens and memori ar but knowledg of fact which is a thing past and irrevoc scienc is the knowledg of consequ and depend of on fact upon anoth by which out of that we can present do we know how to do someth el when we will or the like anoth time becaus when we see how ani thing come about upon what caus and by what manner when the like caus come into our power wee see how to make it produc the like effect children therefor ar not endu with reason at all till thei have attain the us of speech but ar call reason creatur for the possibl appar of have the us of reason in time to come and the most part of men though thei have the us of reason a littl wai as in numbr to some degre yet it serv them to littl us in common life in which thei govern themselv some better some wors accord to their differ of experi quickness of memori and inclin to several end but special accord to good or evil fortun and the error of on anoth for as for scienc or certain rule of their action thei ar so farr from it that thei know not what it is geometri thei have thought conjur but for other scienc thei who have not been taught the begin and some progress in them that thei mai see how thei be acquir and gener ar in thi point like children that have no thought of gener ar made believ by the women that their brother and sister ar not born but found in the garden but yet thei that have no scienc ar in better and nobler condit with their natural prudenc than men that by misreason or by trust them that reason wrong fall upon fals and absurd general rule for ignor of caus and of rule doe not set men so farr out of their wai as reli on fals rule and take for caus of what thei aspir to those that ar not so but rather caus of the contrari to conclud the light of human mind is perspicu word but by exact definit first snuf and purg from ambigu reason is the pace

end content and sedit or contempt prudenc sapienc with their differ as much experi is prudenc so is much scienc sapienc for though wee usual have on name of wisedom for them both yet the latin did alwai distinguish between prudentia and sapientia ascrib the former to experi the later to scienc but to make their differ appear more cleerli let us suppos on man endu with an excel natural us and dexter in handl hi arm and anoth to have ad to that dexter an acquir scienc of where he can offend or be offend by hi adversari in everi possibl postur or guard the abil of the former would be to the abil of the later as prudenc to sapienc both useful but the later infal but thei that trust on to the author of book follow the blind blindli ar like him that trust to the fals rule of the master of

natur judgement and be guid by general sentenc read in author and subject to mani except is a sign of folli and gener scorn by the name of pedantri and even of those men themselv that in councel of

an immobl or contumaci of the heart in resist the action of certain thing and proceed from that the heart is alreadi move otherwis by either more potent object or from want of experi of them and

confid begetteth attempt wherea the suppos of power doe not and is therefor rightli call vain deject grief from opinion of want of power is call deject of mind the vaineglori which consisteth in the feign or suppos of abil in ourselv which we know ar not is most incid to young men and nourish by the histori or fiction of gallant person and is correct often time by ag and employ sudden glori laughter sudden glori is the passion which maketh those grimac call laughter and is caus either by some sudden act of their own that pleaseth them or by the apprehens of some deform thing in anoth by comparison whereof thei suddenli applaud themselv and it is incid most to them that ar consciou of the fewest abil in themselv who ar forc to keep themselv in their own favour by observ the imperfect of other men and therefor much laughter at the defect of other is a sign of pusillanim for of great mind on of the proper work is to help and free other from scorn and compar themselv on with the most abl sudden deject weep on the contrari sudden deject is the passion that causeth weep and is caus by such accid as suddenli take awai some vehement hope or some prop of their power and thei ar most subject to it that reli princip on help external such as ar women and children therefor some weep for the loss of friend other for their unkindness other for the sudden stop made to their thought of reveng by reconcili but in all case both laughter and weep ar sudden motion custom take them both awai for no man laugh at old jest or weep for an old calam shame blush grief for the discoveri of some defect of abil is shame or the passion that discovereth itself in blush and consisteth in the apprehens of some thing dishonour and in young men is a sign of the love of good reput and commend in old men it is a sign of the same but becaus it come too late not commend impud the contempt of good reput is call impud pitti grief for the calam of anoth is pitti and ariseth from the imagin that the like calam mai befal himself and therefor is call also compass and in the phrase of thi present time a fellowfeel and therefor for calam arriv from great wicked the best men have the least pitti and for the same calam those have least pitti that think themselv least obnoxi to the same cruelti contempt or littl sens of the calam of other is that which men call cruelti proceed from secur of their own fortun for that ani man should take pleasur in other men great harm without other end of hi own i do not conceiv it possibl emul envi grief for the success of a competitor in wealth honour or other good if it be joyn with endeavour to enforc our own abil to equal or exce him is call emul but joyn with endeavour to supplant or hinder a competitor envi deliber when in the mind of man appetit and avers hope and fear concern on and the same thing aris altern and diver good and evil consequ of the do or omit the thing propound come success into our thought so that sometim we have an appetit to it sometim an avers from it sometim hope to be abl to do it sometim despair or fear to attempt it the whole sum of desir avers hope and fear continu till the thing be either done or thought imposs is that we call deliber therefor of thing past there is no deliber becaus manifestli imposs to be chang nor of thing known to be imposs or thought so becaus men know or think such deliber vain but of thing imposs which we think possibl we mai deliber not know it is in vain and it is call deliber becaus it is a put an end to the liberti we had of do or omit accord to our own appetit or avers thi altern success of appetit avers hope and fear is no less in other live creatur than in man and therefor beast also deliber everi deliber is then sayd to end when that whereof thei deliber is either done or thought imposs becaus till then wee retain the liberti of do or omit accord to our appetit or avers the will in deliber the last appetit or avers immedi adhaer to the action or to the omiss thereof is that wee call the will the act not the faculti of will and beast that have deliber must necessarili also have will the definit of the will given commonli by the school that it is a rational appetit is not good for if it were then could there be no voluntari act against reason for a voluntari act is that which proceedeth from the will and no other but if in stead of a rational appetit we shall sai an appetit result from a preced deliber then the definit is the same that i have given here will therefor is the last appetit in deliber and though we sai in common discours a man had a will onc to do a thing that nevertheless he forbor to do yet that is properli but an inclin which make no action voluntari becaus the action depend not of it but of the last inclin or appetit for if the interveni appetit make ani action voluntari then by the same reason all interveni avers should make the same action involuntari and so on and the same action should be both voluntari involuntari by thi it is manifest that not on action that have their begin from covet ambit lust or other appetit to the thing propound but also those that have their begin from avers or fear of those consequ that follow the omiss ar voluntari action form of speech in passion the form of speech by which the passion ar express ar partli the same and partli differ from those by which we express our thought and first gener all passion mai be express indic as i love i fear i joi i deliber i will i command but some of them have particular express by themselv which nevertheless ar not affirm unless it be when thei serv to make other infer besid that of the passion thei proce from deliber is express subjunct which is a speech proper to signifi supposit with their consequ as if thi be done then thi will follow and differ not from the languag of reason save that reason is in general word but deliber for the most part is of particular the languag of desir and avers is imper as do thi forbear that which when the parti is oblig to do or forbear is command otherwis prayer or el counsel the languag of vaineglori of indign pitti and reveng opt but of the desir to know there is a peculiar express call interrog as what is it when shall it how is it done and why so other languag of the passion i find none for curs swear revil and the like do not signifi as speech but as the action of a tongu accustom these form of speech i sai ar express or voluntari signif of our passion but certain sign thei be not becaus thei mai be us arbitrarili whether thei that us them have such passion or not the best sign of passion present ar either in the counten motion of the bodi action and end or aim which we otherwis know the man to have good and evil appar and becaus in deliber the appetit and avers ar rais by foresight of the good and evil consequ and sequel of the action whereof we deliber the good or evil effect thereof dependeth on the foresight of a long chain of consequ of which veri seldom ani man is abl to see to the end but for so far as a man seeth if the good in those consequ be greater than the evil the whole chain is that which writer call appar or seem good and contrarili when the evil exceedeth the good the whole is appar or seem evil so that he who hath by experi or reason the greatest and surest prospect of consequ deliber best himself and is abl when he will to give the best counsel unto other felic continu success in obtain those thing which a man from time to time desireth that is to sai continu prosper is that men call felic i mean the felic of thi life for there is no such thing as perpetu tranquil of mind while we live here becaus life itself is but motion and can never be without desir nor without fear no more than without sens what kind of felic god hath ordain to them that devoutli honour him a man shall no sooner know than enjoi be joi that now ar as incomprehens as the word of schoolmen beatif vision is unintellig prais magnif the form of speech wherebi men signifi their opinion of the goodness of anyth is prais that wherebi thei signifi the power and great of anyth is magnifi and that wherebi thei signifi the opinion thei have of a man felic is by the greek call makarismo for which we have no name in our tongu and thu much is suffici for the present purpos to have been said of the passion chapter vii of the end or resolut of discours of all discours govern by desir of knowledg there is at last an end either by attain or by give over and in the chain of discours wheresoev it be interrupt there is an end for that time judgement or sentenc final doubt if the discours be meerli mental it consisteth of thought that the thing will be and will not be or that it ha been and ha not been altern so that wheresoev you break off the chayn of a man discours you leav him in a praesumpt of it will be or it will not be or it ha been or ha not been all which is opinion and that which is altern appetit in deliber concern good and evil the same is altern opinion in the enquiri of the truth of past and futur and as the last appetit in deliber is call the will so the last opinion in search of the truth of past and futur is call the judgement or resolut and final sentenc of him that discourseth and as the whole chain of appetit altern in the question of good or bad is call deliber so the whole chain of opinion altern in the question of true or fals is call doubt no discours whatsoev can end in absolut knowledg of fact past or to come for as for the knowledg of fact it is origin sens and ever after memori and for the knowledg of consequ which i have said befor is call scienc it is not absolut but conditional no man can know by discours that thi or that is ha been or will be which is to know absolut but on that if thi be that is if thi ha been that ha been if thi shall be that shall be which is to know condition and that not the consequ of on thing to anoth but of on name of a thing to anoth name of the same thing scienc opinion conscienc and therefor when the discours is put into speech and begin with the definit of word and proce by connexion of the same into gener affirm and of these again into syllogism the end or last sum is call the conclus and the thought of the mind by it signifi is that condit knowledg or knowledg of the consequ of word which is commonli call scienc but if the first ground of such discours be not definit or if the definit be not rightli joyn togeth into syllogism then the end or conclus is again opinion name of the truth of somewhat said though sometim in absurd and sensless word without possibl of be understood when two or more men know of on and the same fact thei ar said to be consciou of it on to anoth which is as much as to know it togeth and becaus such ar fittest wit of the fact of on anoth or of a third it wa and ever will be reput a veri evil act for ani man to speak against hi conscienc or to corrupt or forc anoth so to do insomuch that the plea of conscienc ha been alwai hearken unto veri dilig in all time afterward men made us of the same word metaphor for the knowledg of their own secret fact and secret thought and therefor it is rhetor said that the conscienc is a thousand wit and last of all men vehement in love with their own new opinion though never so absurd and obstin bent to maintain them gave those their opinion also that reverenc name of conscienc as if thei would have it seem unlaw to chang or speak against them and so pretend to know thei ar true when thei know at most but that thei think so belief faith when a man discours beginneth not at definit it beginneth either at some other contempl of hi own and then it is still call opinion or it beginneth at some sai of anoth of whose abil to know the truth and of whose honesti in not deceiv he doubteth not and then the discours is not so much concern the thing as the person and the resolut is call beleef and faith faith in the man beleef both of the man and of the truth of what he say so then in beleef ar two opinion on of the sai of the man the other of hi vertu to have faith in or trust to or beleev a man signifi the same thing name an opinion of the verac of the man but to beleev what is said signifieth on an opinion of the truth of the sai but wee ar to observ that thi phrase i beleev in as also the latin credo in and the greek pisteno ei ar never us but in the write of divin in stead of them in other write ar put i beleev him i have faith in him i reli on him and in latin credo illi fido illi and in greek pisteno anto and that thi singular of the ecclesiast us of the word hath rais mani disput about the right object of the christian faith but by beleev in as it is in the creed is meant not trust in the person but confess and acknowledg of the doctrin for not on christian but all manner of men do so believ in god as to hold all for truth thei hear him sai whether thei understand it or not which is all the faith and trust can possibl be had in ani person whatsoev but thei do not all believ the doctrin of the creed from whenc we mai inferr that when wee believ ani sai whatsoev it be to be true from argument taken not from the thing it self or from the principl of natural reason but from the author and good opinion wee have of him that hath sayd it then is the speaker or person we believ in or trust in and whose word we take the object of our faith and the honour done in believ is done to him on and consequ when wee believ that the scriptur ar the word of god have no immedi revel from god himself our beleef faith and trust is in the church whose word we take and acquiesc therein and thei that believ that which a prophet relat unto them in the name of god take the word of the prophet do honour to him and in him trust and believ touch the truth of what he relateth whether he be a true or a fals prophet and so it is also with all other histori for if i should not believ all that is written by historian of the gloriou act of alexand or caesar i do not think the ghost of alexand or caesar had ani just caus to be offend or ani bodi els but the historian if livi sai the god made onc a cow speak and we believ it not wee distrust not god therein but livi so that it is evid that whatsoev we believ upon no other reason than what is drawn from author of men on and their write whether thei be sent from god or not is faith in men on chapter viii of the vertu commonli call intellectu and their contrari defect intellectual vertu defin vertu gener in all sort of subject is somewhat that is valu for emin and consisteth in comparison for if all thing were equal in all men noth would be prize and by vertu intellectual ar alwai understood such ability of the mind as men prais valu and desir should be in themselv and go commonli under the name of a good witt though the same word witt be us also to distinguish on certain abil from the rest wit natural or acquir these vertu ar of two sort natural and acquir by natural i mean not that which a man hath from hi birth for that is noth els but sens wherein men differ so littl on from anoth and from brute beast as it is not to be reckon amongst vertu but i mean that witt which is gotten by us on and experi without method cultur or instruct thi natural witt consisteth princip in two thing celer of imagin that is swift success of on thought to anoth and steddi direct to some approv end on the contrari a slow imagin maketh that defect or fault of the mind which is commonli call dulness stupid and sometim by other name that signifi slowness of motion or difficulti to be move good wit or fanci good judgement discret and thi differ of quickness is caus by the differ of men passion that love and dislik some on thing some anoth and therefor some men thought run on wai some anoth and ar held to and observ differ the thing that pass through their imagin and wherea in hi success of men thought there is noth to observ in the thing thei think on but either in what thei be like on anoth or in what thei be unlik or what thei serv for or how thei serv to such a purpos those that observ their similitud in case thei be such as ar but rare observ by other ar sayd to have a good wit by which in thi occas is meant a good fanci but thei that observ their differ and dissimilitud which is call distinguish and discern and judg between thing and thing in case such discern be not easi ar said to have a good judgement and particularli in matter of convers and business wherein time place and person ar to be discern thi vertu is call discret the former that is fanci without the help of judgement is not commend as a vertu but the later which is judgement and discret is commend for it self without the help of fanci besid the discret of time place and person necessari to a good fanci there is requir also an often applic of hi thought to their end that is to sai to some us to be made of them thi done he that hath thi vertu will be easili fit with similitud that will pleas not on by illustr of hi discours and adorn it with new and apt metaphor but also by the rariti or their invent but without steddiness and direct to some end a great fanci is on kind of madness such as thei have that entr into ani discours ar snatch from their purpos by everi thing that come in their thought into so mani and so long digress and parenthes that thei utterli lose themselv which kind of folli i know no particular name for but the caus of it is sometim want of experi wherebi that seemeth to a man new and rare which doth not so to other sometim pusillanim by which that seem great to him which other men think a trifl and whatsoev is new or great and therefor thought fit to be told withdraw a man by degre from the intend wai of hi discours in a good poem whether it be epiqu or dramatiqu as also in sonnet epigram and other piec both judgement and fanci ar requir but the fanci must be more emin becaus thei pleas for the extravag but ought not to displeas by indiscret in a good histori the judgement must be emin becaus the goodness consisteth in the method in the truth and in the choys of the action that ar most profit to be known fanci ha no place but on in adorn the stile in orat of prays and in invect the fanci is praedomin becaus the design is not truth but to honour or dishonour which is done by nobl or by vile comparison the judgement doe but suggest what circumst make an action laudabl or culpabl in hort and plead as truth or disguis serveth best to the design in hand so is the judgement or the fanci most requir in demonstr in councel and all rigour search of truth judgement doe all except sometim the understand have need to be open by some apt similitud and then there is so much us of fanci but for metaphor thei ar in thi case utterli exclud for see thei openli profess deceipt to admit them into councel or reason were manifest folli and in ani discours whatsoev if the defect of discret be appar how extravag soever the fanci be the whole discours will be taken for a sign of want of wit and so will it never when the discret is manifest though the fanci be never so ordinari the secret thought of a man run over all thing holi prophan clean obscen grave and light without shame or blame which verbal discours cannot do farther than the judgement shall approv of the time place and person an anatomist or a physitian mai speak or write hi judgement of unclean thing becaus it is not to pleas but profit but for anoth man to write hi extravag and pleasant fanci of the same is as if a man from be tumbl into the dirt should come and present himself befor good compani and ti the want of discret that make the differ again in profest remissness of mind and familiar compani a man mai plai with the sound and aequivoc signif of word and that mani time with encount of extraordinari fanci but in a sermon or in publiqu or befor person unknown or whom we ought to rever there is no gingl of word that will not be account folli and the differ is on in the want of discret so that where wit is want it is not fanci that is want but discret judgement therefor without fanci is wit but fanci without judgement not prudenc when the thought of a man that ha a design in hand run over a multitud of thing observ how thei conduc to that design or what design thei mai conduc into if hi observ be such as ar not easi or usual thi wit of hi is call prudenc and dependeth on much experi and memori of the like thing and their consequ heretofor in which there is not so much differ of men as there is in their fanci and judgement becaus the experi of men equal in ag is not much unequal as to the quantiti but lye in differ occas everi on have hi privat design to govern well a famili and a kingdom ar not differ degre of prudenc but differ sort of business no more then to draw a pictur in littl or as great or greater then the life ar differ degre of art a plain husbandman is more prudent in affair of hi own hous then a privi counsel in the affair of anoth man craft to prudenc if you add the us of unjust or dishonest mean such as usual ar prompt to men by fear or want you have that crook wisdom which is call craft which is a sign of pusillanim for magnanim is contempt of unjust or dishonest help and that which the latin call versutia translat into english shift and is a put off of a present danger or incommod by engag into a greater as when a man robb on to pai anoth is but a shorter sight craft call versutia from versura which signifi take moni at usuri for the present payment of interest acquir wit as for acquir wit i mean acquir by method and instruct there is none but reason which is ground on the right us of speech and produceth the scienc but of reason and scienc i have alreadi spoken in the fifth and sixth chapter the caus of thi differ of witt ar in the passion and the differ of passion proceedeth partli from the differ constitut of the bodi and partli from differ educ for if the differ proceed from the temper of the brain and the organ of sens either exterior or interior there would be no less differ of men in their sight hear or other sens than in their fanci and discret it proce therefor from the passion which ar differ not on from the differ of men complexion but also from their differ of custom and educ the passion that most of all caus the differ of wit ar princip the more or less desir of power of rich of knowledg and of honour all which mai be reduc to the first that is desir of power for rich knowledg and honour ar but several sort of power giddiness madness and therefor a man who ha no great passion for ani of these thing but is as men term it indiffer though he mai be so farr a good man as to be free from give offenc yet he cannot possibl have either a great fanci or much judgement for the thought ar to the desir as scout and spi to rang abroad and find the wai to the thing desir all stediness of the mind motion and all quickness of the same proceed from thenc for as to have no desir is to be dead so to have weak passion is dulness and to have passion indiffer for everi thing giddiness and distract and to have stronger and more vehement passion for ani thing than is ordinarili seen in other is that which men call madness whereof there be almost as mani kind as of the passion themselv sometim the extraordinari and extravag passion proceedeth from the evil constitut of the organ of the bodi or harm done them and sometim the hurt and indisposit of the organ is caus by the vehem or long continu of the passion but in both case the madness is of on and the same natur the passion whose violenc or continu maketh madness is either great vaineglori which is commonli call pride and selfeconceipt or great deject of mind rage pride subjecteth a man to anger the excess whereof is the madness call rage and furi and thu it come to pass that excess desir of reveng when it becom habitual hurteth the organ and becom rage that excess love with jealousi becom also rage excess opinion of a man own self for divin inspir for wisdom learn form and the like becom distract and giddiness the same joyn with envi rage vehement opinion of the truth of ani thing contradict by other rage melancholi deject subject a man to causeless fear which is a madness commonli call melancholi appar also in diver manner as in haunt of solitud and grave in superstiti behaviour and in fear some on some anoth particular thing in summ all passion that produc strang and unusual behaviour ar call by the general name of madness but of the several kind of madness he that would take the pain might enrowl a legion and if the excess be madness there is no doubt but the passion themselv when thei tend to evil ar degre of the same for exampl though the effect of folli in them that ar possess of an opinion of be inspir be not visibl alway in on man by ani veri extravag action that proceedeth from such passion yet when mani of them conspir togeth the rage of the whole multitud is visibl enough for what argument of madness can there be greater than to clamour strike and throw stone at our best friend yet thi is somewhat less than such a multitud will do for thei will clamour fight against and destroi those by whom all their lifetim befor thei have been protect and secur from injuri and if thi be madness in the multitud it is the same in everi particular man for as in the middest of the sea though a man perceiv no sound of that part of the water next him yet he is well assur that part contribut as much to the roar of the sea as ani other part of the same quantiti so also thought wee perceiv no great unquietness in on or two men yet we mai be well assur that their singular passion ar part of the sediti roar of a troubl nation and if there were noth els that bewrai their madness yet that veri arrog such inspir to themselv is argument enough if some man in bedlam should entertain you with sober discours and you desir in take leav to know what he were that you might anoth time requit hi civil and he should tell you he were god the father i think you need expect no extravag action for argument of hi madness thi opinion of inspir call commonli privat spirit begin veri often from some lucki find of an errour gener held by other and not know or not remembr by what conduct of reason thei came to so singular a truth as thei think it though it be mani time an untruth thei light on thei present admir themselv as be in the special grace of god almighti who hath reveal the same to them supernatur by hi spirit again that madness is noth els but too much appear passion mai be gather out of the effect of wine which ar the same with those of the evil disposit of the organ for the varieti of behaviour in men that have drunk too much is the same with that of madmen some of them rage other love other laugh all extravagantli but accord to their several domin passion for the effect of the wine doe but remov dissimul and take from them the sight of the deform of their passion for i believ the most sober men when thei walk alon without care and employ of the mind would be unwil the vaniti and extravag of their thought at that time should be publiqu seen which is a confess that passion unguid ar for the most part meer madness the opinion of the world both in antient and later ag concern the caus of madness have been two some deriv them from the passion some from daemon or spirit either good or bad which thei thought might enter into a man possess him and move hi organ is such strang and uncouth manner as madmen us to do the former sort therefor call such men madmen but the later call them sometim daemoniack that is possess with spirit sometim energumeni that is agit or move with spirit and now in itali thei ar call not on pazzi madmen but also spiritati men possest there wa onc a great conflux of peopl in abdera a citi of the greek at the act of the tragedi of andromeda upon an extream hot dai whereupon a great mani of the spectat fall into fever had thi accid from the heat and from the tragedi togeth that thei did noth but pronounc iambiqu with the name of perseu and andromeda which togeth with the fever wa cure by the com on of winter and thi madness wa thought to proce from the passion imprint by the tragedi likewis there raign a fit of madness in anoth graecian citi which seiz on the young maiden and caus mani of them to hang themselv thi wa by most then thought an act of the divel but on that suspect that contempt of life in them might proce from some passion of the mind and suppos thei did not contemn also their honour gave counsel to the magistr to strip such as so hangd themselv and let them hang out nake thi the stori say cure that madness but on the other side the same graecian did often ascrib madness to the oper of the eumenid or fury and sometim of cere phoebu and other god so much did men attribut to phantasm as to think them aereal live bodi and gener to call them spirit and as the roman in thi held the same opinion with the greek so also did the jew for thei call madmen prophet or accord as thei thought the spirit good or bad daemoniack and some of them call both prophet and daemoniack madmen and some call the same man both daemoniack and madman but for the gentil ti no wonder becaus diseas and health vice and vertu and mani natural accid were with them term and worship as daemon so that a man wa to understand by daemon as well sometim an agu as a divel but for the jew to have such opinion is somewhat strang for neither mose nor abraham pretend to propheci by possess of a spirit but from the voyc of god or by a vision or dream nor is there ani thing in hi law moral or ceremonial by which thei were taught there wa ani such enthusiasm or ani possess when god is sayd numb to take from the spirit that wa in mose and give it to the elder the spirit of god take it for the substanc of god is not divid the scriptur by the spirit of god in man mean a man spirit enclin to godliness and where it is said exod whom i have fill with the spirit of wisdom to make garment for aaron is not meant a spirit put into them that can make garment but the wisdom of their own spirit in that kind of work in the like sens the spirit of man when it produceth unclean action is ordinarili call an unclean spirit and so other spirit though not alway yet as often as the vertu or vice so stile is extraordinari and emin neither did the other prophet of the old testament pretend enthusiasm or that god spake in them but to them by voyc vision or dream and the burthen of the lord wa not possess but command how then could the jew fall into thi opinion of possess i can imagin no reason but that which is common to all men name the want of curios to search natural caus and their place felic in the acquisit of the gross pleasur of the sens and the thing that most immedi conduc thereto for thei that see ani strang and unusual abil or defect in a man mind unless thei see withal from what caus it mai probabl proce can hardli think it natural and if not natural thei must need think it supernatural and then what can it be but that either god or the divel is in him and henc it came to pass when our saviour mark wa compass about with the multitud those of the hous doubt he wa mad and went out to hold him but the scribe said he had belzebub and that wa it by which he cast out divel as if the greater madman had aw the lesser and that john some said he hath a divel and is mad wherea other hold him for a prophet sayd these ar not the word of on that hath a divel so in the old testament he that came to anoynt jehu king wa a prophet but some of the compani ask jehu what came that madman for so that in summ it is manifest that whosoev behav himself in extraordinari manner wa thought by the jew to be possess either with a good or evil spirit except by the sadduc who er so farr on the other hand as not to believ there were at all ani spirit which is veri neer to direct atheism and therebi perhap the more provok other to term such men daemoniack rather than madmen but why then doe our saviour proce in the cure of them as if thei were possest and not as if thei were mad to which i can give no other kind of answer but that which is given to those that urg the scriptur in like manner against the opinion of the motion of the earth the scriptur wa written to shew unto men the kingdom of god and to prepar their mind to becom hi obedi subject leav the world and the philosophi thereof to the disput of men for the exercis of their natural reason whether the earth or sun motion make the dai and night or whether the exorbit action of men proce from passion or from the divel so we worship him not it is all on as to our obedi and subject to god almighti which is the thing for which the scriptur wa written as for that our saviour speaketh to the diseas as to a person it is the usual phrase of all that cure by word on as christ did and inchant pretend to do whether thei speak to a divel or not for is not christ also said math to have rebuk the wind is not he said also luk to rebuk a fever yet thi doe not argu that a fever is a divel and wherea mani of these divel ar said to confess christ it is not necessari to interpret those place otherwis than that those madmen confess him and wherea our saviour math speaketh of an unclean spirit that have gone out of a man wandreth through dry place seek rest and find none and return into the same man with seven other spirit wors than himself it is manifestli a parabl allud to a man that after a littl endeavour to quit hi lust is vanquish by the strength of them and becom seven time wors than he wa so that i see noth at all in the scriptur that requireth a belief that daemoniack were ani other thing but madmen insignific speech there is yet anoth fault in the discours of some men which mai also be numbr amongst the sort of madness name that abus of word whereof i have spoken befor in the fifth chapter by the name of absurd and that is when men speak such word as put togeth have in them no signif at all but ar fallen upon by some through misunderstand of the word thei have receiv and repeat by rote by other from intent to deceiv by obscur and thi is incid to none but those that convers in question of matter incomprehens as the schoolemen or in question of abstrus philosophi the common sort of men seldom speak insignificantli and ar therefor by those other egregi person count idiot but to be assur their word ar without ani thing correspond to them in the mind there would need some exampl which if ani man requir let him take a schooleman into hi hand and see if he can translat ani on chapter concern ani difficult point as the triniti the deiti the natur of christ transubstanti freewil c into ani of the modern tongu so as to make the same intellig or into ani toler latin such as thei were acquaint withal that live when the latin tongu wa vulgar what is the mean

not inhabit the antient greek command when thei went to war had their shield paint with such devis as thei pleas insomuch as an unpaint buckler wa a sign of poverti and of a common souldier but thei transmit not the inherit of them the roman transmit the mark of their famili but thei were the imag not the devis of their ancestor amongst the peopl of asia afriqu and america there is not nor wa ever ani such thing the german on had that custom from whom it ha been deriv into england franc spain and itali when in great number thei either ayd the roman or made their own conquest in these western part of the world for germani be antient as all other countri in their begin divid amongst an infinit number of littl lord or master of famili that continu had war on with anoth those master

bar palisado and other note of war noth be then in honour but vertu militari afterward not on king but popular commonwealth gave diver manner of scutchion to such as went forth to the war or return from it for encourag or recomp to their servic all which by an observ reader mai be found in such ancient histori greek and latin as make mention of the german nation and manner in their time titl of honour titl of honour such as ar duke count marqui and baron ar honour as signifi the valu set upon them by the soveraign power of the commonwealth which titl were in old time titl of offic and command deriv some from the roman some from the german and french duke in latin duce be general in war count comit such as bare the general compani out of friendship and were left to govern and defend place conquer and pacifi marquis marchion were count that govern the march or bound of the empir which titl of duke count and marqui came into the empir about the time of constantin the great from the custom of the german militia but baron seem to have been a titl of the gaul and signifi a great man such as were the king or princ men whom thei emploi in war about their person and seem to be deriv from vir to ber and bar that signifi the same in the languag of the gaul that vir in latin and thenc to bero and baro so that such men were call beron and after baron and in spanish varon but he that would know more particularli the original of titl of honour mai find it as i have done thi in mr selden most excel treatis of that subject in process of time these offic of honour by occas of troubl and for reason of good and peacabl govern were turn into meer titl serv for the most part to distinguish the preced place and order of subject in the commonwealth and men were made duke count marquis and baron of place wherein thei had neither possess nor command and other titl also were devis to the same end worthiness fitness worthiness is a thing differ from the worth or valu of a man and also from hi merit or desert and consisteth in a particular power or abil for that whereof he is said to be worthi which particular abil is usual name fitness or aptitud for he is worthiest to be a command

therefor cannot be said to merit or deserv it for merit praesupposeth a right and that the thing deserv is due by promis of which i shall sai more hereaft when i shall speak of contract chapter xi of the differ of manner what is here meant by manner by manner i mean not here decenc of behaviour as how on man should salut anoth or how a man should wash hi mouth or pick hi teeth befor compani and such other point of the small moral but those qualiti of mankind that concern their live togeth in peac and uniti to which end we ar to consid that the felic of thi life consisteth not in the repos of a mind satisfi for there is no such fini ultimu utmost aym nor summum bonum greatest good as is spoken of in the book of the old moral philosoph nor can a man ani more live whose desir ar at an end than he whose sens and imagin ar at a stand felic is a continual progress of the desir from on object to anoth the attain of the former be still but the wai to the later the caus whereof is that the object of man desir is not to enjoi onc on and for on instant of time but to assur for ever the wai of hi futur desir and therefor the voluntari action and inclin of all men tend not onli to the procur but also to the assur of a content life and differ on in the wai which ariseth partli from the divers of passion in diver men and partli from the differ of the knowledg or opinion each on ha of the caus which produc the effect desir a restless desir of power in all men so that in the first place i put for a general inclin of all mankind a perpetual and restless desir of power after power that ceaseth on in death and the caus of thi is not alway that a man hope for a more intens delight than he ha alreadi attain to or that he cannot be content with a moder power but becaus he cannot assur the power and mean to live well which he hath present without the acquisit of more and from henc it is that king whose power is greatest turn their endeavour to the assur it a home by law or abroad by war and when that is done there succeedeth a new desir in some of fame from new conquest in other of eas and sensual pleasur in other of admir or be flatter for excel in some art or other abil of the mind love of content from competit competit of rich honour command or other power enclineth to content enmiti and war becaus the wai of on competitor to the attain of hi desir is to kill subdu supplant or repel the other particularli competit of prais enclineth to a rever of antiqu for men contend with the live not with the dead to these ascrib more than due that thei mai obscur the glori of the other civil obedi from love of eas desir of eas and sensual delight disposeth men to obei a common power becaus by such desir a man doth abandon the protect might be hope for from hi own industri and labour from fear of death or wound fear of death and wound disposeth to the same and for the same reason on the contrari needi men and hardi not content with their present condit as also all men that ar ambiti of militari command ar enclin to continu the caus of warr and to stirr up troubl and sedit for there is no honour militari but by warr nor ani such hope to mend an ill game as by caus a new shuffl and from love of art desir of knowledg and art of peac enclineth men to obei a common power for such desir containeth a desir of leasur and consequ protect from some other power than their own love of vertu from love of prais desir of prais disposeth to laudabl action such as pleas them whose judgement thei valu for of these men whom we contemn we contemn also the prais desir of fame after death doe the same and though after death there be no sens of the prais given us on earth as be joy that ar either swallow up in the unspeak joy of heaven or extinguish in the extrem torment of hell yet is not such fame vain becaus men have a present delight therein from the foresight of it and of the benefit that mai rebound therebi to their poster which though thei now see not yet thei imagin and ani thing that is pleasur in the sens the same also is pleasur in the imagin hate from difficulti of requit great benefit to have receiv from on to whom we think our selv equal greater benefit than there is hope to requit disposeth to counterfiet love but realli secret hatr and put a man into the estat of a desper debtor that in declin the sight of hi creditor tacit wish him there where he might never see him more for benefit oblig and oblig is thraldom which is to on equal hate but to have receiv benefit from on whom we acknowledg our superiour enclin to love becaus the oblig is no new depess and cheerful accept which men call gratitud is such an honour done to the oblig as is taken gener for retribut also to receiv benefit though from an equal or inferiour as long as there is hope of requital disposeth to love for in the intent of the receiv the oblig is of ayd and servic mutual from whenc proceedeth an emul of who shall exce in benefit the most nobl and profit content possibl wherein the victor is pleas with hi victori and the other reveng by confess it and from conscienc of deserv to be hate to have done more hurt to a man than he can or is will to expiat enclineth the doer to hate the suffer for he must expect reveng or forgiveness both which ar hateful promptness to hurt from fear fear of oppress disposeth a man to anticip or to seek ayd by societi for there is no other wai by which a man can secur hi life and liberti and from distrust of their own wit men that distrust their own subtilti ar in tumult and sedit better dispos for victori than thei that suppos themselv wise or crafti for these love to consult the other fear to be circumv to strike first and in sedit men be alway in the procinct of battel to hold togeth and us all advantag

that have a strong opinion of their own wisdom in matter of govern ar dispos to ambit becaus without publiqu employ in counsel or magistraci the honour of their wisdom is lost and therefor eloqu speaker ar enclin to ambit for eloqu seemeth wisdom both to themselv and other irresolut from too great valu of small matter pusillanim disposeth men to irresolut and consequ to lose the occas and fittest opportun of action for after men have been in deliber till the time of action approach if it be not then manifest what is best to be done ti a sign the differ of motiv the on wai and the other ar not great therefor not to resolv then is to lose the occas by weigh of trifl which is pusillanim frugalitythough in poor men a vertu maketh a man unapt to atchiev such action as requir the strength

to confid in them that have it becaus the former is seem wisdom the later seem kindness add to them militari reput and it disposeth men to adhaer and subject themselv to those men that have them the two former have given them caution against danger from him the later give them caution against danger from other and from the ignor of natural caus want of scienc that is ignor of caus disposeth or rather constraineth a man to reli on the advis and author of other for all men whom the truth concern if thei reli not on their own must reli on the opinion of some other whom thei think wiser than themselv and see not why he should deceiv them and from want of understand ignor of the signif of word which is want of understand disposeth men to take on trust not on the truth thei know not but

dress and form it into law and to add to it of their own invent ani opinion of the caus of futur event by which thei thought thei should best be abl to govern other and make unto themselv the greatest us of their power chapter xii of religion religion in man on see there ar no sign nor fruit of religion but in man on there is no caus to doubt but that the seed of religion is also on in man and consisteth in some peculiar qualiti or at least in some emin degre thereof not to be found in other live creatur first from hi desir of know caus and first it is peculiar to the natur of man to be inquisit into the caus of the event thei see some more some less but all men so much as to be curiou in the search of the caus of their own good and evil fortun from the consider of the begin of thing secondli upon the sight of ani thing that hath a begin to think also it had a caus which determin the same to begin then when it did rather than sooner or later from hi observ of the sequel of thing thirdli wherea there is no other felic of beast but the enjoi of their quotidian food eas and lust as have littl or no foresight of the time to come for want of observ and memori of the order consequ and depend of the thing thei see man observeth how on event hath been produc by anoth and remembreth in them anteced and consequ and when he cannot assur himself of the true caus of thing for the caus of good and evil fortun for the most part ar invis he suppos caus of them either such as hi own fanci suggesteth or trusteth to the author of other men such as he think to be hi friend and wiser than himself the natural caus of religion the anxieti of the time to come the two first make anxieti for be assur that there be caus of all thing that have arriv hitherto or shall arriv hereaft it is imposs for a man who continu endeavoureth to secur himself against the evil he fear and procur the good he desireth not to be in a perpetual solicitud of the time to come so that everi man especi those that ar over provid ar in an estat like to that of prometheu for as prometheu which interpret is the prudent man wa bound to the hill caucasu a place of larg prospect where an eagl feed on hi

calam and ha no repos nor paus of hi anxieti but in sleep which make them fear the power of invis thing thi perpetual fear alway accompani mankind in the ignor of caus as it were in the dark must need have for object someth and therefor when there is noth to be seen there is noth to accus either of their good or evil fortun but some power or agent invis in which sens perhap it wa that some of the old poet said that the god were at first creat by human fear which spoken of the god that is to sai of the mani god of the gentil is veri true but the acknowledg of on god eternal infinit and omnipot mai more easili be deriv from the desir men have to know the caus of natural bodi and their several vertu and oper than from the fear of what wa to befal them in time to come for he that from ani effect hee seeth come to pass should reason to the next and immedi caus thereof and from thenc to the caus of that caus and plong himself profoundli in the pursuit of caus shall at last come to thi that there must be as even the heathen philosoph confess on first mover that is a first and an eternal caus of all thing which is that which men mean by the name of god and all thi without thought of their fortun the solicitud whereof both enclin to fear and hinder them from the search of the caus of other thing and therebi give occas of feign of as mani god as there be men that feign them and suppos them incorporeal and for the matter or substanc of the invis agent so fanci thei could not by natural cogit fall upon ani other conceipt but that it wa the same with that of the soul of man and that the soul of man wa of the same substanc with that which appeareth in a dream to on that sleepeth or in a lookingglass to on that is awak which men not know that such apparit ar noth els but creatur of the fanci think to be reall and external substanc and therefor call them ghost as the latin call them imagin and umbra and thought them spirit that is thin aereal bodi and those invis agent which thei fear to bee like them save that thei appear and vanish when thei pleas but the opinion that such spirit were incorporeal or immaterial could never enter into the mind of ani man by natur becaus though men mai put togeth word of contradictori signif as spirit and incorporeal yet thei can never have the imagin of ani thing answer to them and therefor men that by their own medit arriv to the acknowledg of on infinit omnipot and eternal god choos rather to confess he is incomprehens and abov their understand than to defin hi natur by spirit incorporeal and then confess their definit to be unintellig or if thei give him such a titl it is not dogmat with intent to make the divin natur understood but piousli to honour him with attribut of signif as remot as thei can from the grosseness of bodi visibl but know not the wai how thei effect anyth then for the wai by which thei think these invis agent wrought their effect that is to sai what immedi caus thei us in bring thing to pass men that know not what it is that we call caus that is almost all men have no other rule to guess by but by observ and remembr what thei have seen to preced the like effect at some other time or time befor without see between the anteced and subsequ event ani depend or connexion at all and therefor from the like thing past thei expect the like thing to come and hope for good or evil luck superstiti from thing that have no part at all in the caus of it as the athenian did for their war at lepanto demand anoth phormio the pompeian faction for their warr in afriqu anoth scipio and other have done in diver other occas sinc in like manner thei attribut their fortun to a stander by to a lucki or unlucki place to word spoken especi if the name of god be amongst them as charm and conjur the leiturgi of witch insomuch as to believ thei have power to turn a stone into bread bread into a man or ani thing into ani thing but honour them as thei honour men thirdli for the worship which natur men exhibit to power invis it can be no other but such express of their rever as thei would us toward men gift petit thank submiss of bodi consider address sober behaviour premedit word swear that is assur on anoth of their promis by invok them beyond that reason suggesteth noth but leav them either to rest there or for further ceremoni to reli on those thei believ to be wiser than themselv and attribut to them all extraordinari event lastli concern how these invis power declar to men the thing which shall hereaft come to pass especi concern their good or evil fortun in general or good or ill success in ani particular undertak men ar natur at a stand save that us to conjectur of the time to come by the time past thei ar veri apt not on to take casual thing after on or two encount for prognostiqu of the like encount ever after but also to believ the like prognostiqu from other men of whom thei have onc conceiv a good opinion four thing natural seed of religion and in these four thing opinion of ghost ignor of second caus devot toward what men fear and take of thing casual for prognostiqu consisteth the natural seed of religion which by reason of the differ fanci judgement and passion of several men hath grown up into ceremoni so differ that those which ar us by on man ar for the most part ridicul to anoth made differ by cultur for these seed have receiv cultur from two sort of men on sort have been thei that have nourish and order them accord to their own invent the other have done it by god command and direct but both sort have done it with a purpos to make those men that reli on them the more apt to obedi law peac chariti and civil societi so that the religion of the former sort is a part of human politiqu and teacheth part of the duti which earthli king requir of their subject and the religion of the later sort is divin politiqu and containeth precept to those that have yeeld themselv subject in the kingdom of god of the former sort were all the founder of commonwealth and the lawgiv of the gentil of the later sort were abraham mose and our bless saviour by whom have been deriv unto us the law of the kingdom of god the absurd opinion of gentilism and for that part of religion which consisteth in opinion concern the natur of power invis there is almost noth that ha a name that ha not been esteem amongst the gentil in on place or anoth a god or divel or by their poet feign to be inanim inhabit or possess by some spirit or other the unform matter of the world wa a god by the name of chao the heaven the ocean the planet the fire

noth which a poet could introduc as a person in hi poem which thei did not make either a god or a divel the same author of the religion of the gentil observ the second ground for religion which is men ignor of caus and therebi their aptness to attribut their fortun to caus on which there wa no depend at all appar took occas to obtrud on their ignor in stead of second caus a kind of second and ministerial god ascrib the caus of foecund to venu the caus of art to apollo of subtilti and craft to mercuri of tempest and storm to aeolu and of other effect to other god insomuch as there wa amongst the heathen almost as great varieti of god as of business and to the worship which natur men conceiv fit to bee us toward their god name oblat prayer thank and the rest formerli name the same legisl of the gentil have ad their imag both in pictur and sculptur that the more ignor sort that is to sai the most part or gener of the peopl think the god for whose represent thei were made were

supernatural divin revel the same author of the religion of the gentil partli upon pretend experi partli upon pretend revel have ad innumer other superstiti way of divin and made men believ thei should find their fortun sometim in the ambigu or sensless answer of the priest at delphi delo ammon and other famou oracl which answer were made ambigu by design to own the event both way or absurd by the intox vapour of the place which is veri frequent in sulphur cavern sometim in the leav of the sibil of whose prophecy like those perhap of nostradamu for the fragment now extant seem to be the

dip of vers in homer and virgil and innumer other such vain conceipt so easi ar men to be drawn to believ ani thing from such men as have gotten credit with them and can with gentleness and dexter take hold of their fear and ignor the design of the author of the religion of the heathen and therefor the first founder and legisl of commonwealth amongst the gentil whose end were onli to keep the peopl in obedi and peac have in all place taken care first to imprint in their mind a belief that those precept which thei gave concern religion might not be thought to proce from their own devic but from the dictat of some god or other spirit or els that thei themselv were of a higher natur than mere mortal that their law might the more easili be receiv so numa pompiliu pretend to receiv the ceremoni he institut amongst the roman from the nymph egeria and the first king and founder of the kingdom of peru pretend himself and hi wife to be the children of the sunn and mahomet to set up hi new religion pretend to have confer with the holi ghost in form of a dove secondli thei have had a care to make it believ that the same thing were displeas to the god which were forbidden by the law thirdli to prescrib ceremoni supplic sacrific and festival by which thei were to believ the anger of the god might be appeas and that ill success in war great contagion of sickness earthquak and each man privat miseri came from the anger of the god and their anger from the neglect of their worship or the forget or mistak some point of the ceremoni requir and though amongst the antient roman men were not forbidden to deni that which in the poet is written of the pain and pleasur after thi life which diver of great author and graviti in that state have in their harangu openli derid yet that belief wa alwai more cherish than the contrari and by these and such other institut thei obtayn in order to their end which wa the peac of the commonwealth that the common peopl in their misfortun lai the fault on neglect or errour in their ceremoni or on their own disobedi to the law were the less apt to mutini against their governor and be entertain with the pomp and pastim of festival and publik gome made in honour of the god need noth els but bread to keep them from discont murmur and commot against the state and therefor the roman that had conquer the greatest part of the then known world made no scrupl of toller ani religion whatsoev in the citi of rome it self unless it had somth in it that could not consist with their civil govern nor do we read that ani religion wa there forbidden but that of the jew who be the peculiar kingdom of god thought it unlawful to acknowledg subject to ani mortal king or state whatsoev and thu you see how the religion of the gentil wa a part of their polici the true religion and the law of god kingdom the same but where god himself by supernatural revel plant religion there he also made to himself a peculiar kingdom and gave law not onli of behaviour toward himself but also toward on anoth and therebi in the kingdom of god the polici and law civil ar a part of religion and therefor the distinct of temporal and spiritual domin hath there no place it is true that god is king of all the earth yet mai he be king of a peculiar and chosen nation for there is no more incongru therein than that he that hath the general command of the whole armi should have withal a peculiar regiment or compani of hi own god is king of all the earth by hi power but of hi chosen peopl he is king by coven but to speak more largli of the kingdom of god both by natur and coven i have in the follow discours assign an other place the caus of chang in religion from the propag of religion it is not hard to understand the caus of the resolut of the same into it first seed or principl which ar onli an opinion of a deiti and power invis and supernatural that can never be so abolish out of human natur but that new religion mai again be made to spring out of them by the cultur of such men as for such purpos ar in reput for see all form religion is found at first upon the faith which a multitud hath in some on person whom thei believ not onli to be a wise man and to labour to procur their happi but also to be a holi man to whom god himself vouchsafeth to declar hi will supernatur it followeth necessarili when thei that have the gover of religion shall come to have either the wisedom of those men their sincer or their love suspect or that thei shall be unabl to shew ani probabl token of divin revel that the religion which thei desir to uphold must be suspect likewis and without the fear of the civil sword contradict and reject injoyn beleef of imposs that which taketh awai the reput of wisedom in him that formeth a religion or addeth to it when it is allreadi form is the enjoyn of a belief of contradictori for both part of a contradict cannot possibl be true and therefor to enjoyn the belief of them is an argument of ignor which detect the author in that and discredit him in all thing els he shall propound as from revel supernatural which revel a man mai inde have of mani thing abov but of noth against natural reason do contrari to the religion thei establish that which taketh awai the reput of sincer is the do or sai of such thing as appear to be sign that what thei requir other men to believ is not believ by themselv all which do or sai ar therefor call scandal becaus thei be stumbl block that make men to fall in the wai of religion as injustic cruelti prophaness avaric and luxuri for who can believ that he that doth ordinarili such action as proce from ani of these root believeth there is ani such invis power to be fear as he affrighteth other men withal for lesser fault that which taketh awai the reput of love is the be detect of privat end as when the belief thei requir of other conduceth or seemeth to conduc to the acquir of dominion rich digniti or secur pleasur to themselv on or special for that which men reap benefit by to themselv thei ar thought to do for their own sake and not for love of other want of the testimoni of miracl lastli the testimoni that men can render of divin call can be no other than the oper of miracl or true propheci which also is a miracl or extraordinari felic and therefor to those point of religion which have been receiv from them that did such miracl those that ar ad by such as approv not their call by some miracl obtain no greater belief than what the custom and law of the place in which thei be educ have wrought into them for as in natural thing men of judgement requir natural sign and argument so in supernatural thing thei requir sign supernatural which ar miracl befor thei consent inwardli and from their heart all which caus of the weaken of men faith do manifestli appear in the exampl follow first we have the exampl of the children of israel who when mose that had approv hi call to them by miracl and by the happi conduct of them out of egypt wa absent but day revolt from the worship of the true god recommend to them by him and set up exod a golden calf for their god relaps into the idolatri of the egyptian from whom thei had been so late deliv and again after mose aaron joshua and that gener which had seen the great work of god in israel judg were dead anoth gener aros and serv baal so that miracl fayl faith also fail again when the son of samuel sam be constitut by their father judg in bersabe receiv bribe and judg unjustli the peopl of israel refus ani more to have god to be their king in other manner than he wa king of other peopl and therefor cry out to samuel to choos them a king after the manner of the nation so that justic fayl faith also fayl insomuch as thei depos their god from reign over them and wherea in the plant of christian religion the oracl ceas in all part of the roman empir and the number of christian encreas wonderfulli everi dai and in everi place by the preach of the apostl and evangelist a great part of that success mai reason be attribut to the contempt into which the priest of the gentil of that time had brought themselv by their uncleanness avaric and jugl between princ also the religion of the church of rome wa partli for the same caus abolish in england and mani other part of christendom insomuch as the fayl of vertu in the pastor maketh faith fail in the peopl and partli from bring of the philosophi and doctrin of aristotl into religion by the schoolemen from whenc there aros so mani contradict and absurd as brought the clergi into a reput both of ignor and of fraudul intent and enclin peopl to revolt from them either against the will of their own princ as in franc and holland or with their will as in england lastli amongst the point by the church of rome declar necessari for salvat there be so mani manifestli to the advantag of the pope and of hi spiritual subject resid in the territori of other christian princ that were it not for the mutual emul of those princ thei might without warr or troubl exclud all forraign author as easili as it ha been exclud in england for who is there that doe not see to whose benefit it conduceth to have it believ that a king hath not hi author from christ unless a bishop crown him that a king if he be a priest cannot marri that whether a princ be born in lawful marriag or not must be judg by author from rome that subject mai be freed from their alleag if by the court of rome the king be judg an heretiqu that a king as chilperiqu of franc mai be depos by a pope as pope zachari for no caus and hi kingdom given to on of hi subject that the clergi and regular in what countri soever shall be exempt from the jurisdict of their king in case criminal or who doe not see to whose profit redound the fee of privat mass and vale of purgatori with other sign of privat interest enough to mortifi the most live faith if as i sayd the civil magistr and custom did not more sustain it than ani opinion thei have of the sanctiti wisdom or probiti of their teacher so that i mai attribut all the chang of religion in the world to on and the some caus and that is unpleas priest and those not on amongst catholiqu but even in that church that hath presum most of reform chapter xiii of the natural condit of mankind as concern their felic and miseri natur hath made men so equal in the faculti of bodi and mind as that though there bee found on man sometim manifestli stronger in bodi or of quicker mind then anoth yet when all is reckon togeth the differ between man and man is not so consider as that on man can thereupon claim to himself ani benefit to which anoth mai not pretend as well as he for as to the strength of bodi the weakest ha strength enough to kill the strongest either by secret machin or by confederaci with other that ar in the same danger with himself and as to the faculti of the mind set asid the art ground upon word and especi that skill of proceed upon general and infal rule call scienc which veri few have and but in few thing as be not a nativ faculti born with us nor attain as prudenc while we look after somewhat el i find yet a greater equal amongst men than that of strength for prudenc is but experi which equal time equal bestow on all men in those thing thei equal appli themselv unto that which mai perhap make such equal incred is but a vain conceipt of on own wisdom which almost all men think thei have in a greater degre than the vulgar that is than all men but themselv and a few other whom by fame or for concur with themselv thei approv for such is the natur of men that howsoev thei mai acknowledg mani other to be more witti or more eloqu or more learn yet thei will hardli believ there be mani so wise as themselv for thei see their own wit at hand and other men at a distanc but thi proveth rather that men ar in that point equal than unequal for there is not ordinarili a greater sign of the equal distribut of ani thing than that everi man is content with hi share from equal proce diffid from thi equal of abil ariseth equal of hope in the attain of our end and therefor if ani two men desir the same thing which nevertheless thei cannot both enjoi thei becom enemi and in the wai to their end which is princip their own conserv and sometim their delect onli endeavour to destroi or subdu on an other and from henc it come to pass that where an invad hath no more to fear than an other man singl power if on plant sow build or possess a conveni seat other mai probabl be expect to come prepar with forc unit to dispossess and depriv him not onli of the fruit of hi labour but also of hi life or liberti and the invad again is in the like danger of anoth from diffid warr and from thi diffid of on anoth there is no wai for ani man to secur himself so reason as anticip that is by forc or wile to master the person of all men he can so long till he see no other power great enough to endang him and thi is no more than hi own conserv requireth and is gener allow also becaus there be some that take pleasur in contempl their own power in the act of conquest which thei pursu farther than their secur requir if other that otherwis would be glad to be at eas within modest bound should not by invas increas their power thei would not be abl long time by stand onli on their defenc to subsist and by consequ such augment of dominion over men be necessari to a man conserv it ought to be allow him again men have no pleasur but on the contrari a great deal of grief in keep compani where there is no power abl to overaw them all for everi man looketh that hi companion should valu him at the same rate he set upon himself and upon all sign of contempt or undervalu natur endeavour as far as he dare which amongst them that have no common power to keep them in quiet is far enough to make them destroi each other to extort a greater valu from hi contemn by dommag and from other by the exampl so that in the natur of man we find three principal caus of quarrel first competit secondli diffid thirdli glori the first maketh men invad for gain the second for safeti and the third for reput the first us violenc to make themselv master of other men person wive children and cattel the second to defend them the third for trifl as a word a smile a differ opinion and ani other sign of undervalu either direct in their person or by reflexion in their kindr their friend their nation their profess or their name out of civil state there is alway warr of everi on against everi on herebi it is manifest that dure the time men live without a common power to keep them all in aw thei ar in that condit which is call warr and such a warr as is of everi man against everi man for warr consisteth not in battel on or the act of fight but in a tract of time wherein the will to contend by battel is suffici known and therefor the notion of time is to be consid in the natur of warr as it is in the natur of weather for as the natur of foul weather lyeth not in a showr or two of rain but in an inclin thereto of mani day togeth so the natur of war consisteth not in actual fight but in the known disposit thereto dure all the time there is no assur to the contrari all other time is peac the incommodit of such a war whatsoev therefor is consequ to a time of warr where everi man is enemi to everi man the same is consequ to the time wherein men live without other secur than what their own strength and their own invent shall furnish them withal in such condit there is no place for industri becaus the fruit thereof is uncertain and consequ no cultur of the earth no navig nor us of the commod that mai be import by sea no commodi build no instrument of move and remov such thing as requir much forc no knowledg of the face of the earth no account of time no art no letter no societi and which is worst of all continual fear and danger of violent death and the life of man solitari poor nasti brutish and short it mai seem strang to some man that ha not well weigh these thing that natur should thu dissoci and render men apt to invad and destroi on anoth and he mai therefor not trust to thi infer made from the passion desir perhap to have the same confirm by experi let him therefor consid with himself when take a journei he arm himself and seek to go well accompani when go to sleep he lock hi dore when even in hi hous he lock hi chest and thi when he know there bee law and publik offic arm to reveng all injuri shall bee done him what opinion he ha of hi fellow subject when he ride arm of hi fellow citizen when he lock hi dore and of hi children and servant when he lock hi chest doe he not there as much accus mankind by hi action as i do by my word but neither of us accus man natur in it the desir and other passion of man ar in themselv no sin no more ar the action that proce from those passion till thei know a law that forbid them which till law be made thei cannot know nor can ani law be made till thei have agre upon the person that shall make it it mai peradventur be thought there wa never such a time nor condit of warr as thi and i believ it wa never gener so over all the world but there ar mani place where thei live so now for the savag peopl in mani place of america except the govern of small famili the concord whereof dependeth on natural lust have no govern at all and live at thi dai in that brutish manner as i said befor howsoev it mai be perceiv what manner of life there would be where there were no common power to fear by the manner of life which men that have formerli live under a peaceful govern us to degener into in a civil warr but though there had never been ani time wherein particular men were in a condit of warr on against anoth yet in all time king and person of soveraign author becaus of their independ ar in continual jealousi and in the state and postur of gladiat have their weapon point and their ey fix on on anoth that is their fort garrison and gun upon the frontier of their kingdom and continual spye upon their neighbour which is a postur of war but becaus thei uphold therebi the industri of their subject there doe not follow from it that miseri which accompani the liberti of particular men in such a warr noth is unjust to thi warr of everi man against everi man thi also is consequ that noth can be unjust the notion of right and wrong justic and injustic have there no place where there is no common power there is no law where no law no injustic forc and fraud ar in warr the two cardinal vertu justic and injustic ar none of the faculti neither of the bodi nor mind if thei were thei might be in a man that were alon in the world as well as hi sens and passion thei ar qualiti that relat to men in societi not in solitud it is consequ also to the same condit that there be no proprieti no dominion no mine and thine distinct but on that to be everi man that he can get and for so long as he can keep it and thu much for the ill condit which man by meer natur is actual place in though with a possibl to come out of it consist partli in the passion partli in hi reason the passion that inclin men to peac the passion that enclin men to peac ar fear of death desir of such thing as ar necessari to commodi live and a hope by their industri to obtain them and reason suggesteth conveni articl of peac upon which men mai be drawn to agreement these articl ar thei which otherwis ar call the law of natur whereof i shall speak more particularli in the two follow chapter chapter xiv of the first and second natural law and of contract right of natur what the right of natur which writer commonli call ju natural is the liberti each man hath to us hi own power as he will himself for the preserv of hi own natur that is to sai of hi own life and consequ of do ani thing which in hi own judgement and reason hee shall conceiv to be the aptest mean thereunto liberti what by liberti is understood accord to the proper signif of the word the absenc of external impedi which impedi mai oft take awai part of a man power to do what hee would but cannot hinder him from us the power left him accord as hi judgement and reason shall dictat to him a law of natur what a law of natur lex naturali is a precept or general rule found out by reason by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destruct of hi life or taketh awai the mean of preserv the same and to omit that by which he thinketh it mai be best preserv for though thei that speak of thi subject us to confound ju and lex right and law yet thei ought to be distinguish becaus right consisteth in liberti to do or to forbear wherea law determineth and bindeth to on of them so that law and right differ as much as oblig and liberti which in on and the same matter ar inconsist natur everi man ha right to everyth and becaus the condit of man as hath been declar in the preced chapter is a condit of warr of everi on against everi on in which case everi on is govern by hi own reason and there is noth he can make us of that mai not be a help unto him in preserv hi life against hi enemy it followeth that in such a condit everi man ha a right to everi thing even to on anoth bodi and therefor as long as thi natural right of everi man to everi thing endureth there can be no secur to ani man how strong or wise soever he be of live out the time which natur ordinarili alloweth men to live the fundament law of natur and consequ it is a precept or general rule of reason that everi man ought to endeavour peac as farr as he ha hope of obtain it and when he cannot obtain it that he mai seek and us all help and advantag of warr the first branch of which rule containeth the first and fundamental law of natur which is to seek peac and follow it the second the summ of the right of natur which is by all mean we can to defend our selv the second law of natur from thi fundamental law of natur by which men ar command to endeavour peac is deriv thi second law that a man be will when other ar so too as farreforth as for peac and defenc of himself he shall think it necessari to lai down thi right to all thing and be content with so much liberti against other men as he would allow other men against himself for as long as everi man holdeth thi right of do ani thing he liketh so long ar all men in the condit of warr but if other men will not lai down their right as well as he then there is no reason for ani on to devest himself of hi for that were to expos himself to prei which no man is bound to rather than to dispos himself to peac thi is that law of the gospel whatsoev you requir that other should do to you that do ye to them and that law of all men quod tibi feiri non vi alteri ne feceri what it is to lai down a right to lai down a man right to ani thing is to devest himself of the liberti of hindr anoth of the benefit of hi own right to the same for he that renounceth or passeth awai hi right giveth not to ani other man a right which he had not befor becaus there is noth to which everi man had not right by natur but on standeth out of hi wai that he mai enjoi hi own original right without hindranc from him not without hindranc from anoth so that the effect which redoundeth to on man by anoth man defect of right is but so much diminut of impedi to the us of hi own right original renounc or transfer right what oblig duti justic right is layd asid either by simpli renounc it or by transfer it to anoth by simpli renounc when he care not to whom the benefit thereof redoundeth by transfer when he intendeth the benefit thereof to some certain person or person and when a man hath in either manner abandon or grant awai hi right then is he said to be oblig or bound not to hinder those to whom such right is grant or abandon from the benefit of it and that he ought and it hi duti not to make voyd that voluntari act of hi own and that such hindranc is injustic and injuri as be sine jure the right be befor renounc or transfer so that injuri or injustic in the controversi of the world is somewhat like to that which in the disput of scholer is call absurd for as it is there call an absurd to contradict what on maintain in the begin so in the world it is call injustic and injuri voluntarili to undo that which from the begin he had voluntarili done the wai by which a man either simpli renounceth or transferreth hi right is a declar or signif by some voluntari and suffici sign or sign that he doth so renounc or transferr or hath so renounc or transfer the same to him that accepteth it and these sign ar either word on or action on or as it happeneth most often both word and action and the same ar the bond by which men ar bound and oblig bond that have their strength not from their own natur for noth is more easili broken then a man word but from fear of some evil consequ upon the ruptur not all right ar alien whensoev a man transferreth hi right or renounceth it it is either in consider of some right reciproc transfer to himself or for some other good he hopeth for therebi for it is a voluntari act and of the voluntari act of everi man the object is some good to himself and therefor there be some right which no man can be understood by ani word or other sign to have abandon or transfer as first a man cannot lai down the right of resist them that assault him by forc to take awai hi life becaus he cannot be understood to aym therebi at ani good to himself the same mai be sayd of wound and chayn and imprison both becaus there is no benefit consequ to such patienc as there is to the patienc of suffer anoth to be wound or imprison as also becaus a man cannot tell when he seeth men proce against him by violenc whether thei intend hi death or not and lastli the motiv and end for which thi renounc and transfer or right is introduc is noth els but the secur of a man person in hi life and in the mean of so preserv life as not to be weari of it and therefor if a man by word or other sign seem to despoyl himself of the end for which those sign were intend he is not to be understood as if he meant it or that it wa hi will but that he wa ignor of how such word and action were to be interpret contract what the mutual transfer of right is that which men call contract there is differ between transfer of right to the thing and transfer or tradit that is deliveri of the thing it self for the thing mai be deliv togeth with the translat of the right as in bui and sell with readi moni or exchang of good or land and it mai be deliv some time after coven what again on of the contractor mai deliv the thing contract for on hi part and leav the other to perform hi part at some determin time after and in the mean time be trust and then the contract on hi part is call pact or coven or both part mai contract now to perform hereaft in which case he that is to perform in time to come be trust hi perform is call keep of promis or faith and the fayl of perform if it be voluntari violat of faith freegift when the transfer of right is not mutual but on of the parti transferreth in hope to gain therebi friendship or servic from anoth or from hi friend or in hope to gain the reput of chariti or magnanim or to deliv hi mind from the pain of compass or in hope of reward in heaven thi is not contract but gift freegift grace which word signifi on and the same thing sign of contract express sign of contract ar either express or by infer express ar word spoken with understand of what thei signifi and such word ar either of the time present or past as i give i grant i have given i have grant i will that thi be your or of the futur as i will give i will grant which word of the futur ar call promis sign of contract by infer sign by infer ar sometim the consequ of word sometim the consequ of silenc sometim the consequ of action sometim the consequ of forbear an action and gener a sign by infer of ani contract is whatsoev suffici argu the will of the contractor free gift passeth by word of the present or past word alon if thei be of the time to come and contain a bare promis ar an insuffici sign of a freegift and therefor not obligatori for if thei be of the time to come as to morrow i will give thei ar a sign i have not given yet and consequ that my right is not transfer but remaineth till i transferr it by some other act but if the word be of the time present or past as i have given or do give to be deliv to morrow then is my to morrow right given awai to dai and that by the vertu of the word though there were no other argument of my will and there is a great differ in the signif of these word volo hoc tuum ess cra and cro dabo that is between i will that thi be thine to morrow and i will give it to thee to morrow for the word i will in the former manner of speech signifi an act of the will present but in the later it signifi a promis of an act of the will to come and therefor the former word be of the present transferr a futur right the later that be of the futur transferr noth but if there be other sign of the will to transferr a right besid word then though the gift be free yet mai the right be understood to pass by word of the futur as if a man propound a prize to him that come first to the end of a race the gift is free and though the word be of the futur yet the right passeth for if he would not have hi word so be understood he should not have let them runn sign of contract ar word both of the past present and futur in contract the right passeth not on where the word ar of the time present or past but also where thei ar of the futur becaus all contract is mutual translat or chang of right and therefor he that promiseth on becaus he hath alreadi receiv the benefit for which he promiseth is to be understood as if he intend the right should pass for unless he had been content to have hi word so understood the other would not have perform hi part first and for that caus in bui and sell and other act of contract a promis is equival to a coven and therefor obligatori merit what he that performeth first in the case of a contract is said to merit that which he is to receiv by the perform of the other and he hath it as due also when a prize is propound to mani which is to be given to him on that winneth or moni is thrown amongst mani to be enjoi by them that catch it though thi be a free gift yet so to win or so to catch is to merit and to have it as due for the right is transfer in the propound of the prize and in throw down the moni though it be not determin to whom but by the event of the content but there is between these two sort of merit thi differ that in contract i merit by vertu of my own power and the contractor need but in thi case of free gift i am enabl to merit on by the benign of the giver in contract i merit at the contractor hand that hee should depart with hi right in thi case of gift i merit not that the giver should part with hi right but that when he ha part with it it should be mine rather than anoth and thi i think to be the mean of that distinct of the school between meritum congrui and meritum condigni for god almighti have promis paradis to those men hoodwinkt with carnal desir that can walk through thi world accord to the precept and limit prescrib by him thei sai he that shall so walk shall merit paradis ex congruo but becaus no man can demand a right to it by hi own righteousness or ani other power in himself but by the free grace of god on thei sai no man can merit paradis ex condigno thi i sai i think is the mean of that distinct but becaus disput do not agre upon the signif of their own term of art longer than it serv their turn i will not affirm ani thing of their mean on thi i sai when a gift is given indefinit as a prize to be contend for he that winneth meriteth and mai claim the prize as due coven of mutual trust when invalid if a coven be made wherein neither of the parti perform present but trust on anoth in the condit of meer natur which is a condit of warr of everi man against everi man upon ani reason suspit it is voyd but if there be a common power set over them both with right and forc suffici to compel perform it is not voyd for he that performeth first ha no assur the other will perform after becaus the bond of word ar too weak to bridl men ambit avaric anger and other passion without the fear of some coerceiv power which in the condit of meer natur where all men ar equal and judg of the justness of their own fear cannot possibl be suppos and therefor he which performeth first doe but betrai himself to hi enemi contrari to the right he can never abandon of defend hi life and mean of live but in a civil estat where there is a power set up to constrain those that would otherwis violat their faith that fear is no more reason and for that caus he which by the coven is to perform first is oblig so to do the caus of fear which maketh such a coven invalid must be alway someth aris after the coven made as some new fact or other sign of the will not to perform els it cannot make the coven voyd for that which could not hinder a man from promis ought not to be admit as a hindranc of perform right to the end containeth right to the mean he that transferreth ani right transferreth the mean of enjoi it as farr as lyeth in hi power as he that selleth land is understood to transferr the herbag and whatsoev grow upon it nor can he that sell a mill turn awai the stream that drive it and thei that give to a man the right of govern in soveraignti ar understood to give him the right of levi moni to maintain souldier and of appoint magistr for the administr of justic no coven with beast to make coven with bruit beast is imposs becaus not understand our speech thei understand not nor accept of ani translat of right nor can translat ani right to anoth and without mutual accept there is no coven nor with god without special revel to make coven with god is imposs but by mediat of such as god speaketh to either by revel supernatural or by hi lieuten that govern under him and in hi name for otherwis we know not whether our coven be accept or not and therefor thei that vow ani thing contrari to ani law of natur vow in vain as be a thing unjust to pai such vow and if it be a thing command by the law of natur it is not the vow but the law that bind them no coven but of possibl and futur the matter or subject of a coven is alway someth that falleth under deliber for to coven is an act of the will that is to sai an act and the last act of deliber and is therefor alway understood to be someth to come and which is judg possibl for him that covenanteth to perform and therefor to promis that which is known to be imposs is no coven but if that prove imposs afterward which befor wa thought possibl the coven is valid and bindeth though not to the thing it self yet to the valu or if that also be imposs to the unfeign endeavour of perform as much as is possibl for to more no man can be oblig coven how made voyd men ar freed of their coven two way by perform or by be forgiven for perform is the natural end of oblig and forgiveness the restitut of liberti as be a retransf of that right in which the oblig consist coven extort by fear ar valid coven entr into by fear in the condit of meer natur ar obligatori for exampl if i coven to pai a ransom or servic for my life to an enemi i am bound by it for it is a contract wherein on receiveth the benefit of life the other is to receiv moni or servic for it and consequ where no other law as in the condit of meer natur forbiddeth the perform the coven is valid therefor prison of warr if trust with the payment of their ransom ar oblig to pai it and if a weaker princ make a disadvantag peac with a stronger for fear he is bound to keep it unless as hath been sayd befor there ariseth some new and just caus of fear to renew the war and even in commonwealth if i be forc to redeem my self from a theef by promis him moni i am bound to pai it till the civil law discharg me for whatsoev i mai lawfulli do without oblig the same i mai lawfulli coven to do through fear and what i lawfulli coven i cannot lawfulli break the former coven to on make voyd the later to anoth a former coven make voyd a later for a man that hath pass awai hi right to on man to dai hath it not to pass to morrow to anoth and therefor the later promis passeth no right but is null a man coven not to defend himself is voyd a coven not to defend my self from forc by forc is alway voyd for as i have shew befor no man can transferr or lai down hi right to save himself from death wound and imprison the avoyd whereof is the on end of lai down ani right and therefor the promis of not resist forc in no coven transferreth ani right nor is oblig for though a man mai coven thu unless i do so or so kill me he cannot coven thu unless i do so or so i will not resist you when you come to kill me for man by natur chooseth the lesser evil which is danger of death in resist rather than the greater which is certain and present death in not resist and thi is grant to be true by all men in that thei lead crimin to execut and prison with arm men notwithstand that such crimin have consent to the law by which thei ar condemn no man oblig to accus himself a coven to accus on self without assur of pardon is likewis invalid for in the condit of natur where everi man is judg there is no place for accus and in the civil state the accus is follow with punish which be forc a man is not oblig not to resist the same is also true of the accus of those by whose condemn a man fall into miseri as of a father wife or benefactor for the testimoni of such an accus if it be not willingli given is praesum to be corrupt by natur and therefor not to be receiv and where a man testimoni is not to be credit hi not bound to give it also accus upon tortur ar not to be reput as testimoni for tortur is to be us but as mean of conjectur and light in the further examin and search of truth and what is in that case confess tendeth to the eas of him that is tortur not to the inform of the tortur and therefor ought not to have the credit of a suffici testimoni for whether he deliv himself by true or fals accus he doe it by the right of preserv hi own life the end of an oath the form of as oath the forc of word be as i have formerli note too weak to hold men to the perform of their coven there ar in man natur but two imagin help to strengthen it and those ar either a fear of the consequ of break their word or a glori or pride in appear not to need to break it thi later is a generos too rare found to be presum on especi in the pursuer of wealth command or sensual pleasur which ar the greatest part of mankind the passion to be reckon upon is fear whereof there be two veri general object on the power of spirit invis the other the power of those men thei shall therein offend of these two though the former be the greater power yet the fear of the later is commonli the greater fear the fear of the former is in everi man hi own religion which hath place in the natur of man befor civil societi the later hath not so at least not place enough to keep men to their promis becaus in the condit of meer natur the inequ of power is not discern but by the event of battel so that befor the time of civil societi or in the interrupt thereof by warr there is noth can strengthen a coven of peac agre on against the temptat of avaric ambit lust or other strong desir but the fear of that invis power which thei everi on worship as god and fear as a reveng of their perfidi all therefor that can be done between two men not subject to civil power is to put on anoth to swear by the god he feareth which swear or oath is a form of speech ad to a promis by which he that promiseth signifieth that unless he perform he renounceth the merci of hi god or calleth to him for vengeanc on himself such wa the heathen form let jupit kill me els as i kill thi beast so is our form i shall do thu and thu so help me god and thi with the rite and ceremoni which everi on useth in hi own religion that the fear of break faith might be the greater no oath but by god by thi it appear that an oath taken accord to ani other form or rite then hi that sweareth is in vain and no oath and there is no swear by ani thing which the swearer think not god for though men have sometim us to swear by their king for fear or flatteri yet thei would have it therebi understood thei attribut to them divin honour and that swear unnecessarili by god is but prophan of hi name and swear by other thing as men do in common discours is not swear but an impiou custom gotten by too much vehem of talk an oath add noth to the oblig it appear also that the oath add noth to the oblig for a coven if lawful bind in the sight of god without the oath as much as with it if unlawful bindeth not at all though it be confirm with an oath chapter xv of other law of natur the third law of natur justic from that law of natur by which we ar oblig to transferr to anoth such right as be retain hinder the peac of mankind there followeth a third which is thi that men perform their coven made without which coven ar in vain and but empti word and the right of all men to all thing remain wee ar still in the condit of warr justic and injustic what and in thi law of natur consisteth the fountain and original of justic for where no coven hath preced there hath no right been transfer and everi man ha right to everi thing and consequ no action can be unjust but when a coven is made then to break it is unjust and the definit of injustic is no other than the not perform of coven and whatsoev is not unjust is just justic and proprieti begin with the constitut of commonwealth but becaus coven of mutual trust where there is a fear of not perform on either part as hath been said in the former chapter ar invalid though the original of justic be the make of coven yet injustic actual there can be none till the caus of such fear be taken awai which while men ar in the natural condit of warr cannot be done therefor befor the name of just and unjust can have place there must be some coerciv power to compel men equal to the perform of their coven by the terrour of some punish greater than the benefit thei expect by the breach of their coven and to make good that proprieti which by mutual contract men acquir in recomp of the universal right thei abandon and such power there is none befor the erect of a commonwealth and thi is also to be gather out of the ordinari definit of justic in the school for thei sai that justic is the constant will of give to everi man hi own and therefor where there is no own that is no proprieti there is no injustic and where there is no coerceiv power erect that is where there is no commonwealth there is no proprieti all men have right to all thing therefor where there is no commonwealth there noth is unjust so that the natur of justic consisteth in keep of valid coven but the valid of coven begin not but with the constitut of a civil power suffici to compel men to keep them and then it is also that proprieti begin justic not contrari to reason the fool hath sayd in hi heart there is no such thing as justic and sometim also with hi tongu serious alleag that everi man conserv and content be commit to hi own care there could be no reason why everi man might not do what he thought conduc thereunto and therefor also to make or not make keep or not keep coven wa not against reason when it conduc to on benefit he doe not therein deni that there be coven and that thei ar sometim broken sometim kept and that such breach of them mai be call injustic and the observ of them justic but he questioneth whether injustic take awai the fear of god for the same fool hath said in hi heart there is no god mai not sometim stand with that reason which dictateth to everi man hi own good and particularli then when it conduceth to such a benefit as shall put a man in a condit to neglect not on the disprais and revil but also the power of other men the kingdom of god is gotten by violenc but what if it could be gotten by unjust violenc were it against reason so to get it when it is imposs to receiv hurt by it and if it be not against reason it is not against justic or els justic is not to be approv for good from such reason as thi succesful wickedness hath obtain the name of vertu and some that in all other thing have disallow the violat of faith yet have allow it when it is for the get of a kingdom and the heathen that believ that saturn wa depos by hi son jupit believ nevertheless the same jupit to be the aveng of injustic somewhat like to a piec of law in coke commentari on litleton where he say if the right heir of the crown be attaint of treason yet the crown shall descend to him and eo instant the atteynd be voyd from which instanc a man will be veri prone to inferr that when the heir appar of a kingdom shall kill him that is in possess though hi father you mai call it injustic or by what other name you will yet it can never be against reason see all the voluntari action of men tend to the benefit of themselv and those action ar most reason that conduc most to their end thi speciou reason is nevertheless fals for the question is not of promis mutual where there is no secur of perform on either side as when there is no civil power erect over the parti promis for such promis ar no coven but either where on of the parti ha perform alreadi or where there is a power to make him perform there is the question whether it be against reason that is against the benefit of the other to perform or not and i sai it is not against reason for the manifest whereof we ar to consid first that when a man doth a thing which notwithstand ani thing can be foreseen and reckon on tendeth to hi own destruct howsoev some accid which he could not expect arriv mai turn it to hi benefit yet such event do not make it reason or wise done secondli that in a condit of warr wherein everi man to everi man for want of a common power to keep them all in aw is an enemi there is no man can hope by hi own strength or wit to defend himself from destruct without the help of confeder where everi on expect the same defenc by the confeder that ani on els doe and therefor he which declar he think it reason to deceiv those that help him can in reason expect no other mean of safeti than what can be had from hi own singl power he therefor that breaketh hi coven and consequ declareth that he think he mai with reason do so cannot be receiv into ani societi that unit themselv for peac and defenc but by the errour of them that receiv him nor when he is receiv be retayn in it without see the danger of their errour which errour a man cannot reason reckon upon as the mean of hi secur and therefor if he be left or cast out of societi he perisheth and if he live in societi it is by the errour of other men which he could not forese nor reckon upon and consequ against the reason of hi preserv and so as all men that contribut not to hi destruct forbear him on out of ignor of what is good for themselv as for the instanc of gain the secur and perpetual felic of heaven by ani wai it is frivol there be but on wai imagin and that is not break but keep of coven and for the other instanc of attain soveraignti by rebellion it is manifest that though the event follow yet becaus it cannot reason be expect but rather the contrari and becaus by gain it so other ar taught to gain the same in like manner the attempt thereof is against reason justic therefor that is to sai keep of coven is a rule of reason by which we ar forbidden to do ani thing destruct to our life and consequ a law of natur there be some that proce further and will not have the law of natur to be those rule which conduc to the preserv of man life on earth but to the attain of an eternal felic after death to which thei think the breach of coven mai conduc and consequ be just and reason such ar thei that think it a work of merit to kill or depos or rebel against the soveraign power constitut over them by their own consent but becaus there is no natural knowledg of man estat after death much less of the reward that is then to be given to breach of faith but on a belief ground upon other men sai that thei know it supernatur or that thei know those that knew them that knew other that knew it supernatur breach of faith cannot be call a precept of reason or natur coven not discharg by the vice of the person to whom made other that allow for a law of natur the keep of faith do nevertheless make except of certain person as heretiqu and such as us not to perform their coven to other and thi also is against reason for if ani fault of a man be suffici to discharg our coven made the same ought in reason to have been suffici to have hindr the make of it justic of men and justic of action what the name of just and unjust when thei ar attribut to men signifi on thing and when thei ar attribut to action anoth when thei ar attribut to men thei signifi conform or inconform of manner to reason but when thei ar attribut to action thei signifi the conform or inconform to reason not of manner or manner of life but of particular action a just man therefor is he that taketh all the care he can that hi action mai be all just and an unjust man is he that neglecteth it and such men ar more often in our languag stile by the name of righteou and unright then just and unjust though the mean be the same therefor a righteou man doe not lose that titl by on or a few unjust action that proce from sudden passion or mistak of thing or person nor doe an unright man lose hi charact for such action as he doe of forbear to do for fear becaus hi will is not frame by the justic but by the appar benefit of what he is to do that which give to human action the relish of justic is a certain nobleness or gallantness of courag rare found by which a man scorn to be behold for the content of hi life to fraud or breach of promis thi justic of the manner is that which is meant where justic is call a vertu and injustic a vice but the justic of action denomin men not just but guiltless and the injustic of the same which is also call injuri give them but the name of guilti justic of manner and justic of action again the injustic of manner is the disposit or aptitud to do injuri and is injustic befor it proce to act and without suppos ani individual person injur but the injustic of an action that is to sai injuri supposeth an individual person injur name him to whom the coven wa made and therefor mani time the injuri is receiv by on man when the dammag redoundeth to anoth as when the master commandeth hi servant to give moni to a stranger if it be not done the injuri is done to the master whom he had befor coven to obei but the dammag redoundeth to the stranger to whom he had no oblig and therefor could not injur him and so also in commonwealth privat men mai remit to on anoth their debt but not robberi or other violenc wherebi thei ar endammag becaus the detain of debt is an injuri to themselv but robberi and violenc ar injuri to the person of the commonwealth noth done to a man by hi own consent can be injuri whatsoev is done to a man conform to hi own will signifi to the doer is no injuri to him for if he that doeth it hath not pass awai hi original right to do what he pleas by some anteced coven there is no breach of coven and therefor no injuri done him and if he have then hi will to have it done be signifi is a releas of that coven and so again there is no injuri done him justic commut and distribut justic of action is by writer divid into commut and distribut and the former thei sai consisteth in proport arithmetical the later in proport geometrical commut therefor thei place in the equal of valu of the thing contract for and distribut in the distribut of equal benefit to men of equal merit as if it were injustic to sell dearer than we bui or to give more to a man than he merit the valu of all thing contract for is measur by the appetit of the contractor and therefor the just valu is that which thei be content to give and merit besid that which is by coven where the perform on on part meriteth the perform of the other part and fall under justic commut not distribut is not due by justic but is reward of grace on and therefor thi distinct in the sens wherein it useth to be expound is not right to speak properli commut justic is the justic of a contractor that is a perform of coven in bui and sell hire and let to hire lend and borrow exchang barter and other act of contract and distribut justic the justic of an arbitr that is to sai the act of defin what is just wherein be trust by them that make him arbitr if he perform hi trust he is said to distribut to everi man hi own and hi is inde just distribut and mai be call though improperli distribut justic but more properli equiti which also is a law of natur as shall be shewn in due place the fourth law of natur gratitud as justic dependeth on anteced coven so doe gratitud depend on anteced grace that is to sai anteced freegift and is the fourth law of natur which mai be conceiv in thi form that a man which receiveth benefit from anoth of meer grace endeavour that he which giveth it have no reason caus to repent him of hi good will for no man giveth but with intent of good to himself becaus gift is voluntari and of all voluntari act the object is to everi man hi own good of which if men see thei shall be frustrat there will be no begin of benevol or trust nor consequ of mutual help nor of reconcili of on man to anoth and therefor thei ar to remain still in the condit of war which is contrari to the first and fundamental law of natur which commandeth men to seek peac the breach of thi law is call ingratitud and hath the same relat to grace that injustic hath to oblig by coven the fifth mutual accommod or compleas a fifth law of natur is compleas that is to sai that everi man strive to accommod himself to the rest for the understand whereof we mai consid that there is in men aptness to societi a divers of natur rise from their divers of affect not unlik to that we see in stone brought togeth for build of an aedific for as that stone which by the asper and irregular of figur take more room from other than it self fill and for the hardness cannot be easili made plain and therebi hindereth the build is by the builder cast awai as unprofit and troublesom so also a man that by asper of natur will strive to retain those thing which to himself ar superflu and to other necessari and for the stubborn of hi passion cannot be correct is to be left or cast out of societi as combersom thereunto for see everi man not on by right but also by necess of natur is suppos to endeavour all he can to obtain that which is necessari for hi conserv he that shall oppos himself against it for thing superflu is guilti of the warr that thereupon is to follow and therefor doth that which is contrari to the fundamental law of natur which commandeth to seek peac the observ of thi law mai be call sociabl the latin call them commodi the contrari stubborn insoci froward intract the sixth facil to pardon a sixth law of natur is thi that upon caution of the futur time a man ought to pardon the offenc past of them that repent desir it for pardon is noth but grant of peac which though grant to them that persever in their hostil be not peac but fear yet not grant to them that give caution of the futur time is sign of an avers to peac and therefor contrari to the law of natur the seventh that in reveng men respect on the futur good a seventh is that in reveng that is retribut of evil for evil men look not at the greatness of the evil past but the greatness of the good to follow wherebi we ar forbidden to inflict punish with ani other design than for correct of the offend or direct of other for thi law is consequ to the next befor it that commandeth pardon upon secur of the futur time besid reveng without respect to the exampl and profit to come is a triumph or glori in the hurt of anoth tend to no end for the end is alway somewhat to come and glori to no end is vainglori and contrari to reason and to hurt without reason tendeth to the introduct of warr which is against the law of natur and is commonli stile by the name of cruelti the eighth against contum and becaus all sign of hatr or contempt provok to fight insomuch as most men choos rather to hazard their life than not to be reveng we mai in the eighth place for a law of natur set down thi precept that no man by deed word counten or gestur declar hatr or contempt of anoth the breach of which law is commonli call contum the ninth against pride the question who is the better man ha no place in the condit of meer natur where as ha been shewn befor all men ar equal the inequal that now is ha been introduc by the law civil i know that aristotl in the first book of hi politiqu for a foundat of hi doctrin maketh men by natur some more worthi to command mean the wiser sort such as he thought himself to be for hi philosophi other to serv mean those that had strong bodi but were not philosoph as he as if master and servant were not introduc by consent of men but by differ of wit which is not onli against reason but also against experi for there ar veri few so foolish that had not rather govern themselv than be govern by other nor when the wise in their own conceit contend by forc with them who distrust their own wisdom do thei alwai or often or almost at ani time get the victori if natur therefor have made men equal that equaliti is to be acknowledg or if natur have made men unequal yet becaus men that think themselv equal will not enter into condit of peac but upon equal term such equaliti must be admit and therefor for the ninth law of natur i put thi that everi man acknowledg other for hi equal by natur the breach of thi precept is pride the tenth against arrog on thi law dependeth anoth that at the entranc into condit of peac no man requir to reserv to himself ani right which he is not content should be reserv to everi on of the rest as it is necessari for all men that seek peac to lai down certain right of natur that is to sai not to have liberti to do all thei list so is it necessari for man life to retain some as right to govern their own bodi enjoi air water motion wai to go from place to place and all thing els without which a man cannot live or not live well if in thi case at the make of peac men requir for themselv that which thei would not have to be grant to other thei do contrari to the preced law that commandeth the acknowledg of natural equaliti and therefor also against the law of natur the observ of thi law ar those we call modest and the breaker arrog men the greek call the violat of thi law pleonexia that is a desir of more than their share the eleventh equiti also if a man be trust to judg between man and man it is a precept of the law of natur that he deal equal between them for without that the controversi of men cannot be determin but by warr he therefor that is partial in judgment doth what in him li to deterr men from the us of judg and arbitr and consequ against the fundamental law of natur is the caus of warr the observ of thi law from the equal distribut to each man of that which in reason belongeth to him is call equiti and as i have sayd befor distribut justic the violat accept of person prosopolepsia the twelfth equal us of thing common and from thi followeth anoth law that such thing as cannot be divid be enjoi in common if it can be and if the quantiti of the thing permit without stint otherwis proportion to the number of them that have right for otherwis the distribut is unequal and contrari to equiti the thirteenth of lot but some thing there be that can neither be divid nor enjoi in common then the law of natur which prescribeth equiti requireth that the entir right or els make the us altern the first possess be determin by lot for equal distribut is of the law of natur and other mean of equal distribut cannot be imagin the fourteenth of primogenitur and first seis of lot there be two sort arbitrari and natural arbitrari is that which is agre on by the competitor natural is either primogenitur which the greek call kleronomia which signifi given by lot or first seisur and therefor those thing which cannot be enjoi in common nor divid ought to be adjudg to the first possessor and is some case to the firstborn as acquir by lot the fifteenth of mediat it is also a law of natur that all men that mediat peac be allow safe conduct for the law that commandeth peac as the end commandeth intercess as the mean and to intercess the mean is safe conduct the sixteenth of submiss to arbitr and becaus though men be never so will to observ these law there mai nevertheless aris question concern a man action first whether it were done or not done secondli if done whether against the law or not against the law the former whereof is call a question of fact the later a question of right therefor unless the parti to the question coven mutual to stand to the sentenc of anoth thei ar as farr from peac as ever thi other to whose sentenc thei submit is call an arbitr and therefor it is of the law of natur that thei that ar at controversi submit their right to the judgement of an arbitr the seventeenth no man is hi own judg and see everi man is presum to do all thing in order to hi own benefit no man is a fit arbitr in hi own caus and if he were never so fit yet equiti allow to each parti equal benefit if on be admit to be judg the other is to be admit also so the controversi that is the caus of war remain against the law of natur the eighteenth no man to be judg that ha in him caus of partial for the same reason no man in ani caus ought to be receiv for arbitr to whom greater profit or honour or pleasur appar ariseth out of the victori of on parti than of the other for he hath taken though an unavoyd bribe yet a bribe and no man can be oblig to trust him and thu also the controversi and the condit of war remaineth contrari to the law of natur the nineteenth of witness and in a controversi of fact the judg be to give no more credit to on than to the other if there be no other argument must give credit to a third or to a third and fourth or more for els the question is undecid and left to forc contrari to the law of natur these ar the law of natur dictat peac for a mean of the conserv of men in multitud and which on concern the doctrin of civil societi there be other thing tend to the destruct of particular men as drunken and all other part of intemper which mai therefor also be reckon amongst those thing which the law of natur hath forbidden but ar not necessari to be mention nor ar pertin enough to thi place a rule by which the law of natur mai easili be examin and though thi mai seem too subtil a deduct of the law of natur to be taken notic of by all men whereof the most part ar too busi in get food and the rest too neglig to understand yet to leav all men unexcus thei have been contract into on easi sum intellig even to the meanest capac and that is do not that to anoth which thou wouldest not have done to thy self which sheweth him that he ha no more to do in learn the law of natur but when weigh the action of other men with hi own thei seem too heavi to put them into the other part of the ballanc and hi own into their place that hi own passion and selfelov mai add noth to the weight and then there is none of these law of natur that will not appear unto him veri reason the law of natur oblig in conscienc alway but in effect then on when there is secur the law of natur oblig in foro interno that is to sai thei bind to a desir thei should take place but in foro externo that is to the put them in act not alway for he that should be modest and tractabl and perform all he promis in such time and place where no man el should do so should but make himself a prei to other and procur hi own certain ruin contrari to the ground of all law of natur which tend to natur preserv and again he that shall observ the same law toward him observ them not himself seeketh not peac but war consequ the destruct of hi natur by violenc and whatsoev law bind in foro interno mai be broken not on by a fact contrari to the law but also by a fact accord to it in case a man think it contrari for though hi action in thi case be accord to the law which where the oblig is in foro interno is a breach the law of natur ar etern the law of natur ar immut and eternal for injustic ingratitud arrog pride iniqu accept of person and the rest can never be made lawful for it can never be that warr shall preserv life and peac destroi it and yet easi the same law becaus thei oblig on to a desir and endeavour i mean an unfeign and constant endeavour ar easi to be observ for in that thei requir noth but endeavour he that endeavoureth their perform fulfilleth them and he that fulfilleth the law is just the scienc of these law is the true moral philosophi and the scienc of them is the true and on moral philosophi for moral philosophi is noth els but the scienc of what is good and evil in the convers and societi of mankind good and evil ar name that signifi our appetit and avers which in differ temper custom and doctrin of men ar differ and diver men differ not on in their judgement on the sens of what is pleasant and unpleas to the tast smell hear touch and sight but also of what is conform or disagre to reason in the action of common life nai the same man in diver time differ from himself and on time praiseth that is calleth good what anoth time he dispraiseth and calleth evil from whenc aris disput controversi and at last war and therefor so long as man is in the condit of meer natur which is a condit of war as privat appetit is the measur of good and evil and consequ all men agre on thi that peac is good and therefor also the wai or mean of peac which as i have shew befor ar justic gratitud modesti equiti merci the rest of the law of natur ar good that is to sai moral vertu and their contrari vice evil now the scienc of vertu and vice is moral philosophi and therfor the true doctrin of the law of natur is the true moral philosophi but the writer of moral philosophi though thei acknowledg the same vertu and vice yet not see wherein consist their goodness nor that thei come to be prais as the mean of peaceabl sociabl and comfort live place them in a mediocr of passion as if not the caus but the degre of dare made fortitud or not the caus but the quantiti of a gift made liber these dictat of reason men us to call by the name of law but improperli for thei ar but conclus or theorem concern what conduceth to the conserv and defenc of themselv wherea law properli is the word of him that by right hath command over other but yet if we consid the same theorem as deliv in the word of god that by right commandeth all thing then ar thei properli call law chapter xvi of person author and thing person a person what a person is he whose word or action ar consid either as hi own or as repres the word or action of an other man or of ani other thing to whom thei ar attribut whether truli or by fiction person natural and artificial when thei ar consid as hi own then is he call a natural person and when thei ar consid as repres the word and action of an other then is he a feign or artificial person the word person whenc the word person is latin instead whereof the greek have prosopon which signifi the face as persona in latin signifi the disguis or outward appear of a man counterfeit on the stage and somtim more particularli that part of it which disguiseth the face as a mask or visard and from the stage hath been translat to ani represent of speech and action as well in tribunal as theater so that a person is the same that an actor is both on the stage and in common convers and to person is to act or repres himself or an other and he that acteth anoth is said to bear hi person or act in hi name in which senc cicero useth it where he sai unu sustineo tre persona mei adversarii judici i bear three person my own my adversari and the judg and is call in divers occas diversli as a represent or repres a lieuten a vicar an attornei a deputi a procur an actor and the like actor author author of person artificial some have their word and action own by those whom thei repres and then the person is the actor and he that owneth hi word and action is the author in which case the actor acteth by author for that which in speak of good and possess is call an owner and in latin dominu in greek kurio speak of action is call author and as the right of possess is call dominion so the right of do ani action is call author so that by author is alway understood a right of do ani act and done by author done by commiss or licenc from him whose right it is coven by author bind the author from henc it followeth that when the actor maketh a coven by author he bindeth therebi the author no less than if he had made it himself and no less subjecteth him to all the consequ of the same and therfor all that hath been said formerli chap of the natur of coven between man and man in their natural capac is true also when thei ar made by their actor represent or procur that have author from them so farforth as is in their commiss but no farther and therefor he that maketh a coven with the actor or represent not know the author he hath doth it at hi own peril for no man is oblig by a coven whereof he is not author nor consequ by a coven made against or besid the author he gave but not the actor when the actor doth ani thing against the law of natur by command of the author if he be oblig by former coven to obei him not he but the author breaketh the law of natur for though the action be against the law of natur yet it is not hi but contrarili to refus to do it is against the law of natur that forbiddeth breach of coven the author is to be shewn and he that maketh a coven with the author by mediat of the actor not know what author he hath but on take hi word in case such author be not made manifest unto him upon demand is no longer oblig for the coven made with the author is not valid without hi counterassur but if he that so covenanteth knew befor hand he wa to expect no other assur than the actor word then is the coven valid becaus the actor in thi case maketh himself the author and therefor as when the author is evid the coven obligeth the author not the actor so when the author is feign it obligeth the actor on there be no author but himself thing person inanim there ar few thing that ar uncap of be repres by fiction inanim thing as a church an hospit a bridg mai be person by a rector master or overs but thing inanim cannot be author nor therefor give author to their actor yet the actor mai have author to procur their mainten given them by those that ar owner or governour of those thing and therefor such thing cannot be person befor there be some state of civil govern irrat likewis children fool and madmen that have no us of reason mai be person by guardian or curat but can be no author dure that time of ani action done by them longer then when thei shall recov the us of reason thei shall judg the same reason yet dure the folli he that hath right of govern them mai give author to the guardian but thi again ha no place but in a state civil becaus befor such estat there is no dominion of person fals god an idol or meer figment of the brain my be person as were the god of the heathen which by such offic as the state appoint were person and held possess and other good and right which men from time to time dedic and consecr unto them but idol cannot be author for a idol is noth the author proceed from the state and therefor befor introduct of civil govern the god of the heathen could not be person the true god the true god mai be person as he wa first by mose who govern the israelit that were not hi but god peopl not in hi own name with hoc dicit mose but in god name with hoc dicit dominu secondli by the son of man hi own son our bless saviour jesu christ that came to reduc the jew and induc all nation into the kingdom of hi father not as of himself but as sent from hi father and thirdli by the holi ghost or

when thei ar by on man or on person repres so that it be done with the consent of everi on of that multitud in particular for it is the uniti of the represent not the uniti of the repres that maketh the person on and it is the represent that beareth the person and but on person and uniti cannot otherwis be understood in multitud everi on is author and becaus the multitud natur is not on but mani thei cannot be understood for on but mani author of everi thing their repres faith or doth in their name everi man give their common represent author from himself in particular and own all the action the represent doth in case thei give him author without stint otherwis when thei limit him in what and how farr he shall repres them none of them owneth more than thei gave him commiss to act an actor mai be mani men made on by plural of voyc and if the repres consist of mani men the voyc of the greater number must be consid as the voyc of them all for if the lesser number pronounc for exampl in the affirm and the greater in the neg there will be neg more than enough to destroi the affirm and therebi the excess of neg stand uncontradict ar the on voyc the repres hath repres when the number is even unprofit and a repres of even number especi when the number is not great wherebi the contradictori voyc ar oftentim equal is therefor oftentim mute and uncap of action yet in some case contradictori voyc equal in number mai determin a question as in condemn or absolv equal of vote even in that thei condemn not do absolv but not on the contrari condemn in that thei absolv not for when a caus is heard not to condemn is to absolv but on the contrari to sai that not absolv is condemn is not true the like it is in a deliber of execut present or defer till anoth time for when the voyc ar equal the not decre execut is a decre of dilat neg voyc or if the number be odd as three or more men or assembl whereof everi on ha by a neg voic author to take awai the effect of all the affirm voic of the rest thi number is no repres becaus by the divers of opinion and interest of men it becom oftentim and in case of the greatest consequ a mute person and unapt as for mai thing els so for the govern of a multitud especi in time of warr of author there be two sort the first simpli so call which i have befor defin to be him that owneth the action of anoth simpli the second is he that owneth an action or coven of anoth condition that is to sai he undertaketh to do it if the other doth it not at or befor a certain time and these author conditional ar gener call surety in latin

commonwealth particular secur the final caus end or design of men who natur love liberti and dominion over other in the introduct of that restraint upon themselv in which wee see them live in commonwealth is the foresight of their own preserv and of a more content life therebi that is to sai of get themselv out from that miser condit of warr which is necessarili consequ as hath been shewn to the natural passion of men when there is no visibl power to keep them in aw and tye them by fear of punish to the perform of their coven and observ of these law of natur set down in the fourteenth and fifteenth chapter which is not to be had from the law of natur for the law of natur as justic equiti modesti merci and in summ do to other as wee would be done to if themselv without the terrour of some power to caus them to be observ ar contrari to our natural passion that carri us to partial pride reveng and the like and coven without the sword ar but word and of no strength to secur a man

in after ag with honour nor from the conjunct of a few men or family nor is it the joyn togeth of a small number of men that give them thi secur becaus in small number small addit on the on side or the other make the advantag of strength so great as is suffici to carri the victori and therefor give encourag to an invas the multitud suffici to confid in for our secur is not determin by ani certain number but by comparison with the enemi we fear and is then suffici when the odd of the enemi is not of so visibl and conspicu moment to determin the event of warr as to move him to attempt

therebi no defenc nor protect neither against a common enemi nor against the injuri of on anoth for be distract in opinion concern the best us and applic of their strength thei do not help but hinder on anoth and reduc their strength by mutual opposit to noth wherebi thei ar easili not on subdu by a veri few that agre togeth but also when there is no common enemi thei make warr upon each other for their particular interest for if we could suppos a great multitud of men to consent in the observ of justic and other law of natur without a common power to keep them all in aw we might as well suppos all mankind to do the same and then there neither would be nor need to be ani civil govern or commonwealth at all becaus there would be peac without subject and that continu nor is it enough for the secur which men desir should last all the time of their life that thei be govern and direct by on judgement for a limit time as in on battel or on warr for though thei obtain a victori by their unanim endeavour against a forraign enemi yet afterward when either thei have no common enemi or he that by on part is held for an enemi is by anoth part held for a friend thei must need by the differ of their interest dissolv and fall again into a warr amongst themselv why certain creatur without reason or speech do nevertheless live in societi without ani coerciv power it is true that certain live creatur as bee and ant live sociabl on with anoth which ar therefor by aristotl numbr amongst political creatur and yet have no other direct than their particular judgement and appetit nor speech wherebi on of them can signifi to anoth what he think expedi for the common benefit and therefor some man mai perhap desir to know why mankind cannot do the same to which i answer first that men ar continu in competit for honour and digniti which these creatur ar not and consequ amongst men there ariseth on that ground envi and hatr and final warr but amongst these not so secondli that amongst these creatur the common good differeth not from the privat and be by natur enclin to their privat thei procur therebi the common benefit but man whose joi consisteth in compar himself with other men can relish noth but what is emin thirdli that these creatur have not as man the us of reason do not see nor think thei see ani fault in the administr of their common business wherea amongst men there ar veri mani that think themselv wiser and abler to govern the publiqu better than the rest and these strive to reform and innov on thi wai anoth that wai and therebi bring it into distract and civil warr fourthli that these creatur though thei have some us of voic in make known to on anoth their desir and other affect yet thei want that art of word by which some men can repres to other that which is good in the likeness of evil and evil in the likeness of good and augment or diminish the appar greatness of good and evil discont men and troubl their peac at their pleasur fiftli irrational creatur cannot distinguish between injuri and dammag and therefor as long as thei be at eas thei ar not offend with their fellow wherea man is then most troublesom when he is most at eas for then it is that he love to shew hi wisdom and controul the action of them that govern the commonwealth lastli the agreement of these creatur is natural that of men is by coven onli which is artificial and therefor it is no wonder if there be somewhat els requir besid coven to make their agreement constant and last which is a common power to keep them in aw and to direct their action to the common benefit the gener of a commonwealth the onli wai to erect such a common power as mai be abl to defend them from the invas of forraign and the injuri of on anoth and therebi to secur them in such sort as that by their own industri and by the fruit of the earth thei mai nourish themselv and live contentedli is to conferr all their power and strength upon on man or upon on assembl of men that mai reduc all their will by plural of voic unto on will which is as much as to sai to appoint on man or assembl of men to bear their person and everi on to own and acknowledg himself to be author of whatsoev he that so beareth their person shall act or caus to be act in those thing which concern the common peac and safeti and therein to submit their will everi on to hi will and their judgement to

man or assembl of men in the same manner as if thei were hi own to the end to live peaceabl amongst themselv and be protect against other men the consequ to such institut ar i the subject cannot chang the form of govern from thi institut of a commonwealth ar deriv all the right and faculty of him or them on whom the soveraign power is confer by the consent of the peopl assembl first becaus thei coven it is to be understood thei ar not oblig by former coven to ani thing repugn hereunto and consequ thei that have alreadi institut a commonwealth be therebi bound by coven to own the action and judgement of on cannot lawfulli make a new coven amongst themselv to be obedi to ani other in ani thing whatsoev without hi permiss and therefor thei that ar subject to a monarch cannot without hi leav cast off monarchi and return to the confus of a disunit multitud nor transferr their person from him that beareth it to anoth man or other assembl of men for thei ar bound everi man to everi man to own and be reput author of all that he that alreadi is their soveraign shall do and judg fit to be done so that ani on man dissent all the rest should break their coven made to that man which is injustic and thei have also everi man given the soveraignti to him that beareth their person and therefor if thei depos him thei take from him that which is hi own and so again it is injustic besid if he that attempteth to depos hi soveraign be kill or punish by him for such attempt he is author of hi own punish as be by the institut author of all hi soveraign shall do and becaus it is injustic for a man to do ani thing for which he mai be punish by hi own author he is also upon that titl unjust and wherea some men have pretend for their disobedi to their soveraign a new coven made not with men but with god thi also is unjust for there is no coven with god but by mediat of some bodi that representeth god person which none doth but god lieuten who hath the soveraignti under god but thi pretenc of coven with god is so evid a lye even in the pretend own conscienc that it is not on an act of an unjust but also of a vile and unmanli disposit soveraign power cannot be forfeit secondli becaus the right of bear the person of them all is given to him thei make soveraign by coven on of on to anoth and not of him to ani of them there can happen no breach of coven on the part of the soveraign and consequ none of hi subject by ani pretenc of forfeitur can be freed from hi subject that he which is made soveraign maketh no coven with hi subject beforehand is manifest becaus either he must make it with the whole multitud as on parti to the coven or he must make a several coven with everi man with the whole as on parti it is imposs becaus as yet thei ar not on person and if he make so mani several coven as there be men those coven after he hath the soveraignti ar voyd becaus what act soever can be pretend by ani on of them for breach thereof is the act both of himself and of all the rest becaus done in the person and by the right of everi on of them in particular besid if ani on or more of them pretend a breach of the coven made by the soveraign at hi institut and other or on other of hi subject or himself alon pretend there wa no such breach there is in thi case no judg to decid the controversi it return therefor to the sword again and everi man recovereth the right of protect himself by hi own strength contrari to the design thei had in the institut it is therefor in vain to grant soveraignti by wai of preced coven the opinion that ani monarch receiveth hi power by coven that is to sai on condit proceedeth from want of understand thi easi truth that coven be but word and breath have no forc to oblig contain constrain or protect ani man but what it ha from the publiqu sword that is from the unti hand of that man or assembl of men that hath the soveraignti and whose action ar avouch by them all and perform by the strength of them all in him unit but when an assembl of men is made soveraign then no man imagineth ani such coven to have past in the institut for no man is so dull as to sai for exampl the peopl of rome made a coven with the roman to hold the soveraignti on such or such condit which not perform the roman might lawfulli depos the roman peopl that men see not the reason to be alik in a monarchi and in a popular govern proceedeth from the ambit of some that ar kinder to the govern of an assembl whereof thei mai hope to particip than of monarchi which thei despair to enjoi no man can without injustic protest against the institut of the soveraign declar by the major part thirdli becaus the major part hath by consent voic declar a soveraign he that dissent must now consent with the rest that is be content to avow all the action he shall do or els justli be destroi by the rest for if he voluntarili enter into the congreg of them that were assembl he suffici declar therebi hi will and therefor tacit coven to stand to what the major part should ordayn and therefor if he refus to stand thereto or make protest against ani of their decre he doe contrari to hi coven and therfor unjustli and whether he be of the congreg or not and whether hi consent be ask or not he must either submit to their decre or be left in the condit of warr he wa in befor wherein he might without injustic be destroi by ani man whatsoev the soveraign action cannot be justli accus by the subject fourthli becaus everi subject is by thi institut author of all the action and judgement of the soveraign institut it follow that whatsoev he doth it can be no injuri to ani of hi subject nor ought he to be by ani of them accus of injustic for he that doth ani thing by author from anoth doth therein no injuri to him by whose author he acteth but by thi institut of a commonwealth everi particular man is author of all the soveraign doth and consequ he that complaineth of injuri from hi soveraign complaineth of that whereof he himself is author and therefor ought not to accus ani man but himself no nor himself of injuri becaus to do injuri to on self is imposs it is true that thei that have soveraign power mai commit iniqu but not injustic or injuri in the proper signif what soever the soveraign doth is unpunish by the subject fiftli and consequ to that which wa sayd last no man that hath soveraign power can justli be put to death or otherwis in ani manner by hi subject punish for see everi subject is author of the action of hi soveraign he punisheth anoth for the action commit by himself the soveraign is judg of what is necessari for the peac and defenc of hi subject and becaus the end of thi institut is the peac and defenc of them all and whosoev ha right to the end ha right to the mean it belongeth of right to whatsoev man or assembl that hath the soveraignti to be judg both of the mean of peac and defenc and also of the hindranc and disturb of the same and to do whatsoev he shall think necessari to be done both beforehand for the preserv of peac and secur by prevent of discord at home and hostil from abroad and when peac and secur ar lost for the recoveri of the same and therefor and judg of what doctrin ar fit to be taught them sixtli it is annex to the soveraignti to be judg of what opinion and doctrin ar avers and what conduc to peac and consequ on what occas how farr and what men ar to be trust withal in speak to multitud of peopl and who shall examin the doctrin of all book befor thei be publish for the action of men proce from their opinion and in the wel govern of opinion consisteth the well govern of men action in order to their peac and concord and though in matter of doctrin noth ought to be regard but the truth yet thi is not repugn to regul of the same by peac for doctrin repugn to peac can no more be true than peac and concord can be against the law of natur it is true that in a commonwealth where by the neglig or unskilfullness of governour and teacher fals doctrin ar by time gener receiv the contrari truth mai be gener offens yet the most sudden and rough busl in of a new truth that can be doe never break the peac but on somtim awak the warr for those men that ar so remiss govern that thei dare take up arm to defend or introduc an opinion ar still in warr and their condit not peac but onli a cessat of arm for fear of on anoth and thei live as it were in the procinct of battail continu it belongeth therefor to him that hath the soveraign power to be judg or constitut all judg of opinion and doctrin as a thing necessari to peac therebi to prevent discord and civil warr the right of make rule wherebi the subject mai everi man know what is so hi own as no other subject can without injustic take it from him seventhli is annex to the soveraignti the whole power of prescrib the rule wherebi everi man mai know what good he mai enjoi and what action he mai doe without be molest by ani of hi fellow subject and thi is it men call proprieti for befor constitut of soveraign power as hath alreadi been shewn all men had right to all thing which necessarili causeth warr and therefor thi proprieti be necessari to peac and depend on soveraign power is the act of the power in order to the publiqu peac these rule of proprieti or meum and tuum and of good evil lawful and unlawful in the action of subject ar the civil law that is to sai the law of each commonwealth in particular though the name of civil law be now restrain to the antient civil law of the citi of rome which be the head of a great part of the world her law at that time were in these part the civil law to him also belongeth the right of all judicatur and decis of controversi eightli is annex to the soveraignti the right of judicatur that is to sai of hear and decid all controversi which mai aris concern law either civil or natural or concern fact for without the decis of controversi there is no protect of on subject against the injuri of anoth the law concern meum and tuum ar in vain and to everi man remaineth from the natural and necessari appetit of hi own conserv the right of protect himself by hi privat strength which is the condit of warr and contrari to the end for which everi commonwealth is institut and of make war and peac as he shall think best ninthli is annex to the soveraignti the right of make warr and peac with other nation and commonwealth that is to sai of judg when it is for the publiqu good and how great forc ar to be assembl arm and payd for that end and to levi moni upon the subject to defrai the expens thereof for the power by which the peopl ar to be defend consisteth in their armi and the strength of an armi in the union of their strength under on command which command the soveraign institut therefor hath becaus the command of the militia without other institut maketh him that hath it soveraign and therefor whosoev is made general of an armi he that hath the soveraign power is alway generallissimo and of choos all counsellour and minist both of peac and warr tenthli is annex to the soveraignti the choos of all councellour minist magistr and offic both in peac and war for see the soveraign is charg with the end which is the common peac and defenc he is understood to have power to us such mean as he shall think most fit for hi discharg and of reward and punish and that where no former law hath determin the measur of it arbitrari eleventhli to the soveraign is commit the power of reward with rich or honour and of punish with corporal or pecuniari punish or with ignomini everi subject accord to the law he hath formerli made or if there be no law made accord as he shall judg most to conduc to the encourag of men to serv the commonwealth or deter of them from do disservic to the same and of honour and order lastli consid what valu men ar natur apt to set upon themselv what respect thei look for from other and how littl thei valu other men from whenc continu aris amongst them emul quarrel faction and at last warr to the destroi of on anoth and diminut of their strength against a common enemi it is necessari that there be law of honour and a publiqu rate of the worth of such men as have deserv or ar abl to deserv well of the commonwealth and that there be forc in the hand of some or other to put those law in execut but it hath alreadi been shown that not on the whole militia or forc of the commonwealth but also the judicatur of all controversi is annex to the soveraignti to the soveraign therefor it belongeth also to give titl of honour and to appoint what order of place and digniti each man shall hold and what sign of respect in publiqu or privat meet thei shall give to on anoth these right ar indivis these ar the right which make the essenc of soveraignti and which ar the mark wherebi a man mai discern in what man or assembl of men the soveraign power is place and resideth for these ar incommunic and insepar the power to coyn moni to dispos of the estat and person of infant heir to have praeemption in market and all other statut praerog mai be transfer by the soveraign and yet the power to protect hi subject be retain but if he transferr the militia he retain the judicatur in vain for want of execut of the law or if he grant awai the power of rais moni the militia is in vain or if he give awai the govern of doctrin men will be fright into rebellion with the fear of spirit and so if we consid ani on of the said right we shall present see that the hold of all the rest will produc no effect in the conserv of peac and justic the end for which all commonwealth ar institut and thi divis is it whereof it is said a kingdom divid in it self cannot stand for unless thi divis preced divis into opposit armi can never happen if there had not first been an opinion receiv of the greatest part of england that these power were divid between the king and the lord and the hous of common the peopl had never been divid and fallen into thi civil warr first between those that disagre in politiqu and after between the dissent about the liberti of religion which have so instruct men in thi point of soveraign right that there be few now in england that do not see that these right ar insepar and will be so gener acknowledg at the next return of peac and so continu till their miseri ar forgotten and no longer except the vulgar be better taught than thei have hetherto been and can by no grant pass awai without direct renounc of the soveraign power and becaus thei ar essential and insepar right it follow necessarili that in whatsoev word ani of them seem to be grant awai yet if the soveraign power it self be not in direct term renounc and the name of soveraign no more given by the grante to him that grant them the grant is voyd for when he ha grant all he can if we grant back the soveraignti all is restor as insepar annex thereunto the power and honour of subject vanisheth in the presenc of the power soveraign thi great author be indivis and insepar annex to the soveraignti there is littl ground for the opinion of them that sai of soveraign king though thei be singuli major of greater power than everi on of their subject yet thei be universi minor of less power than them all togeth for if by all togeth thei mean not the collect bodi as on person then all togeth and everi on signifi the same and the speech is absurd but if by all togeth thei understand them as on person which person the soveraign bear then the power of all togeth is the same with the soveraign power and so again the speech is absurd which absurd thei see well enough when the soveraignti is in an assembl of the peopl but in a monarch thei see it not and yet the power of soveraignti is the same in whomsoev it be place and as the power so also the honour of the soveraign ought to be greater than that of ani or all the subject for in the soveraignti is the fountain of honour the digniti of lord earl duke and princ ar hi creatur as in the presenc of the master the servant ar equal and without ani honour at all so ar the subject in the presenc of the soveraign and though thei shine some more some less when thei ar out of hi sight yet in hi presenc thei shine no more than the starr in presenc of the sun soveraign power not hurtful as the want of it and the hurt proce for the greatest part from not submit readili to a less but a man mai here object that the condit of subject is veri miser as be obnoxi to the lust and other irregular passion of him or them that have so unlimit a power in their hand and commonli thei that live under a monarch think it the fault of monarchi and thei that live under the govern of democraci or other soveraign assembl attribut all the inconveni to that form of commonwealth wherea the power in all form if thei be perfect enough to protect them is the same not consid that the estat of man can never be without some incommod or other and that the greatest that in ani form of govern can possibl happen to the peopl in general is scarc sensibl in respect of the miseri and horribl calam that accompani a civil warr or that dissolut condit of masterless men without subject to law and a coerciv power to tye their hand from rapin and reveng nor consid that the greatest pressur of soveraign governour proceedeth not from ani delight or profit thei can expect in the dammag or weaken of their subject in whose vigor consisteth their own selv that unwillingli contribut to their own defenc make it necessari for their governour to draw from them what thei can in time of peac that thei mai have mean on ani emerg occas or sudden need to resist or take advantag on their enemi for all men ar by natur provid of notabl multipli glass that is their passion and selflov through which everi littl payment appeareth a great grievanc but ar destitut of those prospect glass name moral and civil scienc to see a farr off the miseri that hang over them and cannot without such payment be avoyd chapter xix of the several kind of commonwealth by institut and of success to the soveraign power the differ form of commonwealth but three the differ of commonwealth consisteth in the differ of the soveraign or the person repres of all and everi on of the multitud and becaus the soveraignti is either in on man or in an assembl of more than on and into that assembl either everi man hath right to enter or not everi on but certain men distinguish from the rest it is manifest there can be but three kind of commonwealth for the repres must need be on man or more and if more then it is the assembl of all or but of a part when the repres is on man then is the commonwealth a monarchi when an assembl of all that will come togeth then it is a democraci or popular commonwealth when an assembl of a part on then it is call an aristocraci other kind of commonwealth there can be none for either on or more or all must have the soveraign power which i have shewn to be indivis entir tyranni and oligarchi but differ name of monarchi and aristocraci there be other name of govern in the histori and book of polici as tyranni and oligarchi but thei ar not the name of other form of govern but of the same form mislik for thei that ar discont under monarchi call it tyranni and thei that ar displeas with aristocraci call it oligarchi so also thei which find themselv griev under a democraci call it anarchi which signifi want of govern and yet i think no man believ that want of govern is ani new kind of govern nor by the same reason ought thei to believ that the govern is of on kind when thei like it and anoth when thei mislik it or ar oppress by the governour subordin repres danger it is manifest that men who ar in absolut liberti mai if thei pleas give author to on man to repres them everi on as well as give such author to ani assembl of men whatsoev and consequ mai subject themselv if thei think good to a monarch as absolut as to ani other repres therefor where there is alreadi erect a soveraign power there can be no other repres of the same peopl but on to certain particular end by the soveraign limit for that were to erect two soveraign and everi man to have hi person repres by two actor that by oppos on anoth must need divid that power which if men will live in peac is indivis and therebi reduc the multitud into the condit of warr contrari to the end for which all soveraignti is institut and therefor as it is absurd to think that a soveraign assembl invit the peopl of their dominion to send up their deputi with power to make known their advis or desir should therefor hold such deputi rather than themselv for the absolut repres of the peopl so it is absurd also to think the same in a monarchi and i know not how thi so manifest a truth should of late be so littl observ that in a monarchi he that had the soveraignti from a descent of year wa alon call soveraign had the titl of majesti from everi on of hi subject and wa unquestion taken by them for their king wa notwithstand never consid as their repres that name without contradict pass for the titl of those men which at hi command were sent up by the peopl to carri their petit and give him if he permit it their advis which mai serv as an admonit for those that ar the true and absolut repres of a peopl to instruct men in the natur of that offic and to take heed how thei admit of ani other general represent upon ani occas whatsoev if thei mean to discharg the truth commit to them comparison of monarchi with soveraign assembly the differ between these three kind of commonwealth consisteth not in the differ of power but in the differ of conveni or aptitud to produc the peac and secur of the peopl for which end thei were institut and to compar monarchi with the other two we mai observ first that whosoev beareth the person of the peopl or is on of that assembl that bear it beareth also hi own natural person and though he be careful in hi politiqu person to procur the common interest yet he is more or no less careful to procur the privat good of himself hi famili kindr and friend and for the most part if the publiqu interest chanc to cross the privat he preferr the privat for the passion of men ar commonli more potent than their reason from whenc it follow that where the publiqu and privat interest ar most close unit there is the publiqu most advanc now in monarchi the privat interest is the same with the publiqu the rich power and honour of a monarch aris on from the rich strength and reput of hi subject for no king can be rich nor gloriou nor secur whose subject ar either poor or contempt or too weak through want or dissent to maintain a war against their enemi wherea in a democraci or aristocraci the publiqu prosper conferr not so much to the privat fortun of on that is corrupt or ambiti as doth mani time a perfidi advic a treacher action or a civil warr secondli that a monarch receiveth counsel of whom when and where he pleaseth and consequ mai hear the opinion of men vers in the matter about which he deliber of what rank or qualiti soever and as long befor the time of action and with as much secreci as he will but when a soveraign assembl ha need of counsel none ar admit but such as have a right thereto from the begin which for the most part ar of those who have been vers more in the acquisit of wealth than of knowledg and ar to give their advic in long discours which mai and do commonli excit men to action but not govern them in it for the understand is by the flame of the passion never enlightn but dazl nor is there ani place or time wherein an assembli can receiv counsel with secreci becaus of their own multitud thirdli that the resolut of a monarch ar subject to no other inconst than that of human natur but in assembl besid that of natur there ariseth an inconst from the number for the absenc of a few that would have the resolut onc taken continu firm which mai happen by secur neglig or privat impedi or the dilig appear of a few of the contrari opinion undo to dai all that wa conclud yesterdai fourthli that a monarch cannot disagre with himself out of envi or interest but an assembl mai and that to such a height as mai produc a civil warr fifthli that in monarchi there is thi inconveni that ani subject by the power of on man for the enrich of a favourit or flatter mai be depriv of all he possesseth which i confess is a great and inevit inconveni but the same mai as well happen where the soveraign power is in an assembl for their power is the same and thei ar as subject to evil counsel and to be seduc by orat as a monarch by flatter and becom on an other flatter serv on anoth covetousness and ambit by turn and wherea the favorit of an assembl ar mani and the kindr much more numer than of ani monarch besid there is no favourit of a monarch which cannot as well succour hi friend as hurt hi enemi but orat that is to sai favourit of soveraign assembl though thei have great power to hurt have littl to save for to accus requir less eloqu such is man natur than to excus and condemn than absolut more resembl justic sixtli that it is an inconveni in monarchi that the soveraignti mai descend upon an infant or on that cannot discern between good and evil and consisteth in thi that the us of hi power must be in the hand of anoth man or of some assembl of men which ar to govern by hi right and in hi name as curat and protector of hi person and author but to sai there is inconveni in put the us of the soveraign power into the hand of a man or an assembl of men is to sai that all govern is more inconveni than confus and civil warr and therefor all the danger that can be pretend must aris from the content of those that for an offic of so great honour and profit mai becom competitor to make it appear that thi inconveni proceedeth not from that form of govern we call monarchi we ar to consid that the preced monarch hath appoint who shall have the tuition of hi infant successor either express by testament or tacitli by not control the custom in that case receiv and then such inconveni if it happen is to be attribut not to the monarchi but to the ambit and injustic of the subject which in all kind of govern where the peopl ar not well instruct in their duti and the right of soveraignti is the same or els the preced monarch hath not at all taken order for such tuition and then the law of natur hath provid thi suffici rule that the tuition shall be in him that hath by natur most interest in the preserv of the author of the infant and to whom least benefit can accru by hi death or diminut for see everi man by natur seeketh hi own benefit and promot to put an infant into the power of those that can promot themselv by hi destruct or dammag is not tuition but trecheri so that suffici provis be taken against all just quarrel about the govern under a child if ani content aris to the disturb of the publiqu peac it is not to be attribut to the form of monarchi but to the ambit of subject and ignor of their duti on the other side there is no great commonwealth the soveraignti whereof is in a great assembl which is not as to consult of peac and warr and make of law in the same condit as if the govern were in a child for as a child want the judgement to dissent from counsel given him and is therebi necessit to take the advis of them or him to whom he is commit so an assembl wanteth the liberti to dissent from the counsel of the major part be it good or bad and as a child ha need of a tutor or protector to preserv hi person and author so also in great commonwealth the soveraign assembl in all great danger and troubl have need of custod libertati that is of dictat or protector of their authoriti which ar as much as temporari monarch to whom for a time thei mai commit the entir exercis of their power and have at the end of that time been oftner depriv thereof than infant king by their protector regent or ani other tutor though the kind of soveraignti be as i have now shewn but three that is to sai monarchi where on man ha it or democraci where the general assembl of subject hath it or aristocraci where it is in an assembl of certain person nomin or otherwis distinguish from the rest yet he that shall consid the particular commonwealth that have been and ar in the world will not perhap easili reduc them to three and mai therebi be inclin to think there be other form aris from these mingl togeth as for exampl elect kingdom where king have the soveraign power put into their hand for a time of kingdom wherein the king hath a power limit which govern ar nevertheless by most writer call monarchi likewis if a popular or aristocratical commonwealth subdu an enemi countri and govern the same by a presid procur or other magistr thi mai seem perhap at first sight to be a democratical or aristocratical govern but it is not so for elect king ar not soveraign but minist of the soveraign nor limit king soveraign but minist of them that have the soveraign power nor ar those provinc which ar in subject to a democraci or aristocraci of anoth commonwealth democrat or aristocrat govern but monarch and first concern an elect king whose power is limit to hi life as it is in mani place of christendom at thi dai or to certain year or moneth as the dictat power amongst the roman if he have right to appoint hi successor he is no more elect but hereditari but if he have no power to elect hi successor then there is some other man or assembl known which after hi deceas mai elect a new or els the commonwealth dieth and dissolveth with him and returneth to the condit of warr if it be known who have the power to give the soveraignti after hi death it is known also that the soveraignti wa in them befor for none have right to give that which thei have not right to possess and keep to themselv if thei think good but if there be none that can give the soveraignti after the deceas of him that wa first elect then ha he power nai he is oblig by the law of natur to provid by establish hi successor to keep those that had trust him with the govern from relaps into the miser condit of civil warr and consequ he wa when elect a soveraign absolut secondli that king whose power is limit is not superiour to him or them that have the power to limit it and he that is not superiour is not suprem that is to sai not soveraign the soveraignti therefor wa alwai in that assembl which had the right to limit him and by consequ the govern not monarchi but either democraci or aristocraci as of old time in sparta where the king had a priviledg to lead their armi but the soveraignti wa in the ephori thirdli wherea heretofor the roman peopl govern the land of judea for exampl by a presid yet wa not judea therefor a democraci becaus thei were not govern by ani assembl into which ani of them had right to enter nor by an aristocraci becaus thei were not govern by ani assembl into which ani man could enter by their elect but thei were govern by on person which though as to the peopl of rome wa an assembl of the peopl or democraci yet as to the peopl of judea which had no right at all of particip in the govern wa a monarch for though where the peopl ar govern by an assembl chosen by themselv out of their own number the govern is call a democraci or aristocraci yet when thei ar govern by an assembl not of their own choos ti a monarchi not of on man over anoth man but of on peopl over anoth peopl of the right of success of all these form of govern the matter be mortal so that not on monarch but also whole assembl dy it is necessari for the conserv of the peac of men that as there wa order taken for an artificial man so there be order also taken for an artificial etern of life without which men that ar govern by an assembl should return into the condit of warr in everi ag and thei that ar govern by on man as soon as their governour dyeth thi artificial etern is that which men call the right of success there is no perfect form of govern where the dispos of the success is not in the present soveraign for if it be in ani other particular man or privat assembl it is in a person subject and mai be assum by the soveraign at hi pleasur and consequ the right is in himself and if it be in no particular man but left to a new choyc then is the commonwealth dissolv and the right is in him that can get it contrari to the intent of them that did institut the commonwealth for their perpetual and not temporari secur in a democraci the whole assembl cannot fail unless the multitud that ar to be govern fail and therefor question of the right of success have in that form of govern no place at all in an aristocraci when ani of the assembl dyeth the elect of anoth into hi room belongeth to the assembl as the soveraign to whom belongeth the choos of all counsellour and offic for that which the repres doth as actor everi on of the subject doth as author and though the soveraign assembl mai give power to other to elect new men for suppli of their court yet it is still by their author that the elect is made and by the same it mai when the publiqu shall requir it be recal the present monarch hath right to dispos of the success the greatest difficulti about the right of success is in monarchi and the difficulti ariseth from thi that at first sight it is not manifest who is to appoint the successor nor mani time who it is whom he hath appoint for in both these case there is requir a more exact ratiocin than everi man is accustom to us as to the question who shall appoint the successor of a monarch that hath the soveraign author that is to sai for elect king and princ have not the soveraign power in proprieti but in us onli we ar to consid that either he that is in possess ha right to dispos of the success or els that right is again in the dissolv multitud for the death of him that hath the soveraign power in proprieti leav the multitud without ani soveraign at all that is without ani repres in whom thei should be unit and be capabl of do ani on action at all and therefor thei ar incap of elect of ani new monarch everi man have equal right to submit himself to such as he think best abl to protect him or if he can protect himself by hi own sword which is a return to confus and to the condit of a war of everi man against everi man contrari to the end for which monarchi had it first institut therfor it is manifest that by the institut of monarchi the dispos of the successor is alwai left to the judgment and will of the present possessor and for the question which mai aris sometim who it is that the monarch in possess hath design to the success and inherit of hi power it is determin by hi express word and testament or by other tacit sign suffici success passeth by express word by express word or testament when it is declar by him in hi life time viva voce or by write as the first emperour of rome declar who should be their heir for the word heir doe not of it self impli the children or nearest kindr of a man but whomsoev a man shall ani wai declar he would have to succe him in hi estat if therefor a monarch declar expresli that such a man shall be hi heir either by word or write then is that man immedi after the deceas of hi predecessor invest in the right of be monarch or by not control a custom but where testament and express word ar want other natural sign of the will ar to be follow whereof the on is custom and therefor where the custom is that the next of kindr absolut succeedeth there also the next of kindr hath right to the success for that if the will of him that wa in posess had been otherwis he might easili have declar the same in hi life time and likewis where the custom is that the next of the male kindr succeedeth there also the right of success is in the next of the kindr male for the same reason and so it is if the custom were to advanc the femal for whatsoev custom a man mai by a word controul and doe not it is a natural sign he would have that custom stand or by presumpt of natural affect but where neither custom nor testament hath preced there it is to be understood first that a monarch will is that the govern remain monarchical becaus he hath approv that govern in himself secondli that a child of hi own male or femal be prefer befor ani other becaus men ar presum to be more enclin by natur to advanc their own children than the children of other men and of their own rather a male than a femal becaus men ar natur fitter than women for action of labour and danger thirdli where hi own issu faileth rather a brother than a stranger and so still the neerer in bloud rather than the more remot becaus it is alway presum that the neerer of kin is the neerer in affect and ti evid that a man receiv alway by reflexion the most honour from the greatness of hi neerest kindr to dispos of the success though to a king of anoth nation not unlawful but if it be lawful for a monarch to dispos of the success by word of contract or testament men mai perhap object a great inconveni for he mai sell or give hi right of govern to a stranger which becaus stranger that is men not us to live under the same govern not speak the same languag do commonli undervalu on anoth mai turn to the oppress of hi subject which is inde a great inconveni but it proceedeth not necessarili from the subject to a stranger govern but from the unskilfulness of the governour ignor of the true rule of politiqu and therefor the roman when thei had subdu mani nation to make their govern digest were wont to take awai that grievanc as much as thei thought necessari by give sometim to whole nation and sometim to principal men of everi nation thei conquer not on the privileg but also the name of roman and took mani of them into the senat and offic of charg even in the roman citi and thi wa it our most wise king king jame aym at in endeavour the union of hi two realm of england and scotland which if he could have obtain had in all likelihood prevent the civil warr which make both those kingdom at thi present miser it is not therefor ani injuri to the peopl for a monarch to dispos of the success by will though by the fault of mani princ it hath been sometim found inconveni of the lawfulness of it thi also is an argument that whatsoev inconveni can arriv by give a kingdom to a stranger mai arriv also by so marri with stranger as the right of success mai descend upon them yet thi by all men is account lawful chapter xx of dominion paternal and despotical a commonwealth by acquisit is that where the soveraign power is acquir by forc and it is acquir by forc when men singli or mani togeth by plural of voyc for fear of death or bond do authoris all the action of that man or assembl that hath their live and liberti in hi power wherein differ from a commonwealth by institut and thi kind of dominion or soveraignti differeth from soveraignti by institut on in thi that men who choos their soveraign do it for fear of on anoth and not of him whom thei institut but in thi case thei subject themselv to him thei ar afraid of in both case thei do it for fear which is to be note by them that hold all such coven as proce from fear of death or violenc voyd which if it were true no man in ani kind of commonwealth could be oblig to obedi it is true that in a commonwealth onc institut or acquir promis proceed from fear of death or violenc ar no coven nor oblig when the thing promis is contrari to the law but the reason is not becaus it wa made upon fear but becaus he that promiseth hath no right in the thing promis also when he mai lawfulli perform and doth not it is not the invalid of the coven that absolveth him but the sentenc of the soveraign otherwis whensoev a man lawfulli promiseth he unlawfulli breaketh but when the soveraign who is the actor acquitteth him then he is acquit by him that exort the promis as by the author of such absolut the right of soveraignti the same in both but the right and consequ of soveraignti ar the same in both hi power cannot without hi consent be transfer to anoth he cannot forfeit it he cannot be accus by ani of hi subject of injuri he cannot be punish by them he is judg of what is necessari for peac and judg of doctrin he is sole legisl and suprem judg of controversi and of the time and occas of warr and peac to him it belongeth to choos magistr counsellour command and all other offic and minist and to determin of reward and punish honour and order the reason whereof ar the same which ar alledg in the preced chapter for the same right and consequ of soveraignti by institut dominion paternal how attain not by gener but by contract dominion is acquir two way by gener and by conquest the right of dominion by gener is that which the parent hath over hi children and is call paternal and is not so deriv from the gener as if therefor the parent had dominion over hi child becaus he begat him but from the child consent either express or by other suffici argument declar for as to the gener god hath ordain to man a helper and there be alway two that ar equal parent the dominion therefor over the child should belong equal to both and he be equal subject to both which is imposs for no man can obei two master and wherea some have attribut the dominion to the man on as be of the more excel sex thei misreckon in it for there is not alwai that differ of strength or prudenc between the man and the woman as that the right can be determin without war in commonwealth thi controversi is decid by the civil law and for the most part but not alway the sentenc is in favour of the father becaus for the most part commonwealth have been erect by the father not by the mother of famili but the question lyeth now in the state of meer natur where there ar suppos no law of matrimoni no law for the educ of children but the law of natur and the natural inclin of the sex on to anoth and to their children in thi condit of meer natur either the parent between themselv dispos of the dominion over the child by contract or do not dispos thereof at all if thei dispos thereof the right passeth accord to the contract we find in histori that the amazon contract with the men of the neighbour countri to whom thei had recours for issu that the issu male should be sent back but the femal remain with themselv so that the dominion of the femal wa in the mother or educ if there be no contract the dominion is in the mother for in the condit of meer natur where there ar no matrimonial law it cannot be known who is the father unless it be declar by the mother and therefor the right of dominion over the child dependeth on her will and is consequ her again see the infant is first in the power of the mother so as she mai either nourish or expos it if she nourish it it oweth it life to the mother and is therefor oblig to obei her rather than ani other and by consequ the dominion over it is her but if she expos it and anoth find and nourish it the dominion is in him that nourisheth it for it ought to obei him by whom it is preserv becaus preserv of life be the end for which on man becom subject to anoth everi man is suppos to promis obedi to him in whose power it is to save or destroi him or preced subject of on of the parent to the other if the mother be the father subject the child is in the father power and if the father be the mother subject as when a soveraign queen marrieth on of her subject the child is subject to the mother becaus the father also is her subject if a man and a woman monarch of two several kingdom have a child and contract concern who shall have the dominion of him the right of the dominion passeth by the contract if thei contract not the dominion followeth the dominion of the place of hi resid for the soveraign of each countri hath dominion over all that resid therein he that hath the dominion over the child hath dominion also over their children children for he that hath dominion over the person of a man hath dominion over all that is hi without which dominion were but a titl without the effect the right of success followeth the rule of the right of possess the right of success to paternal dominion proceedeth in the same manner as doth the right of success to monarchi of which i have alreadi suffici spoken in the preced chapter despotical dominion how attain dominion acquir by conquest or victori in war is that which some writer call despotical from despot which signifieth a lord or master and is the dominion of the master over hi servant and thi dominion is then acquir to the victor when the vanquish to avoyd the present stroke of death covenanteth either in express word or by other suffici sign of the will that so long as hi life and the liberti of hi bodi is allow him the victor shall have the us thereof at hi pleasur and after such coven made the vanquish is a servant and not befor for by the word servant whether it be deriv from servir to serv or from servar to save which i leav to grammarian to disput is not meant a captiv which is kept in prison or bond till the owner of him that took him or bought him of on that did shall consid what to do with him for such men commonli call slave have no oblig at all but mai break their bond or the prison and kill or carri awai captiv their master justli but on that be taken hath corporal liberti allow him and upon promis not to run awai nor to do violenc to hi master is trust by him not by the victori but by the consent of the vanquish it is not therefor the victori that giveth the right of dominion over the vanquish but hi own coven nor is he oblig becaus he is conquer that is to sai beaten and taken or put to flight but becaus he commeth in and submitteth to the victor nor is the victor oblig by an enemi rendr himself without promis of life to spare him for thi hi yeeld to discret which oblig not the victor longer than in hi own discret hee shall think fit and that men do when thei demand as it is now call quarter which the greek call zogria take aliv is to evad the present furi of the victor by submiss and to compound for their life with ransom or servic and therefor he that hath quarter hath not hi life given but defer till farther deliber for it is not an yeeld on condit of life but to discret and then on is hi life in secur and hi servic due when the victor hath trust him with hi corporal liberti for slave that work in prison or fetter do it not of duti but to avoyd the cruelti of their taskmast the master of the servant is master also of all he hath and mai exact the us thereof that is to sai of hi good of hi labour of hi servant and of hi children as often as he shall think fit for he holdeth hi life of hi master by the coven of obedi that is of own and authoris whatsoev the master shall do and in case the master if he refus kill him or cast him into bond or otherwis punish him for hi disobedi he is himself the author of the same and cannot accus him of injuri in summ the right and consequ of both paternal and despotical dominion ar the veri same with those of a soveraign by institut and for the same reason which reason ar set down in the preced chapter so that for a man that is monarch of diver nation whereof he hath in on the soveraignti by institut of the peopl assembl and in anoth by conquest that is by the submiss of each particular to avoyd death or bond to demand of on nation more than of the other from the titl of conquest as be a conquer nation is an act of ignor of the right of soveraignti for the soveraign is absolut over both alik or els there is no soveraignti at all and so everi man mai lawfulli protect himself if he can with hi own sword which is the condit of war differ between a famili and a kingdom by thi it appear that a great famili if it be not part of some commonwealth is of it self as to the right of soveraignti a littl monarchi whether that famili consist of a man and hi children or of a man and hi servant or of a man and hi children and servant togeth wherein the father of master is the soveraign but yet a famili is not properli a commonwealth unless it be of that power by it own number or by other opportun as not to be subdu without the hazard of war for where a number of men ar manifestli too weak to defend themselv unit everi on mai us hi own reason in time of danger to save hi own life either by flight or by submiss to the enemi as hee shall think best in the same manner as a veri small compani of souldier surpris by an armi mai cast down their arm and demand quarter or run awai rather than be put to the sword and thu much shall suffic concern what i find by specul and deduct of soveraign right from the natur need and design of men in erect of commonwealth and put themselv under monarch or assembl entrust with power enough for their protect the right of monarchi from scriptur let us now consid what the scriptur teacheth in the same point to mose the children of israel sai thu exod speak thou to us and we will hear thee but let not god speak to us lest we dye thi is absolut obedi to mose concern the right of king god himself by the mouth of samuel saith sam c thi

their king wa to have yet thei consent thereto and sai thu vers c we will be as all other nation and our king shall judg our caus and goe befor us to conduct our war here is confirm the right that

servant understand to judg thy peopl and to discern between good and evil it belongeth therefor to the soveraign to bee judg and to praescrib the rule of discern good and evil which rule ar law and therefor in him is the legisl power saul sought the life of david yet when it wa in hi power to slai saul and hi servant would have done it david forbad them sai sam god forbid i should do such an act against my lord the anoynt of god for obedi of servant st paul saith coll servant obei your master in all thing and vers children obei your parent in all thing there is simpl obedi in those that ar subject to paternal or despotical dominion again math the scribe and pharise sit in mose chayr and therefor all that thei shall bid you observ that observ and do there again is simpl obedi and st paul tit warn them that thei subject themselv to princ and to those that ar in author obei them thi obedi is also simpl lastli our saviour himself acknowledg that men ought to pai such tax as ar by king impos where he say give to caesar that which is caesar and pai such tax himself and that the king word is suffici to take ani thing from ani subject when there is need and that the king is judg of that need for he himself as king of the jew command hi discipl to take the ass and ass colt to carri him into jerusalem sai mat go into the villag over against you and you shall find a shee ass ty and her colt with her unti them and bring them to me and if ani man ask you what you mean by it sai the lord hath need of them and thei will let them go thei will not ask whether hi necess be a suffici

triall of adam obedi the divel to enflam the ambit of the woman to whom that fruit alreadi seem beautiful told her that by tast it thei should be as god know good and evil whereupon have both eaten thei did inde take upon them god offic which is judicatur of good and evil but acquir no new abil to distinguish between them aright and wherea it is sayd that have eaten thei saw thei were nake no man hath so interpret that place as if thei had formerli blind as saw not their own skin the mean is plain that it wa then thei first judg their nakedness wherein it wa god will to creat them to be

cleerli though allegor signifi that the command of them that have the right to command ar not by their subject to be censur nor disput soveraign power ought in all commonwealth to be absolut so it appeareth plainli to my understand both from reason and scriptur that the soveraign power whether place in on man as in monarchi or in on assembl of men as in popular and aristocratical commonwealth is as great as possibl men can be imagin to make it and though of so unlimit a power men mai fanci mani evil consequ yet the consequ of the want of it which is perpetual warr of everi man against hi neighbour ar much wors the condit of man in thi life shall never be without inconveni but there happeneth in no commonwealth ani great inconveni but what proce from the subject disobedi and breach of those coven from which the commonwealth had it be and whosoev think soveraign power too great will seek to make it less must subject himself to the power that can limit it that is to sai to a greater the greatest object is that of the practis when men ask where and when such power ha by subject been acknowledg but on mai ask them again when or where ha there been a kingdom long free from sedit and civil warr in those nation whose commonwealth have been longliv and not been destroi but by forraign warr the subject never did disput of the soveraign power but howsoev an argument for the practis of men that have not sift to the bottom and with exact reason weigh the caus and natur of commonwealth and suffer daili those miseri that proce from the ignor thereof is invalid for though in all place of the world men should lai the foundat of their hous on the sand it could not thenc be infer that so it ought to be the skill of make and maintain commonwealth consisteth in certain rule as doth arithmetiqu and geometri not as tennisplai on practis on which rule neither poor men have the leisur nor men that have had the leisur have hitherto had the curios or the method to find out chapter xxi of the liberti of subject liberti what liberti or freedom signifieth properli the absenc of opposit by opposit i mean external impedi of motion and mai be appli no less to irrat and inanim creatur than to rational for whatsoev is so ty or environ as it cannot move but within a certain space which space is determin by the opposit of some external bodi we sai it hath not liberti to go further and so of all live creatur whilest thei ar imprison or restrain with wall or chayn and of the water whilest it is kept in by bank or vessel that otherwis would spread it self into a larger space we us to sai thei ar not at liberti to move in such manner as without those external impedi thei would but when the impedi of motion is in the constitut of the thing it self we us not to sai it want the liberti but the power to move as when a stone lyeth still or a man is fastn to hi bed by sickness what it is to be free and accord to thi proper and gener receiv mean of the word a freeman is he that in those thing which by hi strength and wit he is abl to do is not hindr to doe what he ha a will to but when the word free and liberti ar appli to ani thing but bodi thei ar abus for that which is not subject to motion is not subject to impedi and therefor when ti said for exampl the wai is free no liberti of the wai is signifi but of those that walk in it without stop and when we sai a guift is free there is not meant ani liberti of the guift but of the giver that wa not bound by ani law or coven to give it so when we speak freeli it is not the liberti of voic or pronunci but of the man whom no law hath oblig to speak otherwis then he did lastli from the us of the word freewil no liberti can be infer to the will desir or inclin but the liberti of the man which consisteth in thi that he find no stop in do what he ha the will desir or inclin to doe fear and liberti consist fear and liberti ar consist as when a man throweth hi good into the sea for fear the ship should sink he doth it nevertheless veri willingli and mai refus to doe it if he will it is therefor the action of on that wa free so a man sometim pai hi debt onli for fear of imprison which becaus no bodi hindr him from detain wa the action of a man at liberti and gener all action which men doe in commonwealth for fear of the law or action which the doer had liberti to omit liberti and necess consist liberti and necess ar consist as in the water that hath not onli liberti but a necess of descend by the channel so likewis in the action which men voluntarili doe which becaus thei proce from their will proce from liberti and yet becaus everi act of man will and everi desir and inclin proceedeth from some caus which caus in a continual chain whose first link in the hand of god the first of all caus proce from necess so that to him that could see the connexion of those caus the necess of all men voluntari action would appear manifest and therefor god that seeth and disposeth all thing seeth also that the liberti of man in do what he will is accompani with the necess of do that which god will no more nor less for though men mai do mani thing which god doe not command nor is therefor author of them yet thei can have no passion nor appetit to ani thing of which appetit god will is not the caus and did not hi will assur the necess of man will and consequ of all that on man will dependeth the liberti of men would be a contradict and impedi to the omnipot and liberti of god and thi shall suffic as to the matter in hand of that natural liberti which onli is properli call liberti artificial bond or coven but as men for the atteyn of peac and conserv of themselv therebi have made an artificial man which we call a commonwealth so also have thei made artificial chain call civil law which thei themselv by mutual coven have fastn at on end to the lip of that man or assembl to whom thei have given the soveraign power and at the other end to their own ear these bond in their own natur but weak mai nevertheless be made to hold by the danger though not by the difficulti of break them liberti of subject consisteth in liberti from coven in relat to these bond onli it is that i am to speak now of the liberti of subject for see there is no commonwealth in the world for the regul of all the action and word of men as be a thing imposs it followeth necessarili that in all kind of action by the law praetermit men have the liberti of do what their own reason shall suggest for the most profit to themselv for if wee take liberti in the proper sens for corporal liberti that is to sai freedom from chain and prison it were veri absurd for men to clamor as thei doe for the liberti thei so manifestli enjoi again if we take liberti for an exempt from law it is no less absurd for men to demand as thei doe that liberti by which all other men mai be master of their live and yet as absurd as it is thi is it thei demand not know that the law ar of no power to protect them without a sword in the hand of a man or men to caus those law to be put in execut the liberti of a subject lyeth therefor onli in those thing which in regul their action the soveraign hath praetermit such as is the liberti to bui and sell and otherwis contract with on anoth to choos their own aboad their own diet their own trade of life and institut their children as thei themselv think fit the like liberti of the subject consist with unlimit power of the soveraign nevertheless we ar not to understand that by such liberti the soveraign power of life and death is either abolish or limit for it ha been alreadi shewn that noth the soveraign repres can doe to a subject on what pretenc soever can properli be call injustic or injuri becaus everi subject is author of everi act the soveraign doth so that he never wanteth right to ani thing otherwis than as he himself is the subject of god and bound therebi to observ the law of natur and therefor it mai and doth often happen in commonwealth that a subject mai be put to death by the command of the soveraign power and yet neither doe the other wrong as when jeptha caus hi daughter to be sacrif in which and the like case he that so dieth had liberti to doe the action for which he is nevertheless without injuri put to death and the same holdeth also in a soveraign princ that putteth to death an innoc subject for though the action be against the law of natur as be contrari to equiti as wa the kill of uriah by david yet it wa not an injuri to uriah but to god not to uriah becaus the right to doe what he pleas wa given him by uriah himself and yet to god becaus david wa god subject and prohibit all iniquiti by the law of natur which distinct david himself when he repent the fact evid confirm sai to thee onli have i sin in the same manner the peopl of athen when thei banish the most potent of their commonwealth for ten year thought thei commit no injustic and yet thei never question what crime he had done but what hurt he would doe nai thei command the banish of thei knew not whom and everi citizen bring hi oystershel into the market place written with the name of him he desir should be banish without actual accus him sometim banish an aristid for hi reput of justic and sometim a scurril jester as hyperbolu to make a jest of it and yet a man cannot sai the soveraign peopl of athen want right to banish them or an athenian the liberti to jest or to be just the liberti which writer prais is the liberti of soveraign not of privat men the liberti whereof there is so frequent and honour mention in the histori and philosophi of the antient greek and roman and in the write and discours of those that from them have receiv all their learn in the politiqu is not the liberti of particular men but the liberti of the commonwealth which is the same with that which everi man then should have if there were no civil law nor commonwealth at all and the effect of it also be the same for as amongst masterless men there is perpetual war of everi man against hi neighbour no inherit to transmit to the son nor to expect from the father no proprieti of good or land no secur but a full and absolut liberti in everi particular man so in state and commonwealth not depend on on anoth everi commonwealth not everi man ha an absolut liberti to doe what it shall judg that is to sai what that man or assembli that representeth it shall judg most conduc to their benefit but withal thei live in the condit of a perpetual war and upon the confin of battel with their frontier arm and canon plant against their neighbour round about the athenian and roman were free that is free commonwealth not that ani particular men had the liberti to resist their own repres but that their repres had the liberti to resist or invad other peopl there is written on the turret of the citi of luca in great charact at thi dai the word liberta yet no man can thenc inferr that a particular man ha more liberti or immuniti from the servic of the commonwealth there than in constantinopl whether a commonwealth be monarchical or popular the freedom is still the same but it is an easi thing for men to be deceiv by the speciou name of liberti and for want of judgement to distinguish mistak that for their privat inherit and birth right which is the right of the publiqu onli and when the same errour is confirm by the author of men in reput for their write in thi subject it is no wonder if it produc sedit and chang of govern in these western part of the world we ar made to receiv our opinion concern the institut and right of commonwealth from aristotl cicero and other men greek and roman that live under popular state deriv those right not from the principl of natur but transcrib them into their book out of the practic of their own commonwealth which were popular as the grammarian describ the rule of languag out of the practis of the time or the rule of poetri out of the poem of homer and virgil and becaus the athenian were taught to keep them from desir of chang their govern that thei were freemen and all that live under monarchi were slave therefor aristotl put it down in hi politiqueslib cap in democraci liberti is to be suppos for ti commonli held that no man is free in ani other govern and as aristotl so cicero and other writer have ground their civil doctrin on the opinion of the roman who were taught to hate monarchi at first by them that have depos their soveraign share amongst them the soveraignti of rome and afterward by their successor and by read of these greek and latin author men from their childhood have gotten a habit under a fals shew of liberti of favour tumult and of licenti control the action of their soveraign and again of control those control with the effus of so much blood as i think i mai truli sai there wa never ani thing so deerli bought as these western part have bought the learn of the greek and latin tongu liberti of the subject how to be measur to come now to the particular of the true liberti of a subject that is to sai what ar the thing which though command by the soveraign he mai nevertheless without injustic refus to do we ar to consid what right we pass awai when we make a commonwealth or which is all on what liberti we deni our selv by own all the action without except of the man or assembl we make our soveraign for in the act of our submiss consisteth both our oblig and our liberti which must therefor be infer by argument taken from thenc there be no oblig on ani man which ariseth not from some act of hi own for all men equal ar by natur free and becaus such argument must either be drawn from the express word i authoris all hi action or from the intent of him that submitteth himself to hi power which intent is to be understood by the end for which he so submitteth the oblig and liberti of the subject is to be deriv either from those word or other equival or els from the end of the institut of soveraignti name the peac of the subject within themselv and their defenc against a common enemi subject have liberti to defend their own bodi even against them that lawfulli invad them first therefor see soveraignti by institut is by coven of everi on to everi on and soveraignti by acquisit by coven of the vanquish to the victor or child to the parent it is manifest that everi subject ha liberti in all those thing the right whereof cannot by coven be transfer i have shewn befor in the chapter that coven not to defend a man own bodi ar voyd therefor ar not bound to hurt themselv if the soveraign command a man though justli condemn to kill wound or maym himself or not to resist those that assault him or to abstain from the us of food ayr medicin or ani other thing without which he cannot live yet hath that man the liberti to disobei if a man be interrog by the soveraign or hi author concern a crime done by himself he is not bound without assur of pardon to confess it becaus no man as i have shewn in the same chapter can be oblig by coven to accus himself again the consent of a subject to soveraign power is contain in these word i authoris or take upon me all hi action in which there is no restrict at all of hi own former natural liberti for by allow him to kill me i am not bound to kill my self when he command me ti on thing to sai kill me or my fellow if you pleas anoth thing to sai i will kill my self or my fellow it followeth therefor that no man is bound by the word themselv either to kill himself or ani other man and consequ that the oblig a man mai sometim have upon the command of the soveraign to execut ani danger or dishonour offic dependeth not on the word of our submiss but on the intent which is to be understood by the end thereof when therefor our refusal to obei frustrat the end for which the soveraignti wa ordain then there is no liberti to refus otherwis there is nor to warfar unless thei voluntarili undertak it upon thi ground a man that is command as a souldier to fight against the enemi though hi soveraign have right enough to punish hi refusal with death mai nevertheless in mani case refus without injustic as when he substituteth a suffici souldier in hi place for in thi case he deserteth not the servic of the commonwealth and there is allow to be made for natural timorousness not on to women of whom no such danger duti is expect but also to men of feminin courag when armi fight there is on on side or both a run awai yet when thei do it not out of trecheri but fear thei ar not esteem to do it unjustli but dishonour for the same reason to avoyd battel is not injustic but cowardis but he that inrowleth himself a souldier or taketh imprest moni taketh awai the excus of a timor natur and is oblig not on to go to the battel but also not to run from it without hi captain leav and when the defenc of the commonwealth requireth at onc the help of all that ar abl to bear arm everi on is oblig becaus otherwis the institut of the commonwealth which thei have not the purpos or courag to preserv wa in vain to resist the sword of the commonwealth in defenc of anoth man guilti or innoc no man hath liberti becaus such liberti take awai from the soveraign the mean of protect us and is therefor destruct of the veri essenc of govern but in case a great mani men togeth have alreadi resist the soveraign power unjustli or commit some capital crime for which everi on of them expecteth death whether have thei not the liberti then to joyn togeth and assist and defend on anoth certainli thei have for thei but defend their live which the guilti man mai as well do as the innoc there wa inde injustic in the first breach of their duti their bear of arm subsequ to it though it be to maintain what thei have done is no new unjust act and if it be on to defend their person it is not unjust at all but the offer of pardon taketh from them to whom it is offer the plea of selfdef and maketh their persever in assist or defend the rest unlawful the greatest liberti of subject dependeth on the silenc of the law as for other lyberti thei depend on the silenc of the law in case where the soveraign ha prescrib no rule there the subject hath the liberti to do or forbear accord to hi own discret and therefor such liberti is in some place more and in some less and in some time more in other time less accord as thei that have the soveraignti shall think most conveni as for exampl there wa a time when in england a man might enter in to hi own land and dispossess such as wrongfulli possess it by forc but in aftertim that liberti of forcibl entri wa taken awai by a statut made by the king in parliament and is some place of the world men have the liberti of mani wive in other place such liberti is not allow if a subject have a controversi with hi soveraign of debt or of right of possess of land or good or concern ani servic requir at hi hand or concern ani penalti corporal or pecuniari ground on a preced law he hath the same liberti to sue for hi right as if it were against a subject and befor such judg as ar appoint by the soveraign for see the soveraign demandeth by forc of a former law and not by vertu of hi power he declareth therebi that he requireth no more than shall appear to be due by that law the sute therefor is not contrari to the will of the soveraign and consequ the subject hath the liberti to demand the hear of hi caus and sentenc accord to that law but if he demand or take ani thing by pretenc of hi power there lyeth in that case no action of law for all that is done by him in vertu of hi power is done by the author of everi subject and consequ he that bring an action against the soveraign bring it against himself if a monarch or soveraign assembl grant a liberti to all or ani of hi subject which grant stand he is disabl to provid for their safeti the grant is voyd unless he directli renounc or transferr the soveraignti to anoth for in that he might openli if it had been hi will and in plain term have renounc or transfer it and did not it is to be understood it wa not hi will but that the grant proceed from ignor of the repugn between such a liberti and the soveraign power and therefor the soveraignti is still retayn and consequ all those power which ar necessari to the exercis thereof such as ar the power of warr and peac of judicatur of appoint offic and councellour of levi moni and the rest name in the th chapter in what case subject absolv of their obedi to their soveraign the oblig of subject to the soveraign is understood to last as long and no longer than the power lasteth by which he is abl to protect them for the right men have by natur to protect themselv when none els can protect them can by no coven be relinquish the soveraignti is the soul of the commonwealth which onc depart from the bodi the member doe no more receiv their motion from it the end of obedi is protect which wheresoev a man seeth it either in hi own or in anoth sword natur applyeth hi obedi to it and hi endeavour to maintain it and though soveraignti in the intent of them that make it be immortal yet is it in it own natur not onli subject to violent death by forreign war but also through the ignor and passion of men it hath in it from the veri institut mani seed of a natural mortal by intestin discord in case of captiv if a subject be taken prison in war or hi person or hi mean of life be within the guard of the enemi and hath hi life and corporal liberti given him on condit to be subject to the victor he hath liberti to accept the condit and have accept it is the subject of him that took him becaus he had no other wai to preserv himself the case is the same if he be detein on the same term in a forreign countri but if a man be held in prison or bond or is not trust with the liberti of hi bodi he cannot be understood to be bound by coven to subject and therefor mai if he can make hi escap by ani mean whatsoev in case the soveraign cast off the govern from himself and heyr if a monarch shall relinquish the soveraignti both for himself and hi heir hi subject return to the absolut liberti of natur becaus though natur mai declar who ar hi son and who ar the nerest of hi kin yet it dependeth on hi own will as hath been said in the preced chapter who shall be hi heyr if therefor he will have no heyr there is no soveraignti nor subject the case is the same if he dye without known kindr and without declar of hi heyr for then there can no heir be known and consequ no subject be due in case of banish if the soveraign banish hi subject dure the banish he is not subject but he that is sent on a messag or hath leav to travel is still subject but it is by contract between soveraign not by vertu of the coven of subject for whosoev entreth into anoth dominion is subject to all the law thereof unless he have a privileg by the amiti of the soveraign or by special licenc in case the soveraign render himself subject to anoth if a monarch subdu by war render himself subject to the victor hi subject ar deliv from their former oblig and becom oblig to the victor but if he be held prison or have not the liberti of hi own bodi he is not understood to have given awai the right of soveraignti and therefor hi subject ar oblig to yield obedi to the magistr formerli place govern not in their own name but in hi for hi right remain the question is onli of the administr that is to sai of the magistr and offic which if he have not mean to name he is suppos to approv those which he himself had formerli appoint chapter xxii of system subject political and privat the diver sort of system of peopl have spoken of the gener form and power of a commonwealth i am in order to speak next of the part thereof and first of system which resembl the similar part or muscl of a bodi natural by system i understand ani number of men joyn in on interest or on business of which some ar regular and some irregular regular ar those where on man or assembl of men is constitut repres of the whole number all other ar irregular of regular some ar absolut and independ subject to none but their own repres such ar onli commonwealth of which i have spoken alreadi in the last preced chapter other ar depend that is to sai subordin to some soveraign power to which everi on as also their repres is subject of system subordin some ar political and some privat political otherwis call bodi politiqu and person in law ar those which ar made by author from the soveraign power of the commonwealth privat ar those which ar constitut by subject amongst themselv or by authoriti from a stranger for no author deriv from forraign power within the dominion of anoth is publiqu there but privat and of privat system some ar lawful some unlawful lawful ar those which ar allow by the commonwealth all other ar unlawful irregular system ar those which have no repres consist onli in concours of peopl which if not forbidden by the commonwealth nor made on evil design such as ar conflux of peopl to market or shew or ani other harmeless end ar lawful but when the intent is evil or if the number be consider unknown thei ar unlawful in all bodi politiqu the power of the repres is limit in bodi politiqu the power of the repres is alwai limit and that which prescribeth the limit thereof is the power soveraign for power unlimit is absolut soveraignti and the soveraign in everi commonwealth is the absolut repres of all the subject and therefor no other can be repres of ani part of them but so far forth as he shall give leav and to give leav to a bodi politiqu of subject to have an absolut repres to all intent and purpos were to abandon the govern of so much of the commonwealth and to divid the dominion contrari to their peac and defenc which the soveraign cannot be understood to doe by ani grant that doe not plainli and directli discharg them of their subject for consequ of word ar not the sign of hi will when other consequ ar sign of the contrari but rather sign of errour and misreckon to which all mankind is too prone the bound of that power which is given to the repres of a bodi politiqu ar to be taken notic of from two thing on is their writt or letter from the soveraign the other is the law of the commonwealth by letter patent for though in the institut or acquisit of a commonwealth which is independ there need no write becaus the power of the repres ha there no other bound but such as ar set out by the unwritten law of natur yet in subordin bodi there ar such divers of limit necessari concern their busi time and place as can neither be remembr without letter nor taken notic of unless such letter be patent that thei mai be read to them and withal seal or testifi with the seal or other perman sign of the author soveraign and the law and becaus such limit is not alwai easi or perhap possibl to be describ in write the ordinari law common to all subject must determin that the repres mai lawfulli do in all case where the letter themselv ar silent and therefor when the repres is on man hi unwarr act hi own on in a bodi politiqu if the repres be on man whatsoev he doe in the person of the bodi which is not warrant in hi letter nor by the law is hi own act and not the act of the bodi nor of ani other member thereof besid himself becaus further than hi letter or the law limit he representeth no man person but hi own but what he doe accord to these is the act of everi on for of the act of the soveraign everi on is author becaus he is their repres unlimit and the act of him that reced not from the letter of the soveraign is the act of the soveraign and therefor everi member of the bodi is author of it when it is an assembl it is the act of them that assent on but if the repres be an assembl whatsoev that assembl shall decre not warrant by their letter or the law is the act of the assembl or bodi politiqu and the act of everi on by whose vote the decre wa made but not the act of ani man that be present vote to the contrari nor of ani man absent unless he vote it by procur it is the act of the assembl becaus vote by the major part and if it be a crime the assembl mai be punish as farreforth as it is capabl as by dissolut or forfeitur of their letter which is to such artificial and fictiti bodi capital or if the assembl have a common stock wherein none of the innoc member have proprieti by pecuniari mulct for from corporal penalti natur hath exempt all bodi politiqu but thei that gave not their vote ar therefor innoc becaus the assembl cannot repres ani man in thing unwarr by their letter and consequ ar not involv in their vote when the repres is on man if he borrow moni or ow it by contract he is lyabl on the member not if the person of the bodi politiqu be in on man borrow moni of a stranger that is of on that is not of the same bodi for no letter need limit borrow see it is left to men own inclin to limit lend the debt is the repres for if he should have author from hi letter to make the member pai what he borroweth he should have by consequ the soveraignti of them and therefor the grant were either voyd as proceed from errour commonli incid to human natur and an unsuffici sign of the will of the granter or if it be avow by him then is the represent soveraign and falleth not under the present question which is on of bodi subordin no member therefor is oblig to pai the debt so borrow but the repres himself becaus he that lendeth it be a stranger to the letter and to the qualif of the bodi understandeth those on for hi debtor that ar engag and see the represent can ingag himself and none els ha him on for debtor who must therefor pai him out of the common stock if there be ani or if there be none out of hi own estat if he come into debt by contract or mulct the case is the same when it is an assembl thei on ar liabl that have assent but when the repres is an assembl and the debt to a stranger all thei and on thei ar respons for the debt that gave their vote to the borrow of it or to the contract that made it due or to the fact for which the mulct wa impos becaus everi on of those in vote did engag himself for the payment for he that is author of the borrow is oblig to the payment even of the whole debt though when payd by ani on he be discharg if the debt be to on of the assembl the bodi on is oblig but if the debt be to on of the assembl the assembl on is oblig to the payment out of their common stock if thei have ani for have liberti of vote if he vote the moni shall be borrow he vote it shall be payd if he vote it shall not be borrow or be absent yet becaus in lend he voteth the borrow he contradicteth hi former vote and is oblig by the later and becom both borrow and lender and consequ cannot demand payment from ani particular man but from the common treasur on which fayl he hath no remedi nor complaint but against himself that be privi to the act of the assembl and their mean to pai and not be enforc did nevertheless through hi own folli lend hi moni protest against the decre of bodi politiqu sometim law but against soveraign power never it is manifest by thi that in bodi politiqu subordin and subject to a soveraign power it is sometim not on lawful but expedi for a particular man to make open protest against the decre of the repres assembl and caus their dissent to be registr or to take witness of it becaus otherwis thei mai be oblig to pai debt contract and be respons for crime commit by other men but in a soveraign assembl that liberti is taken awai both becaus he that protesteth there deni their soveraignti and also becaus whatsoev is command by the soveraign power is as to the subject though not so alway in the sight of god justifi by the command for of such command everi subject is the author bodi politiqu for govern of a provinc coloni or town the varieti of bodi politiqu is almost infinit for thei ar not on distinguish by the several affair for which thei ar constitut wherein there is an unspeak diversiti but also by the time place and number subject to mani limit and as to their affair some ar ordain for govern as first the govern of a provinc mai be commit to an assembl of men wherein all resolut shall depend on the vote of the major part and then thi assembl is a bodi politiqu and their power limit by commiss thi word provinc signifi a charg or care of business which he whose business it is committeth to anoth man to be administr for and under him and therefor when in on commonwealth there be diver countri that have their law distinct on from anoth or ar farr distant in place the administr of the govern be commit to diver person those countri where the soveraign is not resid but govern by commiss ar call provinc but of the govern of a provinc by an assembl resid in the provinc it self there be few exampl the roman who had the soveraignti of mani provinc yet govern them alwai by presid and praetor and not by assembl as thei govern the citi of rome and territori adjac in like manner when there were coloni sent from england to plant virginia and sommeriland though the govern of them here were commit to assembl in london yet did those assembl never commit the govern under them to ani assembl there but did to each plantat send on governour for though everi man where he can be present by natur desir to particip of govern yet where thei cannot be present thei ar by natur also enclin to commit the govern of their common interest rather to a monarchical then a popular form of govern which is also evid in those men that have great privat estat who when thei ar unwil to take the pain of administr the business that belong to them choos rather to trust on servant than a assembl either of their friend or servant but howsoev it be in fact yet we mai suppos the govern of a provinc or coloni commit to an assembl and when it is that which in thi place i have to sai is thi that whatsoev debt is by that assembl contract or whatsoev unlawful act is decre is the act on of those that assent and not of ani that dissent or were absent for the reason befor alledg also that an assembl resid out of the bound of that coloni whereof thei have the govern cannot execut ani power over the person or good of ani of the coloni to seiz on them for debt or other duti in ani place without the coloni it self as have no jurisdict nor authoriti elsewher but ar left to the remedi which the law of the place alloweth them and though the assembl have right to impos a mulct upon ani of their member that shall break the law thei make yet out of the coloni it self thei have no right to execut the same and that which is said here of the right of an assembl for the govern of a provinc or a coloni is appliabl also to an assembl for the govern of a town or univers or a colleg or a church or for ani other govern over the person of men and gener in all bodi politiqu if ani particular member conceiv himself injur by the bodi it self the cognis of hi caus belongeth to the soveraign and those the soveraign hath ordain for judg in such caus or shall ordain for that particular caus and not to the bodi it self for the whole bodi is in thi case hi fellow subject which in a soveraign assembl is otherwis for there if the soveraign be not judg though in hi own caus there can be no judg at all bodi politiqu for order of trade in a bodi politiqu for the well order of forraign traffiqu the most commodi repres is an assembl of all the member that is to sai such a on as everi on that adventureth hi moni mai be present at all the deliber and resolut of the bodi if thei will themselv for proof whereof we ar to consid the end for which men that ar merchant and mai bui and sell export and import their merchandis accord to their own discret doe nevertheless bind themselv up in on corpor it is true there be few merchant that with the merchandis thei bui at home can fraight a ship to export it or with that thei bui abroad to bring it home and have therefor need to joyn togeth in on societi where everi man mai either particip of the gain accord to the proport of hi adventur or take hi own and sell what he transport or import at such price as he think fit but thi is no bodi politiqu there be no common repres to oblig them to ani other law than that which is common to all other subject the end of their incorpor is to make their gain the greater which is done two way by sole bui and sole sell both at home and abroad so that to grant to a compani of merchant to be a corpor or bodi politiqu is to grant them a doubl monopoli whereof on is to be sole buyer anoth to be sole seller for when there is a compani incorpor for ani particular forraign countri thei onli export the commod vendibl in that countri which is sole bui at home and sole sell abroad for at home there is but on buyer and abroad but on that selleth both which is gainful to the merchant becaus therebi thei bui at home at lower and sell abroad at higher rate and abroad there is but on buyer of forraign merchandis and but on that sel them at home both which again ar gainful to the adventur of thi doubl monopoli on part is disadvantag to the peopl at home the other to forraign for at home by their sole export thei set what price thei pleas on the husbandri and handywork of the peopl and by the sole import what price thei pleas on all forraign commod the peopl have need of both which ar ill for the peopl on the contrari by the sole sell of the nativ commod abroad and sole bui the forraign commod upon the place thei rais the price of those and abat the price of these to the disadvantag of the forraign for where but on selleth the merchandis is the dearer and where but on buyeth the cheaper such corpor therefor ar no other then monopoli though thei would be veri profit for a commonwealth if be bound up into on bodi in forraign market thei were at liberti at home everi man to bui and sell at what price he could the end then of these bodi of merchant be not a common benefit to the whole bodi which have in thi case no common stock but what is deduct out of the particular adventur for build bui victual and man of ship but the particular gain of everi adventur it is reason that everi on be acquaint with the employ of hi own that is that everi on be of the assembl that shall have the power to order the same and be acquaint with their account and therefor the repres of such a bodi must be an assembl where everi member of the bodi mai be present at the consult if he will if a bodi politiqu of merchant contract a debt to a stranger by the act of their repres assembl everi member is lyabl by himself for the whole for a stranger can take no notic of their privat law but considereth them as so mani particular men oblig everi on to the whole payment till payment made by on dischargeth all the rest but if the debt be to on of the compani the creditor is debter for the whole to himself and cannot therefor demand hi debt but onli from the common stock if there be ani if the commonwealth impos a tax upon the bodi it is understood to be layd upon everi member proportion to hi particular adventur in the compani for there is in thi case no other common stock but what is made of their particular adventur if a mulct be layd upon the bodi for some unlawful act thei onli ar lyabl by whose vote the act wa decre or by whose assist it wa execut for in none of the rest is there ani other crime but be of the bodi which if a crime becaus the bodi wa ordeyn by the author of the commonwealth is not hi if on of the member be indebt to the bodi he mai be su by the bodi but hi good cannot be taken nor hi person imprison by the author of the bodi but onli by author of the commonwealth for if thei can doe it by their own author thei can by their own author give judgement that the debt is due which is as much as to be judg in their own caus a bodi politiqu for counsel to be give to the soveraign these bodi made for the govern of men or of traffiqu be either perpetual or for a time prescrib by write but there be bodi also whose time ar limit and that onli by the natur of their business for exampl if a soveraign monarch or a soveraign assembl shall think fit to give command to the town and other several part of their territori to send to him their deputi to enform him of the condit and necess of the subject or to advis with him for the make of good law or for ani other caus as with on person repres the whole countri such deputi have a place and time of meet assign them ar there and at that time a bodi politiqu repres everi subject of that dominion but it is on for such matter as shall be propound unto them by that man or assembl that by the soveraign author sent for them and when it shall be declar that noth more shall be propound nor debat by them the bodi is dissolv for if thei were the absolut repres of the peopl then were it the soveraign assembl and so there would be two soveraign assembl or two soveraign over the same peopl which cannot consist with their peac and therefor where there is onc a soveraignti there can be no absolut represent of the peopl but by it and for the limit of how farr such a bodi shall repres the whole peopl thei ar set forth in the write by which thei were sent for for the peopl cannot choos their deputi to other intent than is in the write direct to them from their soveraign express a regular privat bodi lawful as a famili privat bodi regular and lawful ar those that ar constitut without letter or other written author save the law common to all other subject and becaus thei be unit in on person repres thei ar held for regular such as ar all famili in which the father or master ordereth the whole famili for he obligeth hi children and servant as farr as the law permitteth though not further becaus none of them ar bound to obedi in those action which the law hath forbidden to be done in all other action dure the time thei ar under domestiqu govern thei ar subject to their father and master as to their immedi soveraign for the father and master be befor the institut of commonwealth absolut soveraign in their own famili thei lose afterward no more of their author than the law of the commonwealth taketh from them privat bodi regular but unlawful privat bodi regular but unlawful ar those that unit themselv into on person repres without ani publiqu author at all such as ar the corpor of beggar theev and gipsi the better to order their trade of beg and steal and the corpor of men that by author from ani forraign person unit themselv in anoth dominion for easier propag of doctrin and for make a parti against the power of the commonwealth system irregular such as ar privat leagu irregular system in their natur but leagu or sometim meer concours of peopl without union to ani particular design not by oblig of on to anoth but proceed on from a similitud of will and inclin becom lawful or unlawful accord to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of everi particular man design therein and hi design is to be understood by the occas the leagu of subject becaus leagu ar commonli made for mutual defenc ar in a commonwealth which is no more than a leagu of all the subject togeth for the most part unnecessari and savour of unlawful design and ar for that caus unlawful and go commonli by the name of faction or conspiraci for a leagu be a connexion of men by coven if there be no power given to ani on man or assembl as in the condit of meer natur to compel them to perform is so long on valid as there ariseth no just caus of distrust and therefor leagu between commonwealth over whom there is no human power establish to keep them all in aw ar not on lawful but also profit for the time thei last but leagu of the subject of on and the same commonwealth where everi on mai obtain hi right by mean of the soveraign power ar unnecessari to the maintain of peac and justic and in case the design of them be evil or unknown to the commonwealth unlawful for all unit of strength by privat men is if for evil intent unjust if for intent unknown danger to the publiqu and unjustli conceal secret cabal if the soveraign power be in a great assembl and a number of men part of the assembl without author consult a part to contriv the guidanc of the rest thi is a faction or conspiraci unlawful as be a fraudul seduc of the assembl for their particular interest but if he whose privat interest is to be debat and judg in the assembl make as mani friend as he can in him it is no injustic becaus in thi case he is no part of the assembl and though he hire such friend with moni unless there be an express law against it yet it is not injustic for sometim as men manner ar justic cannot be had without moni and everi man mai think hi own caus just till it be heard and judg feud of privat famili in all commonwealth if a privat man entertain more servant than the govern of hi estat and lawful employ he ha for them requir it is faction and unlawful for have the protect of the commonwealth he needeth not the defenc of privat forc and wherea in nation not throughli civil several numer famili have live in continual hostil and invad on anoth with privat forc yet it is evid enough that thei have done unjustli or els that thei had no commonwealth faction for govern and as faction for kindr so also faction for govern of religion as of papist protest c or of state as patrician and plebeian of old time in rome and of aristocratical and democratical of old time in greec ar unjust as be contrari to the peac and safeti of the peopl and a take of the sword out of the hand of the soveraign concours of peopl is an irregular system the lawfulness or unlawfulness whereof dependeth on the occas and on the number of them that ar assembl if the occas be lawful and manifest the concours is lawful as the usual meet of men at church or at a publiqu shew in usual number for if the number be extraordinarili great the occas is not evid and consequ he that cannot render a particular and good account of hi be amongst them is to be judg consciou of an unlawful and tumultu design it mai be lawful for a thousand men to joyn in a petit to be deliv to a judg or magistr yet if a thousand men come to present it it is a tumultu assembl becaus there need but on or two for that purpos but in such case as these it is not a set number that make the assembl unlawful but such a number as the present offic ar not abl to suppress and bring to justic when an unusual number of men assembl against a man whom thei accus the assembl is an unlawful tumult becaus thei mai deliv their accus to the magistr by a few or by on man such wa the case of st paul at ephesu where demetriu and a great number of other men brought two of paul companion befor the magistr sai with on voyc great is diana of the ephesian which wa their wai of demand justic against them for teach the peopl such doctrin as wa against their religion and trade the occas here consid the law of that peopl wa just yet wa their assembl judg unlawful and the magistr reprehend them for it in these wordsact if demetriu and the other workmen can accus ani man of ani thing there be plea and deputi let them accus on anoth and if you have ani other thing to demand your case mai be judg in an assembl lawfulli call for we ar in danger to be accus for thi day sedit becaus there is no caus by which ani man can render ani reason of thi concours of peopl where he calleth an assembl whereof men can give no just account a sedit and such as thei could not answer for and thi is all i shall sai concern system and assembly of peopl which mai be compar as i said to the similar part of man bodi such as be lawful to the muscl such as ar unlawful to wen bile and apostem engendr by the unnatural conflux of evil

and give counsel to none but themselv chapter xxiv of the nutrit and procreat of a commonwealth the nourish of a commonwealth consisteth in the commod of sea and land the nutrit of a commonwealth consisteth in the plenti and distribut of materi conduc to life in concoct or prepar and when concoct in the convey of it by conveni conduit to the publiqu us as for the plenti of matter it is a thing limit by natur to those commod which from the two breast of our common mother land and sea god usual either freeli giveth or for labour selleth to mankind for the matter of thi nutriment consist in anim veget and miner god hath freeli layd them befor us in or neer to the face of the earth so as there needeth no more but the labour and industri of receiv them insomuch as plenti dependeth next to god favour meerli on the labour and industri of men thi matter commonli call commod is partli nativ and partli forraign nativ that which is to be had within the territori of the commonwealth forraign that which is import from without and becaus there is no territori under the dominion of on commonwealth except it be of veri vast extent that produceth all thing needful for the mainten and motion of the whole bodi and few that produc not someth more than necessari the superflu commod to be had within becom no more superflu but suppli these want at home by import of that which mai be had abroad either by exchang or by just warr or by labour for a man labour also is a commod exchang for benefit as well as ani other thing and there have been commonwealth that have no more territori than hath serv them for habit have nevertheless not on maintain but also encreas their power partli by the labour of trade from on place to anoth and partli by sell the manifactur whereof the materi were brought in from other place and the right of distribut of them the distribut of the materi of thi nourish is the constitut of mine and thine and hi that is to sai in on word proprieti and belongeth in all kind of commonwealth to the soveraign power for where there is no commonwealth there is as hath been alreadi shewn a perpetual warr of everi man against hi neighbour and therefor everi thing is hi that getteth it and keepeth it by forc which is neither proprieti nor commun but uncertainti which is so evid that even cicero a passion defend of liberti in a publiqu plead attributeth all proprieti to the law civil let the civil law saith he be onc abandon or but neglig guard not to sai oppress and there is noth that ani man can be sure to receiv from hi ancestor or leav to hi children and again take awai the civil law and no man know what is hi own and what anoth man see therefor the introduct of proprieti is an effect of commonwealth which can do noth but by the person that repres it it is the act on of the soveraign and consisteth in the law which none can make that have not the soveraign power and thi thei well knew of old who call that nomo that is to sai distribut which we call law and defin justic by distribut to everi man hi own all privat estat of land proce origin from the arbitrari distribut of the soveraign in thi distribut the first law is for divis of the land it self wherein the soveraign assigneth to everi man a portion accord as he and not accord as ani subject or ani number of them shall judg agreeabl to equiti and the common good the children of israel were a commonwealth in the wilderness but want the commod of the earth till thei were master of the land of promis which afterward wa divid amongst them not by their own discret but by the discret of eleazar the priest and joshua their general who when there were twelv tribe make them thirteen by subdivis of the tribe of joseph made nevertheless but twelv portion of the land and ordain for the tribe of levi no land but assign them the tenth part of the whole fruit which divis wa therefor arbitrari and though a peopl com into possess of a land by warr do not alwai extermin the antient inhabit as did the jew but leav to mani or most or all of them their estat yet it is manifest thei hold them afterward as of the victor distribut as the peopl of england held all their of william the conquerour proprieti of a subject exclud not the dominion of the soveraign but on of anoth subject from whenc we mai collect that the proprieti which a subject hath in hi land consisteth in a right to exclud all other subject from the us of them and not to exclud their soveraign be it an assembl or a monarch for see the soveraign that is to sai the commonwealth whose person he representeth is understood to do noth but in order to the common peac and secur thi distribut of land is to be understood as done in order to the same and consequ whatsoev distribut he shall make in prejudic thereof is contrari to the will of everi subject that commit hi peac and safeti to hi discret and conscienc and therefor by the will of everi on of them is to be reput voyd it is true that a soveraign monarch or the greater part of a soveraign assembl mai ordain the do of mani thing in pursuit of their passion contrari to their own conscienc which is a breach of trust and of the law of natur but thi is not enough to authoris ani subject either to make warr upon or so much as to accus of injustic or ani wai to speak evil of their soveraign becaus thei have authoris all hi action and in bestow the soveraign power made them their own but in what case the command of soveraign ar contrari to equiti and the law of natur is to be consid hereaft in anoth place the publiqu is not to be diet in the distribut of land the commonwealth it self mai be conceiv to have a portion and possess and improv the same by their repres and that such portion mai be made suffici to sustein the whole expenc to the common peac and defenc necessarili requir which were veri true if there could be ani repres conceiv free from human passion and infirm but the natur of men be as it is the set forth of publiqu land or of ani certain revenu for the commonwealth is in vain and tendeth to the dissolut of govern and to the condit of meer natur and war assoon as ever the soveraign power falleth into the hand of a monarch or of an assembl that ar either too neglig of moni or too hazard in engag the publiqu stock into a long or costli war commonwealth can endur no diet for see their expenc is not limit by their own appetit but by external accid and the appetit of their neighbour the publiqu rich cannot be limit by other limit than those which the emerg occas shall requir and wherea in england there were by the conquerour diver land reserv to hi own us besid forrest and chase either for hi recreat or for preserv of wood and diver servic reserv on the land he gave hi subject yet it seem thei were not reserv for hi mainten in hi publiqu but in hi natural capac for he and hi successor did for all that lai arbitrari tax on all subject land when thei judg it necessari or if those publiqu land and servic were ordain as a suffici mainten of the commonwealth it wa contrari to the scope of the institut be as it appear by those ensu tax insuffici and as it appear by the late revenu of the crown subject to alien and diminut it is therefor in vain to assign a portion to the commonwealth which mai sell or give it awai and doe sell and give it awai when ti done by their repres the place and matter of traffiqu depend as their distribut on the soveraign as the distribut of land at home so also to assign in what place and for what commod the subject shall traffiqu abroad belongeth to the soveraign for if it did belong to privat person to us their own discret therein some of them would bee drawn for gain both to furnish the enemi with mean to hurt the commonwealth and hurt it themselv by import such thing as pleas men appetit be nevertheless noxiou or at least unprofit to them and therefor it belongeth to the commonwealth that is to the soveraign onli to approv or disapprov both of the place and matter of forraign traffiqu the law of transfer properti belong also to the soveraign further see it is not enough to the sustent of a commonwealth that everi man have a proprieti in a portion of land or in some few commod or a natural properti in some useful art and there is no art in the world but is necessari either for the be or well be almost of everi particular man it is necessari that men distribut that which thei can spare and transferr their proprieti therein mutual on to anoth by exchang and mutual contract and therefor it belongeth to the commonwealth that is to sai to the soveraign to appoint in what manner all kind of contract between subject as bui sell exchang borrow lend let and take to hire ar to bee made and by what word and sign thei shall be understood for valid and for the matter and distribut of the nourish to the several member of the commonwealth thu much consid the model of the whole work is suffici moni the bloud of a commonwealth by concoct i understand the reduc of all commod which ar not present consum but reserv for nourish in time to come to some thing of equal valu and withal so portabl as not to hinder the motion of men from place to place to the end a man mai have in what place soever such nourish as the place affordeth and thi is noth els but gold and silver and moni for gold and silver be as it happen almost in all countri of the world highli valu is a commodi measur for the valu of all thing els between nation and moni of what matter soever coyn by the soveraign of a commonwealth is a suffici measur of the valu of all thing els between the subject of that commonwealth by the mean of which measur all commod moveabl and immov ar made to accompani a man to all place of hi resort within and without the place of hi ordinari resid and the same passeth from man to man within the commonwealth and goe round about nourish as it passeth everi part thereof in so much as thi concoct is as it were the sanguif of the commonwealth for natural bloud is in like manner made of the fruit of the earth and circul nourisheth by the wai everi member of the bodi of man and becaus silver and gold have their valu from the

the treasur again and the offic appoint for payment of several publiqu or privat minist and in thi also the artificial man maintain hi resembl with the natural whose vein receiv the bloud from the several part of the bodi carri it to the heart where be made vital the heart by the arteri send it out again to enliven and enabl for motion all the member of the same the children of a commonwealth coloni the procreat or children of a commonwealth ar those we call plantat or coloni which ar number of men sent out from the commonwealth under a conductor or governour to inhabit a forraign countri either formerli voyd of inhabit or made voyd then by warr and when a coloni is setl thei ar either a commonwealth of themselv discharg of their subject to their soveraign that sent them as hath been done by mani commonwealth of antient time in which case the commonwealth from which thei went wa call their metropoli or mother and requir no more of them then father requir of the children whom thei emancip and make free from their domestiqu govern which is honour and friendship or els thei remain unit to their metropoli as were the coloni of the peopl of rome and then thei ar no commonwealth themselv but provinc and part of the commonwealth that sent them so that the right of coloni save honour and leagu with their metropoli dependeth wholli on their licenc or letter by which their soveraign authoris them to plant chapter xxv of counsel counsel what how fallaci it is to judg of the natur of thing by the ordinari and inconst us of word appeareth in noth more than in the confus of counsel and command aris from the imper manner of speak in them both and in mai other occas besid for the word doe thi ar the word not on of him that commandeth but also of him that giveth counsel and of him that exhorteth and yet there ar but few that see not that these ar veri differ thing or that cannot distinguish between them when thei perceiv who it is that speaketh and to whom the speech is direct and upon what occas but find those phrase in men write and be not abl or not will to enter into a consider of the circumst thei mistak sometim the precept of counsellour for the precept of them that command and sometim the contrari accord as it best agreeth with the conclus thei would inferr or the action thei approv to avoyd which mistak and render to those term of command counsel and exhort their proper and distinct signif i defin them thu differ between command and counsel command is where a man saith doe thi or doe thi not without expect other reason than the will of him that say it from thi it followeth manifestli that he that commandeth pretendeth therebi hi own benefit for the reason of hi command is hi own will on and the proper object of everi man will is some good to himself counsel is where a man saith doe or doe not thi and deduceth hi own reason from the benefit that arriveth by it to him to whom he saith it and from thi it is evid that he that giveth counsel pretendeth on whatsoev he intendeth the good of him to whom he giveth it therefor between counsel and command on great differ is that command is direct to a man own benefit and counsel to the benefit of anoth man and from thi ariseth anoth differ that a man mai be oblig to do what he is command as when he hath coven to obei but he cannot be oblig to do as he is counsel becaus the hurt of not follow it is hi own or if he should coven to follow it then is the counsel turn into the natur of a command a third differ between them is that no man can pretend a right to be of anoth man counsel becaus he is not to pretend benefit by it to himself but to demand right to counsel anoth argu a will to know hi design or to gain some other good to himself which as i said befor is of everi man will the proper object thi also is incid to the natur of counsel that whatsoev it be he that asketh it cannot in equiti accus or punish it for to ask counsel of anoth is to permit him to give such counsel as he shall think best and consequ he that giveth counsel to hi soveraign whether a monarch or an assembl when he asketh it cannot in equiti be punish for it whether the same be conform to the opinion of the most or not so it be to the proposit in debat for if the sens of the assembl can be taken notic of befor the debat be end thei should neither ask nor take ani further counsel for the sens of the assembl is the resolut of the debat and end of all deliber and gener he that demandeth counsel is author of it and therefor cannot punish it and what the soveraign cannot no man els can but if on subject giveth counsel to anoth to do ani thing contrari to the law whether that counsel proce from evil intent or from ignor on it is punish by the commonwealth becaus ignor of the law is no good excus where everi man is bound to take notic of the law to which he is subject exhort and dehort what exhort and dehort is counsel accompani with sign in him that giveth it of vehement desir to have it follow or to sai it more briefli counsel vehement press for he that exhorteth doth not deduc the consequ of what he adviseth to be done and tye himself therein to the rigour of true reason but encourag him he counselleth to action as he that dehorteth deterreth him from it and therefor thei have in their speech a regard to the common passion and opinion of men in deduc their reason and make us of similitud metaphor exampl and other tool of oratori to perswad their hearer of the util honour or justic of follow their advis from whenc mai be infer first that exhort and dehort is direct to the good of him that giveth the counsel not of him that asketh it which is contrari to the duti of a counsellour who by the definit of counsel ought to regard not hi own benefit but hi whom he adviseth and that he directeth hi counsel to hi own benefit is manifest enough by the long and vehement urg or by the artifici give thereof which be not requir of him and consequ proceed from hi own occas is direct princip to hi own benefit and but accidentarili to the good of him that is counsel or not at all secondli that the us of exhort and dehort lyeth on where a man is to speak to a multitud becaus when the speech is address to on he mai interrupt him and examin hi reason more rigor than can be done in a multitud which ar too mani to enter into disput and dialogu with him that speaketh indiffer to them all at onc thirdli that thei that exhort and dehort where thei ar requir to give counsel ar corrupt counsellour and as it were bribe by their own interest for though the counsel thei give be never so good yet he that give it is no more a good counsellour than he that giveth a just sentenc for a reward is a just judg but where a man mai lawfulli command as a father in hi famili or a leader in an armi hi exhort and dehort ar not on lawful but also necessari and laudabl but then thei ar no more counsel but command which when thei ar for execut of sour labour sometim necess and alway human requireth to be sweetn in the deliveri by encourag and in the tune and phrase of counsel rather then in harsher languag of command exampl of the differ between command and counsel we mai take from the form of speech that express them in holi scriptur have no other god but me make to thy self no graven imag take not god name in vain sanctifi the sabbath honour thy parent kill not steal not c ar command becaus the reason for which we ar to obei them is drawn from the will of god our king whom we ar oblig to obei but these word sell all thou hast give it to the poor and follow me ar counsel becaus the reason for which we ar to do so is drawn from our own benefit which is thi that we shall have treasur in heaven these word go into the villag over against you and you shall find an ass ty and her colt loos her and bring her to me ar a command for the reason of their fact is drawn from the will of their master but these word repent and be baptiz in the name of jesu ar counsel becaus the reason why we should so do tendeth not to ani benefit of god almighti who shall still be king in what manner soever we rebel but of our selv who have no other mean of avoyd the punish hang over us for our sin differ of fit and unfit counsellour as the differ of counsel from command hath been now deduc from the natur of counsel consist in a deduc of the benefit or hurt that mai aris to him that is to be counsel by the necessari or probabl consequ of the action he propoundeth so mai also the differ between apt and inept counsellour be deriv from the same for experi be but memori of the consequ of like action formerli observ and counsel but the speech wherebi that experi is made known to anoth the vertu and defect of counsel ar the same with the vertu and defect intellectual and to the person of a commonwealth hi counsellour serv him in the place of memori and mental discours but with thi resembl of the commonwealth to a natural man there is on dissimilitud joyn of great import which is that a natural man receiveth hi experi from the natural object of sens which work upon him without passion or interest of their own wherea thei that give counsel to the repres person of a commonwealth mai have and have often their particular end and passion that render their counsel alway suspect and mani time unfaithful and therefor we mai set down for the first condit of a good counsellour that hi end and interest be not inconsist with the end and interest of him he counselleth secondli becaus the offic of a counsellour when an action come into deliber is to make manifest the consequ of it in such manner as he that is counsel mai be truli and evid inform he ought to propound hi advis in such form of speech as mai make the truth most evid appear that is to sai with as firm ratiocin as signific and proper languag and as briefli as the evid will permit and therefor rash and unevid infer such as ar fetch on from exampl or author of book and ar not argument of what is good or evil but wit of fact or of opinion obscur confus and ambigu express also all metaphorical speech tend to the stir up of passion becaus such reason and such express ar useful on to deceiv or to lead him we counsel toward other end than hi own ar repugn to the offic of a counsellour thirdli becaus the abil of counsel proceedeth from experi and long studi and no man is presum to have experi in all those thing that to the administr of a great commonwealth ar necessari to be known no man is presum to be a good counsellour but in such business as he hath not on been much vers in but hath also much medit on and consid for see the business of a commonwealth is thi to preserv the peopl at home and defend them against forraign invas we shall find it requir great knowledg of the disposit of mankind of the right of govern and of the natur of equiti law justic and honour not to be attain without studi and of the strength commod place both of their own countri and their neighbour as also of the inclin and design of all nation that mai ani wai annoi them and thi is not attain to without much experi of which thing not on the whole summ but everi on of the particular requir the ag and observ of a man in year and of more than ordinari studi the wit requir for counsel as i have said befor is judgement and the differ of men in that point come from differ educ of some to on kind of studi or business and of other to anoth when for the do of ani thing there be infal rule as in engin and edific the rule of geometri all the experi of the world cannot equal hi counsel that ha learnt or found out the rule and when there is no such rule he that hath most experi in that particular kind of business ha therein the best judgement and is the best counsellour fourthli to be abl to give counsel to a commonwealth in a business that hath refer to anoth commonwealth it is necessari to be acquaint with the intellig and letter that come from thenc and with all the record of treati and other transact of state between them which none can doe but such as the repres shall think fit by which we mai see that thei who ar not call to counsel can have no good counsel in such case to obtrud fifthli suppos the number of counsellor equal a man is better counsel by hear them apart then in an assembl and that for mani caus first in hear them apart you have the advic of everi man but in an assembl mai of them deliv their advis with i or no or with their hand or feet not move by their own sens but by the eloqu of anoth or for fear of displeas some that have spoken or the whole assembl by contradict or for fear of appear duller in apprehens than those that have applaud the contrari opinion secondli in an assembl of mani there cannot choos but be some whose interest ar contrari to that of the publiqu and these their interest make passion and passion eloqu and eloqu draw other into the same advic for the passion of men which asund ar moder as the heat of on brand in assembl ar like mani brand that enflam on anoth especi when thei blow on anoth with orat to the set of the commonwealth on fire under pretenc of counsel it thirdli in hear everi man apart on mai examin when there is need the truth or probabl of hi reason and of the ground of the advis he give by frequent interrupt and object which cannot be done in an assembl where in everi difficult question a man is rather astoni and dazl with the varieti of discours upon it than inform of the cours he ought to take besid there cannot be an assembl of mani call togeth for advic wherein there be not some that have the ambit to be thought eloqu and also learn in the politiqu and give not their advic with care of the business propound but of the applaus of their motli orat made of the diver color thred or shred of author which is an impertin at least that take awai the time of seriou consult and in the secret wai of counsel apart is easili avoid fourthli in deliber that ought to be kept secret whereof there be mani occas in publiqu business the counsel of mani and especi in assembl ar danger and therefor great assembl ar necessit to commit such affair to lesser number and of such person as ar most vers and in whose fidel thei have most confid to conclud who is there that so far approv the take of counsel from a great assembl of counsellour that wisheth for or would accept of their pain when there is a question of marri hi children dispos of hi land govern hi household or manag hi privat estat especi if there be amongst them such as wish not hi prosper a man that doth hi business by the help of mani and prudent counsellour with everi on consult apart in hi proper element doe it best as he that useth abl second at tenni plai place in their proper station he doe next best that useth hi own judgement onli as he that ha no second at all but he that is carri up and down to hi business in a frame counsel which cannot move but by the plural of consent opinion the execut whereof is commonli out of envi or interest retard by the part dissent doe it worst of all and like on that is carri to the ball though by good player yet in a wheelebarrough or other frame heavi of it self and retard also by the inconcurr judgement and endeavour of them that drive it and so much the more as thei be more that set their hand to it and most of all when there is on or more amongst them that desir to have him lose and though it be true that mani ei see more then on yet it is not to be understood of mani counsellour but then onli when the final resolut is in on man otherwis becaus mani ey see the same thing in diver line and ar apt to look asquint toward their privat benefit thei that desir not to miss their mark though thei look about with two ey yet thei never aym but with on and therefor no great popular commonwealth wa ever kept up but either by a forraign enemi that unit them or by the reput of some on emin man amongst them or by the secret counsel of a few or by the mutual fear of equal faction and not by the open consult of the assembl and as for veri littl commonwealth be thei popular or monarchical there is no human wisdom can uphold them longer then the jealousi lasteth of their potent neighbour chapter xxvi of civil law civil law what by civil law i understand the law that men ar therefor bound to observ becaus thei ar member not of thi or that commonwealth in particular but of a commonwealth for the knowledg of particular law belongeth to them that profess the studi of the law of their several countri but the knowledg of civil law in general to ani man the antient law of rome wa call their civil law from the word civita which signifi a commonwealth and those countri which have been under the roman empir and govern by that law retain still such part thereof as thei think fit call that part the civil law to distinguish it from the rest of their own civil law but that is not it i intend to speak of here my design be not to shew what is law here and there but what is law as plato aristotl cicero and diver other have done without take upon them the profess of the studi of the law and first it manifest that law in general is not counsel but command nor a command of ani man to ani man but onli of him whose command is address to on formerli oblig to obei him and as for civil law it addeth onli the name of the person command which is persona civitati the person of the commonwealth which consid i defin civil law in thi manner civil law is to everi subject those rule which the commonwealth hath command him by word write or other suffici sign of the will to make us of for the distinct of right and wrong that is to sai of what is contrari and what is not contrari to the rule in which definit there is noth that is not at first sight evid for everi man seeth that some law ar address to all the subject in general some to particular provinc some to particular vocat and some to particular men and ar therefor law to everi of those to whom the command is direct and to none els as also that law ar the rule of just and unjust noth be reput unjust that is not contrari to some law likewis that none can make law but the commonwealth becaus our subject is to the commonwealth onli and that command ar to be signifi by suffici sign becaus a man know not otherwis how to obei them and therefor whatsoev can from thi definit by necessari consequ be deduc ought to be acknowledg for truth now i deduc from it thi that followeth the soveraign is legisl the legisl in all commonwealth is onli the soveraign be he on man as in a monarchi or on assembl of men as in a democraci or aristocraci for the legisl is he that maketh the law and the commonwealth onli praescrib and commandeth the observ of those rule which we call law therefor the commonwealth is the legisl but the commonwealth is no person nor ha capac to doe ani thing but by the repres that is the soveraign and therefor the soveraign is the sole legisl for the same reason none can abrog a law made but the soveraign becaus a law is not abrog but by anoth law that forbiddeth it to be put in execut and not subject to civil law the soveraign of a commonwealth be it an assembl or on man is not subject to the civil law for have power to make and repeal law he mai when he pleaseth free himself from that subject by repeal those law that troubl him and make of new and consequ he wa free befor for he is free that can be free when he will nor is it possibl for ani person to be bound to himself becaus he that can bind can releas and therefor he that is bound to himself on is not bound us a law not by vertu of time but of the soveraign consent when long us obtaineth the author of a law it is not the length of time that maketh the author but the will of the soveraign signifi by hi silenc for silenc is sometim an argument of consent and it is no longer law then the soveraign shall be silent therein and therefor if the soveraign shall have a question of right ground not upon hi present will but upon the law formerli made the length of time shal bring no prejudic to hi right but the question shal be judg by equiti for mani unjust action and unjust sentenc go uncontrol a longer time than ani man can rememb and our lawyer account no custom law but such as ar reason and that evil custom ar to be abolish but the judgement of what is reason and of what is to be abolish belongeth to him that maketh the law which is the soveraign assembl or monarch the law of natur and the civil law contain each other the law of natur and the civil law contain each other and ar of equal extent for the law of natur which consist in equiti justic gratitud and other moral vertu on these depend in the condit of meer natur as i have said befor in the end of the th chapter ar not properli law but qualiti that dispos men to peac and to obedi when a commonwealth is onc settl then ar thei actual law and not befor as be then the command of the commonwealth and therefor also civil law for it is the soveraign power that oblig men to obei them for in the differ of privat men to declar what is equiti what is justic and what is moral vertu and to make them bind there is need of the ordin of soveraign power and punish to be ordain for such as shall break them which ordin ar therefor part of the civil law the law of natur therefor is a part of the civil law in all commonwealth of the world reciproc also the civil law is a part of the dictat of natur for justic that is to sai perform of coven and give to everi man hi own is a dictat of the law of natur but everi subject in a commonwealth hath coven to obei the civil law either on with anoth as when thei assembl to make a common repres or with the repres it self on by on when subdu by the sword thei promis obedi that thei mai receiv life and therefor obedi to the civil law is part also of the law of natur civil and natural law ar not differ kind but differ part of law whereof on part be written is call civil the other unwritten natural but the right of natur that is the natural liberti of man mai by the civil law be abridg and restrain nai the end of make law is no other but such restraint without the which there cannot possibl be ani peac and law wa brought into the world for noth els but to limit the natural liberti of particular men in such manner as thei might not hurt but assist on anoth and joyn togeth against a common enemi provincial law ar not made by custom but by the soveraign power if the soveraign of on commonwealth subdu a peopl that have live under other written law and afterward govern them by the same law by which thei were govern befor yet those law ar the civil law of the victor and not of the vanquish commonwealth for the legisl is he not by whose author the law were first made but by whose author thei now continu to be law and therefor where there be diver provinc within the dominion of a commonwealth and in those provinc divers of law which commonli ar call the custom of each several provinc we ar not to understand that such custom have their forc on from length of time but that thei were antient law written or otherwis made known for the constitut and statut of their soveraign and ar now law not by vertu of the praescript of time but by the constitut of their present soveraign but if an unwritten law in all the provinc of a dominion shall be gener observ and no iniqu appear in the us thereof that law can be no other but a law of natur equal oblig all mankind some foolish opinion of lawyer concern the make of law see then all law written and unwritten have their author and forc from the will of the commonwealth that is to sai from the will of the repres which in a monarchi is the monarch and in other commonwealth the soveraign assembl a man mai wonder from whenc proce such opinion as ar found in the book of lawyer of emin in several commonwealth directli or by consequ make the legisl power depend on privat men or subordin judg as for exampl that the common law hath no controul but the parlament which is true on where a parlament ha the soveraign power and cannot be assembl nor dissolv but by their own discret for if there be a right in ani els to dissolv them there is a right also to controul them and consequ to controul their controul and if there be no such right then the controul of law is not parlamentum but rex in parlamento and where a parlament is soveraign if it should assembl never so mani or so wise men from the countri subject to them for whatsoev caus yet there is no man will believ that such an assembl hath therebi acquir to themselv a legisl power item that the two arm of a commonwealth ar forc and justic the first whereof is in the king the other deposit in the hand of the parlament as if a commonwealth could consist where the forc were in ani hand which justic had not the author to command and govern that law can never be against reason our lawyer ar agre and that not the letterthat is everi construct of it but that which is accord to the intent of the legisl is the law and it is true but the doubt is of whose reason it is that shall be receiv for law it is not meant of ani privat reason for then there would be as much contradict in the law as there is in the school nor yet as sr ed coke make it sir edward coke upon littleton lib ch fol b an artificial perfect of reason gotten by long studi observ and experi as hi wa for it is possibl long studi mai encreas and confirm erron sentenc and where men build on fals ground the more thei build the greater is the ruin and of those that studi and observ with equal time and dilig the reason and resolut ar and must remain discord and therefor it is not that juri prudentia or wisedom of subordin judg but the reason of thi our artificial man the commonwealth and hi command that maketh law and the commonwealth be in their repres but on person there cannot easili aris ani contradict in the law and when there doth the same reason is abl by interpret or alter to take it awai in all court of justic the soveraign which is the person of the commonwealth is he that judgeth the subordin judg ought to have regard to the reason which move hi soveraign to make such law that hi sentenc mai be accord thereunto which then is hi soveraign sentenc otherwis it is hi own and an unjust on law made if not also made known is no law from thi that the law is a command and a command consisteth in declar or manifest of the will of him that commandeth by voyc write or some other suffici argument of the same we mai understand that the command of the commonwealth is law on to those that have mean to take notic of it over natural fool children or madmen there is no law no more than over brute beast nor ar thei capabl of the titl of just or unjust becaus thei had never power to make ani coven or to understand the consequ thereof and consequ never took upon them to authoris the action of ani soveraign as thei must do that make to themselv a commonwealth and as those from whom natur or accid hath taken awai the notic of all law in general so also everi man from whom ani accid not proceed from hi own default hath taken awai the mean to take notic of ani particular law is excus if he observ it not and to speak properli that law is no law to him it is therefor necessari to consid in thi place what argument and sign be suffici for the knowledg of what is the law that is to sai what is the will of the soveraign as well in monarchi as in other form of govern unwritten law ar all of them law of natur and first if it be a law that oblig all the subject without except and is not written nor otherwis publish in such place as thei mai take notic thereof it is a law of natur for whatsoev men ar to take knowledg of for law not upon other men word but everi on from hi own reason must be such as is agreeabl to the reason of all men which no law can be but the law of natur the law of natur therefor need not ani publish nor proclam as be contain in thi on sentenc approv by all the world do not that to anoth which thou thinkest unreason to be done by anoth to thy self secondli if it be a law that oblig onli some condit of men or on particular man and be not written nor publish by word then also it is a law of natur and known by the same argument and sign that distinguish those in such a condit from other subject for whatsoev law is not written or some wai publish by him that make it law can be known no wai but by the reason of him that is to obei it and is therefor also a law not onli civil but natural for exampl if the soveraign emploi a publiqu minist without written instruct what to doe he is oblig to take for instruct the dictat of reason as if he make a judg the judg is to take notic that hi sentenc ought to be accord to the reason of hi soveraign which be alwai understood to be equiti he is bound to it by the law of natur or if an ambassador he is in al thing not contein in hi written instruct to take for instruct that which reason dictat to be most conduc to hi soveraign interest and so of all other minist of the soveraignti publiqu and privat all which instruct of natural reason mai be comprehend under on name of fidel which is a branch of natural justic the law of natur except it belongeth to the essenc of all other law to be made known to everi man that shall be oblig to obei them either by word or write or some other act known to proce from the soveraign author for the will of anoth cannot be understood but by hi own word or act or by conjectur taken from hi scope and purpos which in the person of the commonwealth is to be suppos alwai conson to equiti and reason and in antient time befor letter were in common us the law were mani time put into vers that the rude peopl take pleasur in sing or recit them might the more easili retein them in memori and for the same reason solomon adviseth a man to bind the ten command prov upon hi ten finger and for the law which mose gave to the peopl of israel at the renew of the coven deut he biddeth them to teach it their children by discours of it both at home and upon the wai at go to bed and at rise from bed and to write it upon the post and dore of their hous and deut to assembl the peopl man woman and child to hear it read noth is law where the legisl cannot be known nor is it enough the law be written and publish but also that there be manifest sign that it proceedeth from the will of the soveraign for privat men when thei have or think thei have forc enough to secur their unjust design and convoi them safe to their ambiti end mai publish for law what thei pleas without or against the legisl author there is therefor requisit not onli a declar of the law but also suffici sign of the author and author the author or legisl is suppos in everi commonwealth to be evid becaus he is the soveraign who have been constitut by the consent of everi on is suppos by everi on to be suffici known and though the ignor and secur of men be such for the most part as that when the memori of the first constitut of their commonwealth is worn out thei doe not consid by whose power thei us to be defend against their enemi and to have their industri protect and to be right when injuri is done them yet becaus no man that consid can make question of it no excus can be deriv from the ignor of where the soveraignti is place and it is a dictat of natural reason and consequ an evid law of natur that no man ought to weaken that power the protect whereof he hath himself demand or wittingli receiv against other therefor of who is soveraign no man but by hi own fault whatsoev evil men suggest can make ani doubt the difficulti consisteth in the evid of the author deriv from him the remov whereof dependeth on the knowledg of the publiqu regist publiqu counsel publiqu minist and publiqu seal by which all law ar suffici verifi differ between verifi and authoris verifi i sai not authoris for the verif is but the testimoni and record not the author of the law which consisteth in the command of the soveraign onli the law verifi by the subordin judg if therefor a man have a question of injuri depend on the law of natur that is to sai on common equiti the sentenc of the judg that by commiss hath author to take cognis of such caus is a suffici verif of the law of natur in that individual case for though the advic of on that professeth the studi of the law be useful for the avoyd of content yet it is but advic ti the judg must tell men what is law upon the hear of the controversi by the publiqu regist but when the question is of injuri or crime upon a written law everi man by recours to the regist by himself or other mai if he will be suffici enform befor he doe such injuri or commit the crime whither it be an injuri or not nai he ought to doe so for when a man doubt whether the act he goeth about be just or injust and mai inform himself if he will the do is unlawful in like manner he that supposeth himself injur in a case determin by the written law which he mai by himself or other see and consid if he complain befor he consult with the law he doe unjustli and bewrayeth a disposit rather to vex other men than to demand hi own right by letter patent and publiqu seal if the question be of obedi to a publiqu offic to have seen hi commiss with the publiqu seal and heard it read or to have had the mean to be inform of it if a man would is a suffici verif of hi author for everi man is oblig to doe hi best endeavour to inform himself of all written law that mai concern hi own futur action the interpret of the law dependeth on the soveraign power the legisl known and the law either by write or by the light of natur suffici publish there wanteth yet anoth veri material circumst to make them obligatori for it is not the letter but the intend or mean that is to sai the authentiqu interpret of the law which is the sens of the legisl in which the natur of the law consisteth and therefor the interpret of all law dependeth on the author soveraign and the interpret can be none but those which the soveraign to whom onli the subject oweth obedi shall appoint for els by the craft of an interpret the law my be made to bear a sens contrari to that of the soveraign by which mean the interpret becom the legisl all law need interpret all law written and unwritten have need of interpret the unwritten law of natur though it be easi to such as without partial and passion make us of their natural reason and therefor leav the violat thereof without excus yet consid there be veri few perhap none that in some case ar not blind by self love or some other passion it is now becom of all law the most obscur and ha consequ the greatest need of abl interpret the written law if thei be short ar easili misinterpret from the diver signif of a word or two if long thei be more obscur by the divers signif of mani word in so much as no written law deliv in few or mani word can be well understood without a perfect understand of the final caus for which the law wa made the knowledg of which final caus is in the legisl to him therefor there can not be ani knot in the law insolubl either by find out the end to undo it by or els by make what end he will as alexand did with hi sword in the gordian knot by the legisl power which no other interpret can doe the authentical interpret of law is not that of writer the interpret of the law of natur in a commonwealth dependeth not on the book of moral philosophi the author of writer without the author of the commonwealth maketh not their opinion law be thei never so true that which i have written in thi treatis concern the moral vertu and of their necess for the procur and maintain peac though it bee evid truth is not therefor present law but becaus in all commonwealth in the world it is part of the civil law for though it be natur reason yet it is by the soveraign power that it is law otherwis it were a great errour to call the law of natur unwritten law whereof wee see so mani volum publish and in them so mani contradict of on anoth and of themselv the interpret of the law is the judg give sentenc viva voce in everi particular case the interpret of the law of natur is the sentenc of the judg constitut by the soveraign author to hear and determin such controversi as depend thereon and consisteth in the applic of the law to the present case for in the act of judicatur the judg doth no more but consid whither the demand of the parti be conson to natural reason and equiti and the sentenc he giveth is therefor the interpret of the law of natur which interpret is authentiqu not becaus it is hi privat sentenc but becaus he giveth it by author of the soveraign wherebi it becom the soveraign sentenc which is law for that time to the parti plead the sentenc of a judg doe not bind him or anoth judg to give like sentenc in like case ever after but becaus there is no judg subordin nor soveraign but mai err in a judgement of equiti if afterward in anoth like case he find it more conson to equiti to give a contrari sentenc he is oblig to doe it no man error becom hi own law nor oblig him to persist in it neither for the same reason becom it a law to other judg though sworn to follow it for though a wrong sentenc given by author of the soveraign if he know and allow it in such law as ar mutabl be a constitut of a new law in case in which everi littl circumst is the same yet in law immut such as ar the law of natur thei ar no law to the same or other judg in the like case for ever after princ succe on anoth and on judg passeth anoth commeth nai heaven and earth shall pass but not on titl of the law of natur shall pass for it is the eternal law of god therefor all the sentenc of preced judg that have ever been cannot all togeth make a law contrari to natural equiti nor ani exampl of former judg can warrant an unreason sentenc or discharg the present judg of the troubl of studi what is equiti in the case he is to judg from the principl of hi own natural reason for exampl sake ti against the law of natur to punish the innoc and innoc is he that acquitteth himself judici and is acknowledg for innoc by the judg put the case now that a man is accus of a capital crime and see the power and malic of some enemi and the frequent corrupt and partial of judg runneth awai for fear of the event and afterward is taken and brought to a legal triall and maketh it suffici appear he wa not guilti of the crime and be thereof acquit is nevertheless condemn to lose hi good thi is a manifest condemn of the innoc i sai therefor that there is no place in the world where thi can be an interpret of a law of natur or be made a law by the sentenc of preced judg that had done the same for he that judg it first judg unjustli and no injustic can be a pattern of judgement to succeed judg a written law mai forbid innoc men to fly and thei mai be punish for fly but that fly for fear of injuri should be taken for presumpt of guilt after a man is alreadi absolv of the crime judici is contrari to the natur of a presumpt which hath no place after judgement given yet thi is set down by a great lawyer for the common law of england if a man saith he that is innoc be accus of feloni and for fear flyeth for the same albeit he judici acquitteth himself of the feloni yet if it be found that he fled for the feloni he shall notwithstand hi innoc forfeit all hi good chattel debt and duti for as to the forfeitur of them the law will admit no proof against the presumpt in law ground upon hi flight here you see an innoc man judici acquit notwithstand hi innoc when no written law forbad him to fly after hi acquital upon a presumpt in law condemn to lose all the good he hath if the law ground upon hi flight a presumpt of the fact which wa capital the sentenc ought to have been capital if the presumpt were not of the fact for what then ought he to lose hi good thi therefor is no law of england nor is the condemn ground upon a presumpt of law but upon the presumpt of the judg it is also against law to sai that no proof shall be admit against a presumpt of law for all judg soveraign and subordin if thei refus to hear proof refus to do justic for though the sentenc be just yet the judg that condemn without hear the proof offer ar unjust judg and their presumpt is but prejudic which no man ought to bring with him to the seat of justic whatsoev preced judgement or exampl he shall pretend to follow there be other thing of thi natur wherein men judgement have been pervert by trust to preced but thi is enough to shew that though the sentenc of the judg be a law to the parti plead yet it is no law to ani judg that shall succe him in that offic in like manner when question is of the mean of written law he is not the interpret of them that writeth a commentari upon them for commentari ar commonli more subject to cavil than the text and therefor need other commentari and so there will be no end of such interpret and therefor unless there be an interpret authoris by the soveraign from which the subordin judg ar not to reced the interpret can be no other than the ordinari judg in the some manner as thei ar in case of the unwritten law and their sentenc ar to be taken by them that plead for law in that particular case but not to bind other judg in like case to give like judgement for a judg mai err in the interpret even of written law but no errour of a subordin judg can chang the law which is the general sentenc of the soveraign the differ between the letter and sentenc of the law in written law men us to make a differ between the letter and the sentenc of the law and when by the letter is meant whatsoev can be gather from the bare word ti well distinguish for the signif of almost all word ar either in themselv or in the metaphorical us of them ambigu and mai be drawn in argument to make mani sens but there is on on sens of the law but if by the letter be meant the literal sens then the letter and the sentenc or intent of the law is all on for the literal sens is that which the legisl is alway suppos to be equiti for it were a great contum for a judg to think otherwis of the soveraign he ought therefor if the word of the law doe not fulli authoris a reason sentenc to suppli it with the law of natur or if the case be difficult to respit judgement till he have receiv more ampl author for exampl a written law ordaineth that he which is thrust out of hi hous by forc shall be restor by forc it happen that a man by neglig leav hi hous empti and return is kept out by forc in which case there is no special law ordain it is evid that thi case is contain in the same law for els there is no remedi for him at all which is to be suppos against the intent of the legisl again the word of the law commandeth to judg accord to the evid a man is accus falsli of a fact which the judg saw himself done by anoth and not by him that is accus in thi case neither shall the letter of the law be follow to the condemn of the innoc nor shall the judg give sentenc against the evid of the wit becaus the letter of the law is to the contrari but procur of the soveraign that anoth be made judg and himself witness so that the incommod that follow the bare word of a written law mai lead him to the intent of the law wherebi to interpret the same the better though no incommod can warrant a sentenc against the law for everi judg of right and wrong is not judg of what is commodi or incommodi to the commonwealth the abil requir in a judg the abil requir in a good interpret of the law that is to sai in a good judg ar not the same with those of an advoc name the studi of the law for a judg as he ought to take notic of the fact from none but the wit so also he ought to take notic of the law from noth but the statut and constitut of the soveraign alledg in the plead or declar to him by some that have author from the soveraign power to declar them and need not take care beforehand what hee shall judg for it shall bee given him what hee shall sai concern the fact by wit and what hee shall sai in point of law from those that shall in their plead shew it and by author interpret it upon the place the lord of parlament in england were judg and most difficult caus have been heard and determin by them yet few of them were much vers in the studi of the law and fewer had made profess of them and though thei consult with lawyer that were appoint to be present there for that purpos yet thei alon had the author of give sentenc in like manner in the ordinari triall of right twelv men of the common peopl ar the judg and give sentenc not on of the fact but of the right and pronounc simpli for the complayn or for the defend that is to sai ar judg not on of the fact but also of the right and in a question of crime not on determin whether done or not done but also whether it be murder homicid feloni assault and the like which ar determin of law but becaus thei ar not suppos to know the law of themselv there is on that hath author to enform them of it in the particular case thei ar to judg of but yet if thei judg not accord to that he tell them thei ar not subject therebi to ani penalti unless it be made appear thei did it against their conscienc or had been corrupt by reward the thing that make a good judg or good interpret of the law ar first a right understand of that principal law of natur call equiti which depend not on the read of other men write but on the goodness of a man own natural reason and medit is

method in the institut of justinian we find seven sort of civil law the edict constitut and epistl of the princ that is of the emperour becaus the whole power of the peopl wa in him like these ar the proclam of the king of england the decre of the whole peopl of rome comprehend the senat when thei were put to the question by the senat these were law at first by the vertu of the soveraign power

like to these law ar the act of parliament in england the decre of the common peopl exclud the senat when thei were put to the question by the tribun of the peopl for such of them as were not abrog by the emperour remain law by the author imperial like to these were the order of the hous of common in england senatu consulta the order of the senat becaus when the peopl of rome grew so numer as it wa inconveni to assembl them it wa thought fit by the emperour that men should consult the senat in stead of the peopl and these have some resembl with the act of counsel the edict of praetor and in some case of the aedil such as ar the chief justic in the court of england responsa prudentum which were the sentenc and opinion of those lawyer to whom the emperour gave author to interpret the law and to give answer to such as in matter of law demand their advic which answer the judg in give judgement were oblig by the constitut of the emperour to observ and should be like the report of case judg if other judg be by the law of england bound to observ them for the judg of the common law of england ar not properli judg but juri consulti of whom the judg who ar either the lord or twelv men of the

assur of the revel receiv by the declar and how can he be bound to obei them for the first question how a man can be assur of the revel of anoth without a revel particularli to himself it is evid imposs for though a man mai be induc to believ such revel from the miracl thei see him doe or from see the extraordinari sanctiti of hi life or from see the extraordinari wisedom or extraordinari felic of hi action all which ar mark of god extraordinari favour yet thei ar not assur evid of special revel miracl ar marvel work but that which is marvel to on mai not be so to anoth sanctiti mai be feign and the visibl felic of thi world ar most often the work of god by natural and ordinari caus and therefor no man can infal know by natural reason that anoth ha had a supernatural revel of god will but onli a belief everi on as the sign thereof shall appear greater or lesser a firmer or a weaker belief but for the second how he can be bound to obei them it is not so hard for if the law declar be not against the law of natur which is undoubtedli god law and he undertak to obei it he is bound by hi own act bound i sai to obei it but not bound to believ it for men belief and interiour cogit ar not subject to the command but onli to the oper of god ordinari or extraordinari faith of supernatural law is not a fulfil but onli an assent to the same and not a duti that we exhibit to god but a gift which god freeli giveth to whom he pleaseth as also unbelief is not a breach of ani of hi law but a reject of them all except the law natural but thi that i sai will be made yet cleerer by the exampl and testimoni concern thi point in holi scriptur the coven god made with abraham in a supernatural manner wa thu gen thi is the coven which thou shalt observ between me and thee and thy seed after thee abraham seed had not thi revel nor were yet in be yet thei ar a parti to the coven and bound to obei what abraham should declar to them for god law which thei could not be but in vertu of the obedi thei ow to their parent who if thei be subject to no other earthli power as here in the case of abraham have soveraign power over their children and servant again where god saith to abraham in thee shall all nation of the earth be bless for i know thou wilt command thy children and thy hous after thee to keep the wai of the lord and to observ righteousness and judgement it is manifest the obedi of hi famili who had no revel depend on their former oblig to obei their soveraign at mount sinai mose onli went up to god the peopl were forbidden to approach on pain of death yet were thei bound to obei all that mose declar to them for god law upon what ground but on thi submiss of their own speak thou to us and we will hear thee but let not god speak to us lest we dye by which two place it suffici appeareth that in a commonwealth a subject that ha no certain and assur revel particularli to himself concern the will of god is to obei for such the command of the commonwealth for if men were at liberti to take for god command their own dream and fanci or the dream and fanci of privat men scarc two men would agre upon what is god command and yet in respect of them everi man would despis the command of the commonwealth i conclud therefor that in all thing not contrari to the moral law that is to sai to the law of natur all subject ar bound to obei that for divin law which is declar to be so by the law of the commonwealth which also is evid to ani man reason for whatsoev is not against the law of natur mai be made law in the name of them that have the soveraign power and there is no reason men should be the less oblig by it when ti propound in the name of god besid there is no place in the world where men ar permit to pretend other command of god than ar declar for such by the commonwealth christian state punish those that revolt from christian religion and all other state those that set up ani religion by them forbidden for in whatsoev is not regul by the commonwealth ti equiti which is the law of natur and therefor an eternal law of god that everi man equal enjoi hi liberti anoth divis of law there is also anoth distinct of law into fundamental and not fundamental but i could never see in ani author what a fundamental law signifieth nevertheless on mai veri reason distinguish law in that manner a fundamental law what for a fundamental law in everi commonwealth is that which be taken awai the commonwealth faileth and is utterli dissolv as a build whose foundat is destroi and therefor a fundamental law is that by which subject ar bound to uphold whatsoev power is given to the soveraign whether a monarch or a soveraign assembl without which the commonwealth cannot stand such as is the power of war and peac of judicatur of elect of offic and of do whatsoev he shall think necessari for the publiqu good not fundamental is that the abrog whereof draweth not with it the dissolut of the commonwealth such as ar the law concern controversi between subject and subject thu much of the divis of law differ between law and right i find the word lex civili and ju civil that is to sai law and right civil promiscu us for the same thing even in the most learn author which nevertheless ought not to be so for right is liberti name that liberti which the civil law leav us but civil law is an oblig and take from us the liberti which the law of natur gave us natur gave a right to everi man to secur himself by hi own strength and to invad a suspect neighbour by wai of prevent but the civil law take awai that liberti in all case where the protect of the law mai be safe stayd for insomuch as lex and ju ar as differ as oblig and liberti and between a law and a charter likewis law and charter ar taken promiscu for the same thing yet charter ar donat of the soveraign and not law but exempt from law the phrase of a law is jubeo injungo i command and enjoyn the phrase of a charter is dedi concessi i have given i have grant but what is given or grant to a man is not forc upon him by a law a law mai be made to bind all the subject of a commonwealth a liberti or charter is onli to on man or some on part of the peopl for to sai all the peopl of a commonwealth have liberti in ani case whatsoev is to sai that in such case there hath been no law made or els have been made is now abrog chapter xxvii of crime excus and extenu sinn what a sinn is not on a transgress of a law but also ani contempt of the legisl for such contempt is a breach of all hi law at onc and therefor mai consist not on in the commiss of a fact or in the speak of word by the law forbidden or in the omiss of what the law commandeth but also in the intent or purpos to transgress for the purpos to break the law is some degre of contempt of him to whom it belongeth to see it execut to be delight in the imagin on of be possess of anoth man good servant or wife without ani intent to take them from him by forc or fraud is no breach of the law that sayth thou shalt not covet nor is the pleasur a man my have in imagin or dream of the death of him from whose life he expecteth noth but dammag and displeasur a sinn but the resolv to put some act in execut that tendeth thereto for to be pleas in the fiction of that which would pleas a man if it were reall is a passion so adhaer to the natur both of a man and everi other live creatur as to make it a sinn were to make sinn of be a man the consider of thi ha made me think them too sever both to themselv and other that maintain that the first motion of the mind though check with the fear of god be sinn but i confess it is safer to err on that hand than on the other a crime what a crime is a sinn consist in the commit by deed or word of that which the law forbiddeth or the omiss of what it hath command so that everi crime is a sinn but not everi sinn a crime to intend to steal or kill is a sinn though it never appear in word or fact for god that seeth the thought of man can lai it to hi charg but till it appear by some thing done or said by which the intent mai be crime which distinct the greek observ in the word amartema and egklema or aitia wherof the former which is translat sinn signifieth ani swarv from the law whatsoev but the two later which ar translat crime signifi that sinn on whereof on man mai accus anoth but of intent which never appear by ani outward act there is no place for human accus in like manner the latin by peccatum which is sinn signifi all manner of deviat from the law but by crimen which word thei deriv from cerno which signifi to perceiv thei mean on such sinn as my be made appear befor a judg and therfor ar not meer intent where no civil law is there is no crime from thi relat of sinn to the law and of crime to the civil law mai be infer first that where law ceaseth sinn ceaseth but becaus the law of natur is eternal violat of coven ingratitud arrog and all fact contrari to ani moral vertu can never ceas to be sinn secondli that the civil law ceas crime ceas for there be no other law remain but that of natur there is no place for accus everi man be hi own judg and accus on by hi own conscienc and clear by the uprightness of hi own intent when therefor hi intent is right hi fact is no sinn if otherwis hi fact is sinn but not crime thirdli that when the soveraign power ceaseth crime also ceaseth for where there is no such power there is no protect to be had from the law and therefor everi on mai protect himself by hi own power for no man in the institut of soveraign power can be suppos to give awai the right of preserv hi own bodi for the safeti whereof all soveraignti wa ordain but thi is to be understood on of those that have not themselv contribut to the take awai of the power that protect them for that wa a crime from the begin ignor of the law of natur excuseth no man the sourc of everi crime is some defect of the understand or some errour in reason or some sudden forc of the passion defect in the understand is ignor in reason erron opinion again ignor is of three sort of the law and of the soveraign and of the penalti ignor of the law of natur excuseth no man becaus everi man that hath attain to the us of reason is suppos to know he ought not to do to anoth what he would not have done to himself therefor into what place soever a man shall come if he do ani thing contrari to that law it is a crime if a man come from the indi hither and perswad men here to receiv a new religion or teach them ani thing that tendeth to disobedi of the law of thi countri though he be never so well perswad of the truth of what he teacheth he commit a crime and mai be justli punish for the same not on becaus hi doctrin is fals but also becaus he doe that which he would not approv in anoth name that com from henc he should endeavour to alter the religion there but ignor of the civil law shall excus a man in a strang countri till it be declar to him becaus till then no civil law is bind ignor of the civil law excuseth sometim in the like manner if the civil law of a man own countri be not so suffici declar as he mai know it if he will nor the action against the law of natur the ignor is a good excus in other case ignor of the civil law excuseth not ignor of the soveraign excuseth not ignor of the soveraign power in the place of a man ordinari resid excuseth him not becaus he ought to take notic of the power by which he hath been protect there ignor of the penalti excuseth not ignor of the penalti where the law is declar excuseth no man for in break the law which without a fear of penalti to follow were not a law but vain word he undergoeth the penalti though he know not what it is becaus whosoev voluntarili doth ani action accepteth all the known consequ of it but punish is a known consequ of the violat of the law in everi commonwealth which punish if it be determin alreadi by the law he is subject to that if not then is he subject to arbitrari punish for it is reason that he which doe injuri without other limit than that of hi own will should suffer punish without other limit than that of hi will whose law is therebi violat punish declar befor the fact excus from greater punish after it but when a penalti is either annex to the crime in the law it self or hath been usual inflict in the like case there the delinqu is excus from a greater penalti for the punish foreknown if not great enough to deterr men from the action is an invit to it becaus when men compar the benefit of their injustic with the harm of their punish by necess of natur thei choos that which appeareth best for themselv and therefor when thei ar punish more than the law had formerli determin or more than other were punish for the same crime it the law that tempt and deceiveth them noth can be made a crime by a law made after the fact no law made after a fact done can make it a crime becaus if the fact be against the law of natur the law wa befor the fact and a posit law cannot be taken notic of befor it be made and therefor cannot be obligatori but when the law that forbiddeth a fact is made befor the fact be done yet he that doth the fact is lyabl to the penalti ordain after in case no lesser penalti were made known befor neither by write nor by exampl for the reason immediatli befor alledg fals principl of right and wrong caus of crime from defect in reason that is to sai from errour men ar prone to violat the law three way first by presumpt of fals principl as when men from have observ how in all place and in all ag unjust action have been authoris by the forc and victori of those who have commit them and that potent men break through the cobweb law of their countri the weaker sort and those that have fail in their enterpris have been esteem the on crimin have thereupon taken for principl and ground of their reason that justic is but a vain word that whatsoev a man can get by hi own industri and hazard is hi own that the practic of all nation cannot be unjust that exampl of former time ar good argument of do the like again and mani more of that kind which be grant no act in it self can be a crime but must be made so not by the law but by the success of them that commit it and the same fact be vertuou or viciou as fortun pleaseth so that what mariu make a crime sylla shall make meritori and caesar the same law stand turn again into a crime to the perpetual disturb of the peac of the commonwealth fals teacher misinterpret the law of natur secondli by fals teacher that either misinterpret the law of natur make it therebi repugn to the law civil or by teach for law such doctrin of their own or tradit of former time as ar inconsist with the duti of a subject and fals infer from true principl by teacher thirdli by erron infer from true principl which happen commonli to men that ar hasti and praecipit in conclud and resolv what to do such as ar thei that have both a great opinion of their own understand and believ that thing of thi natur requir not time and studi but on common experi and a good natural wit whereof no man think himself unprovid wherea the knowledg of right and wrong which is no less difficult there is no man will pretend to without great and long studi and of those defect in reason there is none that can excus though some of them mai extenu a crime in ani man that pretendeth to the administr of hi own privat business much less in them that undertak a publiqu charg becaus thei pretend to the reason upon the want whereof thei would ground their excus by their passion of the passion that most frequent ar the caus of crime on is vainglori or a foolish overr of their own worth as if differ of worth were an effect of their wit or rich or bloud or some other natural qualiti not depend on the will of those that have the soveraign author from whenc proceedeth a presumpt that the punish ordain by the law and extend gener to all subject ought not to be inflict on them with the same rigour thei ar inflict on poor obscur and simpl men comprehend under the name of the vulgar presumpt of rich therefor it happeneth commonli that such as valu themselv by the greatness of their wealth adventur on crime upon hope of escap punish by corrupt publiqu justic or obtain pardon by moni or other reward and friend and that such as have multitud of potent kindr and popular men that have gain reput amongst the multitud take courag to violat the law from a hope of oppress the power to whom it belongeth to put them in execut wisedom and that such as have a great and fals opinion of their own wisedom take upon them to reprehend the action and call in question the author of them that govern and so to unsettl the law with their publiqu discours as that noth shall be a crime but what their own design requir should be so it happeneth also to the same men to be prone to all such crime as consist in craft and in deceiv of their neighbour becaus thei think their design ar too subtil to be perceiv these i sai ar effect of a fals presumpt of their own wisdom for of them that ar the first mover in the disturb of commonwealth which can never happen without a civil warr veri few ar left aliv long enough to see their new design establish so that the benefit of their crime redoundeth to poster and such as would least have wish it which argu thei were not as wise as thei thought thei were and those that deceiv upon hope of not be observ do commonli deceiv themselv the darkness in which thei believ thei lye hidden be noth els but their own blindness and ar no wiser than children that think all hid by hide their own ey and gener all vainglori men unless thei be withal timor ar subject to anger as be more prone than other to interpret for contempt the ordinari liberti of convers and there ar few crime that mai not be produc by anger hatr lust ambit covetousness caus of crime as for the passion of hate lust ambit and covetousness what crime thei ar apt to produc is so obviou to everi man experi and understand as there needeth noth to be said of them save that thei ar infirm so annex to the natur both of man and all other live creatur as that their effect cannot be hindr but by extraordinari us of reason or a constant sever in punish them for in those thing men hate thei find a continual and unavoyd molest wherebi either a man patienc must be everlast or he must be eas by remov the power of that which molesteth him the former is difficult the later is mani time imposs without some violat of the law ambit and covetousness ar passion also that ar perpetu incumb and press wherea reason is not perpetu present to resist them and therefor whensoev the hope of impun appear their effect proce and for lust what it want in the last it hath in the vehem which sufficeth to weigh down the apprehens of all easi or uncertain punish fear sometim caus of crime as when the danger is neither present nor corporeal of all passion that which enclineth men least to break the law is fear nai except some gener natur it is the on thing when there is appar of profit or pleasur by break the law that make men keep them and yet in mani case a crime mai be commit through fear for not everi fear justifi the action it produceth but the fear on of corporeal hurt which we call bodili fear and from which a man cannot see how to be deliv but by the action a man is assault fear present death from which he see not how to escap but by wound him that assaulteth him if he wound him to death thi is no crime becaus no man is suppos at the make of a commonwealth to have abandon the defenc of hi life or limb where the law cannot arriv time enough to hi assist but to kill a man becaus from hi action or hi threatn i mai argu he will kill me when he can see i have time and mean to demand protect from the soveraign power is a crime again a man receiv word of disgrac or some littl injuri for which thei that made the law had assign no punish nor thought it worthi of a man that hath the us of reason to take notic of and is afraid unless he reveng it he shall fall into contempt and consequ be obnoxi to the like injuri from other and to avoyd thi break the law and protect himself for the futur by the terrour of hi privat reveng thi is a crime for the hurt is not corporeal but phantastical and though in thi corner of the world made sensibl by a custom not mani year sinc begun amongst young and vain men so light as a gallant man and on that is assur of hi own courag cannot take notic of also a man mai stand in fear of spirit either through hi own superstit or through too much credit given to other men that tell him of strang dream and vision and therebi be made believ thei will hurt him for do or omit diver thing which nevertheless to do or omit is contrari to the law and that which is so done or omit is not to be excus by thi fear but is a crime for as i have shewn befor in the second chapter dream be natur but the fanci remain in sleep after the impress our sens had formerli receiv wake and when men ar by ani accid unassur thei have slept seem to be reall vision and therefor he that presum to break the law upon hi own or anoth dream or pretend vision or upon other fanci of the power of invis spirit than is permit by the commonwealth leaveth the law of natur which is a certain offenc and followeth the imageri of hi own or anoth privat man brain which he can never know whether it signifieth ani thing or noth nor whether he that tell hi dream sai true or lye which if everi privat man should have leav to do as thei must by the law of natur if ani on have it there could no law be made to hold and so all commonwealth would be dissolv crime not equal from these differ sourc of crime it appear alreadi that all crime ar not as the stoick of old time maintain of the same allai there is place not onli for excus by which that which seem a crime is prove to be none at all but also for extenu by which the crime that seem great is made less for though all crime doe equal deserv the name of injustic as all deviat from a strait line is equal crookedness which the stoick rightli observ yet it doe not follow that all crime ar equal unjust no more than that all crook line ar equal crook which the stoick not observ held it as great a crime to kill a hen against the law as to kill on father total excus that which total excuseth a fact and take awai from it the natur of a crime can be none but that which at the same time taketh awai the oblig of the law for the fact commit onc against the law if he that commit it be oblig to the law can be no other than a crime the want of mean to know the law total excuseth for the law whereof a man ha no mean to enform himself is not obligatori but the want of dilig to enquir shall not be consid as a want of mean nor shall ani man that pretendeth to reason enough for the govern of hi own affair be suppos to want mean to know the law of natur becaus thei ar known by the reason he pretend to onli children and madmen ar excus from offenc against the law natural where a man is captiv or in the power of the enemi and he is then in the power of the enemi when hi person or hi mean of live is so if it be without hi own fault the oblig of the law ceaseth becaus he must obei the enemi or dye and consequ such obedi is no crime for no man is oblig when the protect of the law faileth not to protect himself by the best mean he can if a man by the terrour of present death be compel to doe a fact against the law he is total excus becaus no law can oblig a man to abandon hi own preserv and suppos such a law were obligatori yet a man would reason thu if i doe it not i die present if i doe it i die afterward therefor by do it there is time of life gain natur therefor compel him to the fact when a man is destitut of food or other thing necessari for hi life and cannot preserv himself ani other wai but by some fact against the law as if in a great famin he take the food by forc or stealth which he cannot obtain for moni nor chariti or in defenc of hi life snatch awai anoth man sword he is total excus for the reason next befor alledg excus against the author again fact done against the law by the author of anoth ar by that author excus against the author becaus no man ought to accus hi own fact in anoth that is but hi instrument but it is not excus against a third person therebi injur becaus in the violat of the law both the author and actor ar criminal from henc it followeth that when that man or assembl that hath the soveraign power commandeth a man to do that which is contrari to a former law the do of it is total excus for he ought not to condemn it himself becaus he is the author and what cannot justli be condemn by the soveraign cannot justli be punish by ani other besid when the soveraign commandeth ani thing to be done against hi own former law the command as to that particular fact is an abrog of the law if that man or assembl that hath the soveraign power disclaim ani right essential to the soveraignti wherebi there accrueth to the subject ani liberti inconsist with the soveraign power that is to sai with the veri be of a commonwealth if the subject shall refus to obei the command in ani thing contrari to the liberti grant thi is nevertheless a sinn and contrari to the duti of the subject for he ought to take notic of what is inconsist with the soveraignti becaus it wa erect by hi own consent and for hi own defenc and that such liberti as is inconsist with it wa grant through ignor of the evil consequ thereof but if he not on disobei but also resist a publiqu minist in the execut of it then it is a crime becaus he might have been right without ani breach of the peac upon complaint the degre of crime ar taken on diver scale and measur first by the malign of the sourc or caus secondli by the contagion of the exampl thirdli by the mischief of the effect and fourthli by the concurr of time place and person presumpt of power aggravateth the same fact done against the law if it proce from presumpt of strength rich or friend to resist those that ar to execut the law is a greater crime than if it proce from hope of not be discov or of escap by flight for presumpt of impun by forc is a root from whenc springeth at all time and upon all temptat a contempt of all law wherea in the later case the apprehens of danger that make a man fly render him more obedi for the futur a crime which we know to be so is greater than the same crime proceed from a fals perswas that it is lawful for he that committeth it against hi own conscienc presumeth on hi forc or other power which encourag him to commit the same again but he that doth it by errour after the errour shewn him is conform to the law evil teacher extenu hee whose errour proce from the author of a teacher or an interpret of the law publiqu authoris is not so faulti as he whose errour proceedeth from a peremptori pursut of hi own principl and reason for what is taught by on that teacheth by publiqu author the commonwealth teacheth and hath a resembl of law till the same author controuleth it and in all crime that contain not in them a denyal of the soveraign power nor ar against an evid law excuseth total wherea he that groundeth hi action on hi privat judgement ought accord to the rectitud or errour thereof to stand or fall exampl of impun extenu the same fact if it have been constantli punish in other men as a greater crime than if there have been mai preced exampl of impun for those exampl ar so mani hope of impun given by the soveraign himself and becaus he which furnish a man with such a hope and presumpt of merci as encourageth him to offend hath hi part in the offenc he cannot reason charg the offend with the whole praemedit aggravateth a crime aris from a sudden passion is not so great as when the same ariseth from long medit for in the former case there is a place for extenu in the common infirm of human natur but he that doth it with praemedit ha us circumspect and cast hi ey on the law on the punish and on the consequ thereof to human societi all which in commit the crime hee hath contemn and postpos to hi own appetit but there is no suddenness of passion suffici for a total excus for all the time between the first know of the law and the commiss of the fact shall be taken for a time of deliber becaus he ought by medit of the law to rectifi the irregular of hi passion where the law is publiqu and with assidu befor all the peopl read and interpret a fact done against it is a greater crime than where men ar left without such instruct to enquir of it with difficulti uncertainti and interrupt of their call and be inform by privat men for in thi case part of the fault is discharg upon common infirm but in the former there is appar neglig which is not without some contempt of the soveraign power tacit approb of the soveraign extenu those fact which the law expresli condemneth but the lawmak by other manifest sign of hi will tacitli approveth ar less crime than the same fact condemn both by the law and lawmak for see the will of the lawmak is a law there appear in thi case two contradictori law which would total excus if men were bound to take notic of the soveraign approb by other argument than ar express by hi command but becaus there ar punish consequ not on to the transgress of hi law but also to the observ of it he is in part a caus of the transgress and therefor cannot reason imput the whole crime to the delinqu for exampl the law condemneth duell the punish is made capital on the contrari part he that refuseth duell is subject to contempt and scorn without remedi and sometim by the soveraign himself thought unworthi to have ani charg or prefer in warr if thereupon he accept duell consid all men lawfulli endeavour to obtain the good opinion of them that have the soveraign power he ought not in reason to be rigor punish see part of the fault mai be discharg on the punish which i sai not as wish liberti of privat reveng or ani other kind of disobedi but a care in governour not to counten ani thing obliqu which directli thei forbid the exampl of princ to those that see them ar and ever have been more potent to govern their action than the law themselv and though it be our duti to do not what thei do but what thei sai yet will that duti never be perform till it pleas god to give men an extraordinari and supernatural grace to follow that precept comparison of crime from their effect again if we compar crime by the mischief of their effect first the same fact when it redound to the dammag of mani is greater than when it redound to the hurt of few and therefor when a fact hurteth not on in the present but also by exampl in the futur it is a greater crime than if it hurt on in the present for the former is a fertil crime and multiply to the hurt of mani the later is barren to maintain doctrin contrari to the religion establish in the commonwealth is a greater fault in an authoris preacher than in a privat person so also is it to live prophan incontin or do ani irreligi act whatsoev likewis in a professor of the law to maintain ani point on do ani act that tendeth to the weakn of the soveraign power as a greater crime than in anoth man also in a man that hath such reput for wisedom as that hi counsel ar follow or hi action imit by mani hi fact against the law is a greater crime than the same fact in anoth for such men not on commit crime but teach it for law to all other men and gener all crime ar the greater by the scandal thei give that is to sai by becom stumblingblock to the weak that look not so much upon the wai thei go in as upon the light that other men carri befor them laesa majesta also fact of hostil against the present state of the commonwealth ar greater crime than the same act done to privat men for the dammag extend it self to all such ar the betrai of the strength or reveal of the secret of the commonwealth to an enemi also all attempt upon the repres of the commonwealth be it a monarch or an assembl and all endeavour by word or deed to diminish the author of the same either in the present time or in success which crime the latin understand by crimina laesa majestati and consist in design or act contrari to a fundamental law briberi and fals testimoni likewis those crime which render judgement of no effect ar greater crime than injuri done to on or a few person as to receiv moni to give fals judgement or testimoni is a greater crime than otherwis to deceiv a man of the like or a greater summ becaus not on he ha wrong that fall by such judgement but all judgement ar render useless and occas ministr to forc and privat reveng depecul also robberi and depecul of the publiqu treasur or revenu is a greater crime than the rob or defraud of a privat man becaus to robb the publiqu is to robb mani at onc counterfeit author also the counterfeit usurp of publiqu ministeri the counterfeit of publiqu seal or publiqu coin than counterfeit of a privat man person or hi seal becaus the fraud thereof extendeth to the dammag of mani crime against privat men compar of fact against the law done to privat men the greater crime is that where the dammag in the common opinion of men is most sensibl and therefor to kill against the law is a greater crime that ani other injuri life preserv and to kill with torment greater than simpli to kill and mutil of a limb greater than the spoyl a man of hi good and the spoyl a man of hi good by terrour of death or wound than by clandestin surrept and by clandestin surrept than by consent fraudul obtain and the violat of chastiti by forc greater than by flatteri and of a woman marri than of a woman not marri for all these thing ar commonli so valu though some men ar more and some less sensibl of the same offenc but the law regardeth not the particular but the general inclin of mankind and therefor the offenc men take from contum in word or gestur when thei produc no other harm than the present grief of him that is reproach hath been neglect in the law of the greek roman and other both antient and modern commonwealth suppos the true caus of such grief to consist not in the contum which take no hold upon men consciou of their own vertu but in the pusillanim of him that is offend by it also a crime against a privat man is much aggrav by the person time and place for to kill on parent is a greater crime than to kill anoth for the parent ought to have the honour of a soveraign though he have surrendr hi power to the civil law becaus he had it origin by natur and to robb a poor man is a greater crime than to robb a rich man becaus ti to the poor a more sensibl dammag and a crime commit in the time or place appoint for devot is greater than if commit at anoth time or place for it proce from a greater contempt of the law mani other case of aggrav and extenu might be ad but by these i have set down it is obviou to everi man to take the altitud of ani other crime propos publiqu crime what lastli becaus in almost all crime there is an injuri done not on to some privat man but also to the commonwealth the same crime when the accus is in the name of the commonwealth is call publiqu crime and when in the name of a privat man a privat crime and the plea accord thereunto call publiqu judicia publica plea of the crown or privat plea as in an accus of murder if the accus be a privat man the plea is a privat plea if the accus be the soveraign the plea is a publiqu plea chapter xxviii of punish and reward the definit of punish a punish is an evil inflict by publiqu author on him that hath done or omit that which is judg by the same author to be a transgress of the law to the end that the will of men mai therebi the better be dispos to obedi right to punish whenc deriv befor i inferr ani thing from thi definit there is a question to be answer of much import which is by what door the right or author of punish in ani case came in for by that which ha been said befor no man is suppos bound by coven not to resist violenc and consequ it cannot be intend that he gave ani right to anoth to lai violent hand upon hi person in the make of a commonwealth everi man giveth awai the right of defend anoth but not of defend himself also he obligeth himself to assist him that hath the soveraignti in the punish of anoth but of himself not but to coven to assist the soveraign in do hurt to anoth unless he that so covenanteth have a right to doe it himself is not to give him a right to punish it is manifest therefor that the right which the commonwealth that is he or thei that repres it hath to punish is not ground on ani concess or gift of the subject but i have also shew formerli that befor the institut of commonwealth everi man had a right to everi thing and to do whatsoev he thought necessari to hi own preserv subdu hurt or kill ani man in order thereunto and thi is the foundat of that right of punish which is exercis in everi commonwealth for the subject did not give the soveraign that right but on in lai down their strengthn him to us hi own as he should think fit for the preserv of them all so that it wa not given but left to him and to him on and except the limit set him by natural law as entir as in the condit of meer natur and of warr of everi on against hi neighbour privat injuri and reveng no punish from the definit of punish i inferr first that neither privat reveng nor injuri of privat men can properli be stile punish becaus thei proce not from publiqu author nor denyal of prefer secondli that to be neglect and unpref by the publiqu favour is not a punish becaus no new evil is therebi on ani man inflict he is on left in the estat he wa in befor nor pain inflict without publiqu hear thirdli that the evil inflict by publiqu author without preced publiqu condemn is not to be stile by the name of punish but of an hostil act becaus the fact for which a man is punish ought first to be judg by publiqu author to be a transgress of the law nor pain inflict by usurp power fourthli that the evil inflict by usurp power and judg without author from the soveraign is not punish but an act of hostil becaus the act of power usurp have not for author the person condemn and therefor ar not act of publiqu author nor pain inflict without respect to the futur good fifthli that all evil which is inflict without intent or possibl of dispos the delinqu or by hi exampl other men to obei the law is not punish but an act of hostil becaus without such an end no hurt done is contain under that name natural evil consequ no punish sixthli wherea to certain action there be annex by natur diver hurtful consequ as when a man in assault anoth is himself slain or wound or when he falleth into sickness by the do of some unlawful act such hurt though in respect of god who is the author of natur it mai be said to be inflict and therefor a punish divin yet it is not contan in the name of punish in respect of men becaus it is not inflict by the author of man hurt inflict if less than the benefit of transgress is not punish seventhli if the harm inflict be less than the benefit or content that natur followeth the crime commit that harm is not within the definit and is rather the price or redempt than the punish of a crime becaus it is of the natur of punish to have for end the dispos of men to obei the law which end if it be less that the benefit of the transgress it attaineth not but worketh a contrari effect where the punish is annex to the law a greater hurt is not punish but hostil eighthli if a punish be determin and prescrib in the law it self and after the crime commit there be a greater punish inflict the excess is not punish but an act of hostil for see the aym of punish is not a reveng but terrour and the terrour of a great punish unknown is taken awai by the declar of a less the unexpect addit is no part of the punish but where there is no punish at all determin by the law there whatsoev is inflict hath the natur of punish for he that goe about the violat of a law wherein no penalti is determin expecteth an indetermin that is to sai an arbitrari punish hurt inflict for a fact done befor the law no punish ninthli harm inflict for a fact done befor there wa a law that forbad it is not punish but an act of hostil for befor the law there is no transgress of the law but punish supposeth a fact judg to have been a transgress of the law therefor harm inflict befor the law made is not punish but an act of hostil the repres of the commonwealth unpunish tenthli hurt inflict on the repres of the commonwealth is not punish but an act of hostil becaus it is of the natur of punish to be inflict by publiqu author which is the author onli of the repres it self hurt to revolt subject is done by right of war not by wai of punish lastli harm inflict upon on that is a declar enemi fal not under the name of punish becaus see thei were either never subject to the law and therefor cannot transgress it or have been subject to it and profess to be no longer so by consequ deni thei can transgress it all the harm that can be done them must be taken as act of hostil but in declar hostil all inflict of evil is lawful from whenc it followeth that if a subject shall by fact or word wittingli and deliberatli deni the author of the repres of the commonwealth whatsoev penalti hath been formerli ordain for treason he mai lawfulli be made to suffer whatsoev the repres will for in deni subject he deny such punish as by the law hath been ordain and therefor suffer as an enemi of the commonwealth that is accord to the will of the repres for the punish set down in the law ar to subject not to enemi such as ar thei that have been by their own act subject deliber revolt deni the soveraign power the first and most general distribut of punish is into divin and human of the former i shall have occas to speak in a more conveni place hereaft human ar those punish that be inflict by the command of man and ar either corporal or pecuniari or ignomini or imprison or exil or mixt of these punish corporal corporal punish is that which is inflict on the bodi directli and accord to the intent of him that inflicteth it such as ar stripe or wound or depriv of such pleasur of the bodi as were befor lawfulli enjoi capital and of these some be capital some less than capital capital is the inflict of death and that either simpli or with torment less than capital ar stripe wound chain and ani other corporal pain not in it own natur mortal for if upon the inflict of a punish death follow not in the intent of the inflict the punish is not be bee esteem capital though the harm prove mortal by an accid not to be foreseen in which case death is not inflict but hasten pecuniari punish is that which consisteth not onli in the depriv of a summ of moni but also of land or ani other good which ar usual bought and sold for moni and in case the law that ordaineth such a punish be made with design to gather moni from such as shall transgress the same it is not properli a punish but the price of priviledg and exempt from the law which doth not absolut forbid the fact but onli to those that ar not abl to pai the moni except where the law is natural or part of religion for in that case it is not an exempt from the law but a transgress of it as where a law exacteth a pecuniari mulct of them that take the name of god in vain the payment of the mulct is not the price of a dispens to swear but the punish of the transgress of a law undispens in like manner if the law impos a summ of moni to be payd to him that ha been injur thi is but a satisfact for the hurt done him and extinguisheth the accus of the parti injur not the crime of the offend ignomini ignomini is the inflict of such evil as is made dishonor or the depriv of such good as is made honour by the commonwealth for there be some thing honor by natur as the effect of courag magnanim strength wisdom and other abil of bodi and mind other made honor by the commonwealth as badg titl offic or ani other singular mark of the soveraign favour the former though thei mai fail by natur or accid cannot be taken awai by a law and therefor the loss of them is not punish but the later mai be taken awai by the publiqu author that made them honor and ar properli punish such ar degrad men condemn of their badg titl and offic or declar them uncap of the like in time to come imprison imprison is when a man is by publiqu author depriv of liberti and mai happen from two diver end whereof on is the safe custodi of a man accus the other is the inflict of pain on a man condemn the former is not punish becaus no man is suppos to be punisht befor he be judici heard and declar guilti and therefor whatsoev hurt a man is made to suffer by bond or restraint befor hi caus be heard over and abov that which is necessari to assur hi custodi is against the law of natur but the later is punish becaus evil and inflict by publiqu author for somewhat that ha by the same author been judg a transgress of the law under thi word imprison i comprehend all restraint of motion caus by an external obstacl be it a hous which is call by the general name of a prison or an iland as when men ar said to be confin to it or a place where men ar set to work as in old time men have been condemn to quarri and in these time to galli or be it a chain or ani other such impedi exil exil banish is when a man is for a crime condemn to depart out of the dominion of the commonwealth or out of a certain part thereof and dure a prefix time or for ever not to return into it and seemeth not in it own natur without other circumst to be a punish but rather an escap or a publiqu command to avoid punish by flight and cicero say there wa never ani such punish ordain in the citi of rome but cal it a refug of men in danger for if a man banish be nevertheless permit to enjoi hi good and the revenu of hi land the meer chang of ayr is no punish nor doe it tend to that benefit of the commonwealth for which all punish ar ordain that is to sai to the form of men wil to the observ of the law but mani time to the dammag of the commonwealth for a banish man is a lawful enemi of the commonwealth that banish him as be no more a member of the same but if he be withal depriv of hi land or good then the punish lyeth not in the exil but is to be reckon amongst punish pecuniari the punish of innoc subject is contrari to the law of natur all punish of innoc subject be thei great or littl ar against the law of natur for punish is onli of transgress of the law and therefor there can be no punish of the innoc it is therefor a violat first of that law of natur which forbiddeth all men in their reveng to look at ani thing but some futur good for there can arriv no good to the commonwealth by punish the innoc secondli of that which forbiddeth ingratitud for see all soveraign power is origin given by the consent of everi on of the subject to the end thei should as long as thei ar obedi be protect therebi the punish of the innoc is a rendr of evil for good and thirdli of the law that commandeth equiti that is to sai an equal distribut of justic which in punish the innoc is not observ but the harm done to innoc in war not so but the inflict of what evil soever on an innoc man that is not a subject if it be for the benefit of the commonwealth and without violat of ani former coven is no breach of the law of natur for all men that ar not subject ar either enemi or els thei have ceas from be so by some preced coven but against enemi whom the commonwealth judgeth capabl to do them hurt it is lawful by the original right of natur to make warr wherein the sword judgeth not nor doth the victor make distinct of nocent and innoc as to the time past nor ha other respect of merci than as it conduceth to the good of hi own peopl and upon thi ground it is that also in subject who deliberatli deni the author of the commonwealth establish the vengeanc is lawfulli extend not on to the father but also to the third and fourth gener not yet in be and consequ innoc of the fact for which thei ar afflict becaus the natur of thi offenc consisteth in the renounc of subject which is a relaps into the condit of warr commonli call rebellion and thei that so offend suffer not as subject but as enemi for rebellion is but warr renew reward is either salari or grace reward is either of gift or by contract when by contract it is call salari and wage which is benefit due for servic perform or promis when of gift it is benefit proceed from the grace of them that bestow it to encourag or enabl men to do them servic and therefor when the soveraign of a commonwealth appointeth a salari to ani publiqu offic he that receiveth it is bound in justic to perform hi offic otherwis he is bound on in honour to acknowledg and an endeavour of requital for though men have no lawful remedi when thei be command to quit their privat business to serv the publiqu without reward or salari yet thei ar not bound thereto by the law of natur nor by the institut of the commonwealth unless the servic cannot otherwis be done becaus it is suppos the soveraign mai make us of all their mean insomuch as the most common souldier mai demand the wage of hi warrefar as a debt benefit bestow for fear ar not reward the benefit which a soveraign bestoweth on a subject for fear of some power and abil he hath to do hurt to the commonwealth ar not properli reward for thei ar not salary becaus there is in thi case no contract suppos everi man be oblig alreadi not to do the commonwealth disservic nor ar thei grace becaus thei be extort by fear which ought not to be incid to the soveraign power but ar rather sacrific which the soveraign consid in hi natural person and not in the person of the commonwealth make for the appeas the discont of him he think more potent than himself and encourag not to obedi but on the contrari to the continu and increas of further extort salari certain and casual and wherea some salari ar certain and proce from the publiqu treasur and other uncertain and casual proceed from the execut of the offic for which the salari is ordain the later is in some case hurtful to the commonwealth as in the case of judicatur for where the benefit of the judg and minist of a court of justic ariseth for the multitud of caus that ar brought to their cognis there must need follow two inconveni on is the nourish of sute for the more sute the greater benefit and anoth that depend on that which is content about jurisdict each court draw to it self as mani caus as it can but in offic of execut there ar not those inconveni becaus their employ cannot be encreas by ani endeavour of their own and thu much shall suffic for the natur of punish and reward which ar as it were the nerv and tendon that move the limb and joynt of a commonwealth hitherto i have set forth the natur of man whose pride and other passion have compel him to submit himself to govern togeth with the great power of hi governour whom i compar to leviathan take that comparison out of the two last vers of the on and fortieth of job where god have set forth the great power of leviathan call him king of the proud there is noth saith he on earth to be compar with him he is made so as not be afraid hee seeth everi high thing below him and is king of all the children of pride but becaus he is mortal and subject to decai as all other earthli creatur ar and becaus there is that in heaven though not on earth that he should stand in fear of and whose law he ought to obei i shall in the next follow chapter speak of hi diseas and the caus of hi mortal and of what law of natur he is bound to obei chapter xxix of those thing that weaken or tend to the dissolut of a commonwealth dissolut of commonwealth proceedeth from imperfect institut though noth can be immortal which mortal make yet if men had the us of reason thei pretend to their commonwealth might be secur at least from perish by internal diseas for by the natur of their institut thei ar design to live as long as mankind or as the law of natur or as justic it self which give them life therefor when thei come to be dissolv not by external violenc but intestin disord the fault is not in men as thei ar the matter but as thei ar the maker and order of them for men as thei becom at last weari of irregular justl and hew on anoth and desir with all their heart to conform themselv into on firm and last edific so for want both of the art of make fit law to squar their action by and also of humil and patienc to suffer the rude and combersom point of their present greatness to be taken off thei cannot without the help of a veri abl architect be compil into ani other than a crasi build such as hardli last out their own time must assuredli fall upon the head of their poster amongst the infirm therefor of a commonwealth i will reckon in the first place those that aris from an imperfect institut and resembl the diseas of a natural bodi which proce from a defectu procreat want of absolut power of which thi is on that a man to obtain a kingdom is sometim content with less power than to the peac and defenc of the commonwealth is necessarili requir from whenc it commeth to pass that when the exercis of the power layd by is for the publiqu safeti to be resum it hath the resembl of as unjust act which disposeth great number of men when occas is present to rebel in the same manner as the bodi of children gotten by diseas parent ar subject either to untim death or to purg the ill qualiti deriv from their viciou concept by break out into bile and scabb and when king deni themselv some such necessari power it is not alway though sometim out of ignor of what is necessari to the offic thei undertak but mani time out of a hope to recov the same again at their pleasur wherein thei reason not well becaus such as will hold them to their promis shall be maintain against them by forraign commonwealth who in order to the good of their own subject let slip few occas to weaken the estat of their neighbour so wa thoma beckett archbishop of canterburi support against henri the second by the pope the subject of ecclesiastiqu to the commonwealth have been dispens with by william the conqueror at hi recept when he took an oath not to infring the liberti of the church and so were the baron whose power wa by william rufu to have their help in transfer the success from hi elder brother to himself encreas to a degre inconsist with the soveraign power maintain in their rebellion against king john by the french nor doe thi happen in monarchi on for wherea the stile of the antient roman commonwealth wa the senat and peopl of rome neither senat nor peopl pretend to the whole power which first caus the sedit of tiberiu gracchu caiu gracchu luciu saturniu and other and afterward the warr between the senat and the peopl under mariu and sylla and again under pompei and caesar to the extinct of their democrati and the set up of monarchi the peopl of athen bound themselv but from on on action which wa that no man on pain of death should propound the renew of the warr for the island of salami and yet therebi if solon had not caus to be given out he wa mad and afterward in gestur and habit of a madman and in vers propound it to the peopl that flock about him thei had had an enemi perpetu in readiness even at the gate of their citi such dammag or shift ar all commonwealth forc to that have their power never so littl limit privat judgement of good and evil in the second place i observ the diseas of a commonwealth that proce from the poyson of sediti doctrin whereof on is that everi privat man is judg of good and evil action thi is true in the condit of meer natur where there ar no civil law and also under civil govern in such case as ar not determin by the law but otherwis it is manifest that the measur of good and evil action is the civil law and the judg the legisl who is alway repres of the commonwealth from thi fals doctrin men ar dispos to debat with themselv and disput the command of the commonwealth and afterward to obei or disobei them as in their privat judgement thei shall think fit wherebi the commonwealth is distract and weaken erron conscienc anoth doctrin repugn to civil societi is that whatsoev a man doe against hi conscienc is sinn and it dependeth on the presumpt of make himself judg of good and evil for a man conscienc and hi judgement is the same thing and as the judgement so also the conscienc mai be erron therefor though he that is subject to no civil law sinneth in all he doe against hi conscienc becaus he ha no other rule to follow but hi own reason yet it is not so with him that live in a commonwealth becaus the law is the publiqu conscienc by which he hath alreadi undertaken to be guid otherwis in such divers as there is of privat conscienc which ar but privat opinion the commonwealth must need be distract and no man dare to obei the soveraign power farther than it shall seem good in hi own ey pretenc of inspir it hath been also commonli taught that faith and sanctiti ar not to be attain by studi and reason but by supernatural inspir or infus which grant i see not why ani man should render a reason of hi faith or why everi christian should not be also a prophet or why ani man should take the law of hi countri rather than hi own inspir for the rule of hi action and thu wee fall again into the fault of take upon us to judg of good and evil or to make judg of it such privat men as pretend to be supernatur inspir to the dissolut of all civil govern faith come by hear and hear by those accid which guid us into the presenc of them that speak to us which accid ar all contriv by god almighti and yet ar not supernatural but on for the great number of them that concurr to everi effect unobserv faith and sanctiti ar inde not veri frequent but yet thei ar not miracl but brought to pass by educ disciplin correct and other natural way by which god worketh them in hi elect as such time as he thinketh fit and these three opinion pernici to peac and govern have in thi part of the world proceed chiefli from the tongu and pen of unlearn divin who joyn the word of holi scriptur togeth otherwis than is agreeabl to reason do what thei can to make men think that sanctiti and natural reason cannot stand togeth subject the soveraign power to civil law a fourth opinion repugn to the natur of a commonwealth is thi that he that hath the soveraign power is subject to the civil law it is true that soveraign ar all subject to the law of natur becaus such law be divin and cannot by ani man or commonwealth be abrog but to those law which the soveraign himself that is which the commonwealth maketh he is not subject for to be subject to law is to be subject to the commonwealth that is to the soveraign repres that is to himself which is not subject but freedom from the law which errour becaus it setteth the law abov the soveraign setteth also a judg abov him and a power to punish him which is to make a new soveraign and again for the same reason a third to punish the second and so continu without end to the confus and dissolut of the commonwealth attribut of absolut proprieti to the subject a fifth doctrin that tendeth to the dissolut of a commonwealth is that everi privat man ha an absolut proprieti in hi good such as excludeth the right of the soveraign everi man ha inde a proprieti that exclud the right of everi other subject and he ha it on from the soveraign power without the protect whereof everi other man should have equal right to the same but if the right of the soveraign also be exclud he cannot perform the offic thei have put him into which is to defend them both from forraign enemi and from the injuri of on anoth and consequ there is no longer a commonwealth and if the proprieti of subject exclud not the right of the soveraign repres to their good much less to their offic of judicatur or execut in which thei repres the soveraign himself divid of the soveraign power there is a sixth doctrin plainli and directli against the essenc of a commonwealth and ti thi that the soveraign power mai be divid for what is it to divid the power of a commonwealth but to dissolv it for power divid mutual destroi each other and for these doctrin men ar chiefli behold to some of those that make profess of the law endeavour to make them depend upon their own learn and not upon the legisl power imit of neighbour nation and as fals doctrin so also oftentim the exampl of differ govern in a neighbour nation disposeth men to alter of the form alreadi setl so the peopl of the jew were stir up to reject god and to call upon the prophet samuel for a king after the manner of the nation so also the lesser citi of greec were continu disturb with sedit of the aristocratical and democratical faction on part of almost everi commonwealth desir to imit the lacedaemonian the other the athenian and i doubt not but mani men have been content to see the late troubl in england out of an imit of the low countri suppos there need no more to grow rich than to chang as thei had done the form of their govern for the constitut of man natur is of it self subject to desir novelti when therefor thei ar provok to the same by the neighbourhood also of those that have been enrich by it it is almost imposs for them not to be content with those that solicit them to chang and love the first begin though thei be griev with the continu of disord like hot bloud that have gotten the itch tear themselv with their own nayl till thei can endur the smart no longer imit of the greek and roman and as to rebellion in particular against monarchi on of the most frequent caus of it is the read of the book of polici and histori of the antient greek and roman from which young men and all other that ar unprovid of the antidot of solid reason receiv a strong and delightful impress of the great exploit of warr atchiev by the conductor of their armi receiv withal a pleas idea of all thei have done besid and imagin their great prosper not to have proceed from the aemul of particular men but from the vertu of their popular form of govern not consid the frequent sedit and civil warr produc by the imperfect of their polici from the read i sai of such book men have undertaken to kill their king becaus the greek and latin writer in their book and discours of polici make it lawful and laudabl for ani man so to do provid befor he do it he call him tyrant for thei sai not regicid that is kill of a king but tyrannicid that is kill of a tyrant is lawful from the same book thei that live under a monarch conceiv an opinion that the subject in a popular commonwealth enjoi liberti but that in a monarchi thei ar all slave i sai thei that live under a monarchi conceiv such an opinion not thei that live under a popular govern for thei find no such matter in summ i cannot imagin how anyth can be more prejudicial to a monarchi than the allow of such book to be publik read without present appli such correct of discreet master as ar fit to take awai their venim which venim i will not doubt to compar to the bite of a mad dogg which is a diseas the physician call hydrophobia or fear of water for as he that is so bitten ha a continual torment of thirst and yet abhorreth water and is in such an estat as if the poyson endeavour to convert him into a dogg so when a monarchi is onc bitten to the quick by those democratical writer that continu snarl at that estat it wanteth noth more than a strong monarch which nevertheless out of a certain tyrannophobia or fear of be strongli govern when thei have him thei abhorr as here have been doctor that hold there be three soul in a man so there be also that think there mai be more soul that is more soveraign than on in a commonwealth and set up a supremaci against the soveraignti canon against law and a ghostli author against the civil work on men mind with word and distinct that of themselv signifi noth but bewrai by their obscur that there walketh as some think invis anoth kingdom as it were a kingdom of fayri in the dark now see it is manifest that the civil power and the power of the commonwealth is the same thing and that supremaci and the power of make canon and grant faculti implyeth a commonwealth it followeth that where on is soveraign anoth suprem where on can make law and anoth make canon there must need be two commonwealth of on the same subject which is a kingdom divid in it self and cannot stand for notwithstand the insignific distinct of temporal and ghostli thei ar still two kingdom and everi subject is subject to two master for see the ghostli power challengeth the right to declar what is sinn it challengeth by consequ to declar what is law sinn be noth but the transgress of the law and again the civil power challeng to declar what is law everi subject must obei two master who both will have their command be observ as law which is imposs or if it be but on kingdom either the civil which is the power of the commonwealth must be subordin to the ghostli or the ghostli must be subordin to the temporal and then there is no supremaci but the temporal when therefor these two power oppos on anoth the commonwealth cannot but be in great danger of civil warr and dissolut for the civil author be more visibl and stand in the cleerer light of natural reason cannot choos but draw to it in all time a veri consider part of the peopl and the spiritual though it stand in the darkness of school distinct and hard word yet becaus the fear of darkness and ghost is greater than other fear cannot want a parti suffici to troubl and sometim to destroi a commonwealth and thi is a diseas which not unfitli mai be compar to the epilepsi or fallingsickness which the jew took to be on kind of possess by spirit in the bodi natural for as in thi diseas there is an unnatural spirit or wind in the head that obstructeth the root of the nerv and move them violent taketh awai the motion which natur thei should have from the power of the soul in the brain and therebi causeth violent and irregular motion which men call convuls in the part insomuch as he that is seiz therewith falleth down sometim into the water and sometim into the fire as a man depriv of hi sens so also in the bodi politiqu when the spiritual power moveth the member of a commonwealth by the terrour of punish and hope of reward which ar the nerv of it otherwis than by the civil power which is the soul of the commonwealth thei ought to be move and by strang and hard word suffoc the peopl and either overwhelm the commonwealth with oppress or cast it into the fire of a civil warr mixt govern sometim also in the meerli civil govern there be more than on soul as when the power of levi moni which is the nutrit faculti ha depend on a general assembl the power of conduct and command which is the motiv faculti on on man and the power of make law which is the rational faculti on the accidental consent not on of those two but also of a third thi endangereth the commonwealth somtim for want of consent to good law but most often for want of such nourish as is necessari to life and motion for although few perceiv that such govern is not govern but divis of the commonwealth into three faction and call it mixt monarchi yet the truth is that it is not on independ commonwealth but three independ faction nor on repres person but three in the kingdom of god there mai be three person independ without breach of uniti in god that reigneth but where men reign that be subject to divers of opinion it cannot be so and therefor if the king bear the person of the peopl and the general assembl bear also the person of the peopl and anoth assembl bear the person of a part of the peopl thei ar not on person nor on soveraign but three person and three soveraign to what diseas in the natural bodi of man i mai exactli compar thi irregular of a commonwealth i know not but i have seen a man that had anoth man grow out of hi side with an head arm breast and stomach of hi own if he had had anoth man grow out of hi other side the comparison might then have been exact want of moni hitherto i have name such diseas of a commonwealth as ar of the greatest and most present danger there be other not so great which nevertheless ar not unfit to be observ as first the difficulti of rais moni for the necessari us of the commonwealth especi in the approach of warr thi difficulti ariseth from the opinion that everi subject hath of a proprieti in hi land and good exclus of the soveraign right to the us of the same from whenc it commeth to pass that the soveraign power which foreseeth the necess and danger of the commonwealth find the passag of moni to the publiqu treasur obstruct by the tenac of the peopl

the law of natur and to render an account thereof to god the author of that law and to none but him but by safeti here is not meant a bare preserv but also all other content of life which everi man by lawful industri without danger or hurt to the commonwealth shall acquir to himself by instruct law and thi is intend should be done not by care appli to individual further than their protect from injuri when thei shall complain but by a general provid contain in publiqu instruct both of doctrin and exampl and in the make and execut of good law to which individual person mai appli their own case against the duti of a soveraign to relinquish ani essential right of soveraignti or not to see the peopl taught the ground of them and becaus if the essential right of soveraignti specifi befor in the eighteenth chapter be taken awai the commonwealth is therebi dissolv and everi man returneth into the condit and calam of a warr with everi other man which is the greatest evil that can happen in thi life it is the offic of the soveraign to maintain those right entir and consequ against hi duti first to transferr to anoth or to lai from himself ani of them for he that deserteth the mean deserteth the end and he deserteth the mean that be the soveraign acknowledgeth himself subject to the civil law and renounceth the power of suprem judicatur or of make warr or peac by hi own author or of judg of the necess of the commonwealth or of levi moni and souldier when and as much as in hi own conscienc he shall judg necessari or of make offic and minist both of warr and peac or of appoint teacher and examin what doctrin ar conform or contrari to the defenc peac and good of the peopl secondli it is against hi duti to let the peopl be ignor or misinform of the ground and reason of those hi essential right becaus therebi men ar easi to be seduc and drawn to resist him when the commonwealth shall requir their us and exercis and the ground of these right have the rather need to be dilig and truli taught becaus thei cannot be maintain by ani civil law or terrour of legal punish for a civil law that shall forbid rebellion and such is all resist to the essential right of soveraignti is not as a civil law ani oblig but by vertu on of the law of natur that forbiddeth the violat of faith which natural oblig if men know not thei cannot know the right of ani law the soveraign maketh and for the punish thei take it but for an act of hostil which when thei think thei have strength enough thei will endeavour by act of hostil to avoyd object of those that sai there ar no principl of reason for absolut soveraignti as i have heard some sai that justic is but a word without substanc and that whatsoev a man can by forc or art acquir to himself not on in the condit of warr but also in a commonwealth is hi own which i have alreadi shew to be fals so there be also that maintain that there ar no ground nor principl of reason to sustain those essential right which make soveraignti absolut for if there were thei would have been found out in some place or other wherea we see there ha not hitherto been ani commonwealth where those right have been acknowledg or challeng wherein thei argu as ill as if the savag peopl of america should deni there were ani ground or principl of reason so to build a hous as to last as long as the materi becaus thei never yet saw

reason yet i am sure thei ar principl from author of scriptur as i shall make it appear when i shall come to speak of the kingdom of god administr by mose over the jew hi peculiar peopl by coven object from the incapac of the vulgar but thei sai again that though the principl be right yet common peopl ar not of capac enough to be made to understand them i should be glad that the rich and potent subject of a kingdom or those that ar account the most learn were no less incap than thei but all men know that the obstruct to thi kind of doctrin proce not so much from the difficulti of the matter as from the interest of them that ar to learn potent men digest hardli ani thing that setteth up a power to bridl their affect and learn men ani thing that discovereth their errour and therebi lesseneth their author wherea the commonpeopl mind unless thei be taint with depend on the potent or scribbl over with the opinion of their doctor ar like clean paper fit to receiv whatsoev by publiqu

innumer place at on and the same time which is against reason and shall not men be abl by their teach and preach protect by the law to make that receiv which is so conson to reason that ani unprejud man need no more to learn it than to hear it i conclud therefor that in the instruct of the peopl in the essential right which ar the natural and fundamental law of soveraignti there is no difficulti whilest a soveraign ha hi power entir but what proce from hi own fault or the fault of those whom he trusteth in the administr of the commonwealth and consequ it is hi duti to caus them so to be instruct and not on hi duti but hi benefit also and secur against the danger that mai arriv to himself in hi natural person from rebellion subject ar to be taught not to affect chang of govern and to descend to particular the peopl ar to be taught first that thei ought not to be in love with ani form of govern thei see in their neighbour nation more than with their own nor whatsoev present prosper thei behold in nation that ar otherwis govern than thei to desir chang for the prosper of a peopl rule by an aristocratical or democratical assembl commeth not from aristocraci nor from democraci but from the obedi and concord of the subject nor do the peopl flourish in a monarchi becaus on man ha the right to rule them but becaus thei obei him take awai in ani kind of state the obedi and consequ the concord of the peopl and thei shall not on not flourish but in short time be dissolv and thei that go about by disobedi to doe no more than reform the commonwealth shall find thei do therebi destroi it like the foolish daughter of peleu in the fabl which desir to renew the youth of their decrepit father did by the counsel of medea cut him in piec and boyl him togeth with strang herb but made not of him a new man thi desir of chang is like the breach of the first of god command for there god sai non habebi deo alieno thou shalt not have the god of other nation and in anoth place concern king that thei ar god nor adher against the soveraign to popular men secondli thei ar to be taught that thei ought not to be led with admir of the vertu of ani of their fellow subject how high soever he stand nor how conspicu soever he shine in the commonwealth nor of ani assembl except the soveraign assembl so as to deferr to them ani obedi or honour appropri to the soveraign on whom in their particular station thei repres nor to receiv ani influenc from them but such as is conveigh by them from the soveraign author for that soveraign cannot be imagin to love hi peopl as he ought that is not jealou of them but suffer them by the flatteri of popular men to be seduc from their loyalti as thei have often been not on secretli but openli so as to proclaim marriag with them in faci ecclesia by preacher and by publish the same in the open street which mai fitli be compar to the violat of the second of the ten command nor to disput the soveraign power thirdli in consequ to thi thei ought to be inform how great fault it is to speak evil of the soveraign repres whether on man or an assembl of men or to argu and disput hi power or ani wai to us hi name irrever wherebi he mai be brought into contempt with hi peopl and their obedi in which the safeti of the commonwealth consisteth slacken which doctrin the third command by resembl pointeth to and to have day set apart to learn their duti fourthli see peopl cannot be taught thi nor when ti taught rememb it nor after on gener past so much as know in whom the soveraign power is place without set a part from their ordinari labour some certain time in which thei mai attend those that ar appoint to instruct them it is necessari that some such time be determin wherein thei mai assembl togeth and after prayer and prais given to god the soveraign of soveraign hear those their duti told them and the posit law such as gener concern them all read and expound and be put in mind of the author that maketh them law to thi end had the jew everi seventh dai a sabbath in which the law wa read and expound and in the solemn whereof thei were put in mind that their king wa god that have creat the world in six dai he rest the seventh dai and by their rest on it from their labour that that god wa their king which redeem them from their servil and painful labour in egypt and gave them a time after thei had rejoyc in god to take joi also in themselv by lawful recreat so that the first tabl of the command is spent all in set down the summ of god absolut power not on as god but as king by pact in peculiar of the jew and mai therefor give light to those that have the soveraign power confer on them by the consent of men to see what doctrin thei ought to teach their subject and to honour their parent and becaus the first instruct of children dependeth on the care of their parent it is necessari that thei should be obedi to them whilest thei ar under their tuition and not on so but that also afterward as gratitud requireth thei acknowledg the benefit of their educ by external sign of honour to which end thei ar to be taught that origin the father of everi man wa also hi soveraign lord with power over him of life and death and that the father of famili when by institut a commonwealth thei resign that absolut power yet it wa never intend thei should lose the honour due unto them for their educ for to relinquish such right wa not necessari to the institut of soveraign power nor would there be ani reason why ani man should desir to have children or take the care to nourish and instruct them if thei were afterward to have no other benefit from them than from other men and thi accordeth with the fifth command and to avoyd do of injuri again everi soveraign ought to caus justic to be taught which consist in take from no man what is hi is as much as to sai to caus men to be taught not to depriv their neighbour by violenc or fraud of ani thing which by the soveraign author is their of thing held in proprieti those that ar dearest to a man ar hi own life limb and in the next degre in most men those that concern conjugal affect and after them rich and mean of live therefor the peopl ar to be taught to abstain from violenc to on anoth person by privat reveng from violat of conjugal honour and from forcibl rapin and fraudul surrept of on anoth good for which purpos also it is necessari thei be shew the evil consequ of fals judgement by corrupt either of judg or wit wherebi the distinct of proprieti is taken awai and justic becom of no effect all which thing ar intim in the sixth seventh eighth and ninth command and to do all thi sincer from the heart lastli thei ar to be taught that not on the unjust fact but the design and intent to do them though by accid hindr ar injustic which consisteth in the praviti of the will as well as in the irregular of the act and thi is the intent of the tenth command and the summ of the second tabl which is reduc all to thi on command of mutual chariti thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self as the summ of the first tabl is reduc to the love of god whom thei had then newli receiv as their king the us of univers as for the mean and conduit by which the peopl mai receiv thi instruct wee ar to search by what mean so mai opinion contrari to the peac of mankind upon weak and fals principl have nevertheless been so deepli root in them i mean those which i have in the preced chapter specifi as that men shall judg of what is lawful and unlawful not by the law it self but by their own privat judgement that subject sinn in obei the command of the commonwealth unless thei themselv have first judg them to be lawful that their proprieti in their rich is such as to exclud the dominion which the commonwealth hath over the same that it is lawful for subject to kill such as thei call tyrant that the soveraign power mai be divid and the like which come to be instil into the peopl by thi mean thei whom necess or covetousness keepeth attent on their trade and labour and thei on the other side whom superflu or sloth carrieth after their sensual pleasur which two sort of men take up the greatest part of mankind be divert from the deep medit which the learn of truth not on in the matter of natural justic but also of all other scienc necessarili requireth receiv the notion of their duti chiefli from divin in the pulpit and partli from such of their neighbour or familiar acquaint as have the faculti of discours readili and plausibl seem wiser and better learn in case of law and conscienc than themselv and the divin and such other as make shew of learn deriv their knowledg from the univers and from the school of law or from the book which by men emin in those school and univers have been publish it is therefor manifest that the instruct of the peopl dependeth wholli on the right teach of youth in the univers but ar not mai some men sai the univers of england learn enough alreadi to do that or is it you will undertak to teach the univers hard question yet to the first i doubt not to answer that till toward the later end of henri the eighth the power of the pope wa alway upheld against the power of the commonwealth princip by the univers and that the doctrin maintain by so mani preacher against the soveraign power of the king and by so mani lawyer and other that had their educ there is a suffici argument that though the univers were not author of those fals doctrin yet thei knew not how to plant the true for in such a contradict of opinion it is most certain that thei have not been suffici instruct and ti no wonder if thei yet retain a relish of that subtil liquor wherewith thei were first season against the civil author but to the later question it is not fit nor needful for me to sai either i or no for ani man that see what i am do mai easili perceiv what i think the safeti of the peopl requireth further from him or them that have the soveraign power that justic be equal administr to all degre of peopl that is that as well the rich and mighti as poor and obscur person mai be right of the injuri done them so as the great mai have no greater hope of impun when thei doe violenc dishonour or ani injuri to the meaner sort than when on of these doe the like to on of them for in thi consisteth equiti to which as be a precept of the law of natur a soveraign is as much subject as ani of the meanest of hi peopl all breach of the law ar offenc against the commonwealth but there be some that ar also against privat person those that concern the commonwealth on mai without breach of equiti be pardon for everi man mai pardon what is done against himself accord to hi own discret but an offenc against a privat man cannot in equiti be pardon without the consent of him that is injur or reason satisfact the inequ of subject proceedeth from the act of soveraign power and therefor ha no more place in the presenc of the soveraign that is to sai in a court of justic then the inequ between king and their subject in the presenc of the king of king the honour of great person is to be valu for their benefic and the ayd thei give to men of inferiour rank or not at all and the violenc oppress and injuri thei do ar not extenu but aggrav by the greatness of their person becaus thei have least need to commit them the consequ of thi partial toward the great proce in thi manner impun maketh insol insol hatr and hatr an endeavour to pull down all oppress and contumeli greatness though with the ruin of the commonwealth equal tax to equal justic appertaineth also the equal imposit of tax the equal whereof dependeth not on the equal of rich but on the equal of the debt that everi man oweth to the commonwealth for hi defenc it is not enough for a man to labour for the mainten of hi life but also to fight if need be for the secur of hi labour thei must either do as the jew did after their return from captiv in reedifi the templ build with on hand and hold the sword in the other or els thei must hire other to fight for them for the imposit that ar layd on the peopl by the soveraign power ar noth els but the wage due to them that hold the publiqu sword to defend privat men in the exercis of several trade and call see then the benefit that everi on receiveth therebi is the enjoy of life which is equal dear to poor and rich the debt which a poor man oweth them that defend hi life is the same which a rich man oweth for the defenc of hi save that the rich who have the servic of the poor mai be debtor not on for their own person but for mani more which consid the equal of imposit consisteth rather in the equal of that which is consum than of the rich of the person that consum the same for what reason is there that he which laboureth much and spare the fruit of hi labour consumeth littl should be more charg then he that live idl getteth littl and spendeth all he get see the on hath no more protect from the commonwealth then the other but when the imposit ar layd upon those thing which men consum everi man payeth equal for what he useth nor is the commonwealth defraud by the luxuri wast of privat men publiqu chariti and wherea mani men by accid unevit becom unabl to maintain themselv by their labour thei ought not to be left to the chariti of privat person but to be provid for as farforth as the necess of natur requir by the law of the commonwealth for as it is uncharitableness in ani man to neglect the impot so it is in the soveraign of a commonwealth to expos them to the hazard of such uncertain chariti prevent of idleness but for such as have strong bodi the case is otherwis thei ar to be forc to work and to avoyd the excus of not find employ there ought to be such law as mai encourag all manner of art as navig agricultur fish and all manner of manifactur that requir labour the multitud of poor and yet strong peopl still encreas thei ar to be transplant into countri not suffici inhabit where nevertheless thei ar not to extermin those thei find there but constrain them to inhabit closer togeth and not rang a great deal of ground to snatch what thei find but to court each littl plot with art and labour to give them their susten in due season and when all the world is overchargd with inhabit then the last remedi of all is warr which provideth for everi man by victori or death good law what to the care of the soveraign belongeth the make of good law but what is a good law by a good law i mean not a just law for no law can be unjust the law is made by the soveraign power and all that is done by such power is warrant and own by everi on of the peopl and that which everi man will have so no man can sai is unjust it is in the law of a commonwealth as in the law of game whatsoev the gamest all agre on is injustic to none of them a good law is that which is needful for the good of the peopl and withal perspicu such as ar necessari for the us of law which ar but rule authoris is not to bind the peopl from all voluntari action but to direct and keep them in such a motion as not to hurt themselv by their own impetu desir rashness or indiscret as hedg ar set not to stop travel but to keep them in the wai and therefor a law that is not needful have not the true end of a law is not good a law mai be conceiv to be good when it is for the benefit of the soveraign though it be not necessari for the peopl but it is not so for the good of the soveraign and peopl cannot be separ it is a weak soveraign that ha weak subject and a weak peopl whose soveraign wanteth power to rule them at hi will unnecessari law ar not good law but trapp for moni which where the right of soveraign power is acknowledg ar superflu and where it is not acknowledg unsuffici to defend the peopl such as ar perspicu the perspicu consisteth not so much in the word of the law it self as in a declar of the caus and motiv for which it wa made that is it that shew us the mean of the legisl and the mean of the legisl known the law is more easili understood by few than mani word for all word ar subject to ambigu and therefor multipl of word in the bodi of the law is multipl of ambigu besid it seem to impli by too much dilig that whosoev can evad the word is without the compass of the law and thi is a caus of mani unnecessari process for when i consid how short were the law of antient time and how thei grew by degre still longer me think i see a content between the penner and pleader of the law the former seek to circumscrib the later and the later to evad their circumscript and that the pleader have got the victori it belongeth therefor to the offic of a legisl such as is in all commonwealth the suprem repres be it on man or an assembl to make the reason perspicu why the law wa made and the bodi of the law it self as short but in as proper and signific term as mai be punish it belongeth also to the offic of the soveraign to make a right applic of punish and reward and see the end of punish is not reveng and discharg of choler but correct either of the offend or of other by hi exampl the severest punish ar to be inflict for those crime that ar of most danger to the publiqu such as ar those which proce from malic to the govern establish those that spring from contempt of justic those that provok indign in the multitud and those which unpunish seem authoris as when thei ar commit by sonn servant or favorit of men in author for indign carrieth men not on against the actor and author of injustic but against all power that is like to protect them as in the case of tarquin when for the insol act of on of hi sonn he wa driven out of rome and the monarchi it self dissolv but crime of infirm such as ar those which proce from great provoc from great fear great need or from ignor whether the fact be a great crime or not there is place mani time for leniti without prejudic to the commonwealth and leniti when there is such place for it is requir by the law of natur the punish of the leader and teacher in a commot not the poor seduc peopl when thei ar punish can profit the commonwealth by their exampl to be sever to the peopl is to punish that ignor which mai in great part be imput to the soveraign whose fault it wa thei were no better instruct reward in like manner it belongeth to the offic and duti of the soveraign to appli hi reward alway so as there mai aris from them benefit to the commonwealth wherein consisteth their us and end and is then done when thei that have well serv the commonwealth ar with as littl expenc of the common treasur as is possibl so well recompenc as other therebi mai be encourag both to serv the same as faithfulli as thei can and to studi the art by which thei mai be enabl to do it better to bui with moni or prefer from a popular ambiti subject to be quiet and desist from make ill impress in the mind of the peopl ha noth of the natur of reward which is ordain not for disservic but for servic past nor a sign of gratitud but of fear nor doe it tend to the benefit but to the dammag of the publiqu it is a content with ambit like that of hercul with the monster hydra which have mani head for everi on that wa vanquish there grew up three for in like manner when the stubbornness of on popular man is overcom with reward there aris mani more by the exampl that do the same mischief in hope of like benefit and as all sort of manifactur so also malic encreaseth by be vendibl and though sometim a civil warr mai be differ by such way as that yet the danger grow still the greater and the publiqu ruin more assur it is therefor against the duti of the soveraign to whom the publiqu safeti is commit to reward those that aspir to greatness by disturb the peac of their countri and not rather to oppos the begin of such men with a littl danger than after a longer time with greater counsellour anoth business of the soveraign is to choos good counsellour i mean such whose advic he is to take in the govern of the commonwealth for thi word counsel consilium corrupt from considium is a larg signif and comprehendeth all assembl of men that sit togeth not on to deliber what is to be done hereaft but also to judg of fact past and of law for the present i take it here in the first sens on and in thi sens there is no choyc of counsel neither in a democraci nor aristocraci becaus the person counsel ar member of the person counsel the choyc of counsellour therefor is to monarchi in which the soveraign that endeavoureth not to make choyc of those that in everi kind ar the most abl dischargeth not hi offic as he ought to do the most abl counsellour ar thei that have least hope of benefit by give evil counsel and most knowledg of those thing that conduc to the peac and defenc of the commonwealth it is a hard matter to know who expecteth benefit from publiqu troubl but the sign that guid to a just suspicion is the sooth of the peopl in their unreason or irremedi grievanc by men whose estat ar not suffici to discharg their accustom expenc and mai easili be observ by ani on whom it concern to know it but to know who ha most knowledg of the publiqu affair is yet harder and thei that know them need them a great deal the less for to know who know the rule almost of ani art is a great degre of the knowledg of the same art becaus no man can be assur of the truth of anoth rule but he that is first taught to understand them but the best sign of knowledg of ani art ar much convers in it and constant good effect of it good counsel come not by lot nor by inherit and therefor there is no more reason to expect good advic from the rich or nobl in matter of state than in delin the dimens of a fortress unless we shall think there need no method in the studi of the politiqu as there doe in the studi of geometri but on to be looker on which is not so for the politiqu is the harder studi of the two wherea in these part of europ it hath been taken for a right of certain person to have place in the highest councel of state by inherit it is deriv from the conquest of the antient german wherein mani absolut lord joyn togeth to conquer other nation would not enter in to the confederaci without such priviledg as might be mark of differ in time follow between their poster and the poster of their subject which priviledg be inconsist with the soveraign power by the favour of the soveraign thei mai seem to keep but contend for them as their right thei must need by degre let them go and have at last no further honour than adhaereth natur to their abil and how abl soever be the counsellour in ani affair the benefit of their counsel is greater when thei give everi on hi advic and reason of it apart than when thei do it in an assembl by wai of orat and when thei have praemedit than when thei speak on the sudden both becaus thei have more time to survei the consequ of action and ar less subject to be carri awai to contradict through envi emul or other passion aris from the differ of opinion the best counsel in those thing that concern not other nation but on the eas and benefit the subject mai enjoi by law that look on inward is to be taken from the general inform and complaint of the peopl of each provinc who ar best acquaint with their own want and ought therefor when thei demand noth in derog of the essential right of soveraignti to be dilig taken notic of for without those essential right as i have often befor said the commonwealth cannot at all subsist command a command of an armi in chief if he be not popular shall not be belov nor fear as he ought to be by hi armi and consequ cannot perform that offic with good success he must therefor be industri valiant affabl liberal and fortun that he mai gain an opinion both of suffici and of love hi souldier thi is popular and breed in the souldier both desir and courag to recommend themselv to hi favour and protect the sever of the general in punish when need is the mutin or neglig souldier but thi love of souldier if caution be not given of the command fidel is a danger thing to soveraign power especi when it is in the hand of an assembl not popular it belongeth therefor to the safeti of the peopl both that thei be good conductor and faithful subject to whom the soveraign commit hi armi but when the soveraign himself is popular that is reverenc and belov of hi peopl there is no danger at all from the popular of a subject for souldier ar never so gener unjust as to side with their captain though thei love him against their soveraign when thei love not on hi person but also hi caus and therefor those who by violenc have at ani time suppress the power of their lawful soveraign befor thei could settl themselv in hi place have been alway put to the troubl of contriv their titl to save the peopl from the shame of receiv them to have a known right to soveraign power is so popular a qualiti as he that ha it need no more for hi own part to turn the heart of hi subject to him but that thei see him abl absolut to govern hi own famili nor on the part of hi enemi but a disband of their armi for the greatest and most activ part of mankind ha never hetherto been well content with the present concern the offic of on soveraign to anoth which ar comprehend in that law which is commonli call the law of nation i need not sai ani thing in thi place becaus the law of nation and the law of natur is the same thing and everi soveraign hath the same right in procur the safeti of hi peopl that ani particular man can have in procur the safeti of hi own bodi and the same law that dictateth to men that have no civil govern what thei ought to do and what to avoyd in regard of on anoth dictateth the same to commonwealth that is to the conscienc of soveraign princ and soveraign assembl there be no court of natural justic but in the conscienc on where not man but god raigneth whose law such of them as oblig all mankind in respect of god as he is the author of natur ar natural and in respect of the same god as he is king of king ar law but of the kingdom of god as king of king and as king also of a peculiar peopl i shall speak in the rest of thi discours chapter xxxi of the kingdom of god by natur the scope of the follow chapter that the condit of meer natur that is to sai of absolut liberti such as is their that neither ar soveraign nor subject is anarchi and the condit of warr that the praecept by which men ar guid to avoyd that condit ar the law of natur that a commonwealth without soveraign power is but a word without substanc and cannot stand that subject ow to soveraign simpl obedi in all thing wherein their obedi is not repugn to the law of god i have suffici prove in that which i have alreadi written there want on for the entir knowledg of civil duti to know what ar those law of god for without that a man know not when he is command ani thing by the civil power whether it be contrari to the law of god or not and so either by too much civil obedi offend the divin majesti or through fear of offend god transgress the command of the commonwealth to avoyd both these rock it is necessari to know what ar the law divin and see the knowledg of all law dependeth on the knowledg of the soveraign power i shall sai someth in that which followeth of the kingdom of god who ar subject in the kingdom of god god is king let the earth rejoic saith the psalmist psal and again god is king though the nation be angri and he that sitteth on the cherubin though the earth be move psal whether men will or not thei must be subject alway to the divin power by deni the exist or provid of god men mai shake off their eas but not their yoke but to call thi power of god which extendeth it self not on to man but also to beast and plant and bodi inanim by the name of kingdom is but a metaphorical us of the word for he on is properli said to raign that govern hi subject by hi word and by promis of reward to those that obei it and by threatn them with punish that obei it not subject therefor in the kingdom of god ar not bodi inanim nor creatur irrational becaus thei understand no precept as hi nor atheist nor thei that believ not that god ha ani care of the action of mankind becaus thei acknowledg no word for hi nor have hope of hi reward or fear of hi threatn thei therefor that believ there is a god that governeth the world and hath given praecept and propound reward and punish to mankind ar god subject all the rest ar to be understood as enemi a threefold word of god reason revel propheci to rule by word requir that such word be manifestli made known for els thei ar no law for to the natur of law belongeth a suffici and clear promulg such as mai take awai the excus of ignor which in the law of men is but of on on kind and that is proclam or promulg by the voyc of man but god declareth hi law three way by the dictat of natural reason by revel and by the voyc of some man to whom by the oper of miracl he procureth credit with the rest from henc there ariseth a tripl word of god ration sensibl and prophetiqu to which correspondeth a tripl hear right reason sens supernatural and faith as for sens supernatural which consisteth in revel or inspir there have not been ani universal law so given becaus god speaketh not in that manner but to particular person and to diver men diver thing a twofold kingdom of god natural and prophetiqu from the differ between the other two kind of god word rational and prophetiqu there mai be attribut to god a twofold kingdom natural and prophetiqu natural wherein he governeth as mani of mankind as acknowledg hi provid by the natural dictat of right reason and prophetiqu wherein have chosen out on peculiar nation the jew for hi subject he govern them and none but them not on by natural reason but by posit law which he gave them by the mouth of hi holi prophet of the natural kingdom of god i intend to speak in thi chapter the right of god soveraignti is deriv from hi omnipot the right of natur wherebi god reigneth over men and punisheth those that break hi law is to be deriv not from hi creat them as if he requir obedi as of gratitud for hi benefit but from hi irresist power i have formerli shewn how the soveraign right ariseth from pact to shew how the same right mai aris from natur requir no more but to shew in what case it is never taken awai see all men by natur had right to all thing thei had right everi on to reign over all the rest but becaus thi right could not be obtain by forc it concern the safeti of everi on lai by that right to set up men with soveraign author by common consent to rule and defend them wherea if there had been ani man of power irresist there had been no reason why he should not by that power have rule and defend both himself and them accord to hi own discret to those therefor whose power is irresist the dominion of all men adhaereth natur by their excel of power and consequ it is from that power that the kingdom over men and the right of afflict men at hi pleasur belongeth natur to god almighti not as creator and graciou but as omnipot and though punish be due for sinn on becaus by that word is understood afflict for sinn yet the right of afflict is not alway deriv from men sinn but from god power sinn not the caus of all afflict thi question why evil men often prosper and good men suffer advers ha been much disput by the antient and is the same with thi of our by what right god dispenseth the prosper and advers of thi life and is of that difficulti as it hath shaken the faith not on of the vulgar but of philosoph and which is more of the saint concern the divin provid how good saith david is the god of israel to those that ar upright in heart and yet my feet were almost gone my tread had wellnigh slipt for i wa griev at the wick when i saw the ungodli in such prosper and job how earnestli doe he expostul with god for the mani afflict he suffer notwithstand hi righteousness thi question in the case of job is decid by god himself not by argument deriv from job sinn but hi own power for wherea the friend of job drew their argument from hi afflict to hi sinn and he defend himself by the conscienc of hi innoc god himself taketh up the matter and have justifi the afflict by argument drawn from hi power such as thi where wa thou when i layd the foundat of the earth and the like both approv job innoc and reprov the erron doctrin of hi friend conform to thi doctrin is the sentenc of our saviour concern the man that wa born blind in these word neither hath thi man sin nor hi father but that the work of god might be made manifest in him and though it be said that death entr into the world by sinn by which is meant that if adam had never sin he had never dy that is never suffer ani separ of hi soul from hi bodi it follow not thenc that god could not justli have afflict him though he had not sin as well as he afflicteth other live creatur that cannot sinn divin law have spoken of the right of god soveraignti as ground on on natur we ar to consid next what ar the divin law or dictat of natural reason which law concern either the natural duti of on man to anoth or the honour natur due to our divin soveraign the first ar the same law of natur of which i have spoken alreadi in the and chapter of thi treatis name equiti justic merci humil and the rest of the moral vertu it remaineth therefor that we consid what praecept ar dictat to men by their natural reason on without other word of god touch the honour and worship of the divin majesti honour and worship what honour consisteth in the inward thought and opinion of the power and goodness of anoth and therefor to honour god is to think as highli of hi power and goodness as is possibl and of that opinion the external sign appear in the word and action of men ar call worship which is on part of that which the latin understand by the word cultu for cultu signifieth properli and constantli that labour which a man bestow on ani thing with a purpos to make benefit by it now those thing whereof we make benefit ar either subject to us and the profit thei yeeld followeth the labour we bestow upon them as a natural effect or thei ar not subject to us but answer our labour accord to their own will in the first sens the labour bestow on the earth is call cultur and the educ of children a cultur of their mind in the second sens where men will ar to be wrought to our purpos not by forc but by compleas it signifieth as much as court that is a win of favour by good offic as by prais by acknowledg their power and by whatsoev is pleas to them from whom we look for ani benefit and thi is properli worship in which sens publicola is understood for a worshipp of the peopl and cultu dei for the worship of god several sign of honour from internal honour consist in the opinion of power and goodness aris three passion love which hath refer to goodness and hope and fear that relat to power and three part of external worship prais magnifi and bless the subject of prais be goodness the subject of magnifi and bless be power and the effect thereof felic prais and magnifi ar signific both by word and action by word when we sai a man is good or great by action when we thank him for hi bounti and obei hi power the opinion of the happiness of anoth can on be express by word worship natural and arbitrari there be some sign of honour both in attribut and action that be natur so as amongst attribut good just liberal and the like and amongst action prayer thank and obedi other ar so by institut or custom of men and in some time and place ar honour in other dishonour in other indiffer such as ar the gestur in salut prayer and thanksgiv in differ time and place differ us the former is natural the later arbitrari worship worship command and free and of arbitrari worship there bee two differ for sometim it is a command sometim voluntari worship command when it is such as hee requireth who is worship free when it is such as the worshipp think fit when it is command not the word or gestur but the obedi is the worship but when free the worship consist in the opinion of the behold for if to them the word or action by which we intend honour seem ridicul and tend to contum thei ar not worship becaus a sign is not a sign to him that giveth it but to him to whom it is made that is to the spectat worship publiqu and privat again there is a publiqu and a privat worship publiqu is the worship that a commonwealth performeth as on person privat is that which a privat person exhibiteth publiqu in respect of the whole commonwealth is free but in respect of particular men it is not so privat is in secret free but in the sight of the multitud it is never without some restraint either from the law or from the opinion of men which is contrari to the natur of liberti the end of worship the end of worship amongst men is power for where a man seeth anoth worship he supposeth him powerful and is the readier to obei him which make hi power greater but god ha no end the worship we do him proce from our duti and is direct accord to our capac by those rule of honour that reason dictateth to be done by the weak to the more potent men in hope of benefit for fear of dammag or in thankfulness for good alreadi receiv from them attribut of divin honour that we mai know what worship of god is taught us by the light of natur i will begin with hi attribut where first it is manifest we ought to attribut to him exist for no man can have the will to honour that which he think not to have ani bee secondli that those philosoph who sayd the world or the soul of the world wa god spake unworthili of him and deni hi exist for by god is understood the caus of the world and to sai the world is god is to sai there is no caus of it that is no god thirdli to sai the world wa not creat but eternal see that which is eternal ha no caus is to deni there is a god fourthli that thei who attribut as thei think eas to god take from him the care of mankind take from him hi honour for it take awai men love and fear of him which is the root of honour fifthli in those thing that signifi greatness and power to sai he is finit is not to honour him for it is not a sign of the will to honour god to attribut to him less than we can and finit is less than we can becaus to finit it is easi to add more therefor to attribut figur to him is not honour for all figur is finit nor to sai we conceiv and imagin or have an idea of him in our mind for whatsoev we conceiv is finit not to attribut to him part or total which ar the attribut on of thing finit nor to sai he is thi or that place for whatsoev is in place is bound and finit nor that he is move or resteth for both these attribut ascrib to him place nor that there be more god than on becaus it impli them all finit for there cannot be more than on infinit nor to ascrib to him unless metaphor mean not the passion but the effect passion that partak of grief as repent anger merci or of want as appetit hope desir or of ani passiv faculti for passion is power limit by somewhat els and therefor when we ascrib to god a will it is not to be understood as that of man for a rational appetit but as the power by which he effecteth everi thing likewis when we attribut to him sight and other act of sens as also knowledg and understand which in us is noth els but a tumult of the mind rais by external thing that press the organical part of man bodi for there is no such thing in god and be thing that depend on natural caus cannot be attribut to him hee that will attribut to god noth but what is warrant by natural reason must either us such neg attribut as infinit eternal incomprehens or superl as most high most great and the like or indefinit as good just holi creator and in such sens as if he meant not to declar what he is for that were to circumscrib him within the limit of our fanci but how much wee admir him and how readi we would be to obei him which is a sign of humil and of a will to honour him as much as we can for there is but on name to signifi our concept of hi natur and that is i am and but on name of hi relat to us and that is god in which is contain father king and lord action that ar sign of divin honour concern the action of divin worship it is a most general precept of reason that thei be sign of the intent to honour god such as ar first prayer for not the carver when thei made imag were thought to make them god but the peopl that prai to them secondli thanksgiv which differeth from prayer in divin worship no otherwis than that prayer preced and thank succe the benefit the end both of the on and the other be to acknowledg god for author of all benefit as well past as futur thirdli gift that is to sai sacrific and oblat if thei be of the best ar sign of honour for thei ar thanksgiv fourthli not to swear by ani but god is natur a sign of honour for it is a confess that god on knoweth the heart and that no man wit or strength can protect a man against god vengenc on the perjur fifthli it is a part of rational worship to speak consider of god for it argu a fear of him and fear is a confess of hi power henc followeth that the name of god is not to be us rashli and to no purpos for that is as much as in vain and it is to no purpos unless it be by wai of oath and by order of the commonwealth to make judgement certain or between commonwealth to avoyd warr and that disput of god natur is contrari to hi honour for it is suppos that in thi natural kingdom of god there is no other wai to know ani thing but by natural reason that is from the principl of natural scienc which ar so farr from teach us ani thing of god natur as thei cannot teach us our own natur nor the natur of the smallest creatur live and therefor when men out of the principl of natural reason disput of the attribut of god thei but dishonour him for in the attribut which we give to god we ar not to consid the signif of philosophical truth but the signif of piou intent to do him the greatest honour we ar abl from the want of which consider have proceed the volum of disput about the natur of god that tend not to hi honour but to the honour of our own wit and learn and ar noth els but inconsider and vain abus of hi sacr name sixthli in prayer thanksgiv offer and sacrific it is a dictat of natural reason that thei be everi on in hi kind the best and most signific of honour as for exampl that prayer and thanksgiv be made in word and phrase not sudden nor light nor plebeian but beautiful and well compos for els we do not god as much honour as we can and therefor the heathen did absurdli to worship imag for god but their do it in vers and with musick both of voyc and instrument wa reason also that the beast thei offer in sacrific and the gift thei offer and their action in worship were full of submiss and commemor of benefit receiv wa accord to reason as proceed from an intent to honour him seventhli reason directeth not on to worship god in secret but also and especi in publiqu and in the sight of men for without that that which in honour is most accept the procur other to honour him is lost lastli obedi to hi law that is in thi case to the law of natur is the greatest worship of all for as obedi is more accept to god than sacrific so also to set light by hi command is the greatest of all contum and these ar the law of that divin worship which natural reason dictateth to privat men publiqu worship consisteth in uniform but see a commonwealth is but on person it ought also to exhibit to god but on worship which then it doth when it commandeth it to be exhibit by privat men publiqu and thi is publiqu worship the properti whereof is to be uniform for those action that ar done differ by differ men cannot be said to be a publiqu worship and therefor where mani sort of worship be allow proceed from the differ religion of privat men it cannot be said there is ani publiqu worship nor that the commonwealth is of ani religion at all all attribut depend on the law civil and becaus word and consequ the attribut of god have their signif by agreement and constitut of men those attribut ar to be held signif of honour that men intend shall so be and whatsoev mai be done by the will of particular men where there is no law but reason mai be done by the will of the commonwealth by law civil and becaus a commonwealth hath no will nor make no law but those that ar made by the will of him or them that have the soveraign power it followeth that those attribut which the soveraign ordaineth in the worship of god for sign of honour ought to be taken and us for such by privat men in their publiqu worship not all action but becaus not all action ar sign by constitut but some ar natur sign of honour other of contum these later which ar those that men ar asham to do in the sight of them thei rever cannot be made by human power a part of divin worship nor the former such as ar decent modest humbl behaviour ever be separ from it but wherea there be an infinit number of action and gestur of an indiffer natur such of them as the commonwealth shall ordain to be publiqu and univers in us as sign of honour and part of god worship ar to be taken and us for such by the subject and that which is said in the scriptur it is better to obei god than men hath place in the kingdom of god by pact and not by natur natural punish have thu briefli spoken of the natural kingdom of god and hi natural law i will add on to thi chapter a short declar of hi natural punish there is no action of man in thi life that is not the begin of so long a chayn of consequ as no human provid is high enough to give a man a prospect to the end and in thi chayn there ar link togeth both pleas and unpleas event in such manner as he that will do ani thing for hi pleasur must engag himself to suffer all the pain annex to it and these pain ar the natural punish of those action which ar the begin of more harm that good and herebi it come to pass that intemper is natur punish with diseas rashness with mischanc injustic with the violenc of enemi pride with ruin cowardis with oppress neglig govern of princ with rebellion and rebellion with slaughter for see punish ar consequ to the breach of law natural punish must be natur consequ to the breach of the law of natur and therfor follow them as their natural not arbitrari effect the conclus of the second part and thu farr concern the constitut natur and right of soveraign and concern the duti of subject deriv from the principl of natural reason and now consid how differ thi doctrin is from the practis of the greatest part of the world especi of these western part that have receiv their moral learn from rome and athen and how much depth of moral philosophi is requir in them that have the administr of the soveraign power i am at the point of believ thi my labour as useless and the commonwealth of plato for he also is of opinion that it is imposs for the disord of state and chang of govern by civil warr ever to be taken awai till soveraign be philosoph but when i consid again that the scienc of natural justic is the on scienc necessari for soveraign and their principal minist and that thei need not be charg with the scienc mathematical as by plato thei ar further than by good law to encourag men to the studi of them and that neither plato nor ani other philosoph hitherto hath put into order and suffici or probabl prove all the theorem of moral doctrin that men mai learn therebi both how to govern and how to obei i recov some hope that on time or other thi write of mine mai fall into the hand of a soveraign who will consid it himself for it is short and i think clear without the help of ani interest or enviou interpret and by the exercis of entir soveraignti in protect the publiqu teach of it convert thi truth of specul into the util of practic part iii of a christian commonwealth chapter xxxii of the principl of christian politiqu the word of god deliv by prophet is the main principl of christian politiqu i have deriv the right of soveraign power and the duti of subject hitherto from the principl of natur on such as experi ha found true or consent concern the us of word ha made so that is to sai from the natur of men known to us by experi and from definit of such word as ar essential to all political reason univers agre on but in that i am next to handl which is the natur and right of a christian commonwealth whereof there dependeth much upon supernatural revel of the will of god the ground of my discours must be not onli the natural word of god but also the prophetical nevertheless we ar not to renounc our sens and experi nor that which is the undoubt word of god our natural reason for thei ar the talent which he hath put into our hand to negoti till the come again of our bless saviour and therefor not to be fold up in the napkin of an implic faith but emploi in the purchas of justic peac and true religion for though there be mani thing in god word abov reason that is to sai which cannot by natural reason be either demonstr or confut yet there is noth contrari to it but when it seemeth so the fault is either in our unskilful interpret or erron ratiocin therefor when ani thing therein written is too hard for our examin wee ar bidden to captiv our understand to the word and not to labour in sift out a philosophical truth by logick of such mysteri as ar not comprehens nor fall under ani rule of natural scienc for it is with the mysteri of our religion as with wholsom pill for the sick which swallow whole have the vertu to cure but chew ar for the most part cast up again without effect what it is to captiv the understand but by the captiv of our understand is not meant a submiss of the intellectu faculti to the opinion of ani other man but of the will to obedi where obedi is due for sens memori understand reason and opinion ar not in our power to chang but alwai and necessarili such as the thing we see hear and consid suggest unto us and therefor ar not effect of our will but our will of them we then captiv our understand and reason when we forbear contradict when we so speak as by lawful author we ar command and when we live accordingli which in sum is trust and faith repos in him that speaketh though the mind be incap of ani notion at all from the word spoken how god speaketh to men when god speaketh to man it must be either immedi or by mediat of anoth man to whom he had formerli spoken by himself immedi how god speaketh to a man immedi mai be understood by those well enough to whom he hath so spoken but how the same should be understood by anoth is hard if not imposs to know for if a man pretend to me that god hath spoken to him supernatur and immedi and i make doubt of it i cannot easili perceiv what argument he can produc to oblig me to beleev it it is true that if he be my soveraign he mai oblig me to obedi so as not by act or word to declar i beleev him not but not to think ani otherwis then my reason perswad me but if on that hath not such author over me shall pretend the same there is noth that exacteth either beleef or obedi for to sai that god hath spoken to him in the holi scriptur is not to sai god hath spoken to him immedi but by mediat of the prophet or of the apostl or of the church in such manner as he speak to all other christian men to sai he hath spoken to him in a dream is no more than to sai he dream that god spake to him which is not of forc to win beleef from ani man that know dream ar for the most part natural and mai proce from former thought and such dream as that from self conceit and foolish arrog and fals opinion of a man own godliness or other vertu by which he think he hath merit the favour of extraordinari revel to sai he hath seen a vision or heard a voic is to sai that he hath dream between sleep and wake for in such manner a man doth mani time natur take hi dream for a vision as not have well observ hi own slumber to sai he speak by supernatural inspir is to sai he find an ardent desir to speak or some strong opinion of himself for which he can alledg no natural and suffici reason so that though god almighti can speak to a man by dream vision voic and inspir yet he oblig no man to beleev he hath so done to him that pretend it who be a man mai err and which is more mai lie by what mark prophet ar known how then can he to whom god hath never reveal hi wil immedi save by the wai of natur reason know when he is to obei or not to obei hi word deliv by him that say he is a prophet king of prophet of whom the k of israel ask counsel concern the warr he made against ramoth gilead onli micaiah wa a true on king the prophet that wa sent to propheci against the altar set up by jeroboam though a true prophet and that by two miracl done in hi presenc appear to be a prophet sent from god wa yet deceiv by anoth old prophet that perswad him as from the mouth of god to eat and drink with him if on prophet deceiv anoth what certainti is there of know the will of god by other wai than that of reason to which i answer out of the holi scriptur that there be two mark by which togeth not asund a true prophet is to be known on is the do of miracl the other is the not teach ani other religion than that which is alreadi establish asund i sai neither of these is suffici deut v if a prophet rise amongst you or a dreamer of dream and shall pretend the do of a miracl and the miracl come to pass if he sai let us follow strang god which thou hast not known thou shalt not hearken to him c but that prophet and dreamer of dream shall be put to death becaus he hath spoken to you to revolt from the lord your god in which word two thing ar to be observ first that god wil not have miracl alon serv for argument to approv the prophet call but as it is in the third vers for an experi of the constanc of our adher to himself for the work of the egyptian sorcer though not so great as those of mose yet were great miracl secondli that how great soever the miracl be yet if it tend to stir up revolt against the king or him that governeth by the king author he that doth such miracl is not to be consid otherwis than as sent to make triall of their allegi for these word revolt from the lord your god ar in thi place equival to revolt from your king for thei had made god their king by pact at the foot of mount sinai who rule them by mose onli for he onli spake with god and from time to time declar god command to the peopl in like manner after our saviour christ had made hi discipl acknowledg him for the messiah that is to sai for god anoint whom the nation of the jew daili expect for their king but refus when he came he omit not to advertis them of the danger of miracl there shall aris saith he fals christ and fals prophet and shall doe great wonder and miracl even to the seduc if it were possibl of the veri elect mat by which it appear that fals prophet mai have the power of miracl yet ar wee not to take their doctrin for god word st paul sai further to the galatian that if himself or an angel from heaven preach anoth gospel to them than he had preach let him be accurs gal that gospel wa that christ wa king so that all preach against the power of the king receiv in consequ to these word is by st paul accurs for hi speech is address to those who by hi preach had alreadi receiv jesu for the christ that is to sai for king of the jew the mark of a prophet in the old law miracl and doctrin conform to the law and as miracl without preach that doctrin which god hath establish so preach the true doctrin without the do of miracl is an unsuffici argument of immedi revel for if a man that teacheth not fals doctrin should pretend to bee a prophet without shew ani miracl he is never the more to bee regard for hi pretenc as is evid by deut v if thou sai in thy heart how shall we know that the word of the prophet is not that which the lord hath spoken when the prophet shall have spoken in the name of the lord that which shall not come to pass that the word which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet ha spoken it out of the pride of hi own heart fear him not but a man mai here again ask when the prophet hath foretold a thing how shal we know whether it will come to pass or not for he mai foretel it as a thing to arriv after a certain long time longer then the time of man life or indefinit that it will come to pass on time or other in which case thi mark of a prophet is unuseful and therefor the miracl that oblig us to beleev a prophet ought to be confirm by an immedi or a not long deferrd event so that it is manifest that the teach of the religion which god hath establish and the show of a present miracl join togeth were the onli mark wherebi the scriptur would have a true prophet that is to sai immedi revel to be acknowledg neither of them be singli suffici to oblig ani other man to regard what he saith miracl ceas prophet ceas the scriptur suppli their place see therefor miracl now ceas we have no sign left wherebi to acknowledg the pretend revel or inspir of ani privat man nor oblig to give ear to ani doctrin farther than it is conform to the holi scriptur which sinc the time of our saviour suppli the want of all other propheci and from which by wise and care ratiocin all rule and precept necessari to the knowledg of our duti both to god and man without enthusiasm or supernatural inspir mai easili be deduc and thi scriptur is it out of which i am to take the principl of my discours concern the right of those that ar the supream govenor on earth of christian commonwealth and of the duti of christian subject toward their soveraign and to that end i shall speak in the next chapter or the book writer scope and author of the bibl chapter xxxiii of the number antiqu scope author and interpret of the book of holi scriptur of the book of holi scriptur by the book of holi scriptur ar understood those which ought to be the canon that is to sai the rule of christian life and becaus all rule of life which men ar in conscienc bound to observ ar law the question of the scriptur is the question of what is law throughout all christendom both natural and civil for though it be not determin in scriptur what law everi christian king shall constitut in hi own dominion yet it is determin what law he shall not constitut see therefor i have alreadi prove that soveraign in their own dominion ar the sole legisl those book onli ar canonical that is law in everi nation which ar establish for such by the soveraign author it is true that god is the soveraign of all soveraign and therefor when he speak to ani subject he ought to be obei whatsoev ani earthli potent command to the contrari but the question is not of obedi to god but of when and what god hath said which to subject that have no supernatural revel cannot be known but by that natural reason which guid them for the obtain of peac and justic to obei the author of their several commonwealth that is to sai of their lawful soveraign accord to thi oblig i can acknowledg no other book of the old testament to be holi scriptur but those which have been command to be acknowledg for such by the author of the church of england what book these ar is suffici known without a catalogu of them here and thei ar the same that ar acknowledg by st jerom who holdeth the rest name the wisdom of solomon ecclesiasticu judith tobia the first and second of maccabe though he had seen the first in hebrew and the third and fourth of esdra for apocrypha of the canonical josephu a learn jew that wrote in the time of the emperor domitian reckoneth twenti two make the number agre with the hebrew alphabet st jerom doe the same though thei reckon them in differ manner for josephu number five book of mose thirteen of prophet that writ the histori of their own time which how it agre with the prophet write contain in the bibl wee shall see hereaft and four of hymn and moral precept but st jerom reckon five book of mose eight of prophet and nine of other holi writ which he call of hagiographa the septuagint who were learn men of the jew sent for by ptolemi king of egypt to translat the jewish law out of the hebrew into the greek have left us no other for holi scriptur in the greek tongu but the same that ar receiv in the church of england as for the book of the new testament thei ar equal acknowledg for canon by all christian church and by all sect of christian that admit ani book at all for canonical their antiqu who were the original writer of the several book of holi scriptur ha not been made evid by ani suffici testimoni of other histori which is the onli proof of matter of fact nor can be by ani argument of natural reason for reason serv onli to convinc the truth not of fact but of consequ the light therefor that must guid us in thi question must be that which is held out unto us from the book themselv and thi light though it show us not the writer of everi book yet it is not unuseful to give us knowledg of the time wherein thei were written the pentateuch not written by mose and first for the pentateuch it is not argument enough that thei were written by mose becaus thei ar call the five book of mose no more than these titl the book of joshua the book of judg the book of ruth and the book of the king ar argument suffici to prove that thei were written by joshua by the judg by ruth and by the king for in titl of book the subject is mark as often as the writer the histori of livi denot the writer but the histori of scanderbeg is denomin from the subject we read in the last chapter of deuteronomi ver concern the sepulch of mose that no man knoweth of hi sepulch to thi dai that is to the dai wherein those word were written it is therefor manifest that those word were written after hi interr for it were a strang interpret to sai mose spake of hi own sepulch though by propheci that it wa not found to that dai wherein he wa yet live but it mai perhap be alledg that the last chapter onli not the whole pentateuch wa written by some other man but the rest not let us therefor consid that which we find in the book of genesi chap ver and abraham pass through the land to the place of sichem unto the plain of moreh and the canaanit wa then in the land which must need bee the word of on that wrote when the canaanit wa not in the land and consequ not of mose who dy befor he came into it likewis number ver the writer citeth anoth more ancient book entitul the book of the warr of the lord wherein were registr the act of mose at the redsea and at the brook of arnon it is therefor suffici evid that the five book of mose were written after hi time though how long after it be not so manifest but though mose did not compil those book entir and in the form we have them yet he wrote all that which hee is there said to have written as for exampl the volum of the law which is contain as it seemeth in the of deuteronomi and the follow chapter to the which wa also command to be written on stone in their entri into the land of canaan deut and thi did mose himself write and deliv to the priest and elder of israel to be read everi seventh year to all israel at their assembl in the feast of tabernacl and thi is that law which god command that their king when thei should have establish that form of govern should take a copi of from the priest and levit to lai in the side of the ark deut and the same which have been lost wa long time after found again by hilkiah and sent to king josia who caus it to be read to the peopl renew the coven between god and them king the book of joshua written after hi time that the book of joshua wa also written long after the time of joshua mai be gather out of mani place of the book it self joshua had set up twelv stone in the middest of jordan for a monument of their passag josh of which the writer saith thu thei ar there unto thi dai josh for unto thi dai is a phrase that signifieth a time past beyond the memori of man in like manner upon the sai of the lord that he had roll off from the peopl the reproach of egypt the writer saith the place is call gilgal unto thi dai which to have said in the time of joshua had been improp so also the name of the vallei of achor from the troubl that achan rais in the camp josh the writer saith remaineth unto thi dai which must need bee therefor long after the time of joshua argument of thi kind there be mani other as josh the book of judg and ruth written long after the captiv the same is manifest by like argument of the book of judg chap and ruth but especi judg where it is said that jonathan and hi sonn were priest to the tribe of dan until the dai of the captiv of the land the like of the book of samuel that the book of samuel were also written after hi own time there ar the like argument sam where after david had adjudg equal part of the spoil to them that guard the ammunit with them that fought the writer saith he made it a statut and an ordin to israel to thi dai sam again when david displeas that the lord had slain uzzah for put out hi hand to sustain the ark call the place perezuzzah the writer saith it is call so to thi dai the time therefor of the write of that book must be long after the time of the fact that is long after the time of david the book of the king and the chronicl as for the two book of the king and the two book of the chronicl besid the place which mention such monument as the writer saith remain till hi own dai such as ar king king chron it is argument suffici thei were written after the captiv in babylon that the histori of them is continu till that time for the fact registr ar alwai more ancient than such book as make mention of and quot the regist as these book doe in diver place refer the reader to the chronicl of the king of juda to the chronicl of the king of israel to the book of the prophet samuel or the prophet nathan of the prophet ahijah to the vision of jehdo to the book of the prophet serveiah and of the prophet addo ezra and nehemiah the book of esdra and nehemiah were written certainli after their return from captiv becaus their return the reedif of the wall and hous of jerusalem the renov of the coven and ordin of their polici ar therein contain esther the histori of queen esther is of the time of the captiv and therefor the writer must have been of the same time or after it job the book of job hath no mark in it of the time wherein it wa written and though it appear suffici exekiel and jame that he wa no fain person yet the book it self seemeth not to be a histori but a treatis concern a question in ancient time much disput why wick men have often prosper in thi world and good men have been afflict and it is the most probabl becaus from the begin to the third vers of the third chapter where the complaint of job beginneth the hebrew is as st jerom testifi in prose and from thenc to the sixt vers of the last chapter in hexamet vers and the rest of that chapter again in prose so that the disput is all in vers and the prose is ad but as a prefac in the begin and an epilogu in the end but vers is no usual stile of such as either ar themselv in great pain as job or of such as come to comfort them as hi friend but in philosophi especi moral philosophi in ancient time frequent the psalter the psalm were written the most part by david for the us of the quir to these ar ad some song of mose and other holi men and some of them after the return from the captiv as the and the wherebi it is manifest that the psalter wa compil and put into the form it now hath after the return of the jew from babylon the proverb the proverb be a collect of wise and godli sai partli of solomon partli of agur the son of jakeh and partli of the mother of king lemuel cannot probabl be thought to have been collect by solomon rather then by agur or the mother of lemu and that though the sentenc be their yet the collect or compil them into thi on book wa the work of some other godli man that live after them all ecclesiast and the canticl the book of ecclesiast and the canticl have noth that wa not solomon except it be the titl or inscript for the word of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem and the song of song which is solomon seem to have been made for distinct sake then when the book of scriptur were gather into on bodi of the law to the end that not the doctrin onli but the author also might be extant the prophet of the prophet the most ancient ar sophoniah jona amo hosea isaiah and michaiah who live in the time of amaziah and azariah otherwis ozia king of judah but the book of jona is not properli a regist of hi propheci for that is contain in these few word fourti day and ninivi shall be destroi but a histori or narrat of hi frowardeness and disput god command so that there is small probabl he should be the author see he is the subject of it but the book of amo is hi propheci jeremiah abdia nahum and habakkuk propheci in the time of josiah ezekiel daniel aggeu and zacharia in the captiv when joel and malachi propheci is not evid by their write but consid the inscript or titl of their book it is manifest enough that the whole scriptur of the old testament wa set forth in the form we have it after the return of the jew from their captiv in babylon and befor the time of ptolemaeu philadelphu that caus it to bee translat into greek by seventi men which were sent him out of judea for that purpos and if the book of apocrypha which ar recommend to us by the church though not for canonical yet for profit book for our instruct mai in thi point be credit the scriptur wa set forth in the form wee have it in by esdra as mai appear by that which he himself saith in the second book chapt vers c where speak to god he saith thu thy law is burnt therefor no man knoweth the thing which thou ha done or the work that ar to begin but if i have found grace befor thee send down the holi spirit into me and i shall write all that hath been done in the world sinc the begin which were written in thy law that men mai find thy path and that thei which will live in the later dai mai live and vers and it came to pass when the forti day were fulfil that the highest spake sai the first that thou hast written publish openli that the worthi and unworthi mai read it but keep the seventi last that thou mayst deliv them on to such as be wise among the peopl and thu much concern the time of the write of the book of the old testament the new testament the writer of the new testament live all in less then an ag after christ ascens and had all of them seen our saviour or been hi discipl except st paul and st luke and consequ whatsoev wa written by them is as ancient as the time of the apostl but the time wherein the book of the new testament were receiv and acknowledg by the church to be of their write is not altogeth so ancient for as the book of the old testament ar deriv to us from no higher time then that of esdra who by the direct of god spirit retriv them when thei were lost those of the new testament of which the copi were not mani nor could easili be all in ani on privat man hand cannot bee deriv from a higher time that that wherein the governour of the church collect approv and recommend them to us as the write of those apostl and discipl under whose name thei go the first enumer of all the book both of the old and new testament is in the canon of the apostl suppos to be collect by clement the first after st peter bishop of rome but becaus that is but suppos and by mani question the councel of laodicea is the first we know that recommend the bibl to the then christian church for the write of the prophet and apostl and thi councel wa held in the yeer after christ at which time though ambit had so far prevail on the great doctor of the church as no more to esteem emperour though christian for the shepherd of the peopl but for sheep and emperour not christian for wolv and endeavour to pass their doctrin not for counsel and inform as preacher but for law as absolut governour and thought such fraud as tend to make the peopl the more obedi to christian doctrin to be piou yet i am perswad thei did not therefor falsifi the scriptur though the copi of the book of the new testament were in the hand onli of the ecclesiastick becaus if thei had had an intent so to doe thei would sure have made them more favor to their power over christian princ and civil soveraignti than thei ar i see not therefor ani reason to doubt but that the old and new testament as we have them now ar the true regist of those thing which were done and said by the prophet and apostl and so perhap ar some of those book which ar call apocrypha if left out of the canon not for inconform of doctrin with the rest but onli becaus thei ar not found in the hebrew for after the conquest of asia by alexand the great there were few learn jew that were not perfect in the greek tongu for the seventi interpret that convert the bibl into greek were all of them hebrew and we have extant the work of philo and josephu both jew written by them eloqu in greek but it is not the writer but the author of the church that maketh a book canonical their scope and although these book were written by diver men yet it is manifest the writer were all indu with on and the same spirit in that thei conspir to on and the same end which is the set forth of the right of the kingdom of god the father son and holi ghost for the book of genesi deriveth the genealog of god peopl from the creation of the world to the go into egypt the other four book of mose contain the elect of god for their king and the law which hee prescrib for their govern the book of joshua judg ruth and samuel to the time of saul describ the act of god peopl till the time thei cast off god yoke and call for a king after the manner of their neighbour nation the rest of the histori of the old testament deriv the success of the line of david to the captiv out of which line wa to spring the restor of the kingdom of god even our bless saviour god the son whose come wa foretold in the book of the prophet after whom the evangelist writt hi life and action and hi claim to the kingdom whilst he live on earth and lastli the act and epistl of the apostl declar the come of god the holi ghost and the author he left with them and their successor for the direct of the jew and for the invit of the gentil in summ the histori and the propheci of the old testament and the gospel and epistl of the new testament have had on and the same scope to convert men to the obedi of god in mose and the priest in the man christ and in the apostl and the successor to apostolical power for these three at sever time did repres the person of god mose and hi successor the high priest and king of judah in the old testament christ himself in the time he live on earth and the apostl and their successor from the dai of pentecost when the holi ghost descend on them to thi dai the question of the author of the scriptur state it is a question much disput between the diver sect of christian religion from whenc the scriptur deriv their author which question is also propound sometim in other term as how wee know them to be the word of god or why we beleev them to be so and the difficulti of resolv it ariseth chiefli from the improperness of the word wherein the question it self is couch for it is beleev on all hand that the first and original author of them is god and consequ the question disput is not that again it is manifest that none can know thei ar god word though all true christian beleev it but those to whom god himself hath reveal it supernatur and therefor the question is not rightli move of our knowledg of it lastli when the question is propound of our beleef becaus some ar move to beleev for on and other for other reason there can be rendr no on general answer for them all the question truli state is by what author thei ar made law their author and interpret as far as thei differ not from the law of natur there is no doubt but thei ar the law of god and carri their author with them legibl to all men that have the us of natural reason but thi is no other author then that of all other moral doctrin conson to reason the dictat whereof ar law not made but eternal if thei be made law by god himself thei ar of the natur of written law which ar law to them onli to whom god hath so suffici publish them as no man can excus himself by sai he know not thei were hi he therefor to whom god hath not supernatur reveal that thei ar hi nor that those that publish them were sent by him is not oblig to obei them by ani author but hi whose command have alreadi the forc of law that is to sai by ani other author then that of the commonwealth resid in the soveraign who onli ha the legisl power again if it be not the legisl author of the commonwealth that giveth them the forc of law it must bee some other author deriv from god either privat or publiqu if privat it oblig on him to whom in particular god hath been pleas to reveal it for if everi man should be oblig to take for god law what particular men on pretenc of privat inspir or revel should obtrud upon him in such a number of men that out of pride and ignor take their own dream and extravag fanci and madness for testimoni of god spirit or out of ambit pretend to such divin testimoni fals and contrari to their own conscienc it were imposs that ani divin law should be acknowledg if publiqu it is the author of the commonwealth or of the church but the church if it be on person is the same thing with a commonwealth of christian call a commonwealth becaus it consisteth of men unit in on person their soveraign and a church becaus it consisteth in christian men unit in on christian soveraign but if the church be not on person then it hath no author at all it can neither command nor doe ani action at all nor is capabl of have ani power or right to ani thing nor ha ani will reason nor voic for all these qualiti ar personal now if the whole number of christian be not contain in on commonwealth thei ar not on person nor is there an universal church that hath ani author over them and therefor the scriptur ar not made law by the universal church or if it bee on commonwealth then all christian monarch and state ar privat person and subject to bee judg depos and punish by an universal soveraign of all christendom so that the question of the author of the scriptur is reduc to thi whether christian king and the soveraign assembl in christian commonwealth be absolut in their own territori immedi under god or subject to on vicar of christ constitut over the universal church to bee judg condemn depos and put to death as hee shall think expedi or necessari for the common good which question cannot bee resolv without a more particular consider of the kingdom of god from whenc also wee ar to judg of the author of interpret the scriptur for whosoev hath a lawful power over ani write to make it law hath the power also to approv or disapprov the interpret of the same chapter xxxiv of the signif of spirit angel and inspir in the book of holi scriptur bodi and spirit how taken in the scriptur see the foundat of all true ratiocin is the constant signif of word which in the doctrin follow dependeth not as in natural scienc on the will of the writer nor as in common convers on vulgar us but on the sens thei carri in the scriptur it is necessari befor i proce ani further to determin out of the bibl the mean of such word as by their ambigu mai render what i am to inferr upon them obscur or disput i will begin with the word bodi and spirit which in the languag of the school ar term substanc corporeal and incorporeal the word bodi in the most general accept signifieth that which filleth or occupyeth some certain room or imagin place and dependeth not on the imagin but is a reall part of that we call the univers for the univers be the aggreg of all bodi there is no reall part thereof that is not also bodi nor ani thing properli a bodi that is not also part of that aggreg of all bodi the univers the same also becaus bodi ar subject to chang that is to sai to varieti of appar to the sens of live creatur is call substanc that is to sai subject to variou accid as sometim to be move sometim to stand still and to seem to our sens sometim hot sometim cold sometim of on colour smel tast or sound somtim of anoth and thi divers of seem produc by the divers of the oper of bodi on the organ of our sens we attribut to alter of the bodi that oper call them accid of those bodi and accord to thi accept of the word substanc and bodi signifi the same thing and therefor substanc incorporeal ar word which when thei ar join togeth destroi on anoth as if a man should sai an incorporeal bodi but in the sens of common peopl not all the univers is call bodi but onli such part thereof as thei can discern by the sens of feel to resist their forc or by the sens of their ey to hinder them from a farther prospect therefor in the common languag of men air and aerial substanc us not to be taken for bodi but as often as men ar sensibl of their effect ar call wind or breath or becaus the some ar call in the latin spiritu spirit as when thei call that aerial substanc which in the bodi of ani live creatur give it life and motion vital and animal spirit but for those idol of the brain which repres bodi to us where thei ar not as in a lookingglass in a dream or to a distemp brain wake thei ar as the apostl saith gener of all idol noth noth at all i sai there where thei seem to bee and in the brain it self noth but tumult proceed either from the action of the object or from the disorderli agit of the organ of our sens and men that ar otherwis imploi then to search into their caus know not of themselv what to call them and mai therefor easili be perswad by those whose knowledg thei much rever some to call them bodi and think them made of air compact by a power supernatural becaus the sight judg them corporeal and some to call them spirit becaus the sens of touch discerneth noth in the place where thei appear to resist their finger so that the proper signif of spirit in common speech is either a subtil fluid and invis bodi or a ghost or other idol or phantasm of the imagin but for metaphorical signif there be mani for sometim it is taken for disposit or inclin of the mind as when for the disposit to controwl the sai of other men we sai a spirit contradict for a disposit to uncleanness an unclean spirit for perverseness a froward spirit for sullenness a dumb spirit and for inclin to godliness and god servic the spirit of god sometim for ani emin abil or extraordinari passion or diseas of the mind as when great wisdom is call the spirit of wisdom and mad men ar said to be possess with a spirit other signif of spirit i find no where ani and where none of these can satisfi the sens of that word in scriptur the place falleth not under human understand and our faith therein consisteth not in our opinion but in our submiss as in all place where god is said to be a spirit or where by the spirit of god is meant god himself for the natur of god is incomprehens that is to sai we understand noth of what he is but onli that he is and therefor the attribut we give him ar not to tell on anoth what he is nor to signifi our opinion of hi natur but our desir to honor him with such name as we conceiv most honor amongst our selv spirit of god taken in the scriptur sometim for a wind or breath gen the spirit of god move upon the face of the water here if by the spirit of god be meant god himself then is motion attribut to god and consequ place which ar intellig onli of bodi and not of substanc incorporeal and so the place is abov our understand that can conceiv noth move that chang not place or that ha not dimens and whatsoev ha dimens is bodi but the mean of those word is best understood by the like place gen where when the earth wa cover with water as in the begin god intend to abat them and again to discov the dry land useth like word i will bring my spirit upon the earth and the water shall be diminish in which place by spirit is understood a wind that is an air or spirit move which might be call as in the former place the spirit of god becaus it wa god work secondli for extraordinari gift of the understand gen pharaoh calleth the wisdom of joseph the spirit of god for joseph have advis him to look out a wise and discreet man and to set him over the land of egypt he saith thu can we find such a man as thi is in whom is the spirit of god and exod thou shalt speak saith god to all that ar wise heart whom i have fill with the spirit of wisdom to make aaron garment to consecr him where extraordinari understand though but in make garment as be the gift of god is call the spirit of god the same is found again exod and and isaiah where the prophet speak of the messiah saith the spirit of the lord shall abid upon him the spirit of wisdom and understand the spirit of counsel and fortitud and the spirit of the fear of the lord where manifestli is meant not so mani ghost but so mani emin grace that god would give him thirdli for extraordinari affect in the book of judg an extraordinari zeal and courag in the defenc of god peopl is call the spirit of god as when it excit othoniel gideon jeptha and samson to deliv them from servitud judg and of saul upon the new of the insol of the ammonit toward the men of jabeth gilead it is said sam that the spirit of god came upon saul and hi anger or as it is in the latin hi furi wa kindl greatli where it is not probabl wa meant a ghost but an extraordinari zeal to punish the cruelti of the ammonit in like manner by the spirit of god that came upon saul when hee wa amongst the prophet that prais god in song and musick sam is to be understood not a ghost but an unexpect and sudden zeal to join with them in their devot fourthli for the gift of predict by dream and vision the fals prophet zedekiah saith to micaiah king which wai went the spirit of the lord from me to speak to thee which cannot be understood of a ghost for micaiah declar befor the king of israel and judah the event of the battl as from a vision and not as from a spirit speak in him in the same manner it appeareth in the book of the prophet that though thei spake by the spirit of god that is to sai by a special grace of predict yet their knowledg of the futur wa not by a ghost within them but by some supernatural dream or vision fiftli for life gen it is said god made man of the dust of the earth and breath into hi nostril spiraculum vita the breath of life and man wa made a live soul there the breath of life inspir by god signifi no more but that god gave him life and job as long as the spirit of god is in my nostril is no more then to sai as long as i live so in ezek the spirit of life wa in the wheel is equival to the wheel were aliv and ezek the spirit entr into me and set me on my feet that is i recov my vital strength not that ani ghost or incorpor substanc entr into and possess hi bodi sixtli for a subordin to author in the chap of number vers i will take saith god of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and thei shall bear the burthen of the peopl with thee that is upon the seventi elder whereupon two of the seventi ar said to propheci in the camp of whom some complain and joshua desir mose to forbid them which mose would not doe wherebi it appear that joshua knew not thei had receiv author so to do and propheci accord to the mind of mose that is to sai by a spirit or author subordin to hi own in the like sens we read deut that joshua wa full of the spirit of wisdom becaus mose had laid hi hand upon him that is becaus he wa ordain by mose to prosecut the work hee had himself begun name the bring of god peopl into the promis land but prevent by death could not finish in the like sens it is said rom if ani man have not the spirit of christ he is none of hi not mean therebi the ghost of christ but a submiss to hi doctrin as also john herebi you shall know the spirit of god everi spirit that confesseth that jesu christ is come in the flesh is of god by which is meant the spirit of unfain christian or submiss to that main articl of christian faith that jesu is the christ which cannot be interpret of a ghost likewis these word luke and jesu full of the holi ghost that is as it is exprest mat and mar of the holi spirit mai be understood for zeal to doe the work for which hee wa sent by god the father but to interpret it of a ghost is to sai that god himself for so our saviour wa wa fill with god which is veri unprop and unsignific how we came to translat spirit by the word ghost which signifieth noth neither in heaven nor earth but the imaginari inhabit of man brain i examin not but thi i sai the word spirit in the text signifieth no such thing but either properli a reall substanc or metaphor some extraordinari abil of affect of the mind or of the bodi seventhli for aerial bodi the discipl of christ see him walk upon the sea mat and mark suppos him to be a spirit mean therebi an aerial bodi and not a phantasm for it is said thei all saw him which cannot be understood of the delus of the brain which ar not common to mani at onc as visibl bodi ar but singular becaus of the differ of fanci but of bodi onli in like manner where he wa taken for a spirit by the same apostl luke so also act when st peter wa deliv out of prison it would not be beleev but when the maid said he wa at the dore thei said it wa hi angel by which must be meant a corporeal substanc or we must sai the discipl themselv did follow the common opinion of both jew and gentil that some such apparit were not imaginari but reall and such as need not the fanci of man for their exist these the jew call spirit and angel good or bad as the greek call the same by the name of daemon and some such apparit mai be reall and substantial that is to sai subtil bodi which god can form by the same power by which he form all thing and make us of as of minist and messeng that is to sai angel to declar hi will and execut the same when he pleaseth in extraordinari and supernatural manner but when hee hath so form them thei ar substanc endu with dimens and take up room and can be move from place to place which is peculiar to bodi and therefor ar not ghost incorporeal that is to sai ghost that ar in no place that is to sai that ar no where that is to sai that seem to be somewhat ar noth but if corporeal be taken in the most vulgar manner for such substanc as ar percept by our external sens then is substanc incorporeal a thing not imaginari but reall name a thin substanc invis but that hath the same dimens that ar in grosser bodi angel what by the name of angel is signifi gener a messeng and most often a messeng of god and by a messeng of god is signifi ani thing that make known hi extraordinari presenc that is to sai the extraordinari manifest of hi power especi by a dream or vision concern the creation of angel there is noth deliv in the scriptur that thei ar spirit is often repeat but by the name of spirit is signifi both in scriptur and vulgarli both amongst jew and gentil sometim thin bodi as the air the wind the spirit vital and animal of live creatur and sometim the imag that rise in the fanci in dream and vision which ar not reall substanc but accid of the brain yet when god raiseth them supernatur to signifi hi will thei ar not unproperli term god messeng that is to sai hi angel and as the gentil did vulgarli conceiv the imageri of the brain for thing realli subsist without them and not depend on the fanci and out of them frame their opinion of daemon good and evil which becaus thei seem to subsist realli thei call substanc and becaus thei could not feel them with their hand incorporeal so also the jew upon the same ground without ani thing in the old testament that constrain them thereunto had gener an opinion except the sect of the sadduc that those apparit which it pleas god sometim to produc in the fanci of men for hi own servic and therefor call them hi angel were substanc not depend on the fanci but perman creatur of god whereof those which thei thought were good to them thei esteem the angel of god and those thei thought would hurt them thei call evil angel or evil spirit such as wa the spirit of python and the spirit of madmen of lunatiqu and epileptiqu for thei esteem such as were troubl with such diseas daemoniaqu but if we consid the place of the old testament where angel ar mention we shall find that in most of them there can noth els be understood by the word angel but some imag rais supernatur in the fanci to signifi the presenc of god in the execut of some supernatural work and therefor in the rest where their natur is not exprest it mai be understood in the same manner for we read gen that the same apparit is call not on an angel but god where that which vers is call the angel of the lord in the tenth vers saith to agar i will multipli thy seed exceedingli that is speaketh in the person of god neither wa thi apparit a fanci figur but a voic by which it is manifest that angel signifieth there noth but god himself that caus agar supernatur to apprehend a voic supernatural testifi god special presenc there why therefor mai not the angel that appear to lot and ar call gen men and to whom though thei were but two lot speaketh ver as but on and that on as god for the word ar lot said unto them oh not so my lord be understood of imag of men supernatur form in the fanci as well as befor by angel wa understood a fanci voic when the angel call to abraham out of heaven to stai hi hand gen from slai isaac there wa no apparit but a voic which nevertheless wa call properli enough a messeng or angel of god becaus it declar god will supernatur and save the labour of suppos ani perman ghost the angel which jacob saw on the ladder of heaven gen were a vision of hi sleep therefor on fanci and a dream yet be supernatural and sign of god special presenc those apparit ar not improperli call angel the same is to be understood gen where jacob saith thu the angel of the lord appear to mee in my sleep for an apparit made to a man in hi sleep is that which all men call a dream whether such dream be natural or supernatural and that which there jacob calleth an angel wa god himself for the same angel saith vers i am the god of bethel also exod the angel that went befor the armi of israel to the red sea and then came behind it is vers the lord himself and he appear not in the form of a beautiful man but in form by dai of a pillar of cloud and by night in form of a pillar of fire and yet thi pillar wa all the apparit and angel promis to mose exod for the armi guid for thi cloudi pillar is said to have descend and stood at the dore of the tabernacl and to have talk with mose there you see motion and speech which ar commonli attribut to angel attribut to a cloud becaus the cloud serv as a sign of god presenc and wa no less an angel then if it had had the form of a man or child of never so great beauti or wing as usual thei ar paint for the fals instruct of common peopl for it is not the shape but their us that make them angel but their us is to be signif of god presenc in supernatural oper as when mose exod had desir god to goe along with the camp as he had done alwai befor the make of the golden calf god did not answer i will goe nor i will send an angel in my stead but thu my presenc shall goe with thee to mention all the place of the old testament where the name of angel is found would be too long therefor to comprehend them all at onc i sai there is no text in that part of the old testament which the church of england holdeth for canonical from which we can conclud there is or hath been creat ani perman thing understood by the name of spirit or angel that hath not quantiti and that mai not be by the understand divid that is to sai consid by part so as on part mai bee in on place and the next part in the next place to it and in summ which is not take bodi for that which is some what or some where corporeal but in everi place the sens will bear the interpret of angel for messeng as john baptist is call an angel and christ the angel of the coven and as accord to the same analog the dove and the fieri tongu in that thei were sign of god special presenc might also be call angel though we find in daniel two name of angel gabriel and michael yet is cleer out of the text it self dan that by michael is meant christ not as an angel but as a princ and that gabriel as the like apparit made to other holi men in their sleep wa noth but a supernatural phantasm by which it seem to daniel in hi dream that two saint be in talk on of them said to the other gabriel let us make thi man understand hi vision for god needeth not to distinguish hi celestial servant by name which ar useful on to the short memori of mortal nor in the new testament is there ani place out of which it can be prove that angel except when thei ar put for such men as god hath made the messeng and minist of hi word or work ar thing perman and withal incorporeal that thei ar perman mai bee gather from the word of our saviour himself mat where he saith it shall be said to the wick in the last dai go ye curs into everlast fire prepar for the devil and hi angel which place is manifest for the perman of evil angel unless wee might think the name of devil and hi angel mai be understood of the church adversari and their minist but then it is repugn to their immateri becaus everlast fire is no punish to impat substanc such as ar all thing incorporeal angel therefor ar not thenc prove to be incorporeal in like manner where st paul say cor knew ye not that wee shall judg the angel and pet for if god spare not the angel that sin but cast them down into hell and jude and the angel that kept not their first estat but left their own habit hee hath reserv in everlast chain under darkness unto the judgement of the last dai though it prove the perman of angelical natur it confirmeth also their materi and mat in the resurrect men doe neither marri nor give in marriag but ar as the angel of god in heaven but in the resurrect men shall be perman and not incorporeal so therefor also ar the angel there be diver other place out of which mai be drawn the like conclus to men that understand the signif of these word substanc and incorporeal as incorporeal is taken not for subtil bodi but for not bodi thei impli a contradict insomuch as to sai an angel or spirit is in that sens an incorporeal substanc is to sai in effect there is no angel nor spirit at all consid therefor the signif of the word angel in the old testament and the natur of dream and vision that happen to men by the ordinari wai of natur i wa enclin to thi opinion that angel were noth but supernatural apparit of the fanci rais by the special and extraordinari oper of god therebi to make hi presenc and command known to mankind and chiefli to hi own peopl but the mani place of the new testament and our saviour own word and in such text wherein is no suspicion of corrupt of the scriptur have extort from my feebl reason an acknowledg and beleef that there be also angel substantial and perman but to beleev thei be in no place that is to sai no where that is to sai noth as thei though indirectli sai that will have them incorporeal cannot by scriptur bee evinc inspir what on the signif of the word spirit dependeth that of the word inspir which must either be taken properli and then it is noth but the blow into a man some thin and subtil air or wind in such manner as a man filleth a bladder with hi breath or if spirit be not corpor but have their exist onli in the fanci it is noth but the blow in of a phantasm which is improp to sai and imposs for phantasm ar not but onli seem to be somewhat that word therefor is us in the scriptur metaphor on as gen where it is said that god inspir into man the breath of life no more is meant then that god gave unto him vital motion for we ar not to think that god made first a live breath and then blew it into adam after he wa made whether that breath were reall or seem but onli as it is act that he gave him life and breath that is made him a live creatur and where it is said tim all scriptur is given by inspir from god speak there of the scriptur of the old testament it is an easi metaphor to signifi that god enclin the spirit or mind of those writer to write that which should be useful in teach reprov correct and instruct men in the wai of righteou live but where st peter pet saith that propheci came not in old time by the will of man but the holi men of god spake as thei were move by the holi spirit by the holi spirit is meant the voic of god in a dream or vision supernatural which is not inspir nor when our saviour breath on hi discipl said receiv the holi spirit wa that breath the spirit but a sign of the spiritual grace he gave unto them and though it be said of mani and of our saviour himself that he wa full of the holi spirit yet that fulness is not to be understood for infus of the substanc of god but for accumul of hi gift such as ar the gift of sanctiti of life of tongu and the like whether attain supernatur or by studi and industri for in all case thei ar the gift of god so likewis where god say joel i will powr out my spirit upon all flesh and your son and your daughter shall propheci your old men shall dream dream and your young men shall see vision wee ar not to understand it in the proper sens as if hi spirit were like water subject to effus or infus but as if god had promis to give them prophetical dream and vision for the proper us of the word infus in speak of the grace of god is an abus of it for those grace ar vertu not bodi to be carri hither and thither and to be powr into men as into barrel in the same manner to take inspir in the proper sens or to sai that good spirit entr into men to make them propheci or evil spirit into those that becam phrenetiqu lunatiqu or epileptiqu is not to take the word in the sens of the scriptur for the spirit there is taken for the power of god work by caus to us unknown as also act the wind that is there said to fill the hous wherein the apostl were assembl on the dai of pentecost is not to be understood for the holi spirit which is the deiti it self but for an external sign of god special work on their heart to effect in them the internal grace and holi vertu hee thought requisit for the perform of their apostleship chapter xxxv of the signif in scriptur of kingdom of god of holi sacr and sacrament kingdom of god taken by divin metaphor but in the scriptur properli the kingdom of god in the write of divin and special in sermon and treatis of devot is taken most commonli for eternal felic after thi life in the highest heaven which thei also call the kingdom of glori and sometim for the earnest of that felic sanctif which thei term the kingdom of grace but never for the monarchi that is to sai the soveraign power of god over ani subject acquir by their own consent which is the proper signif of kingdom to the contrari i find the kingdom of god to signifi in most place of scriptur a kingdom properli so name constitut by the vote of the peopl of israel in peculiar manner wherein thei chose god for their king by coven made with him upon god promis them the possess of the land of canaan and but seldom metaphor and then it is taken for dominion over sinn and onli in the new testament becaus such a dominion as that everi subject shall have in the kingdom of god and without prejudic to the soveraign from the veri creation god not onli reign over all men natur by hi might but also had peculiar subject whom he command by a voic as on man speaketh to anoth in which manner he reign over adam and gave him command to abstain from the tree of cogniz of good and evil which when he obei not but tast thereof took upon him to be as god judg between good and evil not by hi creator command but by hi own sens hi punish wa a privat of the estat of eternal life wherein god had at first creat him and afterward god punish hi poster for their vice all but eight person with an universal delug and in these eight did consist the then kingdom of god the original of the kingdom of god after thi it pleas god to speak to abraham and gen to make a coven with him in these word i will establish my coven between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their gener for an everlast coven to be a god to thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlast possess and for a memorial and a token of thi coven he ordaineth vers the sacrament of circumcis thi is it which is call the old coven or testament and containeth a contract between god and abraham by which abraham obligeth himself and hi poster in a peculiar manner to be subject to god posit law for to the law moral he wa oblig befor as by an oath of allegi and though the name of king be not yet given to god nor of kingdom to abraham and hi seed yet the thing is the same name an institut by pact of god peculiar soveraignti over the seed of abraham which in the renew of the same coven by mose at mount sinai is express call a peculiar kingdom of god over the jew and it is of abraham not of mose st paul saith rom that he is the father of the faithful that is of those that ar loyal and doe not violat their allegi sworn to god then by circumcis and afterward in the new coven by baptism that the kingdom of god is properli hi civil soveraignti over a peculiar peopl by pact thi coven at the foot of mount sinai wa renew by mose exod where the lord commandeth mose to speak to the peopl in thi manner if you will obei my voic inde and keep my coven then yee shall be a peculiar peopl to me for all the earth is mine and yee shall be unto me a sacerdotal kingdom and an holi nation for a peculiar peopl the vulgar latin hath peculium de cuncti populi the english translat made in the begin of the reign of king jame hath a peculiar treasur unto me abov all nation and the geneva french the most preciou jewel of all nation but the truest translat is the first becaus it is confirm by st paul himself tit where he saith allud to that place that our bless saviour gave himself for us that he might purifi us to himself a peculiar that is an extraordinari peopl for the word is in the greek periousio which is oppos commonli to the word epiousio and as thi signifieth ordinari quotidian or as in the lord prayer of daili us so the other signifieth that which is overplu and store up and enjoi in a special manner which the latin call peculium and thi mean of the place is confirm by the reason god rendereth of it which followeth immedi in that he addeth for all the earth is mine as if he should sai all the nation of the world ar mine but it is not so that you ar mine but in a special manner for thei ar all mine by reason of my power but you shall be mine by your own consent and coven which is an addit to hi ordinari titl to all nation the same is again confirm in express word in the same text yee shall be to me a sacerdotal kingdom and an holi nation the vulgar latin hath it regnum sacerdotal to which agreeth the translat of that place pet sacerdotium regal a regal priesthood as also the institut it self by which no man might enter into the sanctum sanctorum that is to sai no man might enquir god will immedi of god himself but on the high priest the english translat befor mention follow that of geneva ha a kingdom of priest which is either meant of the success of on high priest after anoth or els it accordeth not with st peter nor with the exercis of the high priesthood for there wa never ani but the high priest on that wa to inform the peopl of god will nor ani convoc of priest ever allow to enter into the sanctum sanctorum again the titl of a holi nation confirm the same for holi signifi that which is god by special not by general right all the earth as is said in the text is god but all the earth is not call holi but that on which is set apart for hi especial servic as wa the nation of the jew it is therefor manifest enough by thi on place that by the kingdom of god is properli meant a commonwealth institut by the consent of those which were to be subject thereto for their civil govern and the regul of their behaviour not on toward god their king but also toward on anoth in point of justic and toward other nation both in peac and warr which properli wa a kingdom wherein god wa king and the high priest wa to be after the death of mose hi sole viceroi or lieuten but there be mani other place that clearli prove the same as first sam when the elder of israel griev with the corrupt of the son of samuel demand a king samuel displeas therewith prai unto the lord and the lord answer said unto him hearken unto the voic of the peopl for thei have not reject thee but thei have reject me that i should not reign over them out of which it is evid that god himself wa then their king and samuel did not command the peopl but onli deliv to them that which god from time to time appoint him again sam where samuel saith to the peopl when yee saw that nahash king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nai but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god wa your king it is manifest that god wa their king and govern the civil state of their commonwealth and after the israelit had reject god the prophet did foretel hi restitut as isaiah then the moon shall be confound and the sun asham when the lord of host shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem where he speaketh express of hi reign in zion and jerusalem that is on earth and micah and the lord shall reign over them in mount zion thi mount zion is in jerusalem upon the earth and ezek as i live saith the lord god sure with a mighti hand and a stretch out arm and with furi powr out i wil rule over you and vers i will caus you to pass under the rod and i will bring you into the bond of the coven that is i will reign over you and make you to stand to that coven which you made with me by mose and brake in your rebellion against me in the dai of samuel and in your elect of anoth king and in the new testament the angel gabriel saith of our saviour luke he shall be great and be call the son of the most high and the lord shall give him the throne of hi father david and he shall reign over the hous of jacob for ever and of hi kingdom there shall be no end thi is also a kingdom upon earth for the claim whereof as an enemi to caesar he wa put to death the titl of hi cross wa jesu of nazareth king of the jew hee wa crown in scorn with a crown of thorn and for the proclaim of him it is said of the discipl act that thei did all of them contrari to the decre of caesar sai there wa anoth king on jesu the kingdom therefor of god is a reall not a metaphorical kingdom and so taken not on in the old testament but the new when we sai for thine is the kingdom the power and glori it is to be understood of god kingdom by forc of our coven not by the right of god power for such a kingdom god alwai hath so that it were superflu to sai in our prayer thy kingdom come unless it be meant of the restaur of that kingdom of god by christ which by revolt of the israelit had been interrupt in the elect of saul nor had it been proper to sai the kingdom of heaven is at hand or to prai thy kingdom come if it had still continu there be so mani other place that confirm thi interpret that it were a wonder there is no greater notic taken of it but that it give too much light to christian king to see their right of ecclesiast govern thi thei have observ that in stead of a sacerdotal kingdom translat a kingdom of priest for thei mai as well translat a royal priesthood as it is in st peter into a priesthood of king and wherea for a peculiar peopl thei put a pretiou jewel or treasur a man might as well call the special regiment or compani of a general the general pretiou jewel or hi treasur in short the kingdom of god is a civil kingdom which consist first in the oblig of the peopl of israel to those law which mose should bring unto them from mount sinai and which afterward the high priest of the time be should deliv to them from befor the cherubin in the sanctum sanctorum and which kingdom have been cast off in the elect of saul the prophet foretold should be restor by christ and the restaur whereof we daili prai for when we sai in the lord prayer thy kingdom come and the right whereof we acknowledg when we add for thine is the kingdom the power and glori for ever and ever amen and the proclaim whereof wa the preach of the apostl and to which men ar prepar by the teacher of the gospel to embrac which gospel that is to sai to promis obedi to god govern is to bee in the kingdom of grace becaus god hath grati given to such the power to bee the subject that is children of god hereaft when christ shall come in majesti to judg the world and actual to govern hi own peopl which is call the kingdom of glori if the kingdom of god call also the kingdom of heaven from the gloriousness and admir height of that throne were not a kingdom which god by hi lieuten or vicar who deliv hi command to the peopl did exercis on earth there would not have been so much content and warr about who it is by whom god speaketh to us neither would mani priest have troubl themselv with spiritual jurisdict nor ani king have deni it them out of thi literal interpret of the kingdom of god ariseth also the true interpret of the word holi for it is a word which in god kingdom answereth to that which men in their kingdom us to call publiqu or the king the king of ani countrei is the publiqu person or repres of all hi own subject and god the king of israel wa the holi on of israel the nation which is subject to on earthli soveraign is the nation of that soveraign that is of the publiqu person so the jew who were god nation were call exod a holi nation for by holi is alwai understood either god himself or that which is god in proprieti as by publiqu is alwai meant either the person of the commonwealth it self or someth that is so the commonwealth as no privat person can claim ani proprieti therein therefor the sabbath god dai is a holi dai the templ god hous a holi hous sacrific tith and offer god tribut holi duti priest prophet and anoint king under christ god minist holi men the coelestial ministr spirit god messeng holi angel and the like and wheresoev the word holi is taken properli there is still someth signifi of proprieti gotten by consent in sai hallow be thy name we do but prai to god for grace to keep the first command of have no other god but him mankind is god nation in proprieti but the jew onli were a holi nation why but becaus thei becam hi proprieti by coven sacr what and the word profan is usual taken in the scriptur for the same with common and consequ their contrari holi and proper in the kingdom of god must be the same also but figur those men also ar call holi that led such godli live as if thei had forsaken all worldli design and wholli devot and given themselv to god in the proper sens that which is made holi by god appropri or separ it to hi own us is said to be sanctifi by god as the seventh dai in the fourth command and as the elect in the new testament were said to bee sanctifi when thei were endu with the spirit of godliness and that which is made holi by the dedic of men and given to god so as to be us on in hi publiqu servic is call also sacr and said to be consecr as templ and other hous of publiqu prayer and their utensil priest and minist victim offer and the external matter of sacrament degre of sanctiti of holiness there be degre for of those thing that ar set apart for the servic of god there mai bee some set apart again for a neerer and more especi servic the whole nation of the israelit were a peopl holi to god yet the tribe of levi wa amongst the israelit a holi tribe and amongst the levit the priest were yet more holi and amongst the priest the high priest wa the most holi so the land of judea wa the holi land but the holi citi wherein god wa to be worship wa more holi and again the templ more holi than the citi and the sanctum sanctorum more holi than the rest of the templ sacrament a sacrament is a separ of some visibl thing from common us and a consecr of it to god servic for a sign either of our admiss into the kingdom of god to be of the number of hi peculiar peopl or for a commemor of the same in the old testament the sign of admiss wa circumcis in the new testament baptism the commemor of it in the old testament wa the eat at a certain time which wa anniversari of the paschal lamb by which thei were put in mind of the night wherein thei were deliv out of their bondag in egypt and in the new testament the celebr of the lord supper by which we ar put in mind of our deliver from the bondag of sin by our bless saviour death upon the cross the sacrament of admiss ar but onc to be us becaus there need but on admiss but becaus we have need of be often put in mind of our deliver and of our alleg the sacrament of commemor have need to be reiter and these ar the principal sacrament and as it were the solemn oath we make of our alleag there be also other consecr that mai be call sacrament as the word implyeth on consecr to god servic but as it impli an oath or promis of alleag to god there were no other in the old testament but circumcis and the passov nor ar there ani other in the new testament but baptism and the lord supper chapter xxxvi of the word of god and of prophet word what when there is mention of the word of god or of man it doth not signifi a part of speech such as grammarian call a nown or a verb or ani simpl voic without a contextur with other word to make it signif but a perfect speech or discours wherebi the speaker affirmeth denieth commandeth promiseth threateneth wisheth or interrogateth in which sens it is not vocabulum that signifi a word but sermo in greek logo that is some speech discours or sai the word spoken by god and concern god both ar call god word in scriptur again if we sai the word of god or of man it mai bee understood sometim of the speaker as the word that god hath spoken or that a man hath spoken in which sens when we sai the gospel of st matthew we understand st matthew to be the writer of it and sometim of the subject in which sens when we read in the bibl the word of the dai of the king of israel or judah ti meant that the act that were done in those dai were the subject of those word and in the greek which in the scriptur retaineth mani hebraism by the word of god is oftentim meant not that which is spoken by god but concern god and hi govern that is to sai the doctrin of religion insomuch as it is all on to sai logo theou and theologia which is that doctrin which wee usual call divin as is manifest by the place follow act then paul and barnaba wax bold and said it wa necessari that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but see you put it from you and judg your selv unworthi of everlast life loe we turn to the gentil that which is here call the word of god wa the doctrin of christian religion as it appear evid by that which goe befor and act where it is said to the apostl by an angel go stand and speak in the templ all the word of thi life by the word of thi life is meant the doctrin of the gospel as is evid by what thei did in the templ and is express in the last vers of the same chap daili in the templ and in everi hous thei ceas not to teach and preach christ jesu in which place it is manifest that jesu christ wa the subject of thi word of life or which is all on the subject of the word of thi life eternal that our saviour offer them so act the word of god is call the word of the gospel becaus it containeth the doctrin of the kingdom of christ and the same word rom is call the word of faith that is as is there express the doctrin of christ come and rais from the dead also mat when ani on heareth the word of the kingdom that is the doctrin of the kingdom taught by christ again the same word is said act to grow and to be multipli which to understand of the evangelical doctrin is easi but of the voic or speech of god hard and strang in the same sens the doctrin of devil signifieth not the word of ani devil but the doctrin of heathen men concern daemon and those phantasm which thei worship as god tim consid these two signif of the word of god as it is taken in scriptur it is manifest in thi later sens where it is taken for the doctrin of the christian religion that the whole scriptur is the word of god but in the former sens not so for exampl though these word i am the lord thy god c to the end of the ten command were spoken by god to mose yet the prefac god spake these word and said is to be understood for the word of him that wrote the holi histori the word of god as it is taken for that which he hath spoken is understood sometim properli sometim metaphor properli as the word he hath spoken to hi prophet metaphor for hi wisdom power and eternal decre in make the world in which sens those fiat let there be light let there be a firmament let us make man c gen ar the word of god and in the same sens it is said john all thing were made by it and without it wa noth made that wa made and heb he upholdeth all thing by the word of hi power that is by the power of hi word that is by hi power and heb the world were frame by the word of god and mani other place to the same sens as also amongst the latin the name of fate which signifieth properli the word spoken is taken in the same sens secondli for the effect of hi word secondli for the effect of hi word that is to sai for the thing it self which by hi word is affirm command threatn or promis as psalm where joseph is said to have been kept in prison till hi word wa come that is till that wa come to pass which he had gen foretold to pharaoh butler concern hi be restor to hi offic for there by hi word wa come is meant the thing it self wa come to pass so also king elijah saith to god i have done all these thy word in stead of i have done all these thing at thy word or command and jer where is the word of the lord is put for where is the evil he threaten and ezek there shall none of my word be prolong ani more by word ar understood those thing which god promis to hi peopl and in the new testament mat heaven and earth shal pass awai but my word shall not pass awai that is there is noth that i have promis or foretold that shall not come to pass and in thi sens it is that st john the evangelist and i think st john on calleth our saviour himself as in the flesh the word of god as joh the word wa made flesh that is to sai the word or promis that christ should come into the world who in the begin wa with god that is to sai it wa in the purpos of god the father to send god the son into the world to enlighten men in the wai of eternal life but it wa not till then put in execut and actual incarn so that our saviour is there call the word not becaus he wa the promis but the thing promis thei that take occas from thi place doe commonli call him the verb of god do but render the text more obscur thei might as well term him the nown of god for as by nown so also by verb men understand noth but a part of speech a voic a sound that neither affirm nor deni nor command nor promiseth nor is ani substanc corporeal or spiritual and therefor it cannot be said to bee either god or man wherea our saviour is both and thi word which st john in hi gospel saith wa with god is in hi epistl vers call the word of life and vers the eternal life which wa with the father so that he can be in no other sens call the word then in that wherein he is call eternal life that is he that hath procur us eternal life by hi com in the flesh so also apocalyps the apostl speak of christ cloth in a garment dipt in bloud saith hi name is the word of god which is to be understood as if he had said hi name had been he that wa come accord to the purpos of god from the begin and accord to hi word and promis deliv by the prophet so that there is noth here of the incarn of a word but of the incarn of god the son therefor call the word becaus hi incarn wa the perform of the promis in like manner as the holi ghost is call the promis act luke thirdli for the word of reason and equiti there ar also place of the scriptur where by the word of god is signifi such word as ar conson to reason and equiti though spoken sometim neither by prophet nor by a holi man for pharaoh necho wa an idol yet hi word to the good king josiah in which he advis him by messeng not to oppos him in hi march against carchemish ar said to have proceed from the mouth of god and that josiah not hearkn to them wa slain in the battl as is to be read chron ver it is true that as the same histori is relat in the first book of esdra not pharaoh but jeremiah spake these word to josiah from the mouth of the lord but wee ar to give credit to the canonical scriptur whatsoev be written in the apocrypha the word of god is then also to be taken for the dictat of reason and equiti when the same is said in the scriptur to bee written in man heart as psalm jerem deut and mani other like place diver accept of the word prophet the name of prophet signifieth in scriptur sometim prolocutor that is he that speaketh from god to man or from man to god and sometim praedictor or a foretel of thing to come and sometim on that speaketh incoher as men that ar distract it is most frequent us in the sens of speak from god to the peopl so mose samuel elijah isaiah jeremiah and other were prophet and in thi sens the high priest wa a prophet for he onli went into the sanctum sanctorum to enquir of god and wa to declar hi answer to the peopl and therefor when caipha said it wa expedi that on man should die for the peopl st john saith chap that he spake not thi of himself but be high priest that year he prophesi that on man should dye for the nation also thei that in christian congreg taught the peopl cor ar said to propheci in the like sens it is that god saith to mose exod concern aaron he shall be thy spokesman to the peopl and he shall be to thee a mouth and thou shalt be to him in stead of god that which here is spokesman is chap interpret prophet see saith god i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet in the sens of speak from man to god abraham is call a prophet gene where god in a dream speaketh to abimelech in thi manner now therefor restor the man hi wife for he is a prophet and shall prai for thee wherebi mai be also gather that the name of prophet mai be given not unproperli to them that in christian church have a call to sai publiqu prayer for the congreg in the same sens the prophet that came down from the high place or hill of god with a psalteri and a tabret and a pipe and a harp sam and ver saul amongst them ar said to propheci in that thei prais god in that manner publiqu in the like sens is miriam exod call a prophetess so is it also to be taken cor where st paul saith everi man that prayeth or prophecyeth with hi head cover c and everi woman that prayeth or prophecyeth with her head uncov for propheci in that place signifieth no more but prais god in psalm and holi song which women might doe in the church though it were not lawful for them to speak to the congreg and in thi signif it is that the poet of the heathen that compos hymn and other sort of poem in the honor of their god were call vate prophet as is well enough known by all that ar vers in the book of the gentil and as is evid tit where st paul saith of the cretian that a prophet of their own said thei were liar not that st paul held their poet for prophet but acknowledgeth that the word prophet wa commonli us to signifi them that celebr the honour of god in vers praedict of futur conting not alwai propheci when by propheci is meant praedict or foretel of futur conting not onli thei were prophet who were god spokesmen and foretold those thing to other which god had foretold to them but also all those impost that pretend by the help of familiar spirit or by superstiti divin of event past from fals caus to foretel the like event in time to come of which as i have declar alreadi in the chapter of thi discours there be mani kind who gain in the opinion of the common sort of men a greater reput of propheci by on casual event that mai bee but wrest to their purpos than can be lost again by never so mani fail propheci is not an art nor when it is taken for praedict a constant vocat but an extraordinari and temporari employ from god most often of good men but sometim also of the wick the woman of endor who is said to have had a familiar spirit and therebi to have rais a phantasm of samuel and foretold saul hi death wa not therefor a prophetess for neither had she ani scienc wherebi she could rais such a phantasm nor doe it appear that god command the rais of it but on guid that impostur to be a mean of saul terror and discourag and by consequ of the discomfitur by which he fell and for incoher speech it wa amongst the gentil taken for on sort of propheci becaus the prophet of their oracl intox with a spirit or vapour from the cave of the pythian oracl at delphi were for the time realli mad and spake like madmen of whose loos word a sens might be made to fit ani event in such sort as all bodi ar said to be made of materia prima in the scriptur i find it also so taken sam in these word and the evil spirit came upon saul and he propheci in the midst of the hous the manner how god hath spoken to the prophet and although there be so mani signif in scriptur of the word prophet yet is that the most frequent in which it is taken for him to whom god speaketh immedi that which the prophet is to sai from him to some other man or to the peopl and hereupon a question mai be ask in what manner god speaketh to such a prophet can it mai some sai be properli said that god hath voic and languag when it cannot be properli said he hath a tongu or other organ as a man the prophet david argueth thu shall he that made the ey not see or he that made the ear not hear but thi mai be spoken not as usual to signifi god natur but to signifi our intent to honor him for to see and hear ar honor attribut and mai be given to god to declar as far as our capac can conceiv hi almighti power but if it were to be taken in the strict and proper sens on might argu from hi make of all part of man bodi that he had also the same us of them which we have which would be mani of them so uncom as it would be the greatest contum in the world to ascrib them to him therefor we ar to interpret god speak to men immedi for that wai whatsoev it be by which god make them understand hi will and the way wherebi he doth thi ar mani and to be sought on in the holi scriptur where though mani time it be said that god spake to thi and that person without declar in what manner yet there be again mani place that deliv also the sign by which thei were to acknowledg hi presenc and command and by these mai be understood how he spake to mani of the rest to the extraordinari prophet of the old testament he spake by dream or vision in what manner god spake to adam and ev and cain and noah is not express nor how he spake to abraham till such time as he came out of hi own countrei to sichem in the land of canaan and then gen god is said to have appear to him so there is on wai wherebi god made hi presenc manifest that is by an apparit or vision and again gen the word of the lord came to abraham in a vision that is to sai somewhat as a sign of god presenc appear as god messeng to speak to him again the lord appear to abraham gen by an apparit of three angel and to abimelech gen in a dream to lot gen by an apparit of two angel and to hagar gen by the apparit of on angel and to abraham again gen by the apparit of a voic from heaven and gen to isaac in the night that is in hi sleep or by dream and to jacob gen in a dream that is to sai as ar the word of the text jacob dream that he saw a ladder c and gen in a vision of angel and to mose exod in the apparit of a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and after the time of mose where the manner how god spake immedi to man in the old testament is express hee spake alwai by a vision or by a dream as to gideon samuel eliah elisha isaiah ezekiel and the rest of the prophet and often in the new testament as to joseph to st peter to st paul and to st john the evangelist in the apocalyps on to mose hee spake in a more extraordinari manner in mount sinai and in the tabernacl and to the high priest in the tabernacl and in the sanctum sanctorum of the templ but mose and after him the high priest were prophet of a more emin place and degre in god favour and god himself in express word declareth that to other prophet hee spake in dream and vision but to hi servant mose in such manner as a man speaketh to hi friend the word ar these numb if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make my self known to him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant mose is not so who is faithful in all my hous with him i will speak mouth to mouth even appar not in dark speech and the similitud of the lord shall he behold and exod the lord spake to mose face to face as a man speaketh to hi friend and yet thi speak of god to mose wa by mediat of an angel or angel as appear express act ver and and gal and wa therefor a vision though a more cleer vision than wa given to other prophet and conform hereunto where god saith deut if there aris amongst you a prophet or dreamer of dream the later word is but the interpret of the former and joel your son and your daughter shall propheci your old men shall dream dream and your young men shall see vision where again the word propheci is expound by dream and vision and in the same manner it wa that god spake to solomon promis him wisdom rich and honor for the text saith king and solomon awoak and behold it wa a dream so that gener the prophet extraordinari in the old testament took notic of the word of god no otherwis than from their dream or vision that is to sai from the imagin which thei had in their sleep or in an extasi which imagin in everi true prophet were supernatural but in fals prophet were either natural or feign the same prophet were nevertheless said to speak by the spirit as zach where the prophet speak of the jew saith thei made their hearth hard as adam lest thei should hear the law and the word which the lord of host hath sent in hi spirit by the former prophet by which it is manifest that speak by the spirit or inspir wa not a particular manner of god speak differ from vision when thei that were said to speak by the spirit were extraordinari prophet such as for everi new messag were to have a particular commiss or which is all on a new dream or vision to prophet of perpetual call and suprem god spake in the old testament from the merci seat in a manner not express in the scriptur of prophet that were so by a perpetual call in the old testament some were suprem and some subordin suprem were first mose and after him the high priest everi on for hi time as long as the priesthood wa royal and after the peopl of the jew had reject god that he should no more reign over them those king which submit themselv to god govern were also hi chief prophet and the high priest offic becam ministerial and when god wa to be consult thei put on the holi vestment and enquir of the lord as the king command them and were depriv of their offic when the king thought fit for king saul sam command the burnt offer to be brought and sam he command the priest to bring the ark neer him and ver again to let it alon becaus he saw an advantag upon hi enemi and in the same chapter saul asketh counsel of god in like manner king david after hi be anoint though befor he had possess of the kingdom is said to enquir of the lord sam whether he should fight against the philistin at keilah and vers david commandeth the priest to bring him the ephod to enquir whether he should stai in keilah or not and king solomon king took the priesthood from abiathar and gave it vers to zadoc therefor mose and the high priest and the piou king who enquir of god on all extraordinari occas how thei were to carri themselv or what event thei were to have were all soveraign prophet but in what manner god spake unto them is not manifest to sai that when mose went up to god in mount sinai it wa a dream or vision such as other prophet had is contrari to that distinct which god made between mose and other prophet numb to sai god spake or appear as he is in hi own natur is to deni hi infiniteness invis incomprehens to sai he spake by inspir or infus of the holi spirit as the holi spirit signifieth the deiti is to make mose equal with christ in whom on the godhead as st paul speaketh col dwelleth bodili and lastli to sai he spake by the holi spirit as it signifieth the grace or gift of the holi spirit is to attribut noth to him supernatural for god disposeth men to pieti justic merci truth faith and all manner of vertu both moral and intellectual by doctrin exampl and by several occas natural and ordinari and as these wai cannot be appli to god in hi speak to mose at mount sinai so also thei cannot be appli to him in hi speak to the high priest from the mercyseat therefor in what manner god spake to those soveraign prophet of the old testament whose offic it wa to enquir of him is not intellig in the time of the new testament there wa no soveraign prophet but our saviour who wa both god that spake and the prophet to whom he spake to prophet of perpetual call but subordin god spake by the spirit to subordin prophet of perpetual call i find not ani place that proveth god spake to them supernatur but on in such manner as natur he inclineth men to pieti to beleef to righteousness and to other vertu all other christian men which wai though it consist in constitut instruct educ and the occas and invit men have to christian vertu yet it is truli attribut to the oper of the spirit of god or holi spirit which we in our languag call the holi ghost for there is no good inclin that is not of the oper of god but these oper ar not alwai supernatural when therefor a prophet is said to speak in the spirit or by the spirit of god we ar to understand no more but that he speak accord to god will declar by the suprem prophet for the most common accept of the word spirit is in the signif of a man intent mind or disposit in the time of mose there were seventi men besid himself that propheci in the camp of the israelit in what manner god spake to them is declar in the of number vers the lord came down in a cloud and spake unto mose and took of the spirit that wa upon him and gave it to the seventi elder and it came to pass when the spirit rest upon them thei propheci and did not ceas by which it is manifest first that their propheci to the peopl wa subservi and subordin to the propheci of mose for that god took of the spirit of mose to put upon them so that thei propheci as mose would have them otherwis thei had not been suffer to propheci at all for there wa vers a complaint made against them to mose and joshua would have mose to have forbidden them which he did not but said to joshua bee not jealou in my behalf secondli that the spirit of god in that place signifieth noth but the mind and disposit to obei and assist mose in the administr of the govern for if it were meant thei had the substanti spirit of god that is the divin natur inspir into them then thei had it in no less manner than christ himself in whom on the spirit of god dwelt bodili it is meant therefor of the gift and grace of god that guid them to cooper with mose from whom their spirit wa deriv and it appeareth vers that thei were such as mose himself should appoint for elder and offic of the peopl for the word ar gather unto me seventi men whom thou knowest to be elder and offic of the peopl where thou knowest is the same with thou appointest or hast appoint to be such for we ar told befor exod that mose follow the counsel of jethro hi fatherinlaw did appoint judg and offic over the peopl such as fear god and of these were those seventi whom god by put upon them mose spirit inclin to aid mose in the administr of the kingdom and in thi sens the spirit of god is said sam present upon the anoint of david to have come upon david and left saul god give hi grace to him he chose to govern hi peopl and take them awai from him he reject so that by the spirit is meant inclin to god servic and not ani supernatural revel god sometim also spake by lot god spake also mani time by the event of lot which were order by such as he had put in author over hi peopl so wee read that god manifest by the lot which saul caus to be drawn sam the fault that jonathan had commit in eat a honeycomb contrari to the oath taken by the peopl and josh god divid the land of canaan amongst the israelit by the lot that joshua did cast befor the lord in shiloh in the same manner it seemeth to be that god discov joshua c the crime of achan and these ar the way wherebi god declar hi will in the old testament all which wai he us also in the new testament to the virgin mari by a vision of an angel to joseph in a dream again to paul in the wai to damascu in a vision of our saviour and to peter in the vision of a sheet let down from heaven with diver sort of flesh of clean and unclean beast and in prison by vision of an angel and to all the apostl and writer of the new testament by the grace of hi spirit and to the apostl again at the choos of matthia in the place of juda iscariot by lot everi man ought to examin the probabl of a pretend prophet call see then all propheci supposeth vision or dream which two when thei be natural ar the same or some especial gift of god so rare observ in mankind as to be admir where observ and see as well such gift as the most extraordinari dream and vision mai proce from god not on by hi supernatural and immedi but also by hi natural oper and by mediat of second caus there is need of reason and judgement to discern between natural and supernatural gift and between natural and supernatural vision or dream and consequ men had need to be veri circumspect and wari in obei the voic of man that pretend himself to be a prophet requir us to obei god in that wai which he in god name telleth us to be the wai to happiness for he that pretend to teach men the wai of so great felic pretend to govern them that is to sai to rule and reign over them which is a thing that all men natur desir and is therefor worthi to be suspect of ambit and impostur and consequ ought to be examin and try by everi man befor hee yeeld them obedi unless he have yeeld it them alreadi in the institut of a commonwealth as when the prophet is the civil soveraign or by the civil soveraign author and if thi examin of prophet and spirit were not allow to everi on of the peopl it had been to no purpos to set out the mark by which everi man might be abl to distinguish between those whom thei ought and those whom thei ought not to follow see therefor such mark ar set out deut c to know a prophet by and john c to know a spirit by and see there is so much propheci in the old testament and so much preach in the new testament against prophet and so much greater a number ordinarili of fals prophet then of true everi on is to bewar of obei their direct at their own peril and first that there were mani more fals than true prophet appear by thi that when ahab king consult four hundr prophet thei were all fals impost but on on michaiah and a littl befor the time of the captiv the prophet were gener lyar the prophet saith the lord by jerem cha vers propheci li in my name i sent them not neither have i command them nor spake unto them thei propheci to you a fals vision a thing of naught and the deceit of their heart in so much as god command the peopl by the mouth of the prophet jeremiah chap not to obei them thu saith the lord of host hearken not unto the word of the prophet that propheci to you thei make you vain thei speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord all propheci but of the soveraign prophet is to be examin by everi subject see then there wa in the time of the old testament such quarrel amongst the visionari prophet on contest with anoth and ask when depart the spirit from me to go to thee as between michaiah and the rest of the four hundr and such give of the lye to on anoth as in jerem and such controversi in the new testament at thi dai amongst the spiritual prophet everi man then wa and now is bound to make us of hi natural reason to appli to all propheci those rule which god hath given us to discern the true from the fals of which rule in the old testament on wa conform doctrin to that which mose the soveraign prophet had taught them and the other the miracul power of foretel what god would bring to pass as i have alreadi shown out of deut c and in the new testament there wa but on on mark and that wa the preach of thi doctrin that jesu is the christ that is the king of the jew promis in the old testament whosoev deni that articl he wa a fals prophet whatsoev miracl he might seem to work and he that taught it wa a true prophet for st john epist c speak express of the mean to examin spirit whether thei be of god or not after he hath told them that there would aris fals prophet saith thu herebi know ye the spirit of god everi spirit that confesseth that jesu christ is come in the flesh is of god that is is approv and allow as a prophet of god not that he is a godli man or on of the elect for thi that he confesseth professeth or preacheth jesu to be the christ but for that he is a prophet avow for god sometim speaketh by prophet whose person he hath not accept as he did by baalam and as he foretold saul of hi death by the witch of endor again in the next vers everi spirit that confesseth not that jesu christ is come in the flesh is not of christ and thi is the spirit of antichrist so that the rule is perfect on both side that he is a true prophet which preacheth the messiah alreadi come in the person of jesu and he a fals on that denyeth him come and looketh for him in some futur impost that shall take upon him that honour fals whom the apostl there properli calleth antichrist everi man therefor ought to consid who is the soveraign prophet that is to sai who it is that is god vicereg on earth and hath next under god the author of govern christian men and to observ for a rule that doctrin which in the name of god hee command to bee taught and therebi to examin and try out the truth of those doctrin which pretend prophet with miracl or without shall at ani time advanc and if thei find it contrari to that rule to doe as thei did that came to mose and complain that there were some that propheci in the camp whose author so to doe thei doubt of and leav to the soveraign as thei did to mose to uphold or to forbid them as hee should see caus and if hee disavow them then no more to obei their voic or if he approv them then to obei them as men to whom god hath given a part of the spirit of their soveraign for when christian men take not their christian soveraign for god prophet thei must either take their own dream for the propheci thei mean to bee govern by and the tumour of their own heart for the spirit of god or thei must suffer themselv to bee lead by some strang princ or by some of their fellow subject that can bewitch them by slander of the govern into rebellion without other miracl to confirm their call then sometim an extraordinari success and impun and by thi mean destroi all law both divin and human reduc all order govern and societi to the first chao of violenc and civil warr chapter xxxvii of miracl and their us a miracl is a work that causeth admir by miracl ar signifi the admir work of god therefor thei ar also call wonder and becaus thei ar for the most part done for a signif of hi command in such occas as without them men ar apt to doubt follow their privat natural reason what he hath command and what not thei ar commonli in holi scriptur call sign in the same sens as thei ar call by the latin ostenta and portenta from shew and foresignifi that which the almighti is about to bring to pass and must therefor be rare whereof there is no natural caus known to understand therefor what is a miracl we must first understand what work thei ar which men wonder at and call admir and there be but two thing which make men wonder at ani event the on is if it be strang that is to sai such as the like of it hath never or veri rare been produc the other is if when it is produc we cannot imagin it to have been done by natural mean but on by the immedi hand of god but when wee see some possibl natural caus of it how rare soever the like ha been done or if the like have been often done how imposs soever it be to imagin a natural mean thereof we no more wonder nor esteem it for a miracl therefor if a hors or cow should speak it were a miracl becaus both the thing is strang the natural caus difficult to imagin so also were it to see a strang deviat of natur in the product of some new shape of a live creatur but when a man or other anim engend hi like though we know no more how thi is done than the other yet becaus ti usual it is no miracl in like manner if a man be metamorphos into a stone or into a pillar it is a miracl becaus strang but if a peec of wood be so chang becaus we see it often it is no miracl and yet we know no more by what oper of god the on is brought to pass than the other the first rainbow that wa seen in the world wa a miracl becaus the first and consequ strang and serv for a sign from god place in heaven to assur hi peopl there should be no more an universal destruct of the world by water but at thi dai becaus thei ar frequent thei ar not miracl neither to them that know their natural caus nor to them who know them not again there be mani rare work produc by the art of man yet when we know thei ar done becaus therebi wee know also the mean how thei ar done we count them not for miracl becaus not wrought by the immedi hand of god but by mediat of human industri that which seemeth a miracl to on man mai seem otherwis to anoth furthermor see admir and wonder is consequ to the knowledg and experi wherewith men ar endu some more some less it followeth that the same thing mai be a miracl to on and not to anoth and thenc it is that ignor and superstiti men make great wonder of those work which other men know to proce from natur which is not the immedi but the ordinari work of god admir not at all as when ecclips of the sun and moon have been taken for supernatural work by the common peopl when nevertheless there were other could from their natural caus have foretold the veri hour thei should arriv or as when a man by confederaci and secret intellig get knowledg of the privat action of an ignor unwari man therebi tell him what he ha done in former time it seem to him a miracul thing but amongst wise and cautel men such miracl as those cannot easili be done the end of miracl again it belongeth to the natur of a miracl that it be wrought for the procur of credit to god messeng minist and prophet that therebi men mai know thei ar call sent and emploi by god and therebi be the better inclin to obei them and therefor though the creation of the world and after that the destruct of all live creatur in the universal delug were admir work yet becaus thei were not done to procur credit to ani prophet or other minist of god thei us not to be call miracl for how admir soever ani work be the admir consisteth not in that it could be done becaus men natur beleev the almighti can doe all thing but becaus he doe it at the prayer or word of a man but the work of god in egypt by the hand of mose were properli miracl becaus thei were done with intent to make the peopl of israel beleev that mose came unto them not out of ani design of hi own interest but as sent from god therefor after god had command him to deliv the israelit from the egyptian bondag when he said exod c thei will not beleev me but will sai the lord hath not appear unto me god gave him power to turn the rod he had in hi hand into a serpent and again to return it into a rod and by put hi hand into hi bosom to make it leprou and again by pull it out to make it whole to make the children of israel beleev as it is vers that the god of their father had appear unto him and if that were not enough he gave him power to turn their water into bloud and when hee had done these miracl befor the peopl it is said vers that thei beleev him nevertheless for fear of pharaoh thei durst not yet obei him therefor the other work which were done to plagu pharaoh and the egyptian tend all to make the israelit beleev in mose and were properli miracl in like manner if we consid all the miracl done by the hand of mose and all the rest of the prophet till the captiv and those of our saviour and hi apostl afterward we shall find their end wa alwai to beget or confirm beleef that thei came not of their own motion but were sent by god wee mai further observ in scriptur that the end of miracl wa to beget beleef not univers in all men elect and reprob but in the elect onli that is to sai is such as god had determin should becom hi subject for those miracul plagu of egypt had not for end the convers of pharaoh for god had told mose befor that he would harden the heart of pharaoh that he should not let the peopl goe and when he let them goe at last not the miracl perswad him but the plagu forc him to it so also of our saviour it is written mat that he wrought not mani miracl in hi own countrei becaus of their unbeleef and in mark in stead of he wrought not mani it is he could work none it wa not becaus he want power which to sai were blasphemi against god nor that the end of miracl wa not to convert incredul men to christ for the end of all the miracl of mose of prophet of our saviour and of hi apostl wa to add men to the church but it wa becaus the end of their miracl wa to add to the church not all men but such as should be save that is to sai such as god had elect see therefor our saviour sent from hi father hee could not us hi power in the convers of those whom hi father had reject thei that expound thi place of st mark sai that hi word hee could not is put for he would not do it without exampl in the greek tongu where would not is put sometim for could not in thing inanim that have no will but could not for would not never and therebi lai a stumbl block befor weak christian as if christ could doe no miracl but amongst the credul the definit of a miracl from that which i have here set down of the natur and us of a miracl we mai defin it thu a miracl is a work of god besid hi oper by the wai of natur ordain in the creation done for the make manifest to hi elect the mission of an extraordinari minist for their salvat and from thi definit we mai inferr first that in all miracl the work done is not the effect of ani vertu in the prophet becaus it is the effect of the immedi hand of god that is to sai god hath done it without us the prophet therein as a subordin caus secondli that no devil angel or other creat spirit can do a miracl for it must either be by vertu of some natural scienc or by incant that is vertu of word for if the inchant do it by their own power independ there is some power that proceedeth not from god which all men deni and if thei doe it by power given them then is the work not from the immedi hand of god but natural and consequ no miracl there be some text of scriptur that seem to attribut the power of work wonder equal to some of those immedi miracl wrought by god himself to certain art of magick and incant as for exampl when we read that after the rod of mose be cast on the ground becam a serpent exod the magician of egypt did the like by their enchant and that after mose had turn the water of the egyptian stream river pond and pool of water into blood exod the magician of egypt did so likewis with their enchant and that after mose had by the power of god brought frog upon the land exod the magician also did so with their enchant and brought up frog upon the land of egypt will not a man be apt to attribut miracl to enchant that is to sai to the efficaci of the sound of word and think the same veri well prove out of thi and other such place and yet there is no place of scriptur that telleth us what on enchant is if therefor enchant be not as mani think it a work of strang effect by spell and word but impostur and delus wrought by ordinari mean and so far from supernatural as the impostor need not the studi so much as of natural caus but the ordinari ignor stupid and superstit of mankind to doe them those text that seem to counten the power of magick witchcraft and enchant must need have anoth sens than at first sight thei seem to bear that men ar apt to be deceiv by fals miracl for it is evid enough that word have no effect but on those that understand them and then thei have no other but to signifi the intent or passion of them that speak and therebi produc hope fear or other passion or concept in the hearer therefor when a rod seemeth a serpent or the water bloud or ani other miracl seemeth done by enchant if it be not to the edif of god peopl not the rod nor the water nor ani other thing is enchant that is to sai wrought upon by the word but the spectat so that all the miracl consisteth in thi that the enchant ha deceiv a man which is no miracl but a veri easi matter to doe for such is the ignor and aptitud to error gener of all men but especi of them that have not much knowledg of natural caus and of the natur and interest of men as by innumer and easi trick to be abus what opinion of miracul power befor it wa known there wa a scienc of the cours of the star might a man have gain that should have told the peopl thi hour or dai the sun should be darkn a juggler by the handl of hi goblet and other trinket if it were not now ordinarili practis would be thought to do hi wonder by the power at least of the devil a man that hath practis to speak by draw in of hi breath which kind of men in antient time were call ventriloqui and so make the weakness of hi voic seem to proce not from the weak impuls of the organ of speech but from distanc of place is abl to make veri mani men beleev it is a voic from heaven whatsoev he pleas to tell them and for a crafti man that hath enquir into the secret and familiar confess that on man ordinarili maketh to anoth of hi action and adventur past to tell them him again is no hard matter and yet there be mani that by such mean as that obtain the reput of be conjur but it is too long a business to reckon up the several sort of those men which the greek call thaumaturgi that is to sai worker of thing wonderful and yet these do all thei do by their own singl dexter but if we look upon the impostur wrought by confederaci there is noth how imposs soever to be done that is imposs to bee beleev for two men conspir on to seem lame the other to cure him with a charm will deceiv mani but mani conspir on to seem lame anoth so to cure him and all the rest to bear witness will deceiv mani more caution against the impostur of miracl in thi aptitud of mankind to give too hasti beleef to pretend miracl there can be no better nor i think ani other caution than that which god hath prescrib first by mose as i have said befor in the preced chapter in the begin of the and end of the of deuteronomi that wee take not ani for prophet that teach ani other religion then that which god lieuten which at that time wa mose hath establish nor ani though he teach the same religion whose praedict we doe not see come to pass mose therefor in hi time and aaron and hi successor in their time and the soveraign governour of god peopl next under god himself that is to sai the head of the church in all time ar to be consult what doctrin he hath establish befor wee give credit to a pretend miracl or prophet and when that is done the thing thei pretend to be a miracl we must both see it done and us all mean possibl to consid whether it be realli done and not on so but whether it be such as no man can do the like by hi natural power but that it requir the immedi hand of god and in thi also we must have recours to god lieuten to whom in all doubtful case wee have submit our privat judgment for exampl if a man pretend that after certain word spoken over a peec of bread that present god hath made it not bread but a god or a man or both and nevertheless it looketh still as like bread as ever it did there is no reason for ani man to think it realli done nor consequ to fear him till he enquir of god by hi vicar or lieuten whether it be done or not if he sai not then followeth that which mose saith deut he hath spoken it presumptu thou shalt not fear him if he sai ti done then he is not to contradict it so also if wee see not but on hear tell of a miracl we ar to consult the law church that is to sai the law head thereof how far we ar to give credit to the relat of it and thi is chiefli the case of men that in these dai live under christian soveraign for in these time i do not know on man that ever saw ani such wondrou work done by the charm or at the word or prayer of a man that a man endu but with a mediocr of reason would think supernatural and the question is no more whether what wee see done be a miracl whether the miracl we hear or read of were a reall work and not the act of a tongu or pen but in plain term whether the report be true or a lye in which question we ar not everi on to make our own privat reason or conscienc but the publiqu reason that is the reason of god suprem lieuten judg and inde we have made him judg alreadi if wee have given him a soveraign power to doe all that is necessari for our peac and defenc a privat man ha alwai the liberti becaus thought is free to beleev or not beleev in hi heart those act that have been given out for miracl accord as he shall see what benefit can accrew by men belief to those that pretend or counten them and therebi conjectur whether thei be miracl or li but when it come to confess of that faith the privat reason must submit to the publiqu that is to sai to god lieuten but who is thi lieuten of god and head of the church shall be consid in it proper place thereaft chapter xxxviii of the signif in scriptur of eternal life hell salvat the world to come and redempt the mainten of civil societi depend on justic and justic on the power of life and death and other less reward and punish resid in them that have the soveraignti of the commonwealth it is imposs a commonwealth should stand where ani other than the soveraign hath a power of give greater reward than life and of inflict greater punish than death now see eternal life is a greater reward than the life present and eternal torment a greater punish than the death of natur it is a thing worthi to be well consid of all men that desir by obei author to avoid the calam of confus and civil war what is meant in holi scriptur by life eternal and torment eternal and for what offenc against whom commit men ar to be etern torment and for what action thei ar to obtain eternal life place of adam etern if he had not sin the terrestri paradis and first we find that adam wa creat in such a condit of life as had he not broken the command of god he had enjoi it in the paradis of eden everlastingli for there wa the tree of life whereof he wa so long allow to eat as he should forbear to eat of the tree of knowledg of good an evil which wa not allow him and therefor as soon as he had eaten of it god thrust him out of paradis lest he should put forth hi hand and take also of the tree of life and live for ever gen by which it seemeth to me with submiss nevertheless both in thi and in all question whereof the determin dependeth on the scriptur to the interpret of the bibl author by the commonwealth whose subject i am that adam if he had not sin had had an eternal life on earth and that mortal entr upon himself and hi poster by hi first sin not that actual death then entr for adam then could never have had children wherea he live long after and saw a numer poster er he dy but where it is said in the dai that thou eatest thereof thou shalt sure die it must need bee meant of hi mortal and certitud of death see then eternal life wa lost by adam forfeitur in commit sin he that should cancel that forfeitur wa to recov therebi that life again now jesu christ hath satisfi for the sin of all that beleev in him and therefor recov to all beleev that eternal life which wa lost by the sin of adam and in thi sens it is that the comparison of st paul holdeth rom as by the offenc of on judgment came upon all men to condemn even so by the righteousness of on the free gift came upon all men to justif of life which is again cor more perspicu deliv in these word for sinc by man came death by man came also the resurrect of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made aliv text concern the place of life eternal for beleev concern the place wherein men shall enjoi that eternal life which christ hath obtain for them the text next befor alledg seem to make it on earth for if as in adam all die that is have forfeit paradis and eternal life on earth even so in christ all shall be made aliv then all men shall be made to live on earth for els the comparison were not proper hereunto seemeth to agre that of the psalmist psal upon zion god command the bless even life for evermor for zion is in jerusalem upon earth as also that of s joh rev to him that overcommeth i will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradis of god thi wa the tree of adam eternal life but hi life wa to have been on earth the same seemeth to be confirm again by st joh rev where he saith i john saw the holi citi new jerusalem come down from god out of heaven prepar as a bride adorn for her husband and again v to the same effect as if he should sai the new jerusalem the paradis of god at the come again of christ should come down to god peopl from heaven and not thei goe up to it from earth and thi differ noth from that which the two men in white cloth that is the two angel said to the apostl that were look upon christ ascend act thi same jesu who is taken up from you into heaven shall so come as you have seen him go up into heaven which soundeth as if thei had said he should come down to govern them under hi father etern here and not take them up to govern them in heaven and is conform to the restaur of the kingdom of god institut under mose which wa a polit govern of the jew on earth again that sai of our saviour mat that in the resurrect thei neither marri nor ar given in marriag but ar as the angel of god in heaven is a descript of an eternal life resembl that which we lost in adam in the point of marriag for see adam and ev if thei had not sin had live on earth etern in their individual person it is manifest thei should not continu have procreat their kind for if immort should have gener as mankind doth now the earth in a small time would not have been abl to afford them a place to stand on the jew that ask our saviour the question whose wife the woman that had marri mani brother should be in the resurrect knew not what were the consequ of immort that there shal be no gener and consequ no marriag no more than there is marriag or gener among the angel the comparison between that eternal life which adam lost and our saviour by hi victori over death hath recov holdeth also in thi that as adam lost eternal life by hi sin and yet live after it for a time so the faith christian hath recov etern life by christ passion though he die a natur death and remain dead for a time name till the resurrect for as death is reckon from the condemn of adam not from the execut so life is reckon from the absolut not from the resurrect of them that ar elect in christ ascens into heaven that the place wherein men ar to live etern after the resurrect is the heaven mean by heaven those part of the world which ar the most remot from earth as where the star ar or abov the star in anoth higher heaven call caelum empyreum whereof there is no mention in scriptur nor ground in reason is not easili to be drawn from ani text that i can find by the kingdom of heaven is meant the kingdom of the king that dwelleth in heaven and hi kingdom wa the peopl of israel whom he rule by the prophet hi lieuten first mose and after him eleazar and the soveraign priest till in the dai of samuel thei rebel and would have a mortal man for their king after the manner of other nation and when our saviour christ by the preach of hi minist shall have perswad the jew to return and call the gentil to hi obedi then shall there be a new kingdom of heaven becaus our king shall then be god whose throne is heaven without ani necess evid in the scriptur that man shall ascend to hi happiness ani higher than god footstool the earth on the contrari we find written joh that no man hath ascend into heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man that is in heaven where i observ by the wai that these word ar not as those which go immedi befor the word of our saviour but of st john himself for christ wa then not in heaven but upon the earth the like is said of david act where st peter to prove the ascens of christ us the word of the psalmist psal thou wilt not leav my soul in hell nor suffer thine holi on to see corrupt saith thei were spoken not of david but of christ and to prove it addeth thi reason for david is not ascend into heaven but to thi a man mai easili answer and sai that though their bodi were not to ascend till the general dai of judgment yet their soul were in heaven as soon as thei were depart from their bodi which also seemeth to be confirm by the word of our saviour luke who prove the resurrect out of the word of mose saith thu that the dead ar rais even mose shew at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob for he is not a god of the dead but of the live for thei all live to him but if these word be to be understood onli of the immort of the soul thei prove not at all that which our saviour intend to prove which wa the resurrect of the bodi that is to sai the immort of the man therefor our saviour meaneth that those patriarch were immortal not by a properti consequ to the essenc and natur of mankind but by the will of god that wa pleas of hi mere grace to bestow eternal life upon the faithful and though at that time the patriarch and mani other faithful men were dead yet as it is in the text thei live to god that is thei were written in the book of life with them that were absolv of their sinn and ordain to life eternal at the resurrect that the soul of man is in it own natur eternal and a live creatur independ on the bodi or that ani meer man is immortal otherwis than by the resurrect in the last dai except eno and elia is a doctrin not appar in scriptur the whole chapter of job which is the speech not of hi friend but of himself is a complaint of thi mortal of natur and yet no contradict of the immort at the resurrect there is hope of a tree saith hee vers if it be cast down though the root thereof wax old and the stock thereof die in the ground yet when it scenteth the water it will bud and bring forth bough like a plant but man dyeth and wasteth awai yea man giveth up the ghost and where is he and vers man lyeth down and riseth not till the heaven be no more but when is it that the heaven shall be no more st peter tell us that it is at the general resurrect for in hi epistl chapter and vers he saith that the heaven and the earth that ar now ar reserv unto fire against the dai of judgment and perdit of ungodli men and vers look for and hast to the com of god wherein the heaven shall be on fire and shall be dissolv and the element shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we accord to the promis look for new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness therefor where job saith man riseth not till the heaven be no more it is all on as if he had said the immortal life and soul and life in the scriptur do usual signifi the same thing beginneth not in man till the resurrect and dai of judgment and hath for caus not hi specifical natur and gener but the promis for st peter sai not wee look for new heaven and a new earth from natur but from promis lastli see it hath been alreadi prove out of diver evid place of scriptur in the chapter of thi book that the kingdom of god is a civil commonwealth where god himself is soveraign by vertu first of the old and sinc of the new coven wherein he reigneth by hi vicar or lieuten the same place do therefor also prove that after the com again of our saviour in hi majesti and glori to reign actual and etern the kingdom of god is to be on earth but becaus thi doctrin though prove out of place of scriptur not few nor obscur will appear to most men a novelti i doe but propound it maintain noth in thi or ani other paradox of religion but attend the end of that disput of the sword concern the author not yet amongst my countreymen decid by which all sort of doctrin ar to bee approv or reject and whose command both in speech and write whatsoev be the opinion of privat men must by all men that mean to be protect by their law be obei for the point of doctrin concern the kingdom of god have so great influenc on the kingdom of man as not to be determin but by them that under god have the soveraign power the place after judgment of those who were never in the kingdom of god or have been in ar cast out as the kingdom of god and eternal life so also god enemi and their torment after judgment appear by the scriptur to have their place on earth the name of the place where all men remain till the resurrect that were either buri or swallow up of the earth is usual call in scriptur by word that signifi under ground which the latin read gener infernu and inferni and the greek hade that is to sai a place where men cannot see and containeth as well the grave as ani other deeper place but for the place of the damn after the resurrect it is not determin neither in the old nor new testament by ani note of situat but on by the compani as that it shall bee where such wick men were as god in former time in extraordinari and miracul manner had destroi from off the face of the earth as for exampl that thei ar in inferno in tartaru or in the bottomeless pit becaus corah dathan and abirom were swallow up aliv into the earth not that the writer of the scriptur would have us beleev there could be in the globe of the earth which is not onli finit but also compar to the height of the star of no consider magnitud a pit without a bottom that is a hole of infinit depth such as the greek in their daemonologi that is to sai in their doctrin concern daemon and after them the roman call tartaru of which virgil say bi patet in praecep tantem tenditqu sub umbra quantu ad aethereum coeli suspectu olympum for that is a thing the proport of earth to heaven cannot bear but that wee should beleev them there indefinit where those men ar on whom god inflict that exemplari punnish the congreg of giant again becaus those mighti men of the earth that live in the time of noah befor the floud which the greek call hero and the scriptur giant and both sai were begotten by copul of the children of god with the children of men were for their wick life destroi by the general delug the place of the damn is therefor also sometim mark out by the compani of those deceas giant as proverb the man that wandreth out of the wai of understand shall remain in the congreg of the giant and job behold the giant groan under water and thei that dwell with them here the place of the damn is under the water and isaiah hell is troubl how to meet thee that is the king of babylon and will displac the giant for thee and here again the place of the damn if the sens be literal is to be under water lake of fire thirdli becaus the citi of sodom and gomorrah by the extraordinari wrath of god were consum for their wickedness with fire and brimston and togeth with them the countrei about made a stink bitumin lake the place of the damn is sometim express by fire and a fieri lake as in the apocalyps ch but the timor incredul and abomin and murder and whoremong and sorcer and idol and all lyar shall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimston which is the second death so that it is manifest that hell fire which is here express by metaphor from the reall fire of sodom signifieth not ani certain kind or place of torment but is to be taken indefinit for destruct as it is in the chapter at the vers where it is said that death and hell were cast into the lake of fire that is to sai were abolish and destroi as if after the dai of judgment there shall be no more dy nor no more go into hell that is no more go to hade from which word perhap our word hell is deriv which is the same with no more dy utter darkness fourthli from the plagu of darkness inflict on the egyptian of which it is written exod thei saw not on anoth neither rose ani man from hi place for three dai but all the children of israel had light in their dwell the place of the wick after judgment is call utter darkness or as it is in the original darkness without and so it is express mat where the king commandeth hi servant to bind hand and foot the man that had not on hi wed garment and to cast him out ei to skoto to exoteron external darkness or darkness without which though translat utter darkness doe not signifi how great but where that darkness is to be name without the habit of god elect gehenna and tophet lastli wherea there wa a place neer jerusalem call the vallei of the children of hinnon in a part whereof call tophet the jew had commit most grievou idolatri sacrif their children to the idol moloch and wherein also god had afflict hi enemi with most grievou punish and wherein josia had burnt the priest of moloch upon their own altar as appeareth at larg in the of king chap the place serv afterward to receiv the filth and garbag which wa carri thither out of the citi and there us to be fire made from time to time to purifi the air and take awai the stench of carrion from thi abomin place the jew us ever after to call the place of the damn by the name of gehenna or vallei of hinnon and thi gehenna is that word which is usual now translat hell and from the fire from time to time there burn we have the notion of everlast and unquench fire of the literal sens of the scriptur concern hell see now there is none that so interpret the scriptur as that after the dai of judgment the wick ar all etern to be punish in the vallei of hinnon or that thei shall so rise again as to be ever after under ground or under water or that after the resurrect thei shall no more see on anoth nor stir from on place to anoth it followeth me think veri necessarili that that which is thu said concern hell fire is spoken metaphor and that therefor there is a proper sens to bee enquir after for of all metaphor there is some reall ground that mai be express in proper word both of the place of hell and the natur of hellish torment and torment satan devil not proper name but appel and first for the torment wee have their natur and properti exactli and properli deliv by the name of the enemi or satan the accus or diabolu the destroy or abbadon which signific name satan devil abbadon set not forth to us ani individual person as proper name us to doe but on an offic or qualiti and ar therefor appel which ought not to have been left untransl as thei ar in the latin and modern bibl becaus therebi thei seem to be the proper name of daemon and men ar the more easili seduc to beleev the doctrin of devil which at that time wa the religion of the gentil and contrari to that of mose and of christ and becaus by the enemi the accus and destroy is meant the enemi of them that shall be in the kingdom of god therefor if the kingdom of god after the resurrect bee upon the earth as in the former chapter i have shewn by scriptur it seem to be the enemi and hi kingdom must be on earth also for so also wa it in the time befor the jew had depos god for god kingdom wa in palestin and the nation round about were the kingdom of the enemi and consequ by satan is meant ani earthli enemi of the church torment of hell the torment of hell ar express sometim by weep and gnash of teeth as mat sometim by the worm of conscienc as isa and mark sometim by fire as in the place now quot where the worm dyeth not and the fire is not quench and mani place besid sometim by shame and contempt as dan and mani of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awak some to everlast life and some to shame and everlast contempt all which place design metaphor a grief and discont of mind from the sight of that eternal felic in other which thei themselv through their own incredul and disobedi have lost and becaus such felic in other is not sensibl but by comparison with their own actual miseri it followeth that thei ar to suffer such bodili pain and calam as ar incid to those who not on live under evil and cruell governour but have also for enemi the eternal king of the saint god almighti and amongst these bodili pain is to be reckon also to everi on of the wick a second death for though the scriptur bee clear for an universal resurrect yet wee do not read that to ani of the reprob is promis an eternal life for wherea st paul cor to the question concern what bodi men shall rise with again saith that the bodi is sown in corrupt and is rais in incorrupt it is sown in dishonour it is rais in glori it is sown in weakness it is rais in power glori and power cannot be appli to the bodi of the wick nor can the name of second death bee appli to those that can never die but onc and although in metaphorical speech a calamit life everlast mai bee call an everlast death yet it cannot well be understood of a second death the fire prepar for the wick is an everlast fire that is to sai the estat wherein no man can be without tortur both of bodi and mind after the resurrect shall endur for ever and in that sens the fire shall be unquench and the torment everlast but it cannot thenc be infer that hee who shall be cast into that fire or be torment with those torment shall endur and resist them so as to be etern burnt and tortur and yet never be destroi nor die and though there be mani place that affirm everlast fire and torment into which men mai be cast success on after anoth for ever yet i find none that affirm there shall bee an eternal life therein of ani individual person but on the contrari an everlast death which is the second death apoc for after death and the grave shall have deliv up the dead which were in them and everi man be judg accord to hi work death and the grave shall also be cast into the lake of fire thi is the second death wherebi it is evid that there is to bee a second death of everi on that shall bee condemn at the dai of judgement after which hee shall die no more the joy of life eternal and salvat the same thing salvat from sin and from miseri all on the joy of life eternal ar in scriptur comprehend all under the name of salvat or be save to be save is to be secur either respect against special evil or absolut against all evil comprehend want sickness and death it self and becaus man wa creat in a condit immortal not subject to corrupt and consequ to noth that tendeth to the dissolut of hi natur and fell from that happiness by the sin of adam it followeth that to be save from sin is to be save from all the evil and calam that sinn hath brought upon us and therefor in the holi scriptur remiss of sinn and salvat from death and miseri is the same thing as it appear by the word of our saviour who have cure a man sick of the palsei by sai mat son be of good cheer thy sin be forgiven thee and know that the scribe took for blasphemi that a man should pretend to forgiv sin ask them v whether it were easier to sai thy sinn be forgiven thee or aris and walk signifi therebi that it wa all on as to the save of the sick to sai thy sin ar forgiven and aris and walk and that he us that form of speech on to shew he had power to forgiv sin and it is besid evid in reason that sinc death and miseri were the punish of sin the discharg of sinn must also be a discharg of death and miseri that is to sai salvat absolut such as the faithful ar to enjoi after the dai of judgment by the power and favour of jesu christ who for that caus is call our saviour concern particular salvat such as ar understood sam as the lord liveth that saveth israel that is from their temporari enemi and sam thou art my saviour thou savest me from violenc and king god gave the israelit a saviour and so thei were deliv from the hand of the assyrian and the like i need sai noth there be neither difficulti nor interest to corrupt the interpret of text of that kind the place of eternal salvat but concern the general salvat becaus it must be in the kingdom of heaven there is great difficulti concern the place on on side by kingdom which is an estat ordain by men for their perpetual secur against enemi and want it seemeth that thi salvat should be on earth for by salvat is set forth unto us a gloriou reign of our king by conquest not a safeti by escap and therefor there where we look for salvat we must look also for triumph and befor triumph for victori and befor victori for battel which cannot well be suppos shall be in heaven but how good soever thi reason mai be i will not trust to it without veri evid place of scriptur the state of salvat is describ at larg isaiah ver look upon zion the citi of our solemn thine ey shall see jerusalem a quiet habit a tabernacl that shall not be taken down not on of the stake thereof shall ever be remov neither shall ani of the cord thereof be broken but there the gloriou lord will be unto us a place of broad river and stream wherein shall goe no galli with oar neither shall gallant ship pass therebi for the lord is our judg the lord is our lawgiv the lord is our king he will save us thy tackl ar loos thei could not well strengthen their mast thei could not spread the sail then is the prei of a great spoil divid the lame take the prei and the inhabit shall not sai i am sick the peopl that shall dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniqu in which word wee have the place from whenc salvat is to proce jerusalem a quiet habit the etern of it a tabernacl that shall not be taken down c the saviour of it the lord their judg their lawgiv their king he will save us the salvat the lord shall be to them as a broad mote of swift water c the condit of their enemi their tackl ar loos their mast weak the lame shal take the spoil of them the condit of the save the inhabit shall not sai i am sick and lastli all thi is comprehend in forgiveness of sin the peopl that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniqu by which it is evid that salvat shall be on earth then when god shall reign at the come again of christ in jerusalem and from jerusalem shall proce the salvat of the gentil that shall be receiv into god kingdom as is also more express declar by the same prophet chap and thei that is the gentil who had ani jew in bondag shall bring all your brethren for an offer to the lord out of all nation upon hors and in charet and in litter and upon mule and upon swift beast to my holi mountain jerusalem saith the lord as the children of israel bring an offer in a clean vessel into the hous of the lord and i will also take of them for priest and for levit saith the lord wherebi it is manifest that the chief seat of god kingdom which is the place from whenc the salvat of us that were gentil shall proce shall be jerusalem and the same is also confirm by our saviour in hi discours with the woman of samaria concern the place of god worship to whom he saith john that the samaritan worship thei know not what but the jew worship what thei knew for salvat is of the jew ex judai that is begin at the jew as if he should sai you worship god but know not by whom he wil save you as we doe that know it shall be on of the tribe of judah a jew not a samaritan and therefor also the woman not impertin answer him again we know the messia shall come so that which our saviour saith salvat is from the jew is the same that paul say rom the gospel is the power of god to salvat to everi on that beleeveth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god reveal from faith to faith from the faith of the jew to the faith of the gentil in the like sens the prophet joel describ the dai of judgment chap that god would shew wonder in heaven and in earth bloud and fire and pillar of smoak the sun should be turn to darkness and the moon into bloud befor the great and terribl dai of the lord come he addeth vers and it shall come to pass that whosoev shall call upon the name of the lord shall be save for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be salvat and obadiah vers saith the same upon mount zion shall be deliver and there shall be holiness and the hous of jacob shall possess their possess that is the possess of the heathen which possess he expresseth more particularli in the follow vers by the mount of esau the land of the philistin the field of ephraim of samaria gilead and the citi of the south and conclud with these word the kingdom shall be the lord all these place ar for salvat and the kingdom of god after the dai of judgement upon earth on the other side i have not found ani text that can probabl be drawn to prove ani ascens of the saint into heaven that is to sai into ani coelum empyreum or other aetherial region save that it is call the kingdom of heaven which name it mai have becaus god that wa king of the jew govern them by hi command sent to mose by angel from heaven to reduc them to their obedi and shall send him thenc again to rule both them and all other faithful men from the dai of judgment everlastingli or from that that the throne of thi our great king is in heaven wherea the earth is but hi footstool but that the subject of god should have ani place as high as hi throne or higher than hi footstool it seemeth not sutabl to the digniti of a king nor can i find ani evid text for it in holi scriptur from thi that hath been said of the kingdom of god and of salvat it is not hard to interpret what is meant by the world to come there ar three world mention in scriptur the old world the present world and the world to come of the first st peter speak pet if god spare not the old world but save noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bring the flood upon the world of the ungodli c so the first world wa from adam to the general flood of the present world our saviour speak john my kingdom is not of thi world for he came on to teach men the wai of salvat and to renew the kingdom of hi father by hi doctrin of the world to come st peter speak pet nevertheless we accord to hi promis look for new heaven and a new earth thi is that world wherein christ come down from heaven in the cloud with great power and glori shall send hi angel and shall gather togeth hi elect from the four wind and from the uttermost part of the earth and thenc forth reign over them under hi father everlastingli redempt salvat of a sinner supposeth a preced redempt for he that is onc guilti of sin is obnoxi to the penalti of the same and must pai or some other for him such ransom as he that is offend and ha him in hi power shall requir and see the person offend is almighti god in whose power ar all thing such ransom is to be paid befor salvat can be acquir as god hath been pleas to requir by thi ransom is not intend a satisfact for sin equival to the offenc which no sinner for himself nor righteou man can ever be abl to make for anoth the dammag a man doe to anoth he mai make amend for by restitut or recomp but sin cannot be taken awai by recomp for that were to make the liberti to sin a thing vendibl but sin mai bee pardon to the repent either grati or upon such penalti as god is pleas to accept that which god usual accept in the old testament wa some sacrific or oblat to forgiv sin is not an act of injustic though the punish have been threatn even amongst men though the promis of good bind the promis yet threat that is to sai promis of evil bind them not much less shall thei bind god who is infinit more merciful then men our saviour christ therefor to redeem us did not in that sens satisfi for the sin of men as that hi death of it own vertu could make it unjust in god to punish sinner with eternal death but did make that sacrific and oblat of himself at hi first come which god wa pleas to requir for the salvat at hi second come of such as in the mean time should repent and beleev in him and though thi act of our redempt be not alwai in scriptur call a sacrific and oblat but sometim a price yet by price we ar not to understand ani thing by the valu whereof he could claim right to a pardon for us from hi offend father but that price which god the father wa pleas in merci to demand chapter xxxix of the signif in scriptur of the word church church the lord hous the word church ecclesia signifieth in the book of holi scriptur diver thing sometim though not often it is taken for god hous that is to sai for a templ wherein christian assembl to perform holi duti publiqu as cor ver let your women keep silenc in the church but thi is metaphor put for the congreg there assembl and hath been sinc us for the edific it self to distinguish between the templ of christian and idolat the templ of jerusalem wa god hous and the hous of prayer and so is ani edific dedic by christian to the worship of christ christ hous and therefor the greek father call it kuriak the lord hous and thenc in our languag it came to be call kyrk and church ecclesia properli what church when not taken for a hous signifieth the same that ecclesia signifi in the grecian commonwealth that is to sai a congreg or an assembl of citizen call forth to hear the magistr speak unto them and which in the commonwealth of rome wa call concio as he that spake wa call ecclesiast and concion and when thei were call forth by lawful author act it wa ecclesia legitima a lawful church ennomo ecclesia but when thei were excit by tumultu and sediti clamor then it wa a confus church ecclesia sugkechumen it is taken also sometim for the men that have right to be of the congreg though not actual assembl that is to sai for the whole multitud of christian men how far soever thei be dispers as act where it is said that saul made havock of the church and in thi sens is christ said to be head of the church and sometim for a certain part of christian as col salut the church that is in hi hous sometim also for the elect on as eph a gloriou church without spot or wrinkl holi and without blemish which is meant of the church triumphant or church to come sometim for a congreg assembl of professor of christian whether their profess be true or counterfeit as it is understood mat where it is said tell it to the church and if hee neglect to hear the church let him be to thee as a gentil or publican in what sens the church is on person church defin and in thi last sens onli it is that the church can be taken for on person that is to sai that it can be said to have power to will to pronounc to command to be obei to make law or to doe ani other action whatsoev for without author from a lawful congreg whatsoev act be done in a concours of peopl it is the particular act of everi on of those that were present and gave their aid to the perform of it and not the act of them all in gross as of on bodi much less that act of them that were absent or that be present were not will it should be done accord to thi sens i defin a church to be a compani of men profess christian religion unit in the person of on soveraign at whose command thei ought to assembl and without whose author thei ought not to assembl and becaus in all commonwealth that assembl which is without warrant from the civil soveraign is unlaw that church also which is assembl in ani commonwealth that hath forbidden them to assembl is an unlawful assembl a christian commonwealth and a church all on it followeth also that there is on earth no such universal church as all christian ar bound to obei becaus there is no power on earth to which all other commonwealth ar subject there ar christian in the dominion of several princ and state but everi on of them is subject to that commonwealth whereof he is himself a member and consequ cannot be subject to the command of ani other person and therefor a church such as on as is capabl to command to judg absolv condemn or do ani other act is the same thing with a civil commonwealth consist of christian men and is call a civil state for that the subject of it ar men and a church for that the subject thereof ar christian temporal and spiritual govern ar but two word brought into the world to make men see doubl and mistak their lawful soveraign it is true that the bodi of the faithful after the resurrect shall be not on spiritual but eternal but in thi life thei ar gross and corrupt there is therefor no other govern in thi life neither of state nor religion but temporal nor teach of ani doctrin lawful to ani subject which the governour both of the state and of the religion forbiddeth to be taught and that governor must be on or els there must need follow faction and civil war in the commonwealth between the church and state between spiritualist and temporalist between the sword of justic and the shield of faith and which is more in everi christian man own brest between the christian and the man the doctor of the church ar call pastor so also ar civil soveraign but if pastor be not subordin on to anoth so as that there mai bee on chief pastor men will be taught contrari doctrin whereof both mai be and on must be fals who that on chief pastor is accord to the law of natur hath been alreadi shewn name that it is the civil soveraign and to whom the scriptur hath assign that offic we shall see in the chapter follow chapter xl of the right of the kingdom of god in abraham mose high priest and the king of judah the soveraign right of abraham the father of the faithful and first in the kingdom of god by coven wa abraham for with him wa the coven first made wherein he oblig himself and hi seed after him to acknowledg and obei the command of god not on such as he could take notic of as moral law by the light of natur but also such as god should in special manner deliv to him by dream and vision for as to the moral law thei were alreadi oblig and need not have been contract withal by promis of the land of canaan nor wa there ani contract that could add to or strengthen the oblig by which both thei and all men els were bound natur to obei god almighti and therefor the coven which abraham made with god wa to take for the command of god that which in the name of god wa command him in a dream or vision and to deliv it to hi famili and caus them to observ the same abraham had the sole power of order the religion of hi own peopl in thi contract of god with abraham wee mai observ three point of import consequ in the govern of god peopl first that at the make of thi coven god spake on to abraham and therefor contract not with ani of hi famili or seed otherwis then as their will which make the essenc of all coven were befor the contract involv in the will of abraham who wa therefor suppos to have had a lawful power to make them perform all that he coven for them accord whereunto gen god saith all the nation of the earth shall be bless in him for i know him that he will command hi children and hi houshold after him and thei shall keep the wai of the lord from whenc mai be conclud thi first point that thei to whom god hath not spoken immedi ar to receiv the posit command of god from their soveraign as the famili and seed of abraham did from abraham their father and lord and civil soveraign and consequ in everi commonwealth thei who have no supernatural revel to the contrari ought to obei the law of their own soveraign in the external act and profess of religion as for the inward thought and beleef of men which human governour can take no notic of for god on knoweth the heart thei ar not voluntari nor the effect of the law but of the unrev will and of the power of god and consequ fall not under oblig no pretenc of privat spirit against the religion of abraham from whenc proceedeth anoth point that it wa not unlawful for abraham when ani of hi subject should pretend privat vision or spirit or other revel from god for the countenanc of ani doctrin which abraham should forbid or when thei follow or adher to ani such pretend to punish them and consequ that it is lawful now for the soveraign to punish ani man that shall oppos hi privat spirit against the law for hee hath the same place in the commonwealth that abraham had in hi own famili abraham sole judg and interpret of what god spake there ariseth also from the same a third point that as none but abraham in hi famili so none but the soveraign in a christian commonwealth can take notic what is or what is not the word of god for god spake on to abraham and it wa he on that wa abl to know what god said and to interpret the same to hi famili and therefor also thei that have the place of abraham in a commonwealth ar the on interpret of what god hath spoken the author of mose whereon ground the same coven wa renew with isaac and afterward with jacob but afterward no more till the israelit were freed from the egyptian and arriv at the foot of mount sinai and then it wa renew by mose as i have said befor chap in such manner as thei becam from that time forward the peculiar kingdom of god whose lieuten wa mose for hi own time and the success to that offic wa setl upon aaron and hi heir after him to bee to god a sacerdotal kingdom for ever by thi constitut a kingdom is acquir to god but see mose had no author to govern the israelit as a successor to the right of abraham becaus he could not claim it by inherit it appeareth not as yet that the peopl were oblig to take him for god lieuten longer than thei beleev that god spake unto him and therefor hi author notwithstand the coven thei made with god depend yet mere upon the opinion thei had of hi sanctiti and of the realiti of hi confer with god and the veriti of hi miracl which opinion come to chang thei were no more oblig to take ani thing for the law of god which he propound to them in god name we ar therefor to consid what other ground there wa of their oblig to obei him for it could not be the command of god that could oblig them becaus god spake not to them immedi but by the mediat of mose himself and our saviour saith of himself john if i bear witness of my self my witness is not true much less if mose bear witness of himself especi in a claim of kingli power over god peopl ought hi testimoni to be receiv hi author therefor as the author of all other princ must be ground on the consent of the peopl and their promis to obei him and so it wa for the peopl exod when thei saw the thunder and the lightn and the noys of the trumpet and the mountain smoak remov and stood a far off and thei said unto mose speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die here wa their promis of obedi and by thi it wa thei oblig themselv to obei whatsoev he should deliv unto them for the command of god mose wa under god soveraign of the jew all hi own time though aaron had the priesthood and notwithstand the coven constitut a sacerdotal kingdom that is to sai a kingdom hereditari to aaron yet that is to be understood of the success after mose should bee dead for whosoev ordereth and establisheth the polici as first founder of a commonwealth be it monarchi aristocraci or democraci must need have soveraign power over the peopl all the while he is do of it and that mose had that power all hi own time is evid affirm in the scriptur first in the text last befor cite becaus the peopl promis obedi not to aaron but to him secondli exod and god said unto mose come up unto the lord thou and aaron nadab and abihu and seventi of the elder of israel and mose alon shall come neer the lord but thei shall not come nigh neither shall the peopl goe up with him by which it is plain that mose who wa alon call up to god and not aaron nor the other priest nor the seventi elder nor the peopl who were forbidden to come up wa alon he that repres to the israelit the person of god that is to sai wa their sole soveraign under god and though afterward it be said vers then went up mose and aaron nadab and abihu and seventi of the elder of israel and thei saw the god of israel and there wa under hi feet as it were a pave work of a saphir stone c yet thi wa not till after mose had been with god befor and had brought to the peopl the word which god had said to him he on went for the business of the peopl the other as the nobl of hi retinu were admit for honour to that special grace which wa not allow to the peopl which wa as in the vers after appeareth to see god and live god laid not hi hand upon them thei saw god and did eat and drink that is did live but did not carri ani command from him to the peopl again it is everi where said the lord spake unto mose as in all other occas of govern so also in the order of the ceremoni of religion contain in the and chapter of exodu and throughout leviticu to aaron seldom the calf that aaron made mose threw into the fire lastli the question of the author of aaron by occas of hi and miriam mutini against mose wa number judg by god himself for mose so also in the question between mose and the peopl when corah dathan and abiram and two hundr and fifti princ of the assembl gather themselv togeth number against mose and against aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you see all the congreg ar holi everi on of them and the lord is amongst them why lift you up your selv abov the congreg of the lord god caus the earth to swallow corah dathan and abiram with their wive and children aliv and consum those two hundr and fifti princ with fire therefor neither aaron nor the peopl nor ani aristocraci of the chief princ of the peopl but mose alon had next under god the soveraignti over the israelit and that not on in caus of civil polici but also of religion for mose on spake with god and therefor on could tell the peopl what it wa that god requir at their hand no man upon pain of death might be so presumptu as to approach the mountain where god talk with mose thou shalt set bound saith the lord exod to the peopl round about and sai take heed to your selv that you goe not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoev toucheth the mount shall sure be put to death and again vers get down charg the peopl lest thei break through unto the lord to gaze out of which we mai conclud that whosoev in a christian commonwealth holdeth the place of mose is the sole messeng of god and interpret of hi command and accord hereunto no man ought in the interpret of the scriptur to proce further then the bound which ar set by their several soveraign for the scriptur sinc god now speaketh in them ar the mount sinai the bound whereof ar the law of them that repres god person on earth to look upon them and therein to behold the wondrou work of god and learn to fear him is allow but to interpret them that is to pry into what god saith to him whom he appointeth to govern under him and make themselv judg whether he govern as god commandeth him or not is to transgress the bound god hath set us and to gaze upon god irrever all spirit were subordin to the spirit of mose there wa no prophet in the time of mose nor pretend to the spirit of god but such as mose had approv and author for there were in hi time but seventi men that ar said to propheci by the spirit of god and these were of all mose hi elect concern whom god saith to mose numb gather to mee seventi of the elder of israel whom thou knowest to be the elder of the peopl to these god impart hi spirit but it wa not a differ spirit from that of mose for it is said vers god came down in a cloud and took of the spirit that wa upon mose and gave it to the seventi elder but as i have shewn befor chap by spirit is understood the mind so that the sens of the place is no other than thi that god endu them with a mind conform and subordin to that of mose that thei might propheci that is to sai speak to the peopl in god name in such manner as to set forward as minist of mose and by hi author such doctrin as wa agreeabl to mose hi doctrin for thei were but minist and when two of them propheci in the camp it wa thought a new and unlawful thing and as it is in the and vers of the same chapter thei were accus of it and joshua advis mose to forbid them as not know that it wa by mose hi spirit that thei propheci by which it is manifest that no subject ought to pretend to propheci or to the spirit in opposit to the doctrin establish by him whom god hath set in the place of mose after mose the soveraignti wa in the high priest aaron be dead and after him also mose the kingdom as be a sacerdotal kingdom descend by vertu of the coven to aaron son eleazar the high priest and god declar him next under himself for soveraign at the same time that he appoint joshua for the general of their armi for thu god saith express numb concern joshua he shall stand befor eleazar the priest who shall ask counsel for him befor the lord at hi word shall thei goe out and at hi word thei shall come in both he and all the children of israel with him therefor the suprem power of make war and peac wa in the priest the suprem power of judicatur belong also to the high priest for the book of the law wa in their keep and the priest and levit on were the subordin judg in caus civil as appear in deut and for the manner of god worship there wa never doubt made but that the high priest till the time of saul had the suprem author therefor the civil and ecclesiastical power were both join togeth in on and the same person the high priest and ought to bee so in whosoev governeth by divin right that is by author immedi from god of the soveraign power between the time of joshua and of saul after the death of joshua till the time of saul the time between is note frequent in the book of judg that there wa in those day no king in israel and sometim with thi addit that everi man did that which wa right in hi own ey by which is to bee understood that where it is said there wa no king is meant there wa no soveraign power in israel and so it wa if we consid the act and exercis of such power for after the death of joshua eleazar there aros anoth gener judg that knew not the lord nor the work which he had done for israel but did evil in the sight of the lord and serv baalim and the jew had that qualiti which st paul noteth to look for a sign not on befor thei would submit themselv to the govern of mose but also after thei had oblig themselv by their submiss wherea sign and miracl had for end to procur faith not to keep men from violat it when thei have onc given it for to that men ar oblig by the law of natur but if we consid not the exercis but the right of govern the soveraign power wa still in the high priest therefor whatsoev obedi wa yeeld to ani of the judg who were men chosen by god extraordinarili to save hi rebelli subject out of the hand of the enemi it cannot bee drawn into argument against the right the high priest had to the soveraign power in all matter both of polici and religion and neither the judg nor samuel himself had an ordinari but extraordinari call to the govern and were obei by the israelit not out of duti but out of rever to their favour with god appear in their wisdom courag or felic hitherto therefor the right of regul both the polici and the religion were insepar of the right of the king of israel to the judg succeed king and wherea befor all author both in religion and polici wa in the high priest so now it wa all in the king for the soveraignti over the peopl which wa befor not on by vertu of the divin power but also by a particular pact of the israelit in god and next under him in the high priest as hi vicereg on earth wa cast off by the peopl with the consent of god himself for when thei said to samuel sam make us a king to judg us like all the nation thei signifi that thei would no more bee govern by the command that should bee laid upon them by the priest in the name of god but by on that should command them in the same manner that all other nation were command and consequ in depos the high priest of royal author thei depos that peculiar govern of god and yet god consent to it sai to samuel vers hearken unto the voic of the peopl in all that thei shall sai unto thee for thei have not reject thee but thei have reject mee that i should not reign over them have therefor reject god in whose right the priest govern there wa no author left to the priest but such as the king wa pleas to allow them which wa more or less accord as the king were good or evil and for the govern of civil affair it is manifest it wa all in the hand of the king for in the same chapter vers thei sai thei will be like all the nation that their king shall be their judg and goe befor them and fight their battel that is he shall have the whole author both in peac and war in which is contain also the order of religion for there wa no other word of god in that time by which to regul religion but the law of mose which wa their civil law besid we read king that solomon thrust out abiathar from be priest befor the lord he had therefor author over the high priest as over ani other subject which is a great mark of supremaci in religion and we read also king that hee dedic the templ that he bless the peopl and that he himself in person made that excel prayer us in the consecr of all church and hous of prayer which is anoth great mark of supremaci in religion again we read king that when there wa question concern the book of the law found in the templ the same wa not decid by the high priest but josiah sent both him and other to enquir concern it of hulda the prophetess which is anoth mark of the supremaci in religion lastli wee read chro that david made hashabiah and hi brethren hebronit offic of israel among them westward in all business of the lord and in the servic of the king likewis vers that hee made other hebronit ruler over the reubenit the gadit and the half tribe of manasseh these were the rest of israel that dwelt beyond jordan for everi matter pertain to god and affair of the king is not thi full power both temporal and spiritual as thei call it that would divid it to conclud from the first institut of god kingdom to the captiv the supremaci of religion wa in the same hand with that of the civil soveraignti and the priest offic after the elect of saul wa not magisterial but ministerial the practic of supremaci in religion wa not in the time of the king accord to the right thereof notwithstand the govern both in polici and religion were join first in the high priest and afterward in the king so far forth as concern the right yet it appeareth by the same holi histori that the peopl understood it not but there be amongst them a great part and probabl the greatest part that no longer than thei saw great miracl or which is equival to a miracl great abil or great felic in the enterpris of their governour gave suffici credit either to the fame of mose or to the colloqui between god and the priest thei took occas as oft as their governour displeas them by blame sometim the polici sometim the religion to chang the govern or revolt from their obedi at their pleasur and from thenc proceed from time to time the civil troubl divis and calam of the nation as for exampl after the death of eleazar and joshua the next gener which had not seen the wonder of god but were left to their own weak reason not know themselv oblig by the coven of a sacerdotal kingdom regard no more the command of the priest nor ani law of mose but did everi man that which wa right in hi own ey and obei in civil affair such men as from time to time thei thought abl to deliv them from the neighbour nation that oppress them and consult not with god as thei ought to doe but with such men or women as thei guess to bee prophet by their praedict of thing to come and thought thei had an idol in their chappel yet if thei had a levit for their chaplain thei made account thei worship the god of israel and afterward when thei demand a king after the manner of the nation yet it wa not with a design to depart from the worship of god their king but despair of the justic of the son of samuel thei would have a king to judg them in civil action but not that thei would allow their king to chang the religion which thei thought wa recommend to them by mose so that thei alwai kept in store a pretext either of justic or religion to discharg themselv of their obedi whensoev thei had hope to prevail samuel wa displeas with the peopl for that thei desir a king for god wa their king alreadi and samuel had but an author under him yet did samuel when saul observ not hi counsel in destroi agag as god had command anoint anoth king name david to take the success from hi heir rehoboam wa no idolat but when the peopl thought him an oppressor that civil pretenc carri from him ten tribe to jeroboam an idolat and gener through the whole histori of the king as well of judah as of israel there were prophet that alwai control the king for transgress the religion and sometim also for errour of state chro as jehosaphat wa reprov by the prophet jehu for aid the king of israel against the syrian and hezekiah by isaiah for shew hi treasur to the ambassador of babylon by all which it appeareth that though the power both of state and religion were in the king yet none of them were uncontrol in the us of it but such as were graciou for their own natural abil or felic so that from the practis of those time there can no argument be drawn that the right of supremaci in religion wa not in the king unless we place it in the prophet and conclud that becaus hezekiah prai to the lord befor the cherubin wa not answer from thenc nor then but afterward by the prophet isaiah therefor isaiah wa suprem head of the church or becaus josiah consult hulda the prophetess concern the book of the law that therefor neither he nor the high priest but hulda the prophetess had the suprem author in matter of religion which i think is not the opinion of ani doctor after the captiv the jew had no setl commonwealth dure the captiv the jew had no commonwealth at all and after their return though thei renew their coven with god yet there wa no promis made of obedi neither to esdra nor to ani other and present after thei becam subject to the greek from whose custom and daemonolog and from the doctrin of the cabalist their religion becam much corrupt in such sort as noth can be gather from their confus both in state and religion concern the supremaci in either and therefor so far forth as concerneth the old testament we mai conclud that whosoev had the soveraignti of the commonwealth amongst the jew the same had also the suprem author in matter of god external worship and repres god person that is the person of god the father though he were not call by the name of father till such time as he sent into the world hi son jesu christ to redeem mankind from their sin and bring them into hi everlast kingdom to be save for evermor of which we ar to speak in the chapter follow chapter xli of the offic of our bless saviour three part of the offic of christ we find in holi scriptur three part of the offic of the messiah the first of a redeem or saviour the second of a pastor counsellour or teacher that is of a prophet sent from god to convert such as god hath elect to salvat the third of a king and eternal king but under hi father as mose and the high priest were in their several time and to these three part ar corespond three time for our redempt he wrought at hi first come by the sacrific wherein he offer up himself for our sinn upon the cross our convers he wrought partli then in hi own person and partli worketh now by hi minist and will continu to work till hi come again and after hi come again shall begin that hi gloriou reign over hi elect which is to last etern hi offic as a redeem to the offic of a redeem that is of on that payeth the ransom of sin which ransom is death it appertaineth that he wa sacrif and therebi bare upon hi own head and carri awai from us our iniqu in such sort as god had requir not that the death of on man though without sinn can satisfi for the offenc of all men in the rigour of justic but in the merci of god that ordain such sacrific for sin as he wa pleas in hi merci to accept in the old law as we mai read leviticu the the lord requir that there should everi year onc bee made an aton for the sin of all israel both priest and other for the do whereof aaron alon wa to sacrific for himself and the priest a young bullock and for the rest of the peopl he wa to receiv from them two young goat of which he wa to sacrific on but as for the other which wa the scape goat he wa to lai hi hand on the head thereof and by a confess of the iniqu of the peopl to lai them all on that head and then by some opportun man to caus the goat to be led into the wilderness and there to escap and carri awai with him the iniqu of the peopl as the sacrific of the on goat wa a suffici becaus an accept price for the ransom of all israel so the death of the messiah is a suffici price for the sin of all mankind becaus there wa no more requir our saviour christ suffer seem to be here figur as cleerli as in the oblat of isaac or in ani other type of him in the old testament he wa both the sacrif goat and the scape goat hee wa oppress and he wa afflict isa he open not hi mouth he brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep is dumb befor the shearer so open he not hi mouth here he is the sacrif goat he hath born our grief ver and carri our sorrow and again ver the lord hath laid upon him the iniqu of us all and so he is the scape goat he wa cut off from the land of the live ver for the transgress of my peopl there again he is the sacrif goat and again ver he shall bear their sin hee is the scape goat thu is the lamb of god equival to both those goat sacrif in that he dy and escap in hi resurrect be rais opportun by hi father and remov from the habit of men in hi ascens christ kingdom not of thi world for as much therefor as he that redeemeth hath no titl to the thing redeem befor the redempt and ransom paid and thi ransom wa the death of the redeem it is manifest that our saviour as man wa not king of those that he redeem befor hee suffer death that is dure that time hee convers bodili on the earth i sai he wa not then king in present by vertu of the pact which the faithful make with him in baptism nevertheless by the renew of their pact with god in baptism thei were oblig to obei him for king under hi father whensoev he should be pleas to take the kingdom upon him accord whereunto our saviour himself express saith john my kingdom is not of thi world now see the scriptur maketh mention but of two world thi that is now and shall remain to the dai of judgment which is therefor also call the last dai and that which shall bee a new heaven and a new earth the kingdom of christ is not to begin till the gener resurrect and that is it which our saviour saith mat the son of man shall come in the glori of hi father with hi angel and then he shall reward everi man accord to hi work to reward everi man accord to hi work is to execut the offic of a king and thi is not to be till he come in the glori of hi father with hi angel when our saviour saith mat the scribe and pharise sit in mose seat all therefor whatsoev thei bid you doe that observ and doe hee declareth plainli that hee ascribeth kingli power for that time not to himself but to them and so hee hath also where he saith luke who made mee a judg or divid over you and john i came not to judg the world but to save the world and yet our saviour came into thi world that hee might bee a king and a judg in the world to come for hee wa the messiah that is the christ that is the anoint priest and the soveraign prophet of god that is to sai he wa to have all the power that wa in mose the prophet in the high priest that succeed mose and in the king that succeed the priest and st john sai express chap ver the father judgeth no man but hath commit all judgment to the son and thi is not repugn to that other place i came not to judg the world for thi is spoken of the world present the other of the world to come as also where it is said that at the second come of christ mat yee that have follow me in the regener when the son of man shall sit in the throne of hi glori yee shall also sit on twelv throne judg the twelv tribe of israel the end of christ com wa to renew the coven of the kingdom of god and to perswad the elect to imbrac it which wa the second part of hi offic if then christ while hee wa on earth had no kingdom in thi world to what end wa hi first come it wa to restor unto god by a new coven the kingdom which be hi by the old coven had been cut off by the rebellion of the israelit in the elect of saul which to doe he wa to preach unto them that he wa the messiah that is the king promis to them by the prophet and to offer himself in sacrific for the sinn of them that should by faith submit themselv thereto and in case the nation gener should refus him to call to hi obedi such as should beleev in him amongst the gentil so that there ar two part of our saviour offic dure hi aboad upon the earth on to proclaim himself the christ and anoth by teach and by work of miracl to perswad and prepar men to live so as to be worthi of the immort beleev were to enjoi at such time as he should come in majesti to take possess of hi father kingdom and therefor it is that the time of hi preach is often by himself call the regener which is not properli a kingdom and therebi a warrant to deni obedi to the magistr that then were for hee command to obei those that sate then in mose chair and to pai tribut to caesar but on an earnest of the kingdom of god that wa to come to those to whom god had given the grace to be hi discipl and to beleev in him for which caus the godli ar said to bee alreadi in the kingdom of grace as natur in that heavenli kingdom the preach of christ not contrari to the then law of the jew nor of caesar hitherto therefor there is noth done or taught by christ that tendeth to the diminut of the civil right of the jew or of caesar for as touch the commonwealth which then wa amongst the jew both thei that bare rule amongst them that thei that were govern did all expect the messiah and kingdom of god which thei could not have done if their law had forbidden him when he came to manifest and declar himself see therefor he did noth but by preach and miracl go about to prove himself to be that messiah hee did therein noth against their law the kingdom hee claim wa to bee in anoth world he taught all men to obei in the mean time them that sate in mose seat he allow them to give caesar hi tribut and refus to take upon himself to be a judg how then could hi word or action bee sediti or tend to the overthrow of their then civil govern but god have determin hi sacrific for the reduct of hi elect to their former coven obedi for the mean wherebi he would bring the same to effect made us of their malic and ingratitud nor wa it contrari to the law of caesar for though pilat himself to gratifi the jew deliv him to be crucifi yet befor he did so he pronounc openli that he found no fault in him and put for titl of hi condemn not as the jew requir that he pretend to be king but simpli that hee wa king of the jew and notwithstand their clamour refus to alter it sai what i have written i have written the third part of hi offic wa to be king under hi father of the elect as for the third part of hi offic which wa to be king i have alreadi shewn that hi kingdom wa not to begin till the resurrect but then he shall be king not on as god in which sens he is king alreadi and ever shall be of all the earth in vertu of hi omnipot but also peculiarli of hi own elect by vertu of the pact thei make with him in their baptism and therefor it is that our saviour saith mat that hi apostl should sit upon twelv throne judg the twelv tribe of israel when the son of man shall sit in the throne of hi glori wherebi he signifi that he should reign then in hi human natur and mat the son of man shall come in the glori of hi father with hi angel and then he shall reward everi man accord to hi work the same we mai read mark and and more express for the time luke i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appoint to mee that you mai eat and drink at my tabl in my kingdom and sit on throne judg the twelv tribe of israel by which it is manifest that the kingdom of christ appoint to him by hi father is not to be befor the son of man shall come in glori and make hi apostl judg of the twelv tribe of israel but a man mai here ask see there is no marriag in the kingdom of heaven whether men shall then eat and drink what eat therefor is meant in thi place thi is expound by our saviour john where he saith labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlast life which the son of man shall give you so that by eat at christ tabl is meant the eat of the tree of life that is to sai the enjoi of immort in the kingdom of the son of man by which place and mani more it is evid that our saviour kingdom is to bee exercis by him in hi human natur christ author in the kingdom of god subordin to hi father again he is to be king then no otherwis than as subordin or vicereg of god the father as mose wa in the wilderness and as the high priest were befor the reign of saul and as the king were after it for it is on of the propheci concern christ that he should be like in offic to mose i will rais them up a prophet saith the lord deut from amongst their brethren like unto thee and will put my word into hi mouth and thi similitud with mose is also appar in the action of our saviour himself whilest he wa convers on earth for as mose chose twelv princ of the tribe to govern under him so did our saviour choos twelv apostl who shall sit on twelv throne and judg the twelv tribe of israel and as mose author seventi elder to receiv the spirit of god and to propheci to the peopl that is as i have said befor to speak unto them in the name of god so our saviour also ordain seventi discipl to preach hi kingdom and salvat to all nation and as when a complaint wa made to mose against those of the seventi that propheci in the camp of israel he justifi them in it as be subservi therein to hi govern so also our saviour when st john complain to him of a certain man that cast out devil in hi name justifi him therein sai luke forbid him not for hee that is not against us is on our part again our saviour resembl mose in the institut of sacrament both of admiss into the kingdom of god and of commemor of hi deliver of hi elect from their miser condit as the children of israel had for sacrament of their recept into the kingdom of god befor the time of mose the rite of circumcis which rite have been omit in the wilderness wa again restor as soon as thei came into the land of promis so also the jew befor the come of our saviour had a rite of baptiz that is of wash with water all those that be gentil embrac the god of israel thi rite st john the baptist us in the recept of all them that gave their name to the christ whom hee preach to bee alreadi come into the world and our saviour institut the same for a sacrament to be taken by all that beleev in him from what caus the rite of baptism first proceed is not express formal in the scriptur but it mai be probabl thought to be an imit of the law of mose concern leprousi wherein the leprou man wa command to be kept out of the camp of israel for a certain time after which time be judg by the priest to be clean hee wa admit into the camp after a solemn wash and thi mai therefor bee a type of the wash in baptism wherein such men as ar cleans of the leprousi of sin by faith ar receiv into the church with the solemn of baptism there is anoth conjectur drawn from the ceremoni of the gentil in a certain case that rare happen and that is when a man that wa thought dead chanc to recov other men made scrupl to convers with him as thei would doe to convers with a ghost unless hee were receiv again into the number of men by wash as children new born were wash from the uncleanness of their nativ which wa a kind of new birth thi ceremoni of the greek in the time that judaea wa under the dominion of alexand and the greek hi successor mai probabl enough have crept into the religion of the jew but see it is not like our saviour would counten a heathen rite it is most like it proceed from the legal ceremoni of wash after leprosi and for the other sacrament of eat the paschal lamb it is manifestli imit in the sacrament of the lord supper in which the break of the bread and the pour out of the wine do keep in memori our deliver from the miseri of sin by christ passion as the eat of the paschal lamb kept in memori the deliver of the jew out of the bondag of egypt see therefor the author of mose wa but subordin and hee but a lieuten to god it followeth that christ whose author as man wa to bee like that of mose wa no more but subordin to the author of hi father the same is more express signifi by that that hee teacheth us to prai our father let thy kingdom come and for thine is the kingdom the power and the glori and by that it is said that hee shall come in the glori of hi father and by that which st paul saith cor then commeth the end when hee shall have deliv up the kingdom to god even the father and by mani other most express place on and the same god is the person repres by mose and by christ our saviour therefor both in teach and reign representeth as mose did the person of god which god from that time forward but not befor is call the father and be still on and the same substanc is on person as repres by mose and anoth person as repres by hi sonn the christ for person be a rel to a represent it is consequ to plural of represent that there bee a plural of person though of on and the same substanc chapter xlii of power ecclesiastical for the understand of power ecclesiastical what and in whom it is we ar to distinguish the time from the ascens of our saviour into two part on befor the convers of king and men endu with soveraign civil power the other after their convers for it wa long after the ascens befor ani king or civil soveraign embrac and publiqu allow the teach of christian religion of the holi spirit that fel on the apostl and for the time between it is manifest that the power ecclesiastical wa in the apostl and after them in such as were by them ordain to preach the gospel and to convert men to christian and to direct them that were convert in the wai of salvat and after these the power wa deliv again to other by these ordain and thi wa done by imposit of hand upon such as were ordain by which wa signifi the give of the holi spirit or spirit of god to those whom thei ordain minist of god to advanc hi kingdom so that imposit of hand wa noth els but the seal of their commiss to preach christ and teach hi doctrin and the give of the holi ghost by that ceremoni of imposit of hand wa an imit of that which mose did for mose us the same ceremoni to hi minist joshua as wee read deuteronomi ver and joshua the son of nun wa full of the spirit of wisdom for mose had laid hi hand upon him our saviour therefor between hi resurrect and ascens gave hi spirit to the apostl first by breath on them and sai john receiv yee the holi spirit and after hi ascens act by send down upon them a mighti wind and cloven tongu of fire and not by imposit of hand as neither did god lai hi hand on mose and hi apostl afterward transmit the same spirit by imposit of hand as mose did to joshua so that it is manifest herebi in whom the power ecclesiastical continu remain in those first time where there wa not ani christian commonwealth name in them that receiv the same from the apostl by success lai on of hand of the triniti here wee have the person of god born now the third time for as mose and the high priest were god repres in the old testament and our saviour himself as man dure hi abod on earth so the holi ghost that is to sai the apostl and their successor in the offic of preach and teach that had receiv the holi spirit have repres him ever sinc but a person as i have shewn befor chapt is he that is repres as often as hee is repres and therefor god who ha been repres that is person thrice mai properli enough be said to be three person though neither the word person nor triniti be ascrib to him in the bibl st john inde epist saith there be three that bear witness in heaven the father the word and the holi spirit and these three ar on but thi disagreeth not but accordeth fitli with three person in the proper signif of person which is that which is repres by anoth for so god the father as repres by mose is on person and as repres by hi sonn anoth person and as repres by the apostl and by the doctor that taught by author from them deriv is a third person and yet everi person here is the person of on and the same god but a man mai here ask what it wa whereof these three bare witness st john therefor tell us vers that thei bear witness that god hath given us eternal life in hi son again if it should be ask wherein that testimoni appeareth the answer is easi for he hath testifi the same by the miracl he wrought first by mose secondli by hi son himself and lastli by hi apostl that had receiv the holi spirit all which in their time repres the person of god and either propheci or preach jesu christ and as for the apostl it wa the charact of the apostleship in the twelv first and great apostl to bear witness of hi resurrect as appeareth express act ver where st peter when a new apostl wa to be chosen in the place of juda iscariot useth these word of these men which have compani with us all the time that the lord jesu went in and out amongst us begin at the baptism of john unto that same dai that hee wa taken up from us must on bee ordain to be a witness with us of hi resurrect which word interpret the bear of witness mention by st john there is in the same place mention anoth triniti of wit in earth for ver he saith there ar three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the bloud and these three agre in on that is to sai the grace of god spirit and the two sacrament baptism and the lord supper which all agre in on testimoni to assur the conscienc of beleev of eternal life of which testimoni he saith vers he that beleeveth on the son of man hath the witness in himself in thi triniti on earth the uniti is not of the thing for the spirit the water and the bloud ar not the same substanc though thei give the same testimoni but in the triniti of heaven the person ar the person of on and the same god though repres in three differ time and occas to conclud the doctrin of the triniti as far as can be gather directli from the scriptur is in substanc thi that god who is alwai on and the same wa the person repres by mose the person repres by hi son incarn and the person repres by the apostl as repres by the apostl the holi spirit by which thei spake is god as repres by hi son that wa god and man the son is that god as repres by mose and the high priest the father that is to sai the father of our lord jesu christ is that god from whenc we mai gather the reason why those name father son and holi spirit in the signif of the godhead ar never us in the old testament for thei ar person that is thei have their name from repres which could not be till diver men had repres god person in rule or in direct under him thu wee see how the power ecclesiastical wa left by our saviour to the apostl and how thei were to the end thei might the better exercis that power endu with the holi spirit which is therefor call sometim in the new testament paracletu which signifieth an assist or on call to for help though it bee commonli translat a comfort let us now consid the power it self what it wa and over whom the power ecclesiastical is but the power to teach cardinal bellarmin in hi third general controversi hath handl a great mani question concern the ecclesiastical power of the pope of rome and begin with thi whether it ought to be monarchical aristocratical or democratical all which sort of power ar soveraign and coerciv if now it should appear that there is no coerciv power left them by our saviour but on a power to proclaim the kingdom of christ and to perswad men to submit themselv thereunto and by precept and good counsel to teach them that have submit what thei ar to do that thei mai be receiv into the kingdom of god when it come and that the apostl and other minist of the gospel ar our schoolemast and not our command and their precept not law but wholesom counsel then were all that disput in vain an argument thereof the power of christ himself i have shewn alreadi in the last chapter that the kingdom of christ is not of thi world therefor neither can hi minist unless thei be king requir obedi in hi name for if the suprem king have not hi regal power in thi world by what author can obedi be requir to hi offic as my father sent me so saith our saviour i send you but our saviour wa sent to perswad the jew to return to and to invit the gentil to receiv the kingdom of hi father and not to reign in majesti no not as hi father lieuten till the dai of judgment from the name of regener the time between the ascens and the general resurrect is call not a reign but a regener that is a prepar of men for the second and gloriou come of christ at the dai of judgment as appeareth by the word of our saviour mat you that have follow me in the regener when the son of man shall sit in the throne of hi glori you shall also sit upon twelv throne and of st paul eph have your feet shod with the prepar of the gospel of peac from the comparison of it with fish leaven seed and is compar by our saviour to fish that is to win men to obedi not by coercion and punish but by perswas and therefor he said not to hi apostl hee would make them so mani nimrod hunter of men but fisher of men it is compar also to leaven to sow of seed and to the multipl of a grain of mustardse by all which compuls is exclud and consequ there can in that time be no actual reign the work of christ minist is evangel that is a proclam of christ and a prepar for hi second com as the evangel of john baptist wa a prepar to hi first come from the natur of faith again the offic of christ minist in thi world is to make men beleev and have faith in christ but faith hath no relat to nor depend at all upon compuls or command but on upon certainti or probabl of argument drawn from reason or from someth men beleev alreadi therefor the minist of christ in thi world have no power by that titl to punish ani man for not beleev or for contradict what thei sai thei have i sai no power by that titl of christ minist to punish such but if thei have soveraign civil power by politick institut then thei mai inde lawfulli punish ani contradict to their law whatsoev and st paul of himself and other then preacher of the gospel saith in express word cor wee have no dominion over your faith but ar helper of your joi from the author christ hath left to civil princ anoth argument that the minist of christ in thi present world have no right of command mai be drawn from the lawful author which christ hath left to all princ as well christian as infidel st paul saith col children obei your parent in all thing for thi is well pleas to the lord and ver servant obei in all thing your master accord to the flesh not with eyeservic as menpleas but in singleness of heart as fear the lord thi is spoken to them whose master were infidel and yet thei ar bidden to obei them in all thing and again concern obedi to princ rom the first vers exhort to be subject to the higher power he saith that all power is ordain of god and that we ought to be subject to them not on for fear of incur their wrath but also for conscienc sake and st peter epist chap e ver submit your selv to everi ordin of man for the lord sake whether it bee to the king as suprem or unto governour as to them that be sent by him for the punish of evil doer and for the prais of them that doe well for so is the will of god and again st paul tit put men in mind to be subject to princip and power and to obei magistr these princ and power whereof st peter and st paul here speak were all infidel much more therefor we ar to obei those christian whom god hath ordain to have soveraign power over us how then can wee be oblig to doe ani thing contrari to the command of the king or other soveraign represent of the commonwealth whereof we ar member and by whom we look to be protect it is therefor manifest that christ hath not left to hi minist in thi world unless thei be also endu with civil author ani author to command other men what christian mai do to avoid persecut but what mai some object if a king or a senat or other soveraign person forbid us to beleev in christ to thi i answer that such forbid is of no effect becaus beleef and unbeleef never follow men command faith is a gift of god which man can neither give nor take awai by promis of reward or menac of tortur and if it be further ask what if wee bee command by our lawful princ to sai with our tongu wee beleev not must we obei such command profess with the tongu is but an external thing and no more then ani other gestur wherebi we signifi our obedi and wherein a christian hold firm in hi heart the faith of christ hath the same liberti which the prophet elisha allow to naaman the syrian naaman wa convert in hi heart to the god of israel for hee saith king thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offer nor sacrific unto other god but unto the lord in thi thing the lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the hous of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and i bow my self in the hous of rimmon when i bow my self in the hous of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in thi thing thi the prophet approv and bid him goe in peac here naaman beleev in hi heart but by bow befor the idol rimmon he deni the true god in effect as much as if he had done it with hi lip but then what shall we answer to our saviour sai whosoev denyeth me befor men i will deni him befor my father which is in heaven thi we mai sai that whatsoev a subject as naaman wa is compel to in obedi to hi soveraign and doth it not in order to hi own mind but in order to the law of hi countri that action is not hi but hi soveraign nor is it he that in thi case denyeth christ befor men but hi governour and the law of hi countrei if ani man shall accus thi doctrin as repugn to true and unfeign christian i ask him in case there should be a subject in ani christian commonwealth that should be inwardli in hi heart of the mahometan religion whether if hi soveraign command him to bee present at the divin servic of the christian church and that on pain of death he think that mamometan oblig in conscienc to suffer death for that caus rather than to obei that command of hi law princ if he sai he ought rather to suffer death then he authorizeth all privat men to disobei their princ in mainten of their religion true or fals if he sai he ought to bee obedi then he alloweth to himself that which hee denyeth to anoth contrari to the word of our saviour whatsoev you would that men should doe unto you that doe yee unto them and contrari to the law of natur which is the indubit everlast law of god do not to anoth that which thou wouldest not he should doe unto thee of martyr but what then shall we sai of all those martyr we read of in the histori of the church that thei have needless cast awai their live for answer hereunto we ar to distinguish the person that have been for that caus put to death whereof some have receiv a call to preach and profess the kingdom of christ openli other have had no such call nor more ha been requir of them than their own faith the former sort if thei have been put to death for bear witness to thi point that jesu christ is risen from the dead were true martyr for a martyr is to give the true definit of the word a witness of the resurrect of jesu the messiah which none can be but those that convers with him on earth and saw him after he wa risen for a witness must have seen what he testifieth or els hi testimoni is not good and that none but such can properli be call martyr of christ is manifest out of the word of st peter act wherefor of these men which have compani with us all the time that the lord jesu went in and out amongst us begin from the baptism of john unto that same dai hee wa taken up from us must on be ordain to be a martyr that is a witness with us of hi resurrect where we mai observ that he which is to bee a witness of the truth of the resurrect of christ that is to sai of the truth of thi fundamental articl of christian religion that jesu wa the christ must be some discipl that convers with him and saw him befor and after hi resurrect and consequ must be on of hi original discipl wherea thei which were not so can witness no more but that their antecessor said it and ar therefor but wit of other men testimoni and ar but second martyr or martyr of christ wit he that to maintain everi doctrin which he himself draweth out of the histori of our saviour life and of the act or epistl of the apostl or which he beleeveth upon the author of a privat man wil oppos the law and author of the civil state is veri far from be a martyr of christ or a martyr of hi martyr ti on articl on which to die for meriteth so honor a name and that articl is thi that jesu is the christ that is to sai he that hath redeem us and shall come again to give us salvat and eternal life in hi gloriou kingdom to die for everi tenet that serveth the ambit or profit of the clergi is not requir nor is it the death of the witness but the testimoni it self that make the martyr for the word signifieth noth els but the man that beareth witness whether he be put to death for hi testimoni or not also he that is not sent to preach thi fundamental articl but taketh it upon him of hi privat author though he be a witness and consequ a martyr either primari of christ or secondari of hi apostl discipl or their successor yet is he not oblig to suffer death for that caus becaus be not call thereto ti not requir at hi hand nor ought hee to complain if he loseth the reward he expecteth from those that never set him on work none therefor can be a martyr neither of the first nor second degre that have not a warrant to preach christ come in the flesh that is to sai none but such as ar sent to the convers of infidel for no man is a witness to him that alreadi beleeveth and therefor need no witness but to them that deni or doubt or have not heard it christ sent hi apostl and hi seventi discipl with author to preach he sent not all that beleev and he sent them to unbeleev i send you saith he as sheep amongst wolv not as sheep to other sheep argument from the point of their commiss lastli the point of their commiss as thei ar express set down in the gospel contain none of them ani author over the congreg to preach we have first mat that the twelv apostl were sent to the lost sheep of the hous of israel and command to preach that the kingdom of god wa at hand now preach in the original is that act which a crier herald or other offic useth to doe publiqu in proclaim of a king but a crier hath not right to command ani man and luke the seventi discipl ar sent out as labour not as lord of the harvest and ar bidden vers to sai the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you and by kingdom here is meant not the kingdom of grace but the kingdom of glori for thei ar bidden to denounc it ver to those citi which shall not receiv them as a threatn that it shall be more toler in that dai for sodom than for such a citi and mat our saviour telleth hi discipl that sought prioriti of place their offic wa to minist even as the son of man came not to be ministr unto but to minist preacher therefor have not magisterial but ministerial power bee not call master saith our saviour mat for on is your master even christ and teach anoth point of their commiss is to teach all nation as it is in mat or as in st mark goe into all the world and preach the gospel to everi creatur teach therefor and preach is the same thing for thei that proclaim the com of a king must withal make known by what right he commeth if thei mean men shall submit themselv unto him as st paul did to the jew of thessalonica when three sabbath dai he reason with them out of the scriptur open and alledg that christ must need have suffer and risen again from the dead and that thi jesu is christ but to teach out of the old testament that jesu wa christ that is to sai king and risen from the dead is not to sai that men ar bound after thei beleev it to obei those that tell them so against the law and command of their soveraign but that thei shall doe wise to expect the come of christ hereaft in patienc and faith with obedi to their present magistr to baptiz anoth point of their commiss is to baptiz in the name of the father and of the son and of the holi ghost what is baptism dip into water but what is it to dip a man into the water in the name of ani thing the mean of these word of baptism is thi he that is baptiz is dip or wash as a sign of becom a new man and a loyal subject to that god whose person wa repres in old time by mose and the high priest when he reign over the jew and to jesu christ hi sonn god and man that hath redeem us and shall in hi human natur repres hi father person in hi eternal kingdom after the resurrect and to acknowledg the doctrin of the apostl who assist by the spirit of the father and of the son were left for guid to bring us into that kingdom to be the on and assur wai thereunto thi be our promis in baptism and the author of earthli soveraign be not to be put down till the dai of judgment for that is express affirm by s paul cor where he saith as in adam all die so in christ all shall be made aliv but everi man in hi own order christ the first fruit afterward thei that ar christ at hi com then commeth the end when he shall have deliv up the kingdom of god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all author and power it is manifest that we do not in baptism constitut over us anoth author by which our external action ar to be govern in thi life but promis to take the doctrin of the apostl for our direct in the wai to life eternal and to forgiv and retain sinn the power of remiss and retent of sinn call also the power of loos and bind and sometim the key of the kingdom of heaven is a consequ of the author to baptiz or refus to baptiz for baptism is the sacrament of alleg of them that ar to be receiv into the kingdom of god that is to sai into eternal life that is to sai to remiss of sin for as eternal life wa lost by the commit so it is recov by the remit of men sin the end of baptism is remiss of sin and therefor st peter when thei that were convert by hi sermon on the dai of pentecost ask what thei were to doe advis them to repent and be baptiz in the name of jesu for the remiss of sin and therefor see to baptiz is to declar the recept of men into god kingdom and to refus to baptiz is to declar their exclus it followeth that the power to declar them cast out or retain in it wa given to the same apostl and their substitut and successor and therefor after our saviour had breath upon them sai john receiv the holi ghost hee addeth in the next vers whose soever sin ye remit thei ar remit unto them and whose soever sin ye retain thei ar retain by which word is not grant an author to forgiv or retain sin simpli and absolut as god forgiveth or retaineth them who knoweth the heart of man and truth of hi penit and convers but condition to the penit and thi forgiveness or absolut in case the absolv have but a feign repent is therebi without other act or sentenc of the absolv made void and hath no effect at all to salvat but on the contrari to the aggrav of hi sin therefor the apostl and their successor ar to follow but the outward mark of repent which appear thei have no author to deni absolut and if thei appear not thei have no author to absolv the same also is to be observ in baptism for to a convert jew or gentil the apostl had not the power to deni baptism nor to grant it to the unpenit but see no man is abl to discern the truth of anoth man repent further than by external mark taken from hi word and action which ar subject to hypocrisi anoth question will aris who it is that is constitut judg of those mark and thi question is decid by our saviour himself mat if thy brother saith he shall trespass against thee go and tell him hi fault between thee and him alon if he shall hear thee thou hast gain thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee on or two more and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican by which it is manifest that the judgment concern the truth of repent belong not to ani on man but to the church that is to the assembl of the faithful or to them that have author to bee their represent but besid the judgment there is necessari also the pronounc of sentenc and thi belong alwai to the apostl or some pastor of the church as prolocutor and of thi our saviour speaketh in the vers whatsoev ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoev ye shall loos on earth shall be loos in heaven and comform hereunto wa the practis of st paul cor where he saith for i verili as absent in bodi but present in spirit have determin alreadi as though i were present concern him that hath so done thi deed in the name of our lord jesu christ when ye ar gather togeth and my spirit with the power of our lord jesu christ to deliv such a on to satan that is to sai to cast him out of the church as a man whose sin ar not forgiven paul here pronounceth the sentenc but the assembl wa first to hear the caus for st paul wa absent and by consequ to condemn him but in the same chapter ver the judgment in such a case is more express attribut to the assembl but now i have written unto you not to keep compani if ani man that is call a brother be a fornic c with such a on no not to eat for what have i to do to judg them that ar without do not ye judg them that ar within the sentenc therefor by which a man wa put out of the church wa pronounc by the apostl or pastor but the judgment concern the merit of the caus wa in the church that is to sai as the time were befor the convers of king and men that had soveraign author in the commonwealth the assembl of the christian dwell in the same citi as in corinth in the assembl of the christian of corinth of excommun thi part of the power of the key by which men were thrust out from the kingdom of god is that which is call excommun and to excommun is in the original aposunagogon poiein to cast out of the synagogu that is out of the place of divin servic a word drawn from the custom of the jew to cast out of their synagogu such as thei thought in manner or doctrin contagi as leper were by the law of mose separ from the congreg of israel till such time as thei should be by the priest pronounc clean the us of excommun without civil power the us and effect of excommun whilest it wa not yet strengthen with the civil power wa no more than that thei who were not excommun were to avoid the compani of them that were it wa not enough to reput them as heathen that never had been christian for with such thei might eat and drink which with excommun person thei might not do as appeareth by the word of st paul cor ver c where he telleth them he had formerli forbidden them to compani with fornic but becaus that could not bee without go out of the world he restraineth it to such fornic and otherwis viciou person as were of the brethren with such a on he saith thei ought not to keep compani no not to eat and thi is no more than our saviour saith mat let him be to thee as a heathen and as a publican for publican which signifieth farmer and receiv of the revenu of the commonwealth were so hate and detest by the jew that were to pai for it as that publican and sinner were taken amongst them for the same thing insomuch as when our saviour accept the invit of zacchaeu a publican though it were to convert him yet it wa object to him as a crime and therefor when our saviour to heathen ad publican he did forbid them to eat with a man excommun as for keep them out of their synagogu or place of assembl thei had no power to do it but that of the owner of the place whether he were christian or heathen and becaus all place ar by right in the dominion of the commonwealth as well hee that wa excommun as hee that never wa baptiz might enter into them by commiss from the civil magistr as paul befor hi convers entr into their synagogu at damascu act to apprehend christian men and women and to carri them bound to jerusalem by commiss from the high priest of no effect upon an apost by which it appear that upon a christian that should becom an apost in a place where the civil power did persecut or not assist the church the effect of excommun had noth in it neither of dammag in thi world nor of terrour not of terrour becaus of their unbeleef nor of dammag becaus thei return therebi into the favour of the world and in the world to come were to be in no wors estat then thei which never had beleev the dammag redound rather to the church by provoc of them thei cast out to a freer execut of their malic but upon the faithful onli excommun therefor had it effect on upon those that beleev that jesu christ wa to come again in glori to reign over and to judg both the quick and the dead and should therefor refus entranc into hi kingdom to those whose sin were retain that is to those that were excommun by the church and thenc it is that st paul calleth excommun a deliveri of the excommun person to satan for without the kingdom of christ all other kingdom after judgment ar comprehend in the kingdom of satan thi is it that the faithful stood in fear of as long as thei stood excommun that is to sai in an estat wherein their sin were not forgiven wherebi wee mai understand that excommun in the time that christian religion wa not author by the civil power wa us on for a correct of manner not of errour in opinion for it is a punish whereof none could be sensibl but such as beleev and expect the come again of our saviour to judg the world and thei who so beleev need no other opinion but on uprightness of life to be save for what fault lyeth excommun there lyeth excommun for injustic as mat if thy brother offend thee tell it him privat then with wit lastli tell the church and then if he obei not let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican and there lyeth excommun for a scandal life as cor if ani man that is call a brother be a fornic or covet or an idolat or a drunkard or an extortion with such a on yee ar not to eat but to excommun a man that held thi foundat that jesu wa the christ for differ of opinion in other point by which that foundat wa not destroi there appeareth no author in the scriptur nor exampl in the apostl there is inde in st paul titu a text that seemeth to be to the contrari a man that is an haeretiqu after the first and second admonit reject for an haeretiqu is he that be a member of the church teacheth nevertheless some privat opinion which the church ha forbidden and such a on s paul adviseth titu after the first and second admonit to reject but to reject in thi place is not to excommun the man but to give over admonish him to let him alon to set by disput with him as on that is to be convinc on by himself the same apostl saith tim foolish and unlearn question avoid the word avoid in thi place and reject in the former is the same in the original parait but foolish question mai bee set by without excommun and again tit avoid foolish question where the original periistaso set them by is equival to the former word reject there is no other place that can so much as colour be drawn to counten the cast out of the church faithful men such as beleev the foundat on for a singular superstructur of their own proceed perhap from a good piou conscienc but on the contrari all such place as command avoid such disput ar written for a lesson to pastor such as timothi and titu were not to make new articl of faith by determin everi small controversi which oblig men to a needless burthen of conscienc or provok them to break the union of the church which lesson the apostl themselv observ well s peter and s paul though their controversi were great as we mai read in gal yet thei did not cast on anoth out of the church nevertheless dure the apostl time there were other pastor that observ it not as diotreph john c who cast out of the church such as s john himself thought fit to be receiv into it out of a pride he took in praeemin so earli it wa that vainglori and ambit had found entranc into the church of christ of person liabl to excommun that a man be liabl to excommun there be mani condit requisit as first that he be a member of some commonalti that is to sai of some lawful assembl that is to sai of some christian church that hath power to judg of the caus for which hee is to bee excommun for where there is no commun there can bee no excommun nor where there is no power to judg can there bee ani power to give sentenc from henc it followeth that on church cannot be excommun by anoth for either thei have equal power to excommun each other in which case excommun is not disciplin nor an act of author but schism and dissolut of chariti or on is so subordin to the other as that thei both have but on voic and then thei be but on church and the part excommun is no more a church but a dissolut number of individual person and becaus the sentenc of excommun importeth an advic not to keep compani nor so much as to eat with him that is excommun if a soveraign princ or assembl bee excommun the sentenc is of no effect for all subject ar bound to be in the compani and presenc of their own soveraign when he requireth it by the law of natur nor can thei lawfulli either expel him from ani place of hi own dominion whether profan or holi nor go out of hi dominion without hi leav much less if he call them to that honour refus to eat with him and as to other princ and state becaus thei ar not part of on and the same congreg thei need not ani other sentenc to keep them from keep compani with the state excommun for the veri institut as it uniteth mani men into on commun so it dissociateth on commun from anoth so that excommun is not needful for keep king and state asund nor ha ani further effect then is in the natur of polici it self unless it be to instig princ to warr upon on anoth nor is the excommun of a christian subject that obeyeth the law of hi own soveraign whether christian or heathen of ani effect for if he beleev that jesu is the christ he hath the spirit of god joh and god dwelleth in him and he in god joh but hee that hath the spirit of god hee that dwelleth in god hee in whom god dwelleth can receiv no harm by the excommun of men therefor he that beleeveth jesu to be the christ is free from all the danger threatn to person excommun he that beleeveth it not is no christian therefor a true and unfeign christian is not liabl to excommun nor he also that is a profess christian till hi hypocrisi appear in hi manner that is till hi behaviour bee contrari to the law of hi soveraign which is the rule of manner and which christ and hi apostl have command us to be subject to for the church cannot judg of manner but by external action which action can never bee unlawful but when thei ar against the law of the commonwealth if a man father or mother or master bee excommun yet ar not the children forbidden to keep them compani nor to eat with them for that were for the most part to oblig them not to eat at all for want of mean to get food and to authoris them to disobei their parent and master contrari to the precept of the apostl in summ the power of excommun cannot be extend further than to the end for which the apostl and pastor of the church have their commiss from our saviour which is not to rule by command and coaction but by teach and direct of men in the wai of salvat in the world to come and as a master in ani scienc mai abandon hi scholar when hee obstin neglecteth the practis of hi rule but not accus him of injustic becaus he wa never bound to obei him so a teacher of christian doctrin mai abandon hi discipl that obstin continu in an unchristian life but he cannot sai thei doe him wrong becaus thei ar not oblig to obei him for to a teacher that shall so complain mai be appli the answer of god to samuel in the like place sam thei have not reject thee but mee excommun therefor when it wanteth the assist of the civil power as it doth when a christian state or princ is excommun by a forain author is without effect and consequ ought to be without terrour the name of fulmen excommunicationi that is the thunderbolt of excommun proceed from an imagin of the bishop of rome which first us it that he wa king of king as the heathen made jupit king of the god and assign him in their poem and pictur a thunderbolt wherewith to subdu and punish the giant that should dare to deni hi power which imagin wa ground on two errour on that the kingdom of christ is of thi world contrari to our saviour own word my kingdom is not of thi world the other that hee is christ vicar not on over hi own subject but over all the christian of the world whereof there is no ground in scriptur and the contrari shall bee prove in it due place of the interpret of the scriptur befor civil soveraign becam christian st paul come to thessalonica where wa a synagogu of the jew act as hi manner wa went in unto them and three sabbath day reason with them out of the scriptur open and alledg that christ must need have suffer and risen again from the dead and that thi jesu whom he preach wa the christ the scriptur here mention were the scriptur of the jew that is the old testament the men to whom he wa to prove that jesu wa the christ and risen again from the dead were also jew and did beleev alreadi that thei were the word of god hereupon as it is vers some of them beleev and as it is in the ver some beleev not what wa the reason when thei all beleev the scriptur that thei did not all beleev alik but that some approv other disapprov the interpret of st paul that cite them and everi on interpret them to himself it wa thi s paul came to them without ani legal commiss and in the manner of on that would not command but perswad which he must need do either by miracl as mose did to the israelit in egypt that thei might see hi author in god work or by reason from the alreadi receiv scriptur that thei might see the truth of hi doctrin in god word but whosoev perswadeth by reason from principl written maketh him to whom hee speaketh judg both of the mean of those principl and also of the forc of hi infer upon them if these jew of thessalonica were not who els wa the judg of what s paul alledg out of scriptur if s paul what need he to quot ani place to prove hi doctrin it had been enough to have said i find it so in scriptur that is to sai in your law of which i am interpret as sent by christ the interpret therefor of the scriptur to whose interpret the jew of thessalonica were bound to stand could be none everi on might beleev or not beleev accord as the alleg seem to himself to be agreeabl or not agreeabl to the mean of the place alledg and gener in all case of the world hee that pretendeth ani proof maketh judg of hi proof him to whom he addresseth hi speech and as to the case of the jew in particular thei were bound by express word deut to receiv the determin of all hard question from the priest and judg of israel for the time be but thi is to bee understood of the jew that were yet unconvert for the convers of the gentil there wa no us of alledg the scriptur which thei beleev not the apostl therefor labour by reason to confut their idolatri and that done to perswad them to the faith of christ by their testimoni of hi life and resurrect so that there could not yet bee ani controversi concern the author to interpret scriptur see no man wa oblig dure hi infidel to follow ani man interpret of ani scriptur except hi soveraign interpret of the law of hi countrei let us now consid the convers it self and see what there wa therein that could be caus of such an oblig men were convert to no other thing then to the beleef of that which the apostl preach and the apostl preach noth but that jesu wa the christ that is to sai the king that wa to save them and reign over them etern in the world to come and consequ that hee wa not dead but risen again from the dead and gone up into heaven and should come again on dai to judg the world which also should rise again to be judg and reward everi man accord to hi work none of them preach that himself or ani other apostl wa such an interpret of the scriptur as all that becam christian ought to take their interpret for law for to interpret the law is part of the administr of a present kingdom which the apostl had not thei prai then and all other pastor ever sinc let thy kingdom come and exhort their convert to obei their then ethniqu princ the new testament wa not yet publish in on bodi everi of the evangelist wa interpret of hi own gospel and everi apostl of hi own epistl and of the old testament our saviour himself saith to the jew john search the scriptur for in them yee think to have eternal life and thei ar thei that testifi of me if hee had not meant thei should interpret them hee would not have bidden them take thenc the proof of hi be the christ he would either have interpret them himself or refer them to the interpret of the priest when a difficulti aros the apostl and elder of the church assembl themselv togeth and determin what should bee preach and taught and how thei should interpret the scriptur to the peopl but took not from the peopl the liberti to read and interpret them to themselv the apostl sent diver letter to the church and other write for their instruct which had been in vain if thei had not allow them to interpret that is to consid the mean of them and as it wa in the apostl time it must be till such time as there should be pastor that could authoris an interpret whose interpret should gener be stood to but that could not be till king were pastor or pastor king of the power to make scriptur law there be two sens wherein a write mai be said to be canonical for canon signifieth a rule and a rule is a precept by which a man is guid and direct in ani action whatsoev such precept though given by a teacher to hi discipl or a counsellor to hi friend without power to compel him to observ them ar nevertheless canon becaus thei ar rule but when thei ar given by on whom he that receiveth them is bound to obei then ar those canon not on rule but law the question therefor here is of the power to make the scriptur which ar the rule of christian faith law of the ten command that part of the scriptur which wa first law wa the ten command written in two tabl of stone and deliv by god himself to mose and by mose made known to the peopl befor that time there wa no written law of god who as yet have not chosen ani peopl to bee hi peculiar kingdom had given no law to men but the law of natur that is to sai the precept of natural reason written in everi man own heart of these two tabl the first containeth the law of soveraignti that thei should not obei nor honour the god of other nation in these word non habebi deo alieno coram me that is thou shalt not have for god the god that other nation worship but on me wherebi thei were forbidden to obei or honor as their king and governour ani other god than him that spake unto them then by mose and afterward by the high priest that thei should not make ani imag to repres him that is to sai thei were not to choos to themselv neither in heaven nor in earth ani repres of their own fanci but obei mose and aaron whom he had appoint to that offic that thei should not take the name of god in vain that is thei should not speak rashli of their king nor disput hi right nor the commiss of mose and aaron hi lieuten that thei should everi seventh dai abstain from their ordinari labour and emploi that time in do him publiqu honor the second tabl containeth the duti of on man toward anoth as to honor parent not to kill not to commit adulteri not to steal not to corrupt judgment by fals witness and final not so much as to design in their heart the do of ani injuri on to anoth the question now is who it wa that gave to these written tabl the obligatori forc of law there is no doubt but that thei were made law by god himself but becaus a law oblig not nor is law to ani but to them that acknowledg it to be the act of the soveraign how could the peopl of israel that were forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what god said to mose be oblig to obedi to all those law which mose propound to them some of them were inde the law of natur as all the second tabl and therefor to be acknowledg for god law not to the israelit alon but to all peopl but of those that were peculiar to the israelit as those of the first tabl the question remain save that thei had oblig themselv present after the propound of them to obei mose in these word exod speak them thou to us and we will hear thee but let not god speak to us lest we die it wa therefor on mose then and after him the high priest whom by mose god declar should administ thi hi peculiar kingdom that had on earth the power to make thi short scriptur of the decalogu to bee law in the commonwealth of israel but mose and aaron and the succeed high priest were the civil soveraign therefor hitherto the canon or make of the scriptur law belong to the civil soveraign of the judici and levitical law the judicial law that is to sai the law that god prescrib to the magistr of israel for the rule of their administr of justic and of the sentenc or judgment thei should pronounc in plea between man and man and the levitical law that is to sai the rule that god prescrib touch the rite and ceremoni of the priest and levit were all deliv to them by mose on and therefor also becam law by vertu of the same promis of obedi to mose whether these law were then written or not written but dictat to the peopl by mose after hi forti day be with god in the mount by word of mouth is not express in the text but thei were all posit law and equival to holi scriptur and made canonical by mose the civil soveraign the second law after the israelit were come into the plain of moab over against jericho and readi to enter into the land of promis mose to the former law ad diver other which therefor ar call deuteronomi that is second law and ar as it is written deut the word of a coven which the lord command mose to make with the children of israel besid the coven which he made with them in horeb for have explain those former law in the begin of the book of deuteronomi he addeth other that begin at the cha and continu to the end of the of the same book thi law deut thei were command to write upon great stone playster over at their pass over jordan thi law also wa written by mose himself in a book and deliv into the hand of the priest and to the elder of israel deut and command ve to be put in the side of the ark for in the ark it self wa noth but the ten command thi wa the law which mose deuteronomi command the king of israel should keep a copi of and thi is the law which have been long time lost wa found again in the templ in the time of josiah and by hi author receiv for the law of god but both mose at the write and josiah at the recoveri thereof had both of them the civil soveraignti hitherto therefor the power of make scriptur canonical wa in the civil soveraign besid thi book of the law there wa no other book from the time of mose till after the captiv receiv amongst the jew for the law of god for the prophet except a few live in the time of the captiv it self and the rest live but a littl befor it and were so far from have their propheci gener receiv for law as that their person were persecut partli by fals prophet and partli by the king which were seduc by them and thi book it self which wa confirm by josiah for the law of god and with it all the histori of the work of god wa lost in the captiv and sack of the citi of jerusalem as appear by that of esdra thy law is burnt therefor no man knoweth the thing that ar done of thee of the work that shall begin and befor the captiv between the time when the law wa lost which is not mention in the scriptur but mai probabl be thought to be the time of rehoboam when shishak king of egypt took the spoil of the templ king and the time of josiah when it wa found again thei had no written word of god but rule accord to their own discret or by the direct of such as each of them esteem prophet the old testament when made canonical from whenc we mai inferr that the scriptur of the old testament which we have at thi dai were not canonical nor a law unto the jew till the renov of their coven with god at their return from the captiv and restaur of their commonwealth under esdra but from that time forward thei were account the law of the jew and for such translat into greek by seventi elder of judaea and put into the librari of ptolemi at alexandria and approv for the word of god now see esdra wa the high priest and the high priest wa their civil soveraign it is manifest that the scriptur were never made law but by the soveraign civil power the new testament began to be canonical under christian soveraign by the write of the father that live in the time befor that christian religion wa receiv and authoris by constantin the emperour we mai find that the book wee now have of the new testament were held by the christian of that time except a few in respect of whose pauciti the rest were call the catholiqu church and other haeretiqu for the dictat of the holi ghost and consequ for the canon or rule of faith such wa the rever and opinion thei had of their teacher as gener the rever that the discipl bear to their first master in all manner of doctrin thei receiv from them is not small therefor there is no doubt but when s paul wrote to the church he had convert or ani other apostl or discipl of christ to those which had then embrac christ thei receiv those their write for the true christian doctrin but in that time when not the power and author of the teacher but the faith of the hearer caus them to receiv it it wa not the apostl that made their own write canonical but everi convert made them so to himself but the question here is not what ani christian made a law or canon to himself which he might again reject by the same right he receiv it but what wa so made a canon to them as without injustic thei could not doe ani thing contrari thereunto that the new testament should in thi sens be canonical that is to sai a law in ani place where the law of the commonwealth had not made it so is contrari to the natur of a law for a law as hath been alreadi shewn is the command of that man or assembl to whom we have given soveraign author to make such rule for the direct of our action as hee shall think fit and to punish us when we doe ani thing contrari to the same when therefor ani other man shall offer unto us ani other rule which the soveraign ruler hath not prescrib thei ar but counsel and advic which whether good or bad hee that is counsel mai without injustic refus to observ and when contrari to the law alreadi establish without injustic cannot observ how good soever he conceiveth it to be i sai he cannot in thi case observ the same in hi action nor in hi discours with other men though he mai without blame beleev the hi privat teacher and wish he had the liberti to practis their advic and that it were publiqu receiv for law for internal faith is in it own natur invis and consequ exempt from all human jurisdict wherea the word and action that proce from it as breach of our civil obedi ar injustic both befor god and man see then our saviour hath deni hi kingdom to be in thi world see he hath said he came not to judg but to save the world he hath not subject us to other law than those of the commonwealth that is the jew to the law of mose which he saith mat he came not to destroi but to fulfil and other nation to the law of their several soveraign and all men to the law of natur the observ whereof both he himself and hi apostl have in their teach recommend to us as a necessari condit of be admit by him in the last dai into hi eternal kingdom wherein shall be protect and life everlast see then our saviour and hi apostl left not new law to oblig us in thi world but new doctrin to prepar us for the next the book of the new testament which contain that doctrin until obedi to them wa command by them that god hath given power to on earth to be legisl were not obligatori canon that is law but on good and safe advic for the direct of sinner in the wai to salvat which everi man might take and refus at hi own peril without injustic again our saviour christ commiss to hi apostl and discipl wa to proclaim hi kingdom not present but to come and to teach all nation and to baptiz them that should beleev and to enter into the hous of them that should receiv them and where thei were not receiv to shake off the dust of their feet against them but not to call for fire from heaven to destroi them nor to compel them to obedi by the sword in all which there is noth of power but of perswas he sent them out as sheep unto wolv not as king to their subject thei had not in commiss to make law but to obei and teach obedi to law made and consequ thei could not make their write obligatori canon without the help of the soveraign civil power and therefor the scriptur of the new testament is there onli law where the lawful civil power hath made it so and there also the king or soveraign maketh it a law to himself by which he subjecteth himself not to the doctor or apostl that convert him but to god himself and hi son jesu christ as immedi as did the apostl themselv of the power of councel to make the scriptur law that which mai seem to give the new testament in respect of those that have embrac christian doctrin the forc of law in the time and place of persecut is the decre thei made amongst themselv in their synod for we read act the stile of the councel of the apostl the elder and the whole church in thi manner it seem good to the holi ghost and to us to lai upon you no greater burthen than these necessari thing c which is a stile that signifieth a power to lai a burthen on them that had receiv their doctrin now to lai a burthen on anoth seemeth the same that to oblig and therefor the act of that councel were law to the then christian nevertheless thei were no more law than ar these other precept repent be baptiz keep the command beleev the gospel come unto me sell all that thou hast give it to the poor and follow me which ar not command but invit and call of men to christian like that of esai ho everi man that thirsteth come yee to the water come and bui wine and milk without monei for first the apostl power wa no other than that of our saviour to invit men to embrac the kingdom of god which thei themselv acknowledg for a kingdom not present but to come and thei that have no kingdom can make no law and secondli if their act of councel were law thei could not without sin be disobei but we read not ani where that thei who receiv not the doctrin of christ did therein sin but that thei di in their sin that is that their sin against the law to which thei ow obedi were not pardon and those law were the law of natur and the civil law of the state whereto everi christian man had by pact submit himself and therefor by the burthen which the apostl might lai on such as thei had convert ar not to be understood law but condit propos to those that sought salvat which thei might accept or refus at their own peril without a new sin though not without the hazard of be condemn and exclud out of the kingdom of god for their sin past and therefor of infidel s john saith not the wrath of god shall come upon them but the wrath of god remaineth upon them and not that thei shall be condemn but that thei ar condemn alreadyjohn nor can it be conceiv that the benefit of faith is remiss of sin unless we conceiv withal that the dammag of infidel is the retent of the same sin but to what end is it mai some man ask that the apostl and other pastor of the church after their time should meet togeth to agre upon what doctrin should be taught both for faith and manner if no man were oblig to observ their decre to thi mai be answer that the apostl and elder of that councel were oblig even by their entranc into it to teach the doctrin therein conclud and decre to be taught so far forth as no preced law to which thei were oblig to yeeld obedi wa to the contrari but not that all other christian should be oblig to observ what thei taught for though thei might deliber what each of them should teach yet thei could not deliber what other should do unless their assembl had had a legisl power which none could have but civil soveraign for though god be the soveraign of all the world we ar not bound to take for hi law whatsoev is propound by everi man in hi name nor ani thing contrari to the civil law which god hath express command us to obei see then the act of councel of the apostl were then no law but councel much less ar law the act of ani other doctor or councel sinc if assembl without the author of the civil soveraign and consequ the book of the new testament though most perfect rule of christian doctrin could not be made law by ani other author then that of king or soveraign assembl the first councel that made the scriptur we now have canon is not extant for that collect the first bishop of rome after s peter is subject to question for though the canonical book bee there reckon up yet these word sint vobi omnibu clerici laici libri venerandi c contain a distinct of clergi and laiti that wa not in us so neer st peter time the first councel for setl the canonical scriptur that is extant is that of laodicea can which forbid the read of other book then those in the church which is a mandat that is not address to everi christian but to those on that had author to read ani publiqu in the church that is to ecclesiastiqu on of the right of constitut ecclesiastical offic in the time of the apostl of ecclesiast offic in the time of the apostl some were magisterial some ministerial magisterial were the offic of preach of the gospel of the kingdom of god to infidel of administr the sacrament and divin servic and of teach the rule of faith and manner to those that were convert ministerial wa the offic of deacon that is of them that were appoint to the administr of the secular necess of the church at such time as thei live upon a common stock of moni rais out of the voluntari contribut of the faithful amongst the offic magisterial the first and principal were the apostl whereof there were at first but twelv and these were chosen and constitut by our saviour himself and their offic wa not on to preach teach and baptiz but also to be martyr wit of our saviour resurrect thi testimoni wa the specifical and essential mark wherebi the apostleship wa distinguish from other magistraci ecclesiastical as be necessari for an apostl either to have seen our saviour after hi resurrect or to have convers with him befor and seen hi work and other argument of hi divin wherebi thei might be taken for suffici wit and therefor at the elect of a new apostl in the place of juda iscariot s peter saith act of these men that have compani with us all the time that the lord jesu went in and out among us begin from the baptism of john unto that same dai that he wa taken up from us must on be ordain to be a witness with us of hi resurrect where by thi word must is impli a necessari properti of an apostl to have compani with the first and prime apostl in the time that our saviour manifest himself in the flesh matthia made apostl by the congreg the first apostl of those which were not constitut by christ in the time he wa upon the earth wa matthia chosen in thi manner there were assembl togeth in jerusalem about christian act these appoint two joseph the just and matthia ver and caus lot to be drawn and ver the lot fell on matthia and he wa numbr with the apostl so that here we see the ordin of thi apostl wa the act of the congreg and not of st peter nor of the eleven otherwis then as member of the assembl paul and barnaba made apostl by the church of antioch after him there wa never ani other apostl ordain but paul and barnaba which wa done as we read act in thi manner there were in the church that wa at antioch certain prophet and teacher as barnaba and simeon that wa call niger and luciu of cyren and manaen which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul as thei ministr unto the lord and fast the holi ghost said separ mee barnaba and saul for the work whereunto i have call them and when thei had fast and prai and laid their hand on them thei sent them awai by which it is manifest that though thei were call by the holi ghost their call wa declar unto them and their mission author by the particular church of antioch and that thi their call wa to the apostleship is appar by that that thei ar both call act apostl and that it wa by vertu of thi act of the church of antioch that thei were apostl s paul declareth plainli rom in that hee useth the word which the holi ghost us at hi call for he stileth himself an apostl separ unto the gospel of god allud to the word of the holi ghost separ me barnaba and saul c but see the work of an apostl wa to be a witness of the resurrect of christ and man mai here ask how s paul that convers not with our saviour befor hi passion could know he wa risen to which it is easili answer that our saviour himself appear to him in the wai to damascu from heaven after hi ascens and chose him for a vessel to bear hi name befor the gentil and king and children of israel and consequ have seen the lord after hi passion wa a compet witness of hi resurrect and as for barnaba he wa a discipl befor the passion it is therefor evid that paul and barnaba were apostl and yet chosen and author not by the first apostl alon but by the church of antioch as matthia wa chosen and author by the church of jerusalem what offic in the church ar magisterial bishop a word form in our languag out of the greek episcopu signifieth an overs or superintend of ani business and particularli a pastor or shepherd and thenc by metaphor wa taken not onli amongst the jew that were origin shepherd but also amongst the heathen to signifi the offic of a king or ani other ruler or guid of peopl whether he rule by law or doctrin and so the apostl were the first christian bishop institut by christ himself in which sens the apostleship of juda is call act hi bishoprick and afterward when there were constitut elder in the christian church with charg to guid christ flock by their doctrin and advic these elder were also call bishop timothi wa an elder which word elder in the new testament is a name of offic as well as of ag yet he wa also a bishop and bishop were then content with the titl of elder nai s john himself the apostl belov of our lord beginneth hi second epistl with these word the elder to the elect ladi by which it is evid that bishop pastor elder doctor that is to sai teacher were but so mani diver name of the same offic in the time of the apostl for there wa then no govern by coercion but onli by doctrin and perswad the kingdom of god wa yet to come in a new world so that there could be no author to compel in ani church till the commonwealth had embrac the christian faith and consequ no divers of author though there were divers of employ besid these magisterial employ in the church name apostl bishop elder pastor and doctor whose call wa to proclaim christ to the jew and infidel and to direct and teach those that beleev we read in the new testament of no other for by the name of evangelist and prophet is not signifi ani offic but several gift by which several men were profit to the church as evangelist by write the life and act of our saviour such as were s matthew and s john apostl and s mark and s luke discipl and whosoev els wrote of that subject as s thoma and s barnaba ar said to have done though the church have not receiv the book that have gone under their name and as prophet by the gift of interpret the old testament and sometim by declar their special revel to the church for neither these gift nor the gift of languag nor the gift of cast out devil or of cure other diseas nor ani thing els did make an offic in the church save on the due call and elect to the charg of teach ordin of teacher as the apostl matthia paul and barnaba were not made by our saviour himself but were elect by the church that is by the assembl of christian name matthia by the church of jerusalem and paul and barnaba by the church of antioch so were also the presbyt and pastor in other citi elect by the church of those citi for proof whereof let us consid first how s paul proceed in the ordin of presbyt in the citi where he had convert men to the christian faith immedi after he and barnaba had receiv their apostleship we read act that thei ordain elder in everi church which at first sight mai be taken for an argument that thei themselv chose and gave them their author but if we consid the original text it will be manifest that thei were author and chosen by the assembl of the christian of each citi for the word there ar cheirotonesant autoispresbuter kat ekklesian that is when thei had ordain them elder by the hold up of hand in everi congreg now it is well enough known that in all those citi the manner of choos magistr and offic wa by plural of suffrag and becaus the ordinari wai of distinguish the affirm vote from the neg wa by hold up of hand to ordain an offic in ani of the citi wa no more but to bring the peopl togeth to elect them by plural of vote whether it were by plural of elev hand or by plural of voic or plural of ball or bean or small stone of which everi man cast in on into a vessel mark for the affirm or neg for diver citi had diver custom in that point it wa therefor the assembl that elect their own elder the apostl were on presid of the assembl to call them togeth for such elect and to pronounc them elect and to give them the benedict which now is call consecr and for thi caus thei that were presid of the assembl as in the absenc of the apostl the elder were were call proestot and in latin antist which word signifi the principal person of the assembl whose offic wa to number the vote and to declar therebi who wa chosen and where the vote were equal to decid the matter in question by ad hi own which is the offic of a presid in councel and becaus all the church had their presbyt ordain in the same manner where the word is constitut as titu ina katastes kata polin presbuter for thi caus left i thee in crete that thou shouldest constitut elder in everi citi we ar to understand the same thing name that hee should call the faithful togeth and ordain them presbyt by plural of suffrag it had been a strang thing if in a town where men perhap had never seen ani magistr otherwis chosen then by an assembl those of the town becom christian should so much as have thought on ani other wai of elect of their teacher and guid that is to sai of their presbyt otherwis call bishop then thi of plural of suffrag intim by s paul act in the word cheirotonesant nor wa there ever ani choos of bishop befor the emperor found it necessari to regul them in order to the keep of the peac amongst them but by the assembl of the christian in everi several town the same is also confirm by the continual practis even to thi dai in the elect of the bishop of rome for if the bishop of ani place had the right of choos anoth to the success of the pastoral offic in ani citi at such time as he went from thenc to plant the same in anoth place much more had he had the right to appoint hi successour in that place in which he last resid and dy and we find not that ever ani bishop of rome appoint hi successor for thei were a long time chosen by the peopl as we mai see by the sedit rais about the elect between damascu and ursinicu which ammianu marcellinu saith wa so great that juventiu the praefect unabl to keep the peac between them wa forc to goe out of the citi and that there were abov an hundr men found dead upon that occas in the church it self and though thei afterward were chosen first by the whole clergi of rome and afterward by the cardinal yet never ani wa appoint to the success by hi predecessor if therefor thei pretend no right to appoint their successor i think i mai reason conclud thei had no right to appoint the new power which none could take from the church to bestow on them but such as had a lawful author not on to teach but to command the church which none could doe but the civil soveraign minist of the church what the word minist in the original diakono signifieth on that voluntarili doth the business of anoth man and differeth from a servant on in thi that servant ar oblig by their condit to what is command them wherea minist ar oblig on by their undertak and bound therefor to no more than that thei have undertaken so that both thei that teach the word of god and thei that administ the secular affair of the church ar both minist but thei ar minist of differ person for the pastor of the church call act the minist of the word ar minist of christ whose word it is but the ministeri of a deacon which is call vers of the same chapter serv of tabl is a servic done to the church or congreg so that neither ani on man nor the whole church could ever of their pastor sai he wa their minist but of a deacon whether the charg he undertook were to serv tabl or distribut mainten to the christian when thei live in each citi on a common stock or upon collect as in the first time or to take a care of the hous of prayer or of the revenu or other worldli business of the church the whole congreg might properli call him their minist for their employ as deacon wa to serv the congreg though upon occas thei omit not to preach the gospel and maintain the doctrin of christ everi on accord to hi gift as s steven did and both to preach and baptiz as philip did for that philip which act preach the gospel at samaria and vers baptiz the eunuch wa philip the deacon not philip the apostl for it is manifest vers that when philip preach in samaria the apostl were at jerusalem and vers when thei heard that samaria had receiv the word of god sent peter and john to them by imposit of whose hand thei that were baptiz vers receiv which befor by the baptism of philip thei had not receiv the holi ghost for it wa necessari for the confer of the holi ghost that their baptism should be administr or confirm by a minist of the word not by a minist of the church and therefor to confirm the baptism of those that philip the deacon had baptiz the apostl sent out of their own number from jerusalem to samaria peter and john who confer on them that befor were but baptiz those grace that were sign of the holi spirit which at that time did accompani all true beleev which what thei were mai be understood by that which s mark saith chap these sign follow them that beleev in my name thei shall cast out devil thei shall speak with new tongu thei shall take up serpent and if thei drink ani deadli thing it shall not hurt them thei shall lai hand on the sick and thei shall recov thi to doe wa it that philip could not give but the apostl could and as appear by thi place effectu did to everi man that truli beleev and wa by a minist of christ himself baptiz which power either christ minist in thi ag cannot conferr or els there ar veri few true beleev or christ hath veri few minist and how chosen what that the first deacon were chosen not by the apostl but by a congreg of the discipl that is of christian men of all sort is manifest out of act where we read that the twelv after the number of discipl wa multipli call them togeth and have told them that it wa not fit that the apostl should leav the word of god and serv tabl said unto them vers brethren look you out among you seven men of honest report full of the holi ghost and of wisdom whom we mai appoint over thi business here it is manifest that though the apostl declar them elect yet the congreg chose them which also vers the fift is more express said where it is written that the sai pleas the multitud and thei chose seven c of ecclesiastical revenu under the law of mose under the old testament the tribe of levi were on capabl of the priesthood and other inferiour offic of the church the land wa divid amongst the other tribe levi except which by the subdivis of the tribe of joseph into ephraim and manass were still twelv to the tribe of levi were assign certain citi for their habit with the suburb for their cattel but for their portion thei were to have the tenth of the fruit of the land of their brethren again the priest for their mainten had the tenth of that tenth togeth with part of the oblat and sacrific for god had said to aaron numb thou shalt have no inherit in their land neither shalt thou have ani part amongst them i am thy part and thine inherit amongst the children of israel for god be then king and have constitut the tribe of levi to be hi publiqu minist he allow them for their mainten the publiqu revenu that is to sai the part that god had reserv to himself which were tyth and offer and that it is which is meant where god saith i am thine inherit and therefor to the levit might not unfitli be attribut the name of clergi from klero which signifieth lot or inherit not that thei were heir of the kingdom of god more than other but that god inherit wa their mainten now see in thi time god himself wa their king and mose aaron and the succeed high priest were hi lieuten it is manifest that the right of tyth and offer wa constitut by the civil power after their reject of god in the demand of a king thei enjoi still the same revenu but the right thereof wa deriv from that that the king did never take it from them for the publiqu revenu wa at the dispos of him that wa the publiqu person and that till the captiv wa the king and again after the return from the captiv thei paid their tyth as befor to the priest hitherto therefor church live were determin by the civil soveraign in our saviour time and after of the mainten of our saviour and hi apostl we read on thei had a purs which wa carri by juda iscariot and that of the apostl such as were fishermen did sometim us their trade and that when our saviour sent the twelv apostl to preach he forbad them to carri gold and silver and brass in their purs for that the workman is worthi of hi hire mat by which it is probabl their ordinari mainten wa not unsuit to their employ for their employ wa ver freeli to give becaus thei had freeli receiv and their mainten wa the free gift of those that beleev the good tyde thei carri about of the come of the messiah their saviour to which we mai add that which wa contribut out of gratitud by such as our saviour had heal of diseas of which ar mention certain women luke which had been heal of evil spirit and infirm mari magdalen out of whom went seven devil and joanna the wife of chuza herod steward and susanna and mani other which ministr unto him of their substanc after our saviour ascens the christian of everi citi live in common act upon the moni which wa made of the sale of their land and possess and laid down at the feet of the apostl of good will not of duti for whilest the land remain saith s peter to anania act wa it not thine and after it wa sold wa it not in thy power which sheweth he need not to have save hi land nor hi monei by ly as not be bound to contribut ani thing at all unless he had pleas and as in the time of the apostl so also all the time downward till after constantin the great we shall find that the mainten of the bishop and pastor of the christian church wa noth but the voluntari contribut of them that had embrac their doctrin there wa yet no mention of tyth but such wa in the time of constantin and hi son the affect of christian to their pastor as ammianu marcellinu saith describ the sedit of damasu and ursinicu about the bishoprick that it wa worth their content in that the bishop of those time by the liber of their flock and especi of matron live splendidli were carri in coach and sumptuou in their fare and apparel the minist of the gospel live on the benevol of their flock but here mai some ask whether the pastor were then bound to live upon voluntari contribut as upon alm for who saith s paul cor goeth to war at hi own charg or who feedeth a flock and eatheth not of the milk of the flock and again cor doe ye not know that thei which minist about holi thing live of the thing of the templ and thei which wait at the altar partak with the altar that is to sai have part of that which is offer at the altar for their mainten and then he concludeth even so hath the lord appoint that thei which preach the gospel should live of the gospel from which place mai be infer inde that the pastor of the church ought to be maintain by their flock but not that the pastor were to determin either the quantiti or the kind of their own allow and be as it were their own carver their allow must need therefor be determin either by the gratitud and liber of everi particular man of their flock or by the whole congreg by the whole congreg it could not be becaus their act were then no law therefor the mainten of pastor befor emperour and civil soveraign had made law to settl it wa noth but benevol thei that serv at the altar live on what wa offer in what court should thei sue for it who had no tribunal or if thei had arbitr amongst themselv who should execut their judgment when thei had no power to arm their offic it remaineth therefor that there could be no certain mainten assign to ani pastor of the church but by the whole congreg and then on when their decre should have the forc not on of canon but also of law which law could not be made but by emperour king or other civil soveraign the right of tyth in mose law could not be appli to the then minist of the gospel becaus mose and the high priest were the civil soveraign of the peopl under god whose kingdom amongst the jew wa present wherea the kingdom of god by christ is yet to come hitherto hath been shewn what the pastor of the church ar what ar the point of their commiss as that thei were to preach to teach to baptiz to be presid in their several congreg what is ecclesiastical censur viz excommun that is to sai in those place where christian wa forbidden by the civil law a put of themselv out of the compani of the excommun and where christian wa by the civil law command a put the excommun out of the congreg of christian who elect the pastor and minist of the church that it wa the congreg who consecr and bless them that it wa the pastor what wa their due revenu that it wa none but their own possess and their own labour and the voluntari contribut of devout and grateful christian we ar to consid now what offic those person have who be civil soveraign have embrac also the christian faith the civil soveraign be a christian hath the right of appoint pastor and first we ar to rememb that the right of judg what doctrin ar fit for peac and to be taught the subject is in all commonwealth insepar annex as hath been alreadi prove cha to the soveraign power civil whether it be in on man or in on assembl of men for it is evid to the meanest capac that men action ar deriv from the opinion thei have of the good or evil which from those action redound unto themselv and consequ men that ar onc possess of an opinion that their obedi to the soveraign power will bee more hurtful to them than their disobedi will disobei the law and therebi overthrow the commonwealth and introduc confus and civil war for the avoid whereof all civil govern wa ordain and therefor in all commonwealth of the heathen the soveraign have had the name of pastor of the peopl becaus there wa no subject that could lawfulli teach the peopl but by their permiss and author thi right of the heathen king cannot bee thought taken from them by their convers to the faith of christ who never ordain that king for beleev in him should be depos that is subject to ani but himself or which is all on be depriv of the power necessari for the conserv of peac amongst their subject and for their defenc against foraign enemi and therefor christian king ar still the suprem pastor of their peopl and have power to ordain what pastor thei pleas to teach the church that is to teach the peopl commit to their charg again let the right of choos them be as befor the convers of king in the church for so it wa in the time of the apostl themselv as hath been shewn alreadi in thi chapter even so also the right will be in the civil soveraign christian for in that he is a christian he allow the teach and in that he is the soveraign which is as much as to sai the church by represent the teacher hee elect ar elect by the church and when an assembl of christian choos their pastor in a christian commonwealth it is the soveraign that electeth him becaus ti done by hi author in the same manner as when a town choos their maior it is the act of him that hath the soveraign power for everi act done is the act of him without whose consent it is invalid and therefor whatsoev exampl mai be drawn out of histori concern the elect of pastor by the peopl or by the clergi thei ar no argument against the right of ani civil soveraign becaus thei that elect them did it by hi author see then in everi christian commonwealth the civil soveraign is the suprem pastor to whose charg the whole flock of hi subject is commit and consequ that it is by hi author that all other pastor ar made and have power to teach and perform all other pastoral offic it followeth also that it is from the civil soveraign that all other pastor deriv their right of teach preach and other function pertain to that offic and that thei ar but hi minist in the same manner as the magistr of town judg in court of justic and command of armi ar all but minist of him that is the magistr of the whole commonwealth judg of all caus and command of the whole militia which is alway the civil soveraign and the reason hereof is not becaus thei that teach but becaus thei that ar to learn ar hi subject for let it be suppos that a christian king commit the author of ordain pastor in hi dominion to anoth king as diver christian king allow that power to the pope he doth not therebi constitut a pastor over himself nor a soveraign pastor over hi peopl for that were to depriv himself of the civil power which depend on the opinion men have of their duti to him and the fear thei have of punish in anoth world would depend also on the skill and loyalti of doctor who ar no less subject not onli to ambit but also to ignor than ani other sort of men so that where a stranger hath author to appoint teacher it is given him by the soveraign in whose dominion he teacheth christian doctor ar our schoolmast to christian but king ar father of famili and mai receiv schoolmast for their subject from the recommend of a stranger but not from the command especi when the ill teach them shall redound to the great and manifest profit of him that recommend them nor can thei be oblig to retain them longer than it is for the publiqu good the care of which thei stand so long charg withal as thei retain ani other essential right of the soveraignti the pastoral author of soveraign onli is de jure divino that of other pastor is jure civili if a man therefor should ask a pastor in the execut of hi offic as the chief priest and elder of the peopl mat ask our saviour by what author dost thou these thing and who gave thee thi author he can make no other just answer but that he doth it by the author of the commonwealth given him by the king or assembl that representeth it all pastor except the suprem execut their charg in the right that is by the author of the civil soveraign that is jure civili but the king and everi other soveraign executeth hi offic of suprem pastor by immedi author from god that is to sai in god right or jure divino and therefor none but king can put into their titl a mark of their submiss to god on dei gratia rex c bishop ought to sai in the begin of their mandat by the favour of the king majesti bishop of such a diocess or as civil minist in hi majesti name for in sai divina providentia which is the same with dei gratia though disguis thei deni to have receiv their author from the civil state and slieli slip off the collar of their civil subject contrari to the uniti and defenc of the commonwealth christian king have power to execut all manner of pastor function but if everi christian soveraign be the suprem pastor of hi own subject it seemeth that he hath also the author not onli to preach which perhap no man will deni but also to baptiz and to administ the sacrament of the lord supper and to consecr both templ and pastor to god servic which most men deni partli becaus thei us not to do it and partli becaus the administr of sacrament and consecr of person and place to holi us requireth the imposit of such men hand as by the like imposit success from the time of the apostl have been ordain to the like ministeri for proof therefor that christian king have power to baptiz and to consecr i am to render a reason both why thei us not to doe it and how without the ordinari ceremoni of imposit of hand thei ar made capabl of do it when thei will there is no doubt but ani king in case he were skilful in the scienc might by the same right of hi offic read lectur of them himself by which he authorizeth other to read them in the univers nevertheless becaus the care of the summ of the business of the commonwealth taketh up hi whole time it were not conveni for him to appli himself in person to that particular a king mai also if he pleas sit in judgment to hear and determin all manner of caus as well as give other author to doe it in hi name but that the charg that lyeth upon him of command and govern constrain him to bee continu at the helm and to commit the ministerial offic to other under him in the like manner our saviour who sure had power to baptiz baptiz none himself but sent hi apostl and discipl to baptiz john so also s paul by the necess of preach in diver and far distant place baptiz few amongst all the corinthian he baptiz onli crispu caju and stephanu cor and the reason wa becaus hi principal charg wa to preach cor wherebi it is manifest that the greater charg such as is the govern of the church is a dispens for the less the reason therefor why christian king us not to baptiz is evid and the same for which at thi dai there ar few baptiz by bishop and by the pope fewer and as concern imposit of hand whether it be needful for the author of a king to baptiz and consecr we mai consid thu imposit of hand wa a most ancient publiqu ceremoni amongst the jew by which wa design and made certain the person or other thing intend in a man prayer bless sacrific consecr condemn or other speech so jacob in bless the children of joseph gen laid hi right hand on ephraim the younger and hi left hand on manasseh the first born and thi he did wittingli though thei were so present to him by joseph as he wa forc in do it to stretch out hi arm across to design to whom he intend the greater bless so also in the sacrif of the burnt offer aaron is command exod to lai hi hand on the head of the bullock and ver to lai hi hand on the head of the ramm the same is also said again levit likewis mose when he ordain joshua to be captain of the israelit that is consecr him to god servic numb laid hi hand upon him and gave him hi charg design and rendr certain who it wa thei were to obei in war and in the consecr of the levit numb god command that the children of israel should put their hand upon the levit and in the condemn of him that had blasphem the lord levit god command that all that heard him should lai their hand on hi head and that all the congreg should stone him and why should thei onli that heard him lai their hand upon him and not rather a priest levit or other minist of justic but that none els were abl to design and demonstr to the ey of the congreg who it wa that had blasphem and ought to die and to design a man or ani other thing by the hand to the ey is less subject to mistak than when it is done to the ear by a name and so much wa thi ceremoni observ that in bless the whole congreg at onc which cannot be done by lai on of hand yet aaron levit did lift up hi hand toward the peopl when he bless them and we read also of the like ceremoni of consecr of templ amongst the heathen as that the priest laid hi hand on some post of the templ all the while he wa utter the word of consecr so natural it is to design ani individual thing rather by the hand to assur the ey than by word to inform the ear in matter of god publiqu servic thi ceremoni wa not therefor new in our saviour time for jairu mark whose daughter wa sick besought our saviour not to heal her but to lai hi hand upon her that shee might bee heal and matth thei brought unto him littl children that hee should put hi hand on them and prai accord to thi ancient rite the apostl and presbyt and the presbyteri it self laid hand on them whom thei ordain pastor and withal prai for them that thei might receiv the holi ghost and that not onli onc but sometim oftner when a new occas wa present but the end wa still the same name a punctual and religi design of the person ordain either to the pastoral charg in gener or to a particular mission so act the apostl prai and laid their hand on the seven deacon which wa done not to give them the holi ghost for thei were full of the holi ghost befor thy were chosen as appeareth immedi befor vers but to design them to that offic and after philip the deacon had convert certain person in samaria peter and john went down act and laid their hand on them and thei receiv the holi ghost and not onli an apostl but a presbyt had thi power for s paul adviseth timothi tim lai hand suddenli on no man that is design no man rashli to the offic of a pastor the whole presbyteri laid their hand on timothi as we read tim but thi is to be understood as that some did it by the appoint of the presbyteri and most like their proesto or prolocutor which it mai be wa st paul himself for in hi epist to tim ver he saith to him stirr up the gift of god which is in thee by the lai on of my hand where note by the wai that by the holi ghost is not meant the third person in the triniti but the gift necessari to the pastoral offic we read also that st paul had imposit of hand twice onc from anania at damascu act at the time of hi baptism and again act at antioch when he wa first sent out to preach the us then of thi ceremoni consid in the ordin of pastor wa to design the person to whom thei gave such power but if there had been then ani christian that had had the power of teach befor the baptiz of him that is the make of him a christian had given him no new power but had on caus him to preach true doctrin that is to us hi power aright and therefor the imposit of hand had been unnecessari baptism it self had been suffici but everi soveraign befor christian had the power of teach and ordain teacher and therefor christian gave them no new right but onli direct them in the wai of teach truth and consequ thei need no imposit of hand besid that which is done in baptism to author them to exercis ani part of the pastoral function as name to baptiz and consecr and in the old testament though the priest onli had right to consecr dure the time that the soveraignti wa in the high priest yet it wa not so when the soveraignti wa in the king for we read king that solomon bless the peopl consecr the templ and pronounc that publiqu prayer which is the pattern now for consecr of all christian church and chappel wherebi it appear he had not onli the right of ecclesiastical govern but also of exercis ecclesiastical function the civil soveraign if a christian is head of the church in hi own dominion from thi consolid of the right politiqu and ecclesiastiqu in christian soveraign it is evid thei have all manner of power over their subject that can be given to man for the govern of men external action both in polici and religion and mai make such law as themselv shall judg fittest for the govern of their own subject both as thei ar the commonwealth and as thei ar the church for both state and church ar the same men if thei pleas therefor thei mai as mani christian king now doe commit the govern of their subject in matter of religion to the pope but then the pope is in that point subordin to them and exerciseth that charg in anoth dominion jure civili in the right of the civil soveraign not jure divino in god right and mai therefor be discharg of that offic when the soveraign for the good of hi subject shall think it necessari thei mai also if thei pleas commit the care of religion to on suprem pastor or to an assembl of pastor and give them what power over the church or on over anoth thei think most conveni and what titl of honor as of bishop archbishop priest or presbyt thei will and make such law for their mainten either by tith or otherwis as thei pleas so thei doe it out of a sincer conscienc of which god on is the judg it is the civil soveraign that is to appoint judg and interpret of the canonical scriptur for it is he that maketh them law it is he also that giveth strength to excommun which but for such law and punish as mai humbl obstin libertin and reduc them to union with the rest of the church would bee contemn in summ he hath the suprem power in all caus as well ecclesiastical as civil as far as concerneth action and word for these on ar known and mai be accus and of that which cannot be accus there is no judg at all but god that knoweth the heart and these right ar incid to all soveraign whether monarch or assembl for thei that ar the represent of a christian peopl ar represent of the church for a church and a commonwealth of christian peopl ar the same thing cardin bellarmin book de summo pontific consid though thi that i have here said and in other place of thi book seem cleer enough for the assert of the suprem ecclesiastical power to christian soveraign yet becaus the pope of rome challeng to that power univers hath been maintain chiefli and i think as strongli as is possibl by cardinal bellarmin in hi controversi de summo pontific i have thought it necessari as briefli as i can to examin the ground and strength of hi discours the first book of five book he hath written of thi subject the first containeth three question on which is simpli the best govern monarchi aristocraci or democraci and concludeth for neither but for a govern mixt of all there anoth which of these is the best govern of the church and concludeth for the mixt but which should most particip of monarchi the third whether in thi mixt monarchi st peter had the place of monarch concern hi first conclus i have alreadi suffici prove chapt that all govern which men ar bound to obei ar simpl and absolut in monarchi there is but on man suprem and all other men that have ani kind of power in the state have it by hi commiss dure hi pleasur and execut it in hi name and in aristocraci and democraci but on suprem assembl with the same power that in monarchi belongeth to the monarch which is not a mixt but an absolut soveraignti and of the three sort which is the best is not to be disput where ani on of them is alreadi establish but the present ought alwai to be prefer maintain and account best becaus it is against both the law of natur and the divin posit law to doe ani thing tend to the subvers thereof besid it maketh noth to the power of ani pastor unless he have the civil soveraignti what kind of govern is the best becaus their call is not to govern men by command but to teach them and perswad them by argument and leav it to them to consid whether thei shall embrac or reject the doctrin taught for monarchi aristocraci and democraci do mark out unto us three sort of soveraign not of pastor or as we mai sai three sort of master of famili not three sort of schoolmast for their children and therefor the second conclus concern the best form of govern of the church is noth to the question of the pope power without hi own dominion for in all other commonwealth hi power if hee have ani at all is that of the schoolmast on and not of the master of the famili for the third conclus which is that st peter wa monarch of the church he bringeth for hi chief argument the place of s matth chap thou art peter and upon thi rock i will build my church c and i will give thee the key of heaven whatsoev thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoev thou shalt loos on earth shall be loos in heaven which place well consid proveth no more but that the church of christ hath for foundat on on articl name that which peter in the name of all the apostl profess gave occas to our saviour to speak the word here cite which that wee mai cleerli understand we ar to consid that our saviour preach by himself by john baptist and by hi apostl noth but thi articl of faith that he wa the christ all other articl requir faith no otherwis than as found on that john began first mat preach onli thi the kingdom of god is at hand then our saviour himself mat preach the same and to hi twelv apostl when he gave them their commiss mat there is no mention of preach ani other articl but that thi wa the fundamental articl that is the foundat of the church faith afterward the apostl be return to him he asketh them all mat not peter on who men said he wa and thei answer that some said he wa john the baptist some elia and other jeremia or on of the prophet then ver he ask them all again not peter on whom sai yee that i am therefor peter answer for them all thou art christ the son of the live god which i said is the foundat of the faith of the whole church from which our saviour take the occas of sai upon thi stone i will build my church by which it is manifest that by the foundationston of the church wa meant the fundamental articl of the church faith but why then will some object doth our saviour interpos these word thou art peter if the original of thi text had been rigidli translat the reason would easili have appear we ar therefor to consid that the apostl simon wa surnam stone which is the signif of the syriack word cepha and of the greek word petru our saviour therefor after the confess of that fundamental articl allud to hi name said as if it were in english thu thou art stone and upon thi stone i will build my church which is as much as to sai thi articl that i am the christ is the foundat of all the faith i requir in those that ar to bee member of my church neither is thi allus to a name an unusual thing in common speech but it had been a strang and obscur speech if our saviour intend to build hi church on the person of st peter had said thou art a stone and upon thi stone i will build my church when it wa so obviou without ambigu to have said i will build my church on thee and yet there had been still the same allus to hi name and for the follow word i will give thee the key of heaven c it is no more than what our saviour gave also to all the rest of hi discipl matth whatsoev yee shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoev ye shall loos on earth shall be loos in heaven but howsoev thi be interpret there is no doubt but the power here grant belong to all suprem pastor such as ar all christian civil soveraign in their own dominion in so much as if st peter or our saviour himself had convert ani of them to beleev him and to acknowledg hi kingdom yet becaus hi kingdom is not of thi world he had left the suprem care of convert hi subject to none but him or els hee must have depriv him of the soveraignti to which the right of teach is insepar annex and thu much in refut of hi first book wherein hee would prove st peter to have been the monarch universal of the church that is to sai of all the christian in the world the second book the second book hath two conclus on that s peter wa bishop of rome and there dy the other that the pope of rome ar hi successor both which have been disput by other but suppos them to be true yet if by bishop of rome bee understood either the monarch of the church or the suprem pastor of it not silvest but constantin who wa the first christian emperour wa that bishop and as constantin so all other christian emperor were of right suprem bishop of the roman empir i sai of the roman empir not of all christendom for other christian soveraign had the same right in their several territori as to an offic essenti adhaer to their soveraignti which shall serv for answer to hi second book the third book in the third book he handleth the question whether the pope be antichrist for my part i see no argument that prove he is so in that sens that scriptur useth the name nor will i take ani argument from the qualiti of antichrist to contradict the author he exerciseth or hath heretofor exercis in the dominion of ani other princ or state it is evid that the prophet of the old testament foretold and the jew expect a messiah that is a christ that should reestablish amongst them the kingdom of god which had been reject by them in the time of samuel when thei requir a king after the manner of other nation thi expect of their made them obnoxi to the impostur of all such as had both the ambit to attempt the attain of the kingdom and the art to deceiv the peopl by counterfeit miracl by hypocritical life or by orat and doctrin plausibl our saviour therefor and hi apostl forewarn men of fals prophet and of fals christ fals christ ar such as pretend to be the christ but ar not and ar call properli antichrist in such sens as when there happeneth a schism in the church by the elect of two pope the on calleth the other antipapa or the fals pope and therefor antichrist in the proper signif hath two essential mark on that he denyeth jesu to be christ and anoth that he professeth himself to bee christ the first mark is set down by s john in hi epist ch ver everi spirit that confesseth not that jesu christ is come in the flesh is not of god and thi is the spirit of antichrist the other mark is express in the word of our saviour mat mani shall come in my name sai i am christ and again if ani man shall sai unto you loe here is christ there is christ beleev it not and therefor antichrist must be a fals christ that is some on of them that shall pretend themselv to be christ and out of these two mark to deni jesu to be the christ and to affirm himself to be the christ it followeth that he must also be an adversari of the true christ which is anoth usual signif of the word antichrist but of these mani antichrist there is on special on o antichristo the antichrist or antichrist definit as on certain person not indefinit an antichrist now see the pope of rome neither pretendeth himself nor denyeth jesu to be the christ i perceiv not how he can be call antichrist by which word is not meant on that fals pretendeth to be hi lieuten or vicar general but to be hee there is also some mark of the time of thi special antichrist as mat when that abomin destroy spoken of by daniel dan shall stand in the holi place and such tribul as wa not sinc the begin of the world nor ever shall be again insomuch as if it were to last long ver no flesh could be save but for the elect sake those dai shall be shorten made fewer but that tribul is not yet come for it is to be follow immedi ver by a darken of the sun and moon a fall of the star a concuss of the heaven and the gloriou come again of our saviour in the cloud and therefor the antichrist is not yet come wherea mani pope ar both come and gone it is true the pope in take upon him to give law to all christian king and nation usurpeth a kingdom in thi world which christ took not on him but he doth it not as christ but as for christ wherein there is noth of the antichrist the fourth book in the fourth book to prove the pope to be the suprem judg in all question of faith and manner which is as much as to be the absolut monarch of all christian in the world be bringeth three proposit the first that hi judgment ar infal the second that he can make veri law and punish those that observ them not the third that our saviour confer all jurisdict ecclesiastical on the pope of rome text for the infal of the pope judgement in point of faith for the infal of hi judgment he alledgeth the scriptur and first that of luke simon simon satan hath desir you that hee mai sift you as wheat but i have prai for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art convert strengthen thy brethren thi accord to bellarmin exposit is that christ gave here to simon peter two priviledg on that neither hi faith should fail neither he nor ani of hi successor should ever defin ani point concern faith or manner erron or contrari to the definit of a former pope which is a strang and veri much strain interpret but he that with attent readeth that chapter shall find there is no place in the whole scriptur that maketh more against the pope author than thi veri place the priest and scribe seek to kill our saviour at the passeov and juda possess with a resolut to betrai him and the dai of kill the passeov be come our saviour celebr the same with hi apostl which he said till the kingdom of god wa come hee would doe no more and withal told them that on of them wa to betrai him hereupon thei question which of them it should be and withal see the next passeov their master would celebr should be when he wa king entr into a content who should then be the greater man our saviour therefor told them that the king of the nation had dominion over their subject and ar call by a name in hebrew that signifi bountiful but i cannot be so to you you must endeavour to serv on anoth i ordain you a kingdom but it is such as my father hath ordain mee a kingdom that i am now to purchas with my blood and not to possess till my second come then yee shall eat and drink at my tabl and sit on throne judg the twelv tribe of israel and then address himself to st peter he saith simon simon satan seek by suggest a present domin to weaken your faith of the futur but i have prai for thee that thy faith shall not fail thou therefor note thi be convert and understand my kingdom as of anoth world confirm the same faith in thy brethren to which s peter answer as on that no more expect ani author in thi world lord i am readi to goe with thee not on to prison but to death wherebi it is manifest s peter had not on no jurisdict given him in thi world but a charg to teach all the other apostl that thei also should have none and for the infal of st peter sentenc definit in matter of faith there is no more to be attribut to it out of thi text than that peter should continu in the beleef of thi point name that christ should come again and possess the kingdom at the dai of judgement which wa not given by the text to all hi successor for wee see thei claim it in the world that now is the second place is that of matth thou art peter and upon thi rock i will build my church and the gate of hell shall not prevail against it by which as i have alreadi shewn in thi chapter is prove no more than that the gate of hell shall not prevail against the confess of peter which gave occas to that speech name thi that jesu is christ the sonn of god the third text is john ver feed my sheep which contain no more but a commiss of teach and if we grant the rest of the apostl to be contain in that name of sheep then it is the suprem power of teach but it wa on for the time that there were no christian soveraign alreadi possess of that supremaci but i have alreadi prove that christian soveraign ar in their own dominion the suprem pastor and institut thereto by vertu of their be baptiz though without other imposit of hand for such imposit be a ceremoni of design the person is needless when hee is alreadi design to the power of teach what doctrin he will by hi institut to an absolut power over hi subject for as i have prove befor soveraign ar suprem teacher in general by their offic and therefor oblig themselv by their baptism to teach the doctrin of christ and when thei suffer other to teach their peopl thei doe it at the peril of their own soul for it is at the hand of the head of famili that god will requir the account of the instruct of hi children and servant it is of abraham himself not of a hirel that god saith gen i know him that he will command hi children and hi houshold after him that thei keep the wai of the lord and do justic and judgement the fourth place is that of exod thou shalt put in the breastplat of judgment the urim and the thummin which hee saith is interpret by the septuagint delosin kai aletheian that is evid and truth and thenc concludeth god had given evid and truth which is almost infal to the high priest but be it evid and truth it self that wa given or be it but admonit to the priest to endeavour to inform himself cleerli and give judgment uprightli yet in that it wa given to the high priest it wa given to the civil soveraign for next under god wa the high priest in the commonwealth of israel and is an argument for evid and truth that is for the ecclesiastical supremaci of civil soveraign over their own subject against the pretend power of the pope these ar all the text hee bringeth for the infal of the judgement of the pope in point of faith text for the same in point of manner for the infal of hi judgment concern manner hee bringeth on text which is that of john when the spirit of truth is come hee will lead you into all truth where saith he by all truth is meant at least all truth necessari to salvat but with thi mitig he attributeth no more infal to the pope than to ani man that professeth christian and is not to be damn for if ani man err in ani point wherein not to err is necessari to salvat it is imposs he should be save for that on is necessari to salvat without which to be save is imposs what point these ar i shall declar out of the scriptur in the chapter follow in thi place i sai no more but that though it were grant the pope could not possibl teach ani error at all yet doth not thi entitl him to ani jurisdict in the dominion of anoth princ unless we shall also sai a man is oblig in conscienc to set on work upon all occas the best workman even then also when he hath formerli promis hi work to anoth besid the text he argueth from reason thu if the pope could err in necessari then christ hath not suffici provid for the church salvat becaus he hath command her to follow the pope direct but thi reason is invalid unless he shew when and where christ command that or took at all ani notic of a pope nai grant whatsoev wa given to s peter wa given to the pope yet see there is in the scriptur no command to ani man to obei st peter no man can bee just that obeyeth him when hi command ar contrari to those of hi lawful soveraign lastli it hath not been declar by the church nor by the pope himself that he is the civil soveraign of all the christian in the world and therefor all christian ar not bound to acknowledg hi jurisdict in point of manner for the civil soveraignti and suprem judicatur in controversi of manner ar the same thing and the maker of civil law ar not on declar but also maker of the justic and injustic of action there be noth in men manner that make them righteou or unright but their conform with the law of the soveraign and therefor when the pope challengeth supremaci in controversi of manner hee teacheth men to disobei the civil soveraign which is an erron doctrin contrari to the mani precept of our saviour and hi apostl deliv to us in the scriptur to prove the pope ha power to make law he alledgeth mani place as first deut the man that will doe presumptu and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minist there befor the lord thy god or unto the judg even that man shall die and thou shalt put awai the evil from israel for answer whereunto we ar to rememb that the high priest next and immedi under god wa the civil soveraign and all judg were to be constitut by him the word alledg sound therefor thu the man that will presum to disobei the civil soveraign for the time be or ani of hi offic in the execut of their place that man shall die c which is cleerli for the civil soveraignti against the universal power of the pope secondli he alledgeth that of matth whatsoev yee shall bind c and interpreteth it for such bind as is attribut matth to the scribe and pharise thei bind heavi burthen and grievou to be born and lai them on men shoulder by which is meant he say make of law and conclud thenc the pope can make law but thi also maketh on for the legisl power of civil soveraign for the scribe and pharise sat in mose chair but mose next under god wa soveraign of the peopl of israel and therefor our saviour command them to doe all that thei should sai but not all that thei should do that is to obei their law but not follow their exampl the third place is john feed my sheep which is not a power to make law but a command to teach make law belong to the lord of the famili who by hi own discret chooseth hi chaplain as also a schoolmast to teach hi children the fourth place john is against him the word ar as my father sent me so send i you but our saviour wa sent to redeem by hi death such as should beleev and by hi own and hi apostl preach to prepar them for their entranc into hi kingdom which he himself saith is not of thi world and hath taught us to prai for the come of it hereaft though hee refus act to tell hi apostl when it should come and in which when it come the twelv apostl shall sit on twelv throne everi on perhap as high as that of st peter to judg the twelv tribe of israel see then god the father sent not our saviour to make law in thi present world wee mai conclud from the text that neither did our saviour send s peter to make law here but to perswad men to expect hi second com with a stedfast faith and in the mean time if subject to obei their princ and if princ both to beleev it themselv and to do their best to make their subject doe the same which is the offic of a bishop therefor thi place maketh most strongli for the join of the ecclesiastical supremaci to the civil soveraignti contrari to that which cardinal bellarmin alledgeth it for the fift place is act it hath seem good to the holi spirit and to us to lai upon you no greater burden than these necessari thing that yee abstain from meat offer to idol and from bloud and from thing strangl and from fornic here hee note the word lai of burden for the legisl power but who is there that read thi text can sai thi stile of the apostl mai not as properli be us in give counsel as in make law the stile of a law is we command but we think good is the ordinari stile of them that but give advic and thei lai a burthen that give advic though it bee conditional that is if thei to whom thei give it will attain their end and such is the burthen of abstain from thing strangl and from bloud not absolut but in case thei will not err i have shewn befor chap that law is distinguish from counsel in thi that the reason of a law is taken from the design and benefit of him that prescribeth it but the reason of a counsel from the design and benefit of him to whom the counsel is given but here the apostl aim on at the benefit of the convert gentil name their salvat not at their own benefit for have done their endeavour thei shall have their reward whether thei be obei or not and therefor the act of thi councel were not law but counsel the sixt place is that of rom let everi soul be subject to the higher power for there is no power but of god which is meant he saith not on of secular but also of ecclesiastical princ to which i answer first that there ar no ecclesiastical princ but those that ar also civil soveraign and their princip exce not the compass of their civil soveraignti without those bound though thei mai be receiv for doctor thei cannot be acknowledg for princ for if the apostl had meant we should be subject both to our own princ and also to the pope he had taught us a doctrin which christ himself hath told us is imposs name to serv two master and though the apostl sai in anoth place i write these thing be absent lest be present i should us sharpness accord to the power which the lord hath given me it is not that he challeng a power either to put to death imprison banish whip or fine ani of them which ar punish but on to excommun which without the civil power is no more but a leav of their compani and have no more to doe with them than with a heathen man or a publican which in mani occas might be a greater pain to the excommunic than to the excommun the seventh place is cor shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and the spirit of leniti but here again it is not the power of a magistr to punish offend that is meant by a rod but on the power of excommun which is not in it own natur a punish but on a denounc of punish that christ shall inflict when he shall be in possess of hi kingdom at the dai of judgment nor then also shall it bee properli a punish as upon a subject that hath broken the law but a reveng as upon an enemi or revolt that denyeth the right of our saviour to the kingdom and therefor thi proveth not the legisl power of ani bishop that ha not also the civil power the eighth place is timothi a bishop must be the husband but of on wife vigil sober c which he saith wa a law i thought that none could make a law in the church but the monarch of the church st peter but suppos thi precept made by the author of st peter yet i see no reason why to call it a law rather than an advic see timothi wa not a subject but a discipl of st paul nor the flock under the charg of timothi hi subject in the kingdom but hi scholar in the school of christ if all the precept he giveth timothi be law why is not thi also a law drink no longer water but us a littl wine for thy health sake and why ar not also the precept of good physitian so mani law but that it is not the imper manner of speak but an absolut subject to a person that maketh hi precept law in like manner the ninth place tim against an elder receiv not an accus but befor two or three wit is a wise precept but not a law the tenth place is luke he that heareth you heareth mee and he that despiseth you despiseth me and there is no doubt but he that despiseth the counsel of those that ar sent by christ despiseth the counsel of christ himself but who ar those now that ar sent by christ but such as ar ordain pastor by lawful author and who ar lawfulli ordain that ar not ordain by the soveraign pastor and who is ordain by the soveraign pastor in a christian commonwealth that is not ordain by the author of the soveraign thereof out of thi place therefor it followeth that he which heareth hi soveraign be a christian heareth christ and hee that despiseth the doctrin which hi king be a christian authorizeth despiseth the doctrin of christ which is not that which bellarmin intendeth here to prove but the contrari but all thi is noth to a law nai more a christian king as a pastor and teacher of hi subject make not therebi hi doctrin law he cannot oblig men to beleev though as a civil soveraign he mai make law suitabl to hi doctrin which mai oblig men to certain action and sometim to such as thei would not otherwis do and which he ought not to command and yet when thei ar command thei ar law and the external action done in obedi to them without the inward approb ar the action of the soveraign and not of the subject which is in that case but as an instrument without ani motion of hi own at all becaus god hath command to obei them the eleventh is everi place where the apostl for counsel putteth some word by which men us to signifi command or calleth the follow of hi counsel by the name of obedi and therefor thei ar alledg out of cor i commend you for keep my precept as i deliv them to you the greek is i commend you for keep those thing i deliv to you as i deliv them which is far from signifi that thei were law or ani thing els but good counsel and that of thess you know what command we gave you where the greek word is paraggelia edokamen equival to paredokamen what wee deliv to you as in the place next befor alledg which doe not prove the tradit of the apostl to be ani more than counsel though as is said in the th vers he that despiseth them despiseth not man but god for our saviour himself came not to judg that is to be king in thi world but to sacrific himself for sinner and leav doctor in hi church to lead not to drive men to christ who never accepteth forc action which is all the law produceth but the inward convers of the heart which is not the work of law but of counsel and doctrin and that of thess if ani man obei not our word by thi epistl note that man and have no compani with him that he mai bee asham where from the word obei he would inferr that thi epistl wa a law to the thessalonian the epistl of the emperour were inde law if therefor the epistl of s paul were also a law thei were to obei two master but the word obei as it is in the greek upakouei signifieth hearken to or put in practic not on that which is command by him that ha right to punish but also that which is deliv in a wai of counsel for our good and therefor st paul doe not bid kill him that disobei nor beat nor imprison nor amerc him which legisl mai all do but avoid hi compani that he mai bee asham wherebi it is evid it wa not the empir of an apostl but hi reput amongst the faithful which the christian stood in aw of the last place is that of heb obei your leader and submit your selv to them for thei watch for your soul as thei that must give account and here also is intend by obedi a follow of their counsel for the reason of our obedi is not drawn from the will and command of our pastor but from our own benefit as be the salvat of our soul thei watch for and not for the exalt of their own power and author if it were meant here that all thei teach were law then not on the pope but everi pastor in hi parish should have legisl power again thei that ar bound to obei their pastor have no power to examin their command what then shall wee sai to st john who bid us epist chap ver not to beleev everi spirit but to try the spirit whether thei ar of god becaus mani fals prophet ar gone out into the world it is therefor manifest that wee mai disput the doctrin of our pastor but no man can disput a law the command of civil soveraign ar on all side grant to be law if ani els can make a law besid himself all commonwealth and consequ all peac and justic must ceas which is contrari to all law both divin and human noth therefor can be drawn from these or ani other place of scriptur to prove the decre of the pope where he ha not also the civil soveraignti to be law the question of superior between the pope and other bishop the last point hee would prove is thi that our saviour christ ha commit ecclesiastical jurisdict immedi to none but the pope wherein he handleth not the question of supremaci between the pope and christian king but between the pope and other bishop and first he say it is agre that the jurisdict of bishop is at least in the general de jure divino that is in the right of god for which he alledg s paul eph where hee say that christ after hi ascens into heaven gave gift to men some apostl some prophet and some evangelist and some pastor and some teacher and thenc inferr thei have inde their jurisdict in god right but will not grant thei have it immedi from god but deriv through the pope but if a man mai be said to have hi jurisdict de jure divino and yet not immedi what lawful jurisdict though but civil is there in a christian commonwealth that is not also de jure divino for christian king have their civil power from god immedi and the magistr under him exercis their several charg in vertu of hi commiss wherein that which thei doe is no less de jure divino mediato than that which the bishop doe in vertu of the pope ordin all lawful power is of god immedi in the suprem governour and mediat in those that have author under him so that either hee must grant everi constabl in the state to hold hi offic in the right of god or he must not hold that ani bishop hold hi so besid the pope himself but thi whole disput whether christ left the jurisdict to the pope on or to other bishop also if consid out of these place where the pope ha the civil soveraignti is a content de lana caprina for none of them where thei ar not soveraign ha ani jurisdict at all for jurisdict is the power of hear and determin caus between man and man and can belong to none but him that hath the power to prescrib the rule of right and wrong that is to make law and with the sword of justic to compel men to obei hi decis pronounc either by himself or by the judg he ordaineth thereunto which none can lawfulli do but the civil soveraign therefor when he alledgeth out of the of luke that our saviour call hi discipl togeth and chose twelv of them which he name apostl he proveth that he elect them all except matthia paul and barnaba and gave them power and command to preach but not to judg of caus between man and man for that is a power which he refus to take upon himself sai who made me a judg or a divid amongst you and in anoth place my kingdom is not of thi world but hee that hath not the power to hear and determin caus between man and man cannot be said to have ani jurisdict at all and yet thi hinder not but that our saviour gave them power to preach and baptiz in all part of the world suppos thei were not by their own lawful soveraign forbidden for to our own soveraign christ himself and hi apostl have in sundri place express command us in all thing to be obedi the argument by which he would prove that bishop receiv their jurisdict from the pope see the pope in the dominion of other princ hath no jurisdict himself ar all in vain yet becaus thei prove on the contrari that all bishop receiv jurisdict when thei have it from their civil soveraign i will not omit the recital of them the first is from number where mose not be abl alon to undergo the whole burthen of administr the affair of the peopl of israel god command him to choos seventi elder and took part of the spirit of mose to put it upon those seventi elder by which it is understood not that god weaken the spirit of mose for that had not eas him at all but that thei had all of them their author from him wherein he doth truli and ingenu interpret that place but see mose had the entir soveraignti in the commonwealth of the jew it is manifest that it is therebi signifi that thei had their author from the civil soveraign and therefor that place proveth that bishop in everi christian commonwealth have their author from the civil soveraign and from the pope in hi own territori onli and not in the territori of ani other state the second argument is from the natur of monarchi wherein all author is in on man and in other by deriv from him but the govern of the church he sai is monarchical thi also make for christian monarch for thei ar realli monarch of their own peopl that is of their own church for the church is the same thing with a christian peopl wherea the power of the pope though hee were s peter is neither monarchi nor hath ani thing of archical nor cratical but on of didactical for god accepteth not a forc but a will obedi the third is from that the sea of s peter is call by s cyprian the head the sourc the root the sun from whenc the author of bishop is deriv but by the law of natur which is a better principl of right and wrong than the word of ani doctor that is but a man the civil soveraign in everi commonwealth is the head the sourc the root and the sun from which all jurisdict is deriv and therefor the jurisdict of bishop is deriv from the civil soveraign the fourth is taken from the inequ of their jurisdict for if god saith he had given it them immedi he had given aswel equal of jurisdict as of order but wee see some ar bishop but of own town some of a hundr town and some of mani whole provinc which differ were not determin by the command of god their jurisdict therefor is not of god but of man and on ha a greater anoth a less as it pleaseth the princ of the church which argument if he had prove befor that the pope had had an universal jurisdict over all christian had been for hi purpos but see that hath not been prove and that it is notori known the larg jurisdict of the pope wa given him by those that had it that is by the emperour of rome for the patriarch of constantinopl upon the same titl name of be bishop of the capital citi of the empir and seat of the emperour claim to be equal to him it followeth that all other bishop have their jurisdict from the soveraign of the place wherein thei exercis the same and as for that caus thei have not their author de jure divino so neither hath the pope hi de jure divino except on where hee is also the civil soveraign hi fift argument is thi if bishop have their jurisdict immedi from god the pope could not take it from them for he can doe noth contrari to god ordin and thi consequ is good and well prove but saith he the pope can do thi and ha done it thi also is grant so he doe it in hi own dominion or in the dominion of ani other princ that hath given him that power but not univers in right of the popedom for that power belongeth to everi christian soveraign within the bound of hi own empir and is insepar from the soveraignti befor the peopl of israel had by the command of god to samuel set over themselv a king after the manner of other nation the high priest had the civil govern and none but he could make nor depos an inferiour priest but that power wa afterward in the king as mai be prove by thi same argument of bellarmin for if the priest be he the high priest or ani other had hi jurisdict immedi from god then the king could not take it from him for he could do noth contrari to god ordin but it is certain that king solomon king depriv abiathar the high priest of hi offic and place zadok vers in hi room king therefor mai in the like manner ordain and depriv bishop as thei shall think fit for the well govern of their subject hi sixth argument is thi if bishop have their jurisdict de jure divino that is immedi from god thei that maintain it should bring some word of god to prove it but thei can bring none the argument is good i have therefor noth to sai against it but it is an argument no less good to prove the pope himself to have no jurisdict in the dominion of ani other princ lastli hee bringeth for argument the testimoni of two pope innoc and leo and i doubt not but hee might have alledg with as good reason the testimoni of all the pope almost sinc s peter for consid the love of power natur implant in mankind whosoev were made pope he would be tempt to uphold the same opinion nevertheless thei should therein but doe as innoc and leo did bear witness of themselv and therefor their wit should not be good of the pope temporal power in the fift book he hath four conclus the first is that the pope in not lord of all the world the second that the pope is not lord of all the christian world the third that the pope without hi own territori ha not ani temporal jurisdict directli these three conclus ar easili grant the fourth is that the pope ha in the dominion of other princ the suprem temporal power indirectli which is deni unless he mean by indirectli that he ha gotten it by indirect mean then is that also grant but i understand that when he saith he hath it indirectli he mean that such temporal jurisdict belongeth to him of right but that thi right is but a consequ of hi pastoral author the which he could not exercis unless he have the other with it and therefor to the pastoral power which he call spiritual the suprem power civil is necessarili annex and that therebi hee hath a right to chang kingdom give them to on and take them from anoth when he shall think it conduc to the salvat of soul befor i come to consid the argument by which hee would prove thi doctrin it will not bee amiss to lai open the consequ of it that princ and state that have the civil soveraignti in their several commonwealth mai bethink themselv whether it bee conveni for them and conduc to the good of their subject of whom thei ar to give an account at the dai of judgment to admit the same when it is said the pope hath not in the territori of other state the suprem civil power directli we ar to understand he doth not challeng it as other civil soveraign doe from the original submiss thereto of those that ar to be govern for it is evid and ha alreadi been suffici in thi treatis demonstr that the right of all soveraign is deriv origin from the consent of everi on of those that ar to bee govern whether thei that choos him doe it for their common defenc against an enemi as when thei agre amongst themselv to appoint a man or an assembl of men to protect them or whether thei doe it to save their live by submiss to a conquer enemi the pope therefor when he disclaimeth the suprem civil power over other state directli denyeth no more but that hi right cometh to him by that wai he ceaseth not for all that to claim it anoth wai and that is without the consent of them that ar to be govern by a right given him by god which hee calleth indirectli in hi assumpt to the papaci but by what wai soever he pretend the power is the same and he mai if it bee grant to be hi right depos princ and state as often as it is for the salvat of soul that is as often as he will for he claimeth also the sole power to judg whether it be to the salvat of men soul or not and thi is the doctrin not on that bellarmin here and mani other doctor teach in their sermon and book but also that some councel have decre and the pope have decre and the pope have accordingli when the occas hath serv them put in practis for the fourth councel of lateran held under pope innoc the third in the third chap de haeretici hath thi canon if a king at the pope admonit doe not purg hi kingdom of haeretiqu and be excommun for the same make not satisfact within a year hi subject ar absolv of their obedi and the practis hereof hath been seen on diver occas as in the depos of chilperiqu king of franc in the translat of the roman empir to charlemain in the oppress of john king of england in transfer the kingdom of navarr and of late year in the leagu against henri the third of franc and in mani more occurr i think there be few princ that consid not thi as injust and inconveni but i wish thei would all resolv to be king or subject men cannot serv two master thei ought therefor to eas them either by hold the rein of govern wholli in their own hand or by wholli deliv them into the hand of the pope that such men as ar will to be obedi mai be protect in their obedi for thi distinct of temporal and spiritual power is but word power is as realli divid and as danger to all purpos by share with anoth indirect power as with a direct on but to come now to hi argument the first is thi the civil power is subject to the spiritual therefor he that hath the suprem power spiritual hath right to command temporal princ and dispos of their temporal in order to the spiritual as for the distinct of temporal and spiritual let us consid in what sens it mai be said intellig that the temporal or civil power is subject to the spiritual there be but two wai that those word can be made sens for when wee sai on power is subject to anoth power the mean either is that he which hath the on is subject to him that hath the other or that the on power is to the other as the mean to the end for wee cannot understand that on power hath power over anoth power and that on power can have right or command over anoth for subject command right and power ar accid not of power but of person on power mai be subordin to anoth as the art of a sadler to the art of a rider if then it be grant that the civil govern be ordain as a mean to bring us to a spiritual felic yet it doe not follow that if a king have the civil power and the pope the spiritual that therefor the king is bound to obei the pope more then everi sadler is bound to obei everi rider therefor as from subordin of an art cannot be infer the subject of the professor so from the subordin of a govern cannot be infer the subject of the governor when therefor he saith the civil power is subject to the spiritual hi mean is that the civil soveraign is subject to the spiritual soveraign and the argument stand thu the civil soveraign is subject to the spiritual therefor the spiritual princ mai command temporal princ where the conclus is the same with the anteced he should have prove but to prove it he alledgeth first thi reason king and pope clergi and laiti make but on commonwealth that is to sai but on church and in all bodi the member depend on upon anoth but thing spiritual depend not of thing temporal therefor temporal depend on spiritual and therefor ar subject to them in which argument there be two gross errour on is that all christian king pope clergi and all other christian men make but on commonwealth for it is evid that franc is on commonwealth spain anoth and venic a third c and these consist of christian and therefor also ar several bodi of christian that is to sai several church and their several soveraign repres them wherebi thei ar capabl of command and obei of do and suffer as a natur man which no general or universal church is till it have a represent which it hath not on earth for if it had there is no doubt but that all christendom were on commonwealth whose soveraign were that represent both in thing spiritual and temporal and the pope to make himself thi represent wanteth three thing that our saviour hath not given him to command and to judg and to punish otherwis than by excommun to run from those that will not learn of him for though the pope were christ on vicar yet he cannot exercis hi govern till our saviour second come and then also it is not the pope but st peter himself with the other apostl that ar to be judg of the world the other errour in thi hi first argument is that he say the member of everi commonwealth as of a natural bodi depend on of anoth it is true thei cohaer togeth but thei depend on on the soveraign which is the soul of the commonwealth which fail the commonwealth is dissolv into a civil war no on man so much as cohaer to anoth for want of a common depend on a known soveraign just as the member of the natural bodi dissolv into earth for want of a soul to hold them togeth therefor there is noth in thi similitud from whenc to inferr a depend of the laiti on the clergi or of the temporal offic on the spiritual but of both on the civil soveraign which ought inde to direct hi civil command to the salvat of soul but is not therefor subject to ani but god himself and thu you see the labour fallaci of the first argument to deceiv such men as distinguish not between the subordin of action in the wai to the end and the subject of person on to anoth in the administr of the mean for to everi end the mean ar determin by natur or by god himself supernatur but the power to make men us the mean is in everi nation resign by the law of natur which forbiddeth men to violat their faith given to the civil soveraign hi second argument is thi everi commonwealth becaus it is suppos to be perfect and suffici in it self mai command ani other commonwealth not subject to it and forc it to chang the administr of the govern nai depos the princ and set anoth in hi room if it cannot otherwis defend it self against the injuri he goe about to doe them much more mai a spiritual commonwealth command a temporal on to chang the administr of their govern and mai depos princ and institut other when thei cannot otherwis defend the spiritual good that a commonwealth to defend it self against injuri mai lawfulli doe all that he hath here said is veri true and hath alreadi in that which hath gone befor been suffici demonstr and if it were also true that there is now in thi world a spiritual commonwealth distinct from a civil commonwealth then might the princ thereof upon injuri done him or upon want of caution that injuri be not done him in time to come repair and secur himself by warr which is in summ depos kill or subdu or do ani act of hostil but by the same reason it would be no less lawful for a civil soveraign upon the like injuri done or fear to make warr upon the spiritual soveraign which i beleev is more than cardinal bellarmin would have infer from hi own proposit but spiritual commonwealth there is none in thi world for it is the same thing with the kingdom of christ which he himself saith is not of thi world but shall be in the next world at the resurrect when thei that have live justli and beleev that he wa the christ shall though thei di natural bodi rise spiritual bodi and then it is that our saviour shall judg the world and conquer hi adversari and make a spiritual commonwealth in the mean time see there ar no men on earth whose bodi ar spiritual there can be no spiritual commonwealth amongst men that ar yet in the flesh unless wee call preacher that have commiss to teach and prepar men for their recept into the kingdom of christ at the resurrect a commonwealth which i have prove to bee none the third argument is thi it is not lawful for christian to toler an infidel or haeretical king in case he endeavour to draw them to hi haeresi or infidel but to judg whether a king draw hi subject to haeresi or not belongeth to the pope therefor hath the pope right to determin whether the princ be to be depos or not depos to thi i answer that both these assert ar fals for christian or men of what religion soever if thei toler not their king whatsoev law hee maketh though it bee concern religion doe violat their faith contrari to the divin law both natural and posit nor is there ani judg of haeresi amongst subject but their own civil soveraign for haeresi is noth els but a privat opinion obstin maintain contrari to the opinion which the publiqu person that is to sai the represent of the commonwealth hath command to bee taught by which it is manifest that an opinion publiqu appoint to bee taught cannot be haeresi nor the soveraign princ that author them haeretiqu for haeretiqu ar none but privat men that stubbornli defend some doctrin prohibit by their law soveraign but to prove that christian ar not to toler infidel or haeretical king he alledgeth a place in deut where god forbiddeth the jew when thei shall set a king over themselv to choos a stranger and from thenc inferreth that it is unlawful for a christian to choos a king that is not a christian and ti true that he that is a christian that is hee that hath alreadi oblig himself to receiv our saviour when he shall come for hi king shal tempt god too much in choos for king in thi world on that hee knoweth will endeavour both by terrour and perswas to make him violat hi faith but it is saith hee the same danger to choos on that is not a christian for king and not to depos him when hee is chosen to thi i sai the question is not of the danger of not depos but of the justic of depos him to choos him mai in some case bee unjust but to depos him when he is chosen is in no case just for it is alwai violat of faith and consequ against the law of natur which is the etern law of god nor doe wee read that ani such doctrin wa account christian in the time of the apostl nor in the time of the roman emperour till the pope had the civil soveraignti of rome but to thi he hath repli that the christian of old depos not nero nor diocletian nor julian nor valen an arrian for thi caus on that thei want temporal forc perhap so but did our saviour who for call for might have had twelv legion of immortal invulner angel to assist him want forc to depos caesar or at least pilat that unjustli without find fault in him deliv him to the jew to bee crucifi or if the apostl want temporal forc to depos nero wa it therefor necessari for them in their epistl to the new made christian to teach them as thei did to obei the power constitut over them whereof nero in that time wa on and that thei ought to obei them not for fear of their wrath but for conscienc sake shall we sai thei did not on obei but also teach what thei meant not for want of strength it is not therefor for want of strength but for conscienc sake that christian ar to toler their heathen princ or princ for i cannot call ani on whose doctrin is the publiqu doctrin an haeretiqu that author the teach of an errour and wherea for the temporal power of the pope he alledgeth further that st paul cor appoint judg under the heathen princ of those time such as were not ordain by those princ it is not true for st paul doe but advis them to take some of their brethren to compound their differ as arbitr rather than to goe to law on with anoth befor the heathen judg which is a wholsom precept and full of chariti fit to bee practis also in the best christian commonwealth and for the danger that mai aris to religion by the subject toler of an heathen or an er princ it is a point of which a subject is no compet judg or if hee bee the pope temporal subject mai judg also of the pope doctrin for everi christian princ as i have formerli prove is no less suprem pastor of hi own subject than the pope of hi the fourth argument is taken from the baptism of king wherein that thei mai be made christian thei submit their scepter to christ and promis to keep and defend the christian faith thi is true for christian king ar no more but christ subject but thei mai for all that bee the pope fellow for thei ar suprem pastor of their own subject and the pope is no more but king and pastor even in rome it self the fifth argument is drawn from the word spoken by our saviour feed my sheep by which wa give all power necessari for a pastor as the power to chase awai wolv such as ar haeretiqu the power to shut up ramm if thei be mad or push at the other sheep with their horn such as ar evil though christian king and power to give the flock conveni food from whenc hee inferreth that st peter had these three power given him by christ to which i answer that the last of these power is no more than the power or rather command to teach for the first which is to chase awai wolv that is haeretiqu the place hee quoteth is matth bewar of fals prophet which come to you in sheep cloth but inwardli ar raven wolv but neither ar haeretiqu fals prophet or at all prophet nor admit haeretiqu for the wolv there meant were the apostl command to kill them or if thei were king to depos them but to bewar of fly and avoid them nor wa it to st peter nor to ani of the apostl but to the multitud of the jew that follow him into the mountain men for the most part not yet convert that hee gave thi counsel to bewar of fals prophet which therefor if it conferr a power of chase awai king wa given not on to privat men but to men that were not at all christian and as to the power of separ and shut up of furiou ramm by which hee meaneth christian king that refus to submit themselv to the roman pastor our saviour refus to take upon him that power in thi world himself but advis to let the corn and tare grow up togeth till the dai of judgment much less did hee give it to st peter or can s peter give it to the pope st peter and all other pastor ar bidden to esteem those christian that disobei the church that is that disobei the christian soveraign as heathen men and as publican see then men challeng to the pope no author over heathen princ thei ought to challeng none over those that ar to bee esteem as heathen but from the power to teach on hee inferreth also a coerciv power in the pope over king the pastor saith he must give hi flock conveni food therefor the pope mai and ought to compel king to doe their duti out of which it followeth that the pope as pastor of christian men is king of king which all christian king ought inde either to confess or els thei ought to take upon themselv the suprem pastoral charg everi on in hi own dominion hi sixth and last argument is from exampl to which i answer first that exampl prove noth secondli that the exampl he alledgeth make not so much as a probabl of right the fact of jehoiada in kill athaliah king wa either by the author of king joash or it wa a horribl crime in the high priest which ever after the elect of king saul wa a mere subject the fact of st ambros in excommun theodosiu the emperour if it were true hee did so wa a capital crime and for the pope gregori greg zachari and leo their judgment ar void as given in their own caus and the act done by them conform to thi doctrin ar the greatest crime especi that of zachari that ar incid to human natur and thu much of power ecclesiastical wherein i had been more brief forbear to examin these argument of bellarmin if thei had been hi as a privat man and not as the champion of the papaci against all other christian princ and state chapter xliii of what is necessari for a man recept into the kingdom of heaven the difficulti of obei god and man both at onc the most frequent praetext of sedit and civil warr in christian commonwealth hath a long time proceed from a difficulti not yet suffici resolv of obei at onc both god and man then when their command ar on contrari to the other it is manifest enough that when a man receiveth two contrari command and know that on of them is god he ought to obei that and not the other though it be the command even of hi lawful soveraign whether a monarch or a soveraign assembl or the command of hi father the difficulti therefor consisteth in thi that men when thei ar command in the name of god know not in diver case whether the command be from god or whether he that commandeth doe but abus god name for some privat end of hi own for as there ware in the church of the jew mani fals prophet that sought reput with the peopl by feign dream and vision so there have been in all time in the church of christ fals teacher that seek reput with the peopl by phantastical and fals doctrin and by such reput as is the natur of ambit to govern them for their privat benefit is none to them that distinguish between what is and what is not necessari to salvat but thi difficulti of obei both god and the civil soveraign on earth to those that can distinguish between what is necessari and what is not necessari for their recept into the kingdom of god is of no moment for if the command of the civil soveraign bee such as that it mai be obei without the forfeitur of life eternal not to obei it is unjust and the precept of the apostl take place servant obei your master in all thing and children obei your parent in all thing and the precept of our saviour the scribe and pharise sit in mose chair all therefor thei shall sai that observ and doe but if the command be such as cannot be obei without be damn to eternal death then it were madness to obei it and the counsel of our saviour take place mat fear not those that kill the bodi but cannot kill the soul all men therefor that would avoid both the punish that ar to be in thi world inflict for disobedi to their earthli soveraign and those that shall be inflict in the world to come for disobedi to god have need be taught to distinguish well between what is and what is not necessari to eternal salvat all that is necessari to salvat is contain in faith and obedi all that is necessari to salvat is contain in two vertu faith in christ and obedi to law the latter of these if it were perfect were enough to us but becaus wee ar all guilti of disobedi to god law not on origin in adam but also actual by our own transgress there is requir at our hand now not on obedi for the rest of our time but also a remiss of sin for the time past which remiss is the reward of our faith in christ that noth els is necessarili requir to salvat is manifest from thi that the kingdom of heaven is shut to none but to sinner that is to sai to the disobedi or transgressor of the law nor to them in case thei repent and beleev all the articl of christian faith necessari to salvat what obedi is necessari the obedi requir at our hand by god that accepteth in all our action the will for the deed is a seriou endeavour to obei him and is call also by all such name as signifi that endeavour and therefor obedi is sometim call by the name of chariti and love becaus thei impli a will to obei and our saviour himself maketh our love to god and to on anoth a fulfil of the whole law and sometim by the name of righteousness for righteousness is but the will to give to everi on hi own that is to sai the will to obei the law and sometim by the name of repent becaus to repent implyeth a turn awai from sinn which is the same with the return of the will to obedi whosoev therefor unfeignedli desireth to fulfil the command of god or repenteth him trueli of hi transgress or that loveth god with all hi heart and hi neighbor as himself hath all the obedi necessari to hi recept into the kingdom of god for if god should requir perfect innoc there could no flesh be save and to what law but what command ar those that god hath given us ar all those law which were given to the jew by the hand of mose the command of god if thei bee why ar not christian taught to obei them if thei be not what other ar so besid the law of natur for our saviour christ hath not given us new law but counsel to observ those wee ar subject to that is to sai the law of natur and the law of our several soveraign nor did he make ani new law to the jew in hi sermon on the mount but on expound the law of mose to which thei were subject befor the law of god therefor ar none but the law of natur whereof the principal is that we should not violat our faith that is a command to obei our civil soveraign which wee constitut over us by mutual pact on with anoth and thi law of god that commandeth obedi to the law civil commandeth by consequ obedi to all the precept of the bibl which as i have prove in the preced chapter is there on law where the civil soveraign hath made it so and in other place but counsel which a man at hi own peril mai without injustic refus to obei in the faith of a christian who is the person beleev know now what is the obedi necessari to salvat and to whom it is due we ar to consid next concern faith whom and why we beleev and what ar the articl or point necessarili to be beleev by them that shall be save and first for the person whom we beleev becaus it is imposs to beleev ani person befor we know what he saith it is necessari he be on that wee have heard speak the person therefor whom abraham isaac jacob mose and the prophet beleev wa god himself that spake unto them supernatur and the person whom the apostl and discipl that convers with christ beleev wa our saviour himself but of them to whom neither god the father nor our saviour ever spake it cannot be said that the person whom thei beleev wa god thei beleev the apostl and after them the pastor and doctor of the church that recommend to their faith the histori of the old and new testament so that the faith of christian ever sinc our saviour time hath had for foundat first the reput of their pastor and afterward the author of those that made the old and new testament to be receiv for the rule of faith which none could do but christian soveraign who ar therefor the suprem pastor and the on person whom christian now hear speak from god except such as god speaketh to in these dai supernatur but becaus there be mani fals prophet gone out into the world other men ar to examin such spirit as st john advis us epistl chap ver whether thei be of god or not and therefor see the examin of doctrin belongeth to the suprem pastor the person which all thei that have no special revel ar to beleev is in everi commonwealth the suprem pastor that is to sai the civil soveraign the caus of christian faith the caus why men beleev ani christian doctrin ar variou for faith is the gift of god and he worketh it in each several man by such way as it seemeth good unto himself the most ordinari immedi caus of our beleef concern ani point of christian faith is that wee beleev the bibl to be the word of god but why wee beleev the bibl to be the word of god is much disput as all question must need bee that ar not well state for thei make not the question to be why we beleev it but how wee know it as if beleev and know were all on and thenc while on side ground their knowledg upon the infal of the church and the other side on the testimoni of the privat spirit neither side concludeth what it pretend for how shall a man know the infal of the church but by know first the infal of the scriptur or how shall a man know hi own privat spirit to be other than a beleef ground upon the author and argument of hi teacher or upon a presumpt of hi own gift besid there is noth in the scriptur from which can be infer the infal of the church much less of ani particular church and least of all the infal of ani particular man faith come by hear it is manifest therefor that christian men doe not know but on beleev the scriptur to be the word of god and that the mean of make them beleev which god is pleas to afford men ordinarili is accord to the wai of natur that is to sai from their teacher it is the doctrin of st paul concern christian faith in general rom faith cometh by hear that is by hear our lawful pastor he saith also ver of the same chapter how shall thei beleev in him of whom thei have not heard and how shall thei hear without a preacher and how shall thei preach except thei be sent wherebi it is evid that the ordinari caus of beleev that the scriptur ar the word of god is the same with the caus of the beleev of all other articl of our faith name the hear of those that ar by the law allow and appoint to teach us as our parent in their hous and our pastor in the church which also is made more manifest by experi for what other caus can there bee assign why in christian commonwealth all men either beleev or at least profess the scriptur to bee the word of god and in other commonwealth scarc ani but that in christian commonwealth thei ar taught it from their infanc and in other place thei ar taught otherwis but if teach be the caus of faith why doe not all beleev it is certain therefor that faith is the gift of god and hee giveth it to whom he will nevertheless becaus of them to whom he giveth it he giveth it by the mean of teacher the immedi caus of faith is hear in a school where mani ar taught and some profit other profit not the caus of learn in them that profit is the master yet it cannot be thenc infer that learn is not the gift of god all good thing proce from god yet cannot all that have them sai thei ar inspir for that impli a gift supernatural and the immedi hand of god which he that pretend to pretend to be a prophet and is subject to the examin of the church but whether men know or beleev or grant the scriptur to be the word of god if out of such place of them as ar without obscur i shall shew what articl of faith ar necessari and on necessari for salvat those men must need know beleev or grant the same the on necessari articl of christian faith the unum necessarium on articl of faith which the scriptur maketh simpli necessari to salvat is thi that jesu is the christ by the name of christ is understood the king which god had befor promis by the prophet of the old testament to send into the world to reign over the jew and over such of other nation as should beleev in him under himself etern and to give them that eternal life which wa lost by the sin of adam which when i have prove out of scriptur i will further shew when and in what sens some other articl mai bee also call necessari prove from the scope of the evangelist for proof that the beleef of thi articl jesu is the christ is all the faith requir to salvat my first argument shall bee from the scope of the evangelist which wa by the descript of the life of our saviour to establish that on articl jesu is the christ the summ of st matthew gospel is thi that jesu wa of the stock of david born of a virgin which ar the mark of the true christ that the magi came to worship him as king of the jew that herod for the same caus sought to kill him that john baptist proclaim him that he preach by himself and hi apostl that he wa that king that he taught the law not as a scribe but as a man of author that he cure diseas by hi word on and did mani other miracl which were foretold the christ should doe that he wa salut king when he enter into jerusalem that he forewarn them to bewar of all other that should pretend to be christ that he wa taken accus and put to death for sai hee wa king that the caus of hi condemn written on the cross wa jesu of nazareth the king of the jew all which tend to no other end than thi that men should beleev that jesu is the christ such therefor wa the scope of st matthew gospel but the scope of all the evangelist as mai appear by read them wa the same therefor the scope of the whole gospel wa the establish of that on articl and st john express make it hi conclus john these thing ar written that you mai know that jesu is the christ the son of the live god from the sermon of the apostl my second argument is taken from the subject of the sermon of the apostl both whilest our saviour live on earth and after hi ascens the apostl in our saviour time were sent luke to preach the kingdom of god for neither there nor mat giveth he ani commiss to them other than thi as ye go preach sai the kingdom of heaven is at hand that is that jesu is the messiah the christ the king which wa to come that their preach also after hi ascens wa the same is manifest out of act thei drew saith st luke jason and certain brethren unto the ruler of the citi cry these that have turn the world upsid down ar come hither also whom jason hath receiv and these all do contrari to the decre of caesar sai that there is anoth king on jesu and out of the vers of the same chapter where it is said that st paul as hi manner wa went in unto them and three sabbath day reason with them out of the scriptur open and alledg that christ must need have suffer and risen again from the dead and that thi jesu whom he preach is christ from the easiness of the doctrin the third argument is from those place of scriptur by which all the faith requir to salvat is declar to be easi for if an inward assent of the mind to all the doctrin concern christian faith now taught whereof the greatest part ar disput were necessari to salvat there would be noth in the world so hard as to be a christian the thief upon the cross though repent could not have been save for sai lord rememb me when thou commest into thy kingdom by which he testifi no beleef of ani other articl but thi that jesu wa the king nor could it bee said as it is mat that christ yoke is easi and hi burthen light nor that littl children beleev in him as it is matth nor could st paul have said cor it pleas god by the foolishness of preach to save them that beleev nor could st paul himself have been save much less have been so great a doctor of the church so suddenli that never perhap thought of transsubstanti nor purgatori nor mani other articl now obtrud from formal and cleer text the fourth argument is taken from place express and such as receiv no controversi of interpret as first john search the scriptur for in them yee think yee have eternal life and thei ar thei that testifi of mee our saviour here speaketh of the scriptur on of the old testament for the jew at that time could not search the scriptur of the new testament which were not written but the old testament hath noth of christ but the mark by which men might know him when hee came as that he should descend from david be born at bethlehem and of a virgin doe great miracl and the like therefor to beleev that thi jesu wa he wa suffici to eternal life but more than suffici is not necessari and consequ no other articl is requir again john whosoev liveth and beleeveth in mee shall not die etern therefor to beleev in christ is faith suffici to eternal life and consequ no more faith than that is necessari but to beleev in jesu and to beleev that jesu is the christ is all on as appeareth in the vers immedi follow for when our saviour vers had said to martha beleevest thou thi she answereth vers yea lord i beleev that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world therefor thi articl alon is faith suffici to life eternal and more than suffici is not necessari thirdli john these thing ar written that yee might beleev that jesu is the christ the son of god and that beleev yee might have life through hi name there to beleev that jesu is the christ is faith suffici to the obtain of life and therefor no other articl is necessari fourthli john everi spirit that confesseth that jesu christ is come in the flesh is of god and joh whosoev beleeveth that jesu is the christ is born of god and vers who is hee that overcommeth the world but he that beleeveth that jesu is the son of god fiftli act ver see saith the eunuch here is water what doth hinder me to be baptiz and philip said if thou beleevest with all thy heart thou mayst and hee answer and said i beleev that jesu christ is the son of god therefor thi articl beleev jesu is the christ is suffici to baptism that is to sai to our recept into the kingdom of god and by consequ on necessari and gener in all place where our saviour saith to ani man thy faith hath save thee the caus he saith it is some confess which directli or by consequ implyeth a beleef that jesu is the christ from that it is the foundat of all other articl the last argument is from the place where thi articl is made the foundat of faith for he that holdeth the foundat shall bee save which place ar first mat if ani man shall sai unto you loe here is christ or there beleev it not for there shall aris fals christ and fals prophet and shall shew great sign and wonder c here wee see thi articl jesu is the christ must bee held though hee that shall teach the contrari should doe great miracl the second place is gal though we or an angel from heaven preach ani other gospel unto you than that wee have preach unto you let him bee accurs but the gospel which paul and the other apostl preach wa on thi articl that jesu is the christ therefor for the beleef of thi articl we ar to reject the author of an angel from heaven much more of ani mortal man if he teach the contrari thi is therefor the fundamental articl of christian faith a third place is joh belov beleev not everi spirit herebi yee shall know the spirit of god everi spirit that confesseth that jesu christ is come in the flesh is of god by which it is evid that thi articl is the measur and rule by which to estim and examin all other articl and is therefor on fundamental a fourth is matt where after st peter had profess thi articl sai to our saviour thou art christ the son of the live god our saviour answer thou art peter and upon thi rock i will build my church from whenc i inferr that thi articl is that on which all other doctrin of the church ar built as on their foundat a fift is cor ver c other foundat can no man lai than that which is laid jesu is the christ now if ani man build upon thi foundat gold silver pretiou stone wood hai stubbl everi man work shall be made manifest for the dai shall declar it becaus it shall be reveal by fire and the fire shall try everi man work of what sort it is if ani man work abid which he hath built thereupon he shall receiv a reward if ani man work shall bee burnt he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be save yet so as by fire which word be partli plain and easi to understand and partli allegorical and difficult out of that which is plain mai be infer that pastor that teach thi foundat that jesu is the christ though thei draw from it fals consequ which all men ar sometim subject to thei mai nevertheless bee save much more that thei mai bee save who be no pastor but hearer beleev that which is by their lawful pastor taught them therefor the beleef of thi articl is suffici and by consequ there is no other articl of faith necessarili requir to salvat now for the part which is allegorical as that the fire shall try everi man work and that thei shall be save but so as by fire or through fire for the original is dia puro it maketh noth against thi conclus which i have drawn from the other word that ar plain nevertheless becaus upon thi place there hath been an argument taken to prove the fire of purgatori i will also here offer you my conjectur concern the mean of thi triall of doctrin and save of men as by fire the apostl here seemeth to allud to the word of the prophet zachari ch who speak of the restaur of the kingdom of god saith thu two part therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left therein and i will bring the third part through the fire and will refin them as silver is refin and will try them as gold is try thei shall call on the name of the lord and i will hear them the dai of judgment is the dai of the restaur of the kingdom of god and at that dai it is that st peter tell us pet v shall be the conflagr of the world wherein the wick shall perish but the remnant which god will save shall pass through that fire unhurt and be therein as silver and gold ar refin by the fire from their dross try and refin from their idolatri and be made to call upon the name of the true god allud whereto st paul here saith that the dai that is the dai of judgment the great dai of our saviour com to restor the kingdom of god in israel shall try everi man doctrin by judg which ar gold silver pretiou stone wood hai stubbl and then thei that have built fals consequ on the true foundat shall see their doctrin condemn nevertheless thei themselv shall be save and pass unhurt through thi universal fire and live etern to call upon the name of the true and on god in which sens there is noth that accordeth not with the rest of holi scriptur or ani glimps of the fire of purgatori in what sens other articl mai be call necessari but a man mai here ask whether it bee not as necessari to salvat to beleev that god is omnipot creator of the world that jesu christ is risen and that all men els shall rise again from the dead at the last dai as to beleev that jesu is the christ to which i answer thei ar and so ar mani more articl but thei ar such as ar contain in thi on and mai be deduc from it with more or less difficulti for who is there that doe not see that thei who beleev jesu to be the son of the god of israel and that the israelit had for god the omnipot creator of all thing doe therein also beleev that god is the omnipot creator of all thing or how can a man beleev that jesu is the king that shall reign etern unless hee beleev him also risen again from the dead for a dead man cannot exercis the offic of a king in summ he that holdeth thi foundat jesu is the christ holdeth express all that hee seeth rightli deduc from it and implicit all that is consequ thereunto though he have not skill enough to discern the consequ and therefor it holdeth still good that the beleef of thi on articl is suffici faith to obtain remiss of sinn to the penit and consequ to bring them into the kingdom of heaven that faith and obedi ar both of them necessari to salvat now that i have shewn that all the obedi requir to salvat consisteth in the will to obei the law of god that is to sai in repent and all the faith requir to the same is comprehend in the beleef of thi articl jesu is the christ i will further alledg those place of the gospel that prove that all that is necessari to salvat is contain in both these join togeth the men to whom st peter preach on the dai of pentecost next after the ascens of our saviour ask him and the rest of the apostl sai act men and brethren what shall we doe to whom st peter answer in the next vers repent and be baptiz everi on of you for the remiss of sin and ye shall receiv the gift of the holi ghost therefor repent and baptism that is beleev that jesu is the christ is all that is necessari to salvat again our saviour be ask by a certain ruler luke what shall i doe to inherit eternal life answer vers thou knowest the command doe not commit adulteri doe not kill doe not steal doe not bear fals witness honor thy father and thy mother which when he said he had observ our saviour ad sell all thou hast give it to the poor and come and follow me which wa as much as to sai rely on me that am the king therefor to fulfil the law and to beleev that jesu is the king is all that is requir to bring a man to eternal life thirdli st paul saith rom the just shall live by faith not everi on but the just therefor faith and justic that is the will to be just or repent ar all that is necessari to life eternal and mark our saviour preach sai the time is fulfil and the kingdom of god is at hand repent and beleev the evangil that is the good new that the christ wa come therefor to repent and to beleev that jesu is the christ is all that is requir to salvat what each of them contribut thereunto see then it is necessari that faith and obedi impli in the word repent do both concurr to our salvat the question by which of the two we ar justifi is impertin disput nevertheless it will not be impertin to make manifest in what manner each of them contribut thereunto and in what sens it is said that we ar to be justifi by the on and by the other and first if by righteousness be understood the justic of the work themselv there is no man that can be save for there is none that hath not transgress the law of god and therefor when wee ar said to be justifi by work it is to be understood of the will which god doth alwai accept for the work it self as well in good as in evil men and in thi sens on it is that a man is call just or unjust and that hi justic justifi him that is give him the titl in god accept of just and render him capabl of live by hi faith which befor he wa not so that justic justifi in that that sens in which to justifi is the same that to denomin a man just and not in the signif of discharg the law wherebi the punish of hi sin should be unjust but a man is then also said to be justifi when hi plea though in it self unsuffici is accept as when we plead our will our endeavour to fulfil the law and repent us of our fail and god accepteth it for the perform it self and becaus god accepteth not the will for the deed but on in the faithful it is therefor faith that make good our plea and in thi sens it is that faith on justifi so that faith and obedi ar both necessari to salvat yet in several sens each of them is said to justifi obedi to god and to the civil soveraign not inconsist whether christian have thu shewn what is necessari to salvat it is not hard to reconcil our obedi to the civil soveraign who is either christian or infidel if he bee a christian he alloweth the beleef of thi articl that jesu is the christ and of all the articl that ar contain in or ar evid consequ deduc from it which is all the faith necessari to salvat and becaus he is a soveraign he requireth obedi to all hi own that is to all the civil law in which also ar contain all the law of natur that is all the law of god for besid the law of natur and the law of the church which ar part of the civil law for the church that can make law is the commonwealth there bee no other law divin whosoev therefor obeyeth hi christian soveraign is not therebi hindr neither from beleev nor from obei god but suppos that a christian king should from thi foundat jesu is the christ draw some fals consequ that is to sai make some superstruct of hai or stubbl and command the teach of the same yet see st paul sai he shal be save much more shall he be save that teacheth them by hi command and much more yet he that teach not but on beleev hi lawful teacher and in case a subject be forbidden by the civil soveraign to profess some of those hi opinion upon what ground can he disobei christian king mai err in deduc a consequ but who shall judg shall a privat man judg when the question is of hi own obedi or shall ani man judg but he that is appoint thereto by the church that is by the civil soveraign that representeth it or if the pope or an apostl judg mai he not err in deduc of a consequ did not on of the two st peter or st paul err in a superstructur when st paul withstood st peter to hi face there can therefor be no contradict between the law of god and the law of a christian commonwealth or infidel and when the civil soveraign is an infidel everi on of hi own subject that resisteth him sinneth against the law of god for such as ar the law of natur and rejecteth the counsel of the apostl that admonisheth all christian to obei their princ and all children and servant to obei thei parent and master in all thing and for their faith it is internal and invis thei have the licenc that naaman had and need not put themselv into danger for it but if thei do thei ought to expect their reward in heaven and not complain of their lawful soveraign much less make warr upon him for he that is not glad of ani just occas of martyrdom ha not the faith be professeth but pretend it on to set some colour upon hi own contumaci but what infidel king is so unreason as know he ha a subject that waiteth for the second com of christ after the present world shall be burnt and intendeth then to obei him which is the intent of beleev that jesu is the christ and in the mean time thinketh himself bound to obei the law of that infidel king which all christian ar oblig in conscienc to doe to put to death or to persecut such a subject and thu much shall suffic concern the kingdom of god and polici ecclesiastical wherein i pretend not to advanc ani posit of my own but on to shew what ar the consequ that seem to me deduc from the principl of christian politiqu which ar the holi scriptur in confirm of the power of civil soveraign and the duti of their subject and in the alleg of scriptur i have endeavour to avoid such text as ar of obscur or controvert interpret and to alledg none but is such sens as is most plain and agreeabl to the harmoni and scope of the whole bibl which wa written for the reestablish of the kingdom of god in christ for it is not the bare word but the scope of the writer that giveth the true light by which ani write is to bee interpret and thei that insist upon singl text without consid the main design can deriv no thing from them cleerli but rather by cast atom of scriptur as dust befor men ey make everi thing more obscur than it is an ordinari artific of those that seek not the truth but their own advantag chapter xliv of spiritual darkness from misinterpret of scriptur the kingdom of darkness what besid these soveraign power divin and human of which i have hitherto discours there is mention in scriptur of anoth power name eph that of the ruler of the darkness of thi world mat the kingdom of satan and mat the princip of beelzebub over daemon that is to sai over phantasm that appear in the air for which caus satan is also call eph the princ of the power of the air and becaus he ruleth in the darkness of thi world joh the princ of thi world and in consequ hereunto thei who ar under hi dominion in opposit to the faithful who ar the children of the light ar call the children of darkness for see beelzebub is princ of phantasm inhabit of hi dominion of air and darkness the children of darkness and these daemon phantasm or spirit of illus signifi allegor the same thing thi consid the kingdom of darkness as it is set forth in these and other place of the scriptur is noth els but a confederaci of deceiv that to obtain dominion over men in thi present world endeavour by dark and erron doctrin to extinguish in them the light both of natur and of the gospel and so to disprepar them for the kingdom of god to come the church not yet fulli freed of darkness as men that ar utterli depriv from their nativ of the light of the bodili ey have no idea at all of ani such light and no man conceiv in hi imagin ani greater light than he hath at some time or other perceiv by hi outward sens so also is it of the light of the gospel and of the light of the understand that no man can conceiv there is ani greater degre of it than that which he hath alreadi attain unto and from henc it come to pass that men have no other mean to acknowledg their own darkness but on by reason from the unforseen mischanc that befal them in their wai the darkest part of the kingdom of satan is that which is without the church of god that is to sai amongst them that beleev not in jesu christ but we cannot sai that therefor the church enjoyeth as the land of goshen all the light which to the perform of the work enjoin us by god is necessari whenc come it that in christendom there ha been almost from the time of the apostl such justl of on anoth out of their place both by forraign and civil war such stumbl at everi littl asper of their own fortun and everi littl emin of that of other men and such divers of wai in run to the same mark felic if it be not night amongst us or at least a mist wee ar therefor yet in the dark four caus of spiritual darkness the enemi ha been here in the night of our natural ignor and sown the tare of spiritual error and that first by abus and put out the light of the scriptur for we err not know the scriptur secondli by introduc the daemonolog of the heathen poet that is to sai their fabul doctrin concern daemon which ar but idol or phantasm of the brain without ani reall natur of their own distinct from human fanci such as ar dead men ghost and fairi and other matter of old wive tale thirdli by mix with the scriptur diver reliqu of the religion and much of the vain and erron philosophi of the greek especi of aristotl fourthli by mingl with both these fals or uncertain tradit and fain or uncertain histori and so we come to err by give heed to seduc spirit and the daemonolog of such as speak li in hypocrisi or as it is in the original tim of those that plai the part of lyar with a sear conscienc that is contrari to their own knowledg concern the first of these which is the seduc of men by abus of scriptur i intend to speak briefli in thi chapter error from misinterpret the scriptur concern the kingdom of god the greatest and main abus of scriptur and to which almost all the rest ar either consequ or subservi is the wrest of it to prove that the kingdom of god mention so often in the scriptur is the present church or multitud of christian men now live or that be dead ar to rise again at the last dai wherea the kingdom of god wa first institut by the ministeri of mose over the jew on who were therefor call hi peculiar peopl and ceas afterward in the elect of saul when thei refus to be govern by god ani more and demand a king after the manner of the nation which god himself consent unto as i have more at larg prove befor in the chapter after that time there wa no other kingdom of god in the world by ani pact or otherwis than he ever wa is and shall be king of all men and of all creatur as govern accord to hi will by hi infinit power nevertheless he promis by hi prophet to restor thi hi govern to them again when the time he hath in hi secret counsel appoint for it shall bee fulli come and when thei shall turn unto him by repent and amend of life and not on so but he invit also the gentil to come in and enjoi the happiness of hi reign on the same condit of convers and repent and hee promis also to send hi son into the world to expiat the sin of them all by hi death and to prepar them by hi doctrin to receiv him at hi second come which second come not yet be the kingdom of god is not yet come and wee ar not now under ani other king by pact but our civil soveraign save on that christian men ar alreadi in the kingdom of grace in as much as thei have alreadi the promis of be receiv at hi com again as that the kingdom of god is the present church consequ to thi errour that the present church is christ kingdom there ought to be some on man or assembl by whose mouth our saviour now in heaven speaketh giveth law and which representeth hi person to all christian or diver men or diver assembl that doe the same to diver part of christendom thi power regal under christ be challeng univers by that pope and in particular commonwealth by assembl of the pastor of the place when the scriptur give it to none but to civil soveraign come to be so passion disput that it putteth out the light of natur and causeth so great a darkness in men understand that thei see not who it is to whom thei have engag their obedi and that the pope is hi vicar general consequ to thi claim of the pope to vicar general of christ in the present church suppos to be that kingdom of hi to which we ar address in the gospel is the doctrin that it is necessari for a christian king to receiv hi crown by a bishop as if it were from that ceremoni that he deriv the claus of dei gratia in hi titl and that then on he is made king by the favour of god when he is crown by the author of god universal vicereg on earth and that everi bishop whosoev be hi soveraign taketh at hi consecr an oath of absolut obedi to the pope consequ to the same is the doctrin of the fourth councel of lateran held under pope innoc the third chap de haeretici that if a king at the pope admonit doe not purg hi kingdom of haeresi and be excommun for the same doe not give satisfact within a year hi subject ar absolv of the bond of their obedi where by haeresi ar understood all opinion which the church of rome hath forbidden to be maintain and by thi mean as often as there is ani repugn between the political design of the pope and other christian princ as there is veri often there ariseth such a mist amongst their subject that thei know not a stranger that thrusteth himself into the throne of their lawful princ from him whom thei had themselv place there and in thi darkness of mind ar made to fight on against anoth without discern their enemi from their friend under the conduct of anoth man ambit and that the pastor ar the clergi from the same opinion that the present church is the kingdom of god it proce that pastour deacon and all other minist of the church take the name to themselv of the clergi give to other christian the name of laiti that is simpli peopl for clergi signifi those whose mainten is that revenu which god have reserv to himself dure hi reign over the israelit assign to the tribe of levi who were to be hi publiqu minist and had no portion of land set them out to live on as their brethren to be their inherit the pope therefor pretend the present church to be as the realm of israel the kingdom of god challeng to himself and hi subordin minist the like revenu as the inherit of god the name of clergi wa sutabl to that claim and thenc it is that tith or other tribut paid to the levit as god right amongst the israelit have a long time been demand and taken of christian by ecclesiastiqu jure divino that is in god right by which mean the peopl everi where were oblig to a doubl tribut on to the state anoth to the clergi whereof that to the clergi be the tenth of their revenu is doubl to that which a king of athen and esteem a tyrant exact of hi subject for the defrai of all publiqu charg for he demand no more but the twentieth part and yet abundantli maintain therewith the commonwealth and in the kingdom of the jew dure the sacerdotal reign of god the tith and offer were the whole publiqu revenu from the same mistak of the present church for the kingdom of god came in the distinct between the civil and the canon law the civil law be the act of soveraign in their own dominion and the canon law be the act of the pope in the same dominion which canon though thei were but canon that is rule propound and but voluntarili receiv by christian princ till the translat of the empir to charlemain yet afterward as the power of the pope encreas becam rule command and the emperour themselv to avoyd greater mischief which the peopl blind might be led into were forc to let them pass for law from henc it is that in all dominion where the pope ecclesiastical power is entir receiv jew turk and gentil ar in the roman church toler in their religion as farr forth as in the exercis and profess thereof thei offend not against the civil power wherea in a christian though a stranger not to be of the roman religion is capital becaus the pope pretendeth that all christian ar hi subject for otherwis it were as much against the law of nation to persecut a christian stranger for profess the religion of hi own countri as an infidel or rather more in as much as thei that ar not against christ ar with him from the same it is that in everi christian state there ar certain men that ar exempt by ecclesiastical liberti from the tribut and from the tribun of the civil state for so ar the secular clergi besid monk and friar which in mani place bear so great a proport to the common peopl as if need were there might be rais out of them alon an armi suffici for ani warr the church milit should imploi them in against their own or other princ error from mistak consecr for conjur a second general abus of scriptur is the turn of consecr into conjur or enchant to consecr is in scriptur to offer give or dedic in piou and decent languag and gestur a man or ani other thing to god by separ of it from common us that is to sai to sanctifi or make it god and to be us onli by those whom god hath appoint to be hi publik minist as i have alreadi prove at larg in the chapter and therebi to chang not the thing consecr but on the us of it from be profan and common to be holi and peculiar to god servic but when by such word the natur of qualiti of the thing it self is pretend to be chang it is not consecr but either an extraordinari work of god or a vain and impiou conjur but see for the frequenc of pretend the chang of natur in their consecr it cannot be esteem a work extraordinari it is no other than a conjur or incant wherebi thei would have men to beleev an alter of natur that is not contrari to the testimoni of man sight and of all the rest of hi sens as for exampl when the priest in stead of consecr bread and wine to god peculiar servic in the sacrament of the lord supper which is but a separ of it from the common us to signifi that is to put men in mind of their redempt by the passion of christ whose bodi wa broken and blood shed upon the cross for our transgress pretend that by sai of the word of our saviour thi is my bodi and thi is my blood the natur of bread is no more there but hi veri bodi notwithstand there appear not to the sight or other sens of the receiv ani thing that appeareth not befor the consecr the egyptian conjur that ar said to have turn their rod to serpent and the water into bloud ar thought but to have delud the sens of the spectat by a fals shew of thing yet ar esteem enchant but what should wee have thought of them if there had appear in their rod noth like a serpent and in the water enchant noth like bloud nor like ani thing els but water but that thei had face down the king that thei were serpent that look like rod and that it wa bloud that seem water that had been both enchant and ly and yet in thi daili act of the priest thei doe the veri same by turn the holi word into the manner of a charm which produceth noth now to the sens but thei face us down that it hath turn the bread into a man nai more into a god and requir men to worship it as if it were our saviour himself present god and man and therebi to commit most gross idolatri for if it bee enough to excus it of idolatri to sai it is no more bread but god why should not the same excus serv the egyptian in case thei had the face to sai the leek and onyon thei worship were not veri leek and onyon but a divin under their speci or likeness the word thi is my bodi ar aequival to these thi signifi or repres my bodi and it is an ordinari figur of speech but to take it liter is an abus nor though so taken can it extend ani further than to the bread which christ himself with hi own hand consecr for hee never said that of what bread soever ani priest whatsoev should sai thi is my bodi or thi is christ bodi the same should present be transubstanti nor did the church of rome ever establish thi transubstanti till the time of innoc the third which wa not abov year ago when the power of pope wa at the highest and the darkness of the time grown so great as men discern not the bread that wa given them to eat especi when it wa stamp with the figur of christ upon the cross as if thei would have men beleev it were transubstanti not on into the bodi of christ but also into the wood of hi cross and that thei did eat both togeth in the sacrament incant in the ceremoni of baptism the like incant in stead of consecr is us also in the sacrament of baptism where the abus of god name in each several person and in the whole triniti with the sign of the cross at each name maketh up the charm as first when thei make the holi water the priest saith i conjur thee thou creatur of water in the name of god the father almighti and in the name of jesu christ hi on son our lord and in vertu of the holi ghost that thou becom conjur water to drive awai all the power of the enemi and to erad and supplant the enemi c and the same in the benedict of the salt to be mingl with it that thou becom conjur salt that all phantasm and knaveri of the devil fraud mai fly and depart from the place wherein thou art sprinkl and everi unclean spirit bee conjur by him that shall come to judg the quick and the dead the same in the benedict of the oyl that all the power of the enemi all the host of the devil all assault and phantasm of satan mai be driven awai by thi creatur of oyl and for the infant that is to be baptiz he is subject to mani charm first at the church dore the priest blow thrice in the child face and say goe out of him unclean spirit and give place to the holi ghost the comfort as if all children till blown on by the priest were daemoniaqu again befor hi entranc into the church he saith as befor i conjur thee c to goe out and depart from thi servant of god and again the same exorcism is repeat onc more befor he be baptiz these and some other incant and consecr in administr of the sacrament of baptism and the lord supper wherein everi thing that serveth to those holi men except the unhallow spittl of the priest hath some set form of exorcism in marriag in visit of the sick and in consecr of place nor ar the other rite as of marriag of extrem unction of visit of the sick of consecr church and churchyard and the like exempt from charm in as much as there is in them the us of enchant oyl and water with the abus of the cross and of the holi word of david asperg me domin hyssopo as thing of efficaci to drive awai phantasm and imagineri spirit error from mistak eternal life and everlast death anoth general error is from the misinterpret of the word eternal life everlast death and the second death for though we read plainli in holi scriptur that god creat adam in an estat of live for ever which wa conditional that is to sai if he disobei not hi command which wa not essential to human natur but consequ to the vertu of the tree of life whereof hee had liberti to eat as long as hee had not sin and that hee wa thrust out of paradis after he had sin lest hee should eat thereof and live for ever and that christ passion is a discharg of sin to all that beleev on him and by consequ a restitut of eternal life to all the faithful and to them on yet the doctrin is now and hath been a long time far otherwis name that everi man hath etern of life by natur in as much as hi soul is immortal so that the flame sword at the entranc of paradis though it hinder a man from come to the tree of life hinder him not from the immort which god took from him for hi sin nor make him to need the sacrif of christ for the recov of the same and consequ not on the faithful and righteou but also the wick and the heathen shall enjoi eternal life without ani death at all much less a second and everlast death to salv thi it is said that by second and everlast death is meant a second and everlast life but in torment a figur never us but in thi veri case all which doctrin is found on on some of the obscur place of the new testament which nevertheless the whole scope of the scriptur consid ar cleer enough in a differ sens and unnecessari to the christian faith for suppos that when a man di there remaineth noth of him but hi carkass cannot god that rais inanim dust and clai into a live creatur by hi word as easili rais a dead carkass to life again and continu him aliv for ever or make him die again by anoth word the soul in scriptur signifieth alwai either the life or the live creatur and the bodi and soul jointli the bodi aliv in the fift dai of the creation god said let the water produc reptil anima viventi the creep thing that hath in it a live soul the english translat it that hath life and again god creat whale omnem animam viventem which in the english is everi live creatur and likewis of man god made him of the dust of the earth and breath in hi face the breath of life factu est homo in animam viventem that is and man wa made a live creatur and after noah came out of the ark god saith hee will no more smite omnem animam viventem that is everi live creatur and deut eat not the bloud for the bloud is the soul that is the life from which place if by soul were meant a substanc incorporeal with an exist separ from the bodi it might as well be infer of ani other live creatur as of man but that the soul of the faithful ar not of their own natur but by god special grace to remain in their bodi from the resurrect to all etern i have alreadi i think suffici prove out of the scriptur in the chapter and for the place of the new testament where it is said that ani man shall be cast bodi and soul into hell fire it is no more than bodi and life that is to sai thei shall be cast aliv into the perpetual fire of gehenna as the doctrin of purgatori and exorcism and invoc of saint thi window it is that give entranc to the dark doctrin first of eternal torment and afterward of purgatori and consequ of the walk abroad especi in place consecr solitari or dark of the ghost of men deceas and therebi to the pretenc of exorcism and conjur of phantasm as also of invoc of men dead and to the doctrin of indulg that is to sai of exempt for a time or for ever from the fire of purgatori wherein these incorporeal substanc ar pretend by burn to be cleans and made fit for heaven for men be gener possess befor the time of our saviour by contagion of the daemonolog of the greek of an opinion that the soul of men were substanc distinct from their bodi and therefor that when the bodi wa dead the soul of everi man whether godli or wick must subsist somewher by vertu of it own natur without acknowledg therein ani supernatural gift of god the doctor of the church doubt a long time what wa the place which thei were to abid in till thei should be reunit to their bodi in the resurrect suppos for a while thei lai under the altar but afterward the church of rome found it more profit to build for them thi place of purgatori which by some other church in thi later ag ha been demolish the text alledg for the doctrin aforement have been answer befor let us now consid what text of scriptur seem most to confirm these three general error i have here touch as for those which cardinal bellarmin hath alledg for the present kingdom of god administr by the pope than which there ar none that make a better show of proof i have alreadi answer them and made it evid that the kingdom of god institut by mose end in the elect of saul after which time the priest of hi own author never depos ani king that which the high priest did to athaliah wa not done in hi own right but in the right of the young king joash her son but solomon in hi own right depos the high priest abiathar and set up anoth in hi place the most difficult place to answer of all those than can be brought to prove the kingdom of god by christ is alreadi in thi world is alledg not by bellarmin nor ani other of the church of rome but by beza that will have it to begin from the resurrect of christ but whether hee intend therebi to entitl the presbyteri to the suprem power ecclesiastical in the commonwealth of geneva and consequ to everi presbyteri in everi other commonwealth or to princ and other civil soveraign i doe not know for the presbyteri hath challeng the power to excommun their own king and to bee the suprem moder in religion in the place where thei have that form of church govern no less then the pope challengeth it univers answer to the text on which beza infereth that the kingdom of christ began at the resurrect the word ar mark verili i sai unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not tast of death till thei have seen the kingdom of god come with power which word if taken grammat make it certain that either some of those men that stood by christ at that time ar yet aliv or els that the kingdom of god must be now in thi present world and then there is anoth place more difficult for when the apostl after our saviour resurrect and immedi befor hi ascens ask our saviour sai act wilt thou at thi time restor again the kingdom to israel he answer them it is not for you to know the time and the season which the father hath put in hi own power but ye shall receiv power by the com of the holi ghost upon you and yee shall be my martyr wit both in jerusalem in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth which is as much as to sai my kingdom is not yet come nor shall you foreknow when it shall come for it shall come as a theef in the night but i will send you the holi ghost and by him you shall have power to bear witness to all the world by your preach of my resurrect and the work i have done and the doctrin i have taught that thei mai beleev in me and expect eternal life at my com again how doe thi agre with the com of christ kingdom at the resurrect and that which st paul sai thessal that thei turn from idol to serv the live and true god and to wait for hi sonn from heaven where to wait for hi sonn from heaven is to wait for hi com to be king in power which were not necessari if thi kingdom had been then present again if the kingdom of god began as beza on that place mark would have it at the resurrect what reason is there for christian ever sinc the resurrect to sai in their prayer let thy kingdom come it is therefor manifest that the word of st mark ar not so to be interpret there be some of them that stand here saith our saviour that shall not tast of death till thei have seen the kingdom of god come in power if then thi kingdom were to come at the resurrect of christ why is it said some of them rather than all for thei all live till after christ wa risen explic of the place in mark but thei that requir an exact interpret of thi text let them interpret first the like word of our saviour to st peter concern st john chap if i will that he tarri till i come what is that to thee upon which wa ground a report that hee should not dye nevertheless the truth of that report wa neither confirm as well ground nor refut as ill ground on those word but left as a sai not understood the same difficulti is also in the place of st mark and if it be lawful to conjectur at their mean by that which immedi follow both here and in st luke where the same is again repeat it is not unprob to sai thei have relat to the transfigur which is describ in the vers immedi follow where it is said that after six day jesu taketh with him peter and jame and john not all but some of hi discipl and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselv and wa transfigur befor them and hi rayment becam shine exceed white as snow so as no fuller on earth can white them and there appear unto them elia with mose and thei were talk with jesu c so that thei saw christ in glori and majesti as he is to come insomuch as thei were sore afraid and thu the promis of our saviour wa accomplish by wai of vision for it wa a vision as mai probabl bee infer out of st luke that reciteth the same stori ch ve and saith that peter and thei that were with him were heavi with sleep but most certainli out of matth where the same is again relat for our saviour charg them sai tell no man the vision until the son of man be risen from the dead howsoev it be yet there can from thenc be taken no argument to prove that the kingdom of god taketh begin till the dai of judgement abus of some other text in defenc of the power of the pope as for some other text to prove the pope power over civil soveraign besid those of bellarmin as that the two sword that christ and hi apostl had amongst them were the spiritual and the temporal sword which thei sai st peter had given him by christ and that of the two luminari the greater signifi the pope and the lesser the king on might as well inferr out of the first vers of the bibl that by heaven is meant the pope and by earth the king which is not argu from scriptur but a wanton insult over princ that came in fashion after the time the pope were grown so secur of their greatness as to contemn all christian king and tread on the neck of emperour to mock both them and the scriptur in the word of the psalm thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder the young lion and the dragon thou shalt trampl under thy feet the manner of consecr in the scriptur wa without exorc as for the rite of consecr though thei depend for the most part upon the discret and judgement of the governor of the church and not upon the scriptur yet those governor ar oblig to such direct as the natur of the action it self requireth as that the ceremoni word and gestur be both decent and signific or at least conform to the action when mose consecr the tabernacl the altar and the vessel belong to them exod he anoint them with the oyl which god had command to bee made for that purpos and thei were holi there wa noth exorcis to drive awai phantasm the same mose the civil soveraign of israel when he consecr aaron the high priest and hi son did wash them with water not exorcis water put their garment upon them and anoint them with oyl and thei were sanctifi to minist unto the lord in the priest offic which wa a simpl and decent cleans and adorn them befor hee present them to god to be hi servant when king solomon the civil soveraign of israel consecr the templ hee had built king he stood befor all the congreg of israel and have bless them he gave thank to god for put into the heart of hi father to build it and for give to himself the grace to accomplish the same and then prai unto him first to accept that hous though it were not sutabl to hi infinit greatness and to hear the prayer of hi servant that should prai therein or if thei were absent toward it and lastli he offer a sacrific of peaceoff and the hous wa dedic here wa no process the king stood still in hi first place no exorcis water no asperg me nor other impertin applic of word spoken upon anoth occas but a decent and rational speech and such as in make to god a present of hi new built hous wa most conform to the occas we read not that st john did exorcis the water of jordan nor philip the water of the river wherein he baptiz the eunuch nor that ani pastor in the time of the apostl did take hi spittl and put it to the nose of the person to be baptiz and sai in odorem suavitati that is for a sweet savour unto the lord wherein neither the ceremoni of spittl for the uncleanness nor the applic of that scriptur for the leviti can by ani author of man be justifi the immort of man soul not prove by scriptur to be of natur but of grace to prove that the soul separ from the bodi liveth etern not on the soul of the elect by especial grace and restaur of the eternal life which adam lost by sinn and our saviour restor by the sacrific of himself to the faithful but also the soul of reprob as a properti natur consequ to the essenc of mankind without other grace of god but that which is univers given to all mankind there ar diver place which at the first sight seem suffici to serv the turn but such as when i compar them with that which i have befor chapter alledg out of the of job seem to mee much more subject to a diver interpret than the word of job and first there ar the word of solomon ecclesiast then shall the dust return to dust as it wa and the spirit shall return to god that gave it which mai bear well enough if there be no other text directli against it thi interpret that god on know but man not what becom of a man spirit when he expireth and the same solomon in the same book chap ver delivereth in the same sentenc in the sens i have given it hi word ar all goe man and beast to the same place all ar of the dust and all turn to dust again who knoweth that the spirit of man goeth upward and the spirit of the beast goeth downward to the earth that is none know but god nor is it an unusual phrase to sai of thing we understand not god know what and god know where that of gen enoch walk with god and he wa not for god took him which is expound heb he wa translat that he should not die and wa not found becaus god had translat him for befor hi translat he had thi testimoni that he pleas god make as much for the immort of the bodi as of the soul proveth that thi hi translat wa peculiar to them that pleas god not common to them with the wick and depend on grace not on natur but on the contrari what interpret shall we give besid the literal sens of the word of solomon eccl that which befalleth the son of men befalleth beast even on thing befalleth them as the on dyeth so doth the other yea thei have all on breath on spirit so that a man hath no praeemin abov a beast for all is vaniti by the literal sens here is no natural immort of the soul nor yet ani repugn with the life eternal which the elect shall enjoi by grace and chap ver better is he that hath not yet been than both thei that is than thei that live or have live which if the soul of all them that have live were immortal were a hard sai for then to have an immortal soul were wors than to have no soul at all and againechapt the live know thei shall die but the dead know not ani thing that is natur and befor the resurrect of the bodi anoth place which seem to make for a natural immort of the soul is that where our saviour saith that abraham isaac and jacob ar live but thi is spoken of the promis of god and of their certitud to rise again not of a life then actual and in the same sens that god said to adam that on the dai hee should eat of the forbidden fruit he should certainli die from that time forward he wa a dead man by sentenc but not by execut till almost a thousand year after so abraham isaac and jacob were aliv by promis then when christ spake but ar not actual till the resurrect and the histori of dive and lazaru make noth against thi if wee take it as it is for a parabl but there be other place of the new testament where an immort seemeth to be directli attribut to the wick for it is evid that thei shall all rise to judgement and it is said besid in mani place that thei shall goe into everlast fire everlast torment everlast punish and that the worm of conscienc never dyeth and all thi is comprehend in the word everlast death which is ordinarili interpret everlast life in torment and yet i can find no where that ani man shall live in torment everlastingli also it seemeth hard to sai that god who is the father of merci that doth in heaven and earth all that hee will that hath the heart of all men in hi dispos that worketh in men both to doe and to will and without whose free gift a man hath neither inclin to good nor repent of evil should punish men transgress without ani end of time and with all the extrem of tortur that men can imagin and more we ar therefor to consid what the mean is of everlast fire and other the like phrase of scriptur i have shew alreadi that the kingdom of god by christ beginneth at the dai of judgment that in that dai the faithful shall rise again with gloriou and spiritual bodi and bee hi subject in that hi kingdom which shall be eternal that thei shall neither marri nor be given in marriag nor eat and drink as thei did in their natural bodi but live for ever in their individual person without the specifical etern of gener and that the reprob also shall rise again to receiv punish for their sin as also that those of the elect which shall be aliv in their earthli bodi at that dai shall have their bodi suddenli chang and made spiritual and immortal but that the bodi of the reprob who make the kingdom of satan shall also be gloriou or spiritual bodi or that thei shall bee as the angel of god neither eat nor drink nor engendr or that their life shall be eternal in their individual person as the life of everi faithful man is or as the life of adam had been if hee had not sin there is no place of scriptur to prove it save on these place concern eternal torment which mai otherwis be interpret from whenc mai be infer that as the elect after the resurrect shall be restor to the estat wherein adam wa befor he had sin so the reprob shall be in the estat that adam and hi poster were in after the sin commit save that god promis a redeem to adam and such of hi seed as should trust in him and repent but not to them that should die in their sin as do the reprob eternal torment what these thing consid the text that mention eternal fire etern torment or the word that never dieth contradict not the doctrin of a second and everlast death in the proper and natural sens of the word death the fire or torment prepar for the wick in gehenna tophet or in what place soever mai continu for ever and there mai never want wick men to be torment in them though not everi nor ani on etern for the wick be left in the estat thei were in after adam sin mai at the resurrect live as thei did marri and give in marriag and have gross and corrupt bodi as all mankind now have and consequ mai engend perpetu after the resurrect as thei did befor for there is no place of scriptur to the contrari for st paul speak of the resurrect cor understandeth it on of the resurrect to life eternal and not the resurrect to punish and of the first he saith that the bodi is sown in corrupt rais in incorrupt sown in dishonour rais in honour sown in weakness rais in power sown a natural bodi rais a spiritual bodi there is no such thing can be said of the bodi of them that rise to punish the text is luke vers a fertil text the children of thi world marri and ar given in marriag but thei that shall be count worthi to obtain that world and the resurrect from the dead neither marri nor ar given in marriag neither can thei die ani more for thei ar equal to the angel and ar the children of god be the children of the resurrect the children of thi world that ar in the estat which adam left them in shall marri and be given in marriag that is corrupt and gener success which is an immort of the kind but not of the person of men thei ar not worthi to be count amongst them that shall obtain the next world and an absolut resurrect from the dead but on a short time as inmat of that world and to the end on to receiv condign punish for their contumaci the elect ar the on children of the resurrect that is to sai the sole heir of eternal life thei onli can die no more it is thei that ar equal to the angel and that ar the children of god and not the reprob to the reprob there remaineth after the resurrect a second and eternal death between which resurrect and their second and eternal death is but a time of punish and torment and to last by success of sinner thereunto as long as the kind of man by propag shall endur which is etern answer of the text alledg for purgatori upon thi doctrin of the natural etern of separ soul is found as i said the doctrin of purgatori for suppos eternal life by grace on there is no life but the life of the bodi and no immort till the resurrect the text for purgatori alledg by bellarmin out of the canonical scriptur of the old testament ar first the fast of david for saul and jonathan mention king and again sam for the death of abner thi fast of david he saith wa for the obtain of someth for them at god hand after their death becaus after he had fast to procur the recoveri of hi own child assoon as he know it wa dead he call for meat see then the soul hath an exist separ from the bodi and noth can be obtain by men fast for the soul that ar alreadi either in heaven or hell it followeth that there be some soul of dead men what ar neither in heaven nor in hell and therefor thei must bee in some third place which must be purgatori and thu with hard strain hee ha wrest those place to the proof of a purgatori wherea it is manifest that the ceremoni of mourn and fast when thei ar us for the death of men whose life wa not profit to the mourner thei ar us for honour sake to their person and when ti done for the death of them by whose life the mourner had benefit it proce from their particular dammag and so david honour saul and abner with hi fast and in the death of hi own child recomfort himself by receiv hi ordinari food in the other place which he alledgeth out of the old testament there is not so much as ani shew or colour of proof he bring in everi text wherein there is the word anger or fire or burn or purg or clens in case ani of the father have but in a sermon rhetor appli it to the doctrin of purgatori alreadi beleev the first vers of psalm o lord rebuk me not in thy wrath nor chasten me in thy hot displeasur what were thi to purgatori if augustin had not appli the wrath to the fire of hell and the displeasur to that of purgatori and what is it to purgatori that of psalm wee went through fire and water and thou broughtest us to a moist place and other the like text with which the doctor of those time entend to adorn or extend their sermon or commentari hale to their purpos by forc of wit place of the new testament for purgatori answer but he alledgeth other place of the new testament that ar not so easi to be answer and first that of matth whosoev speaketh a word against the sonn of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoev speaketh against the holi ghost it shall not bee forgiven him neither in thi world nor in the world to come where he will have purgatori to be the world to come wherein some sinn mai be forgiven which in thi world were not forgiven notwithstand that it is manifest there ar but three world on from the creation to the flood which wa destroi by water and is call in scriptur the old world anoth from the flood to the dai of judgement which is the present world and shall bee destroi by fire and the third which shall bee from the dai of judgement forward everlast which is call the world to come and in which it is agre by all there shall be no purgatori and therefor the world to come and purgatori ar inconsist but what then can bee the mean of those our saviour word i confess thei ar veri hardli to bee reconcil with all the doctrin now unanim receiv nor is it ani shame to confess the profoundness of the scriptur to bee too great to be sound by the shortness of human understand nevertheless i mai propound such thing to the consider of more learn divin as the text it self suggesteth and first see to speak against the holi ghost as be the third person of the triniti is to speak against the church in which the holi ghost resideth it seemeth the comparison is made between the easiness of our saviour in bear with offenc done to him while he wa on earth and the sever of the pastor after him against those which should deni their author which wa from the holi ghost as if he should sai you that deni my power nai you that shall crucifi me shall be pardon by mee as often as you turn unto mee by repent but if you deni the power of them that teach you hereaft by vertu of the holi ghost thei shall be inexor and shall not forgiv you but persecut you in thi world and leav you without absolut though you turn to me unless you turn also to them to the punish as much as li in them of the world to come and so the word mai be taken as a propheci or praedict concern the time as thei have along been in the christian church or if thi be not the mean for i am not peremptori in such difficult place perhap there mai be place left after the resurrect for the repent of some sinner and there is also anoth place that seemeth to agre therewith for consid the word of st paul cor what shall thei doe which ar baptiz for the dead if the dead rise not at all why also ar thei baptiz for the dead a man mai probabl inferr as some have done that in st paul time there wa a custom by receiv baptism for the dead as men that now beleev ar sureti and undertak for the faith of infant that ar not capabl of beleev to undertak for the person of their deceas friend that thei should be readi to obei and receiv our saviour for their king at hi come again and then the forgiveness of sin in the world to come ha no need of a purgatori but in both these interpret there is so much of paradox that i trust not to them but propound them to those that ar throughli vers in the scriptur to inquir if there be no clearer place that contradict them on of thu much i see evid scriptur to perswad men that there is neither the word nor the thing of purgatori neither in thi nor ani other text nor ani thing that can prove a necess of a place for the soul without the bodi neither for the soul of lazaru dure the four dai he wa dead nor for the soul of them which the roman church pretend to be torment now in purgatori for god that could give a life to a peec of clai hath the same power to give life again to a dead man and renew hi inanim and rotten carkass into a gloriou spiritual and immortal bodi anoth place is that of cor where it is said that thei which built stubbl hai c on the true foundat their work shall perish but thei themselv shall be save but as through fire thi fire he will have to be the fire of purgatori the word as i have said befor ar an allus to those of zach where he saith i will bring the third part through the fire and refin them as silver is refin and will try them as gold is try which is spoken of the com of the messiah in power and glori that is at the dai of judgment and conflagr of the present world wherein the elect shall not be consum but be refin that is depos their erron doctrin and tradit and have them as it were sindg off and shall afterward call upon the name of the true god in like manner the apostl saith of them that hold thi foundat jesu is the christ shall build thereon some other doctrin that be erron that thei shall not be consum in that fire which reneweth the world but shall pass through it to salvat but so as to see and relinquish their former errour the builder ar the pastor the foundat that jesu is the christ the stubbl and hai fals consequ drawn from it through ignor or frailti the gold silver and pretiou stone ar their true doctrin and their refin or purg the relinquish of their error in all which there is no colour at all for the burn of incorporeal that is to sai impat soul baptism for the dead how understood a third place is that of cor befor mention concern baptism for the dead out of which he concludeth first that prayer for the dead ar not unprofit and out of that that there is a fire of purgatori but neither of them rightli for of mani interpret of the word baptism he approveth thi in the first place that by baptism is meant metaphor a baptism of penanc and that men ar in thi sens baptiz when thei fast and prai and give alm and so baptism for the dead and prayer of the dead is the same thing but thi is a metaphor of which there is no exampl neither in the scriptur nor in ani other us of languag and which is also discord to the harmoni and scope of the scriptur the word baptism is us mar luk for be dip in on own bloud as christ wa upon the cross and as most of the apostl were for give testimoni of him but it is hard to sai that prayer fast and alm have ani similitud with dip the same is us also mat which seemeth to make somewhat for purgatori for a purg with fire but it is evid the fire and purg here mention is the same whereof the prophet zachari speaketh chap v i will bring the third part through the fire and will refin them c and st peter after him epist that the triall of your faith which is much more preciou than of gold that perisheth though it be try with fire might be found unto prais and honour and glori at the appear of jesu christ and st paul cor the fire shall trie everi man work of what sort it is but st peter and st paul speak of the fire that shall be at the second appear of christ and the prophet zachari of the dai of judgment and therefor thi place of s mat mai be interpret of the same and then there will be no necess of the fire of purgatori anoth interpret of baptism for the dead is that which i have befor mention which he preferreth to the second place of probabl and thenc also he inferreth the util of prayer for the dead for if after the resurrect such as have not heard of christ or not beleev in him mai be receiv into christ kingdom it is not in vain after their death that their friend should prai for them till thei should be risen but grant that god at the prayer of the faithful mai convert unto him some of those that have not heard christ preach and consequ cannot have reject christ and that the chariti of men in that point cannot be blame yet thi concludeth noth for purgatori becaus to rise from death to life is on thing to rise from purgatori to life is anoth and be a rise from life to life from a life in torment to a life in joi a fourth place is that of mat agre with thine adversari quickli whilest thou art in the wai with him lest at ani time the adversari deliv thee to the offic and thou be cast into prison verili i sai unto thee thou shalt by no mean come out thenc till thou ha paid the uttermost farth in which allegori the offend is the sinner both the adversari and the judg is god the wai is thi life the prison is the grave the offic death from which the sinner shall not rise again to life eternal but to a second death till he have paid the utmost farth or christ pai it for him by hi passion which is a full ransom for all manner of sin as well lesser sin as greater crime both be made by the passion of christ equal venial the fift place is that of matth whosoev is angri with hi brother without a caus shall be guilti in judgment and whosoev shall sai to hi brother racha shall be guilti in the councel but whosoev shall sai thou fool shall be guilti to hell fire from which word he inferreth three sort of sin and three sort of punish and that none of those sin but the last shall be punish with hell fire and consequ that after thi life there is punish of lesser sin in purgatori of which infer there is no colour in ani interpret that hath yet been given to them shall there be a distinct after thi life of court of justic as there wa amongst the jew in our saviour time to hear and determin diver sort of crime as the judg and the councel shall not all judicatur appertain to christ and hi apostl to understand therefor thi text we ar not to consid it solitarili but jointli with the word preced and subsequ our saviour in thi chapter interpreteth the law of mose which the jew thought wa then fulfil when thei had not transgress the grammatical sens thereof howsoev thei had transgress against the sentenc or mean of the legisl therefor wherea thei thought the sixth command wa not broken but by kill a man nor the seventh but when a man lai with a woman not hi wife our saviour tell them the inward anger of a man against hi brother if it be without just caus is homicid you have heard saith hee the law of mose thou shalt not kill and that whosoev shall kill shall be condemn befor the judg or befor the session of the seventi but i sai unto you to be angri with on brother without caus or to sai unto him racha or fool is homicid and shall be punish at the dai of judgment and session of christ and hi apostl with hell fire so that those word were not us to distinguish between diver crime and diver court of justic and diver punish but to tax the distinct between sin and sin which the jew drew not from the differ of the will in obei god but from the differ of their temporal court of justic and to shew them that he that had the will to hurt hi brother though the effect appear but in revil or not at all shall be cast into hell fire by the judg and by the session which shall be the same not differ court at the dai of judgment thi consid what can be drawn from thi text to maintain purgatori i cannot imagin the sixth place is luke make yee friend of the unright mammon that when yee fail thei mai receiv you into everlast tabernacl thi he alledg to prove invoc of saint depart but the sens is plain that we should make friend with our rich of the poor and therebi obtain their prayer whilest thei live he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord the seventh is luke lord rememb me when thou commest into thy kingdom therefor saith hee there is remiss of sin after thi life but the consequ is not good our saviour then forgav him and at hi com again in glori will rememb to rais him again to life eternal the eight is act where st peter saith of christ that god had rais him up and loos the pain of death becaus it wa not possibl he should be holden of it which hee interpret to bee a descent of christ into purgatori to loos some soul there from their torment wherea it is manifest that it wa christ that wa loos it wa hee that could not bee holden of death or the grave and not the soul in purgatori but if that which beza say in hi note on thi place be well observ there is none that will not see that in stead of payn it should be band and then there is no further caus to seek for purgatori in thi text chapter xlv of daemonolog and other reliqu of the religion of the gentil the original of daemonolog the impress made on the organ of sight by lucid bodi either in on direct line or in mani line reflect from opaqu or refract in the passag through diaphan bodi produceth in live creatur in whom god hath place such organ an imagin of the object from whenc the impress proceedeth which imagin is call sight and seemeth not to bee a meer imagin but the bodi it self without us in the same manner as when a man violent presseth hi ey there appear to him a light without and befor him which no man perceiveth but himself becaus there is inde no such thing without him but on a motion in the interiour organ press by resist outward that make him think so and the motion made by thi pressur continu after the object which caus it is remov is that we call imagin and memori and in sleep and sometim in great distemp of the organ by sickness or violenc a dream of which thing i have alreadi spoken briefli in the second and third chapter thi natur of sight have never been discov by the ancient pretend to natural knowledg much less by those that consid not thing so remot as that knowledg is from their present us it wa hard for men to conceiv of those imag in the fanci and in the sens otherwis than of thing realli without us which some becaus thei vanish awai thei know not whither nor how will have to be absolut incorporeal that is to sai immaterial of form without matter colour and figur without ani colour or figur bodi and that thei can put on aieri bodi as a garment to make them visibl when thei will to our bodili ey and other sai ar bodi and live creatur but made of air or other more subtil and aethereal matter which is then when thei will be seen condens but both of them agre on on general appel of them daemon as if the dead of whom thei dream were not inhabit of their own brain but of the air or of heaven or hell not phantasm but ghost with just as much reason as if on should sai he saw hi own ghost in a lookingglass or the ghost of the star in a river or call the ordinari apparit of the sun of the quantiti of about a foot the daemon or ghost of that great sun that enlighteneth the whole visibl world and by that mean have fear them as thing of an unknown that is of an unlimit power to doe them good or harm and consequ given occas to the governour of the heathen commonwealth to regul thi their fear by establish that daemonolog in which the poet as princip priest of the heathen religion were special emploi or reverenc to the publiqu peac and to the obedi of subject necessari thereunto and to make some of them good daemon and other evil the on as a spurr to the observ the other as rein to withhold them from violat of the law what were the daemon of the ancient what kind of thing thei were to whom thei attribut the name of daemon appeareth partli in the genealogi of their god written by hesiod on of the most ancient poet of the graecian and partli in other histori of which i have observ some few befor in the chapter of thi discours how that doctrin wa spread the graecian by their coloni and conquest commun their languag and write into asia egypt and itali and therein by necessari consequ their daemonolog or as st paul call it their doctrin of devil and by that mean the contagion wa deriv also to the jew both of judaea and alexandria and other part whereinto thei were dispers but the name of daemon thei did not as the graecian attribut to spirit both good and evil but to the evil on and to the good daemon thei gave the name of the spirit of god and esteem those into whose bodi thei entr to be prophet in summ all singular if good thei attribut to the spirit of god and if evil to some daemon but a kakodaimen an evil daemon that is a devil and therefor thei call daemoniaqu that is possess by the devil such as we call madmen or lunatiqu or such as had the fall sickness or that spoke ani thing which thei for want of understand thought absurd as also of an unclean person in a notori degre thei us to sai he had an unclean spirit of a dumb man that he had a dumb devil and of john baptist math for the singular of hi fast that he had a devil and of our saviour becaus he said hee that keepeth hi sai should not see death in aeternum john now we know thou hast a devil abraham is dead and the prophet ar dead and again becaus he said john thei went about to kill him the peopl answer thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee wherebi it is manifest that the jew had the same opinion concern phantasm name that thei were not phantasm that is idol of the brain but thing reall and independ on the fanci why our saviour control it not which doctrin if it be not true why mai some sai did not our saviour contradict it and teach the contrari nai why doe he us on divers occas such form of speech as seem to confirm it to thi i answer that first where christ saith a spirit hath not flesh and bone though hee shew that there be spirit yet he deni not that thei ar bodi and where st paul sai we shall rise spiritual bodi he acknowledgeth the natur of spirit but that thei ar bodili spirit which is not difficult to understand for air and mani other thing ar bodi though not flesh and bone or ani other gross bodi to bee discern by the ey but when our saviour speaketh to the devil and commandeth him to go out of a man if by the devil be meant a diseas as phrenesi or lunaci or a corpor spirit is not the speech improp can diseas hear or can there be a corporeal spirit in a bodi of flesh and bone full alreadi of vital and animal spirit ar there not therefor spirit that neither have bodi nor ar meer imagin to the first i answer that the address of our saviour command to the madness or lunaci he cureth is no more improp then wa hi rebuk of the fever or of the wind and sea for neither do these hear or than wa the command of god to the light to the firmament to the sunn and starr when he command them to bee for thei could not hear befor thei had a bee but those speech ar not improp becaus thei signifi the power of god word no more therefor is it improp to command madness or lunaci under the appel of devil by which thei were then commonli understood to depart out of a man bodi to the second concern their be incorporeal i have not yet observ ani place of scriptur from whenc it can be gather that ani man wa ever possess with ani other corpor spirit but that of hi own by which hi bodi is natur move the scriptur doe not teach that spirit ar incorporeal our saviour immedi after the holi ghost descend upon him in the form of a dove is said by st matthew chapt to have been led up by the spirit into the wilderness and the same is recit luke in these word jesu be full of the holi ghost wa led in the spirit into the wilderness wherebi it is evid that by spirit there is meant the holi ghost thi cannot be interpret for a possess for christ and the holi ghost ar but on and the same substanc which is no possess of on substanc or bodi by anoth and wherea in the vers follow he is said to have been taken up by the devil into the holi citi and set upon a pinnacl of the templ shall we conclud thenc that hee wa possess of the devil or carri thither by violenc and again carri thenc by the devil into an exceed high mountain who shew him them thenc all the kingdom of the world herein wee ar not to beleev he wa either possess or forc by the devil nor that ani mountain is high enough accord to the literal sens to shew him on whole hemispher what then can be the mean of thi place other than that he went of himself into the wilderness and that thi carri of him up and down from the wilderness to the citi and from thenc into a mountain wa a vision conform whereunto is also the phrase of st luke that hee wa led into the wilderness not by but in the spirit wherea concern hi be taken up into the mountain and unto the pinnacl of the templ hee speaketh as st matthew doth which suiteth with the natur of a vision again where st luke say of juda iscariot that satan entr into him and thereupon that he went and commun with the chief priest and captain how he might betrai christ unto them it mai be answer that by the entr of satan that is the enemi into him is meant the hostil and traiter intent of sell hi lord and master for as by the holi ghost is frequent in scriptur understood the grace and good inclin given by the holi ghost so by the entr of satan mai bee understood the wick cogit and design of the adversari of christ and hi discipl for as it is hard to sai that the devil wa entr into juda befor he had ani such hostil design so it is impertin to sai he wa first christ enemi in hi heart and that the devil entr into him afterward therefor the entr of satan and hi wick purpos wa on and the same thing but if there be no immaterial spirit nor ani possess of men bodi by ani spirit corporeal it mai again be ask why our saviour and hi apostl did not teach the peopl so and in such cleer word as thei might no more doubt thereof but such question as these ar more curiou than necessari for a christian man salvat men mai as well ask why christ that could have given to all men faith pieti and all manner of moral vertu gave it to some on and not to all and why he left the search of natural caus and scienc to the natural reason and industri of men and did not reveal it to all or ani man supernatur and mani other such question of which nevertheless there mai be alledg probabl and piou reason for as god when he brought the israelit into the land of promis did not secur them therein by subdu all the nation round about them but left mani of them as thorn in their side to awaken from time to time their pieti and industri so our saviour in conduct us toward hi heavenli kingdom did not destroi all the difficulti of natural question but left them to exercis our industri and reason the scope of hi preach be on to shew us thi plain and direct wai to salvat name the beleef of thi articl that he wa the christ the son of the live god sent into the world to sacrific himself for our sin and at hi com again glorious to reign over hi elect and to save them from their enemi etern to which the opinion of possess by spirit or phantasm ar no impedi in the wai though it be to some an occas of go out of the wai and to follow their own invent if wee requir of the scriptur an account of all question which mai be rais to troubl us in the perform of god command we mai as well complain of mose for not have set down the time of the creation of such spirit as well as of the creation of the earth and sea and of men and beast to conclud i find in scriptur that there be angel and spirit good and evil but not that thei ar incorporeal as ar the apparit men see in the dark or in a dream or vision which the latin call spectra and took for daemon and i find that there ar spirit corpor though subtil and invis but not that ani man bodi wa possess or inhabit by them and that the bodi of the saint shall be such name spiritual bodi as st paul call them the power of cast out devil not the same it wa in the primit church nevertheless the contrari doctrin name that there be incorporeal spirit hath hitherto so prevail in the church that the us of exorcism that is to sai of eject of devil by conjur is thereupon built and though rare and faintli practis is not yet total given over that there were mani daemoniaqu in the primit church and few madmen and other such singular diseas wherea in these time we hear of and see mani madmen and few daemoniaqu proce not from the chang of natur but of name but how it come to pass that wherea heretofor the apostl and after them for a time the pastor of the church did cure those singular diseas which now thei ar not seen to doe as likewis why it is not in the power of everi true beleev now to doe all that the faithful did then that is to sai as we read mark in christ name to cast out devil to speak with new tongu to take up serpent to drink deadli poison without harm take and to cure the sick by the lai on of their hand and all thi without other word but in the name of jesu is anoth question and it is probabl that those extraordinari gift were given to the church for no longer a time than men trust wholli to christ and look for their felic on in hi kingdom to come and consequ that when thei sought author and rich and trust to their own subtilti for a kingdom of thi world these supernatural gift of god were again taken from them anoth reliqu of gentilism worship imag left in the church not brought into it anoth reliqu of gentilism is the worship of imag neither institut by mose in the old nor by christ in the new testament nor yet brought in from the gentil but left amongst them after thei had given their name to christ befor our saviour preach it wa the general religion of the gentil to worship for god those appar that remain in the brain from the impress of external bodi upon the organ of their sens which ar commonli call idea idol phantasm conceit as be represent of those external bodi which caus them and have noth in them of realiti no more than there is in the thing that seem to stand befor us in a dream and thi is the reason why st paul sai wee know that an idol is noth not that he thought that an imag of metal stone or wood wa noth but that the thing which thei honor or fear in the imag and held for a god wa a meer figment without place habit motion or exist but in the motion of the brain and the worship of these with divin honour is that which is in the scriptur call idolatri and rebellion against god for god be king of the jew and hi lieuten be first mose and afterward the high priest if the peopl had been permit to worship and prai to imag which ar represent of their own fanci thei had had no farther depend on the true god of whom there can be no similitud nor on hi prime minist mose and the high priest but everi man had govern himself accord to hi own appetit to the utter evers of the commonwealth and their own destruct for want of union and therefor the first law of god wa thei should not take for god alieno deo that is the god of other nation but that on true god who vouchsaf to commun with mose and by him to give them law and direct for their peac and for their salvat from their enemi and the second wa that thei should not make to themselv ani imag to worship of their own invent for it is the same depos of a king to submit to anoth king whether he be set up by a neighbour nation or by our selv answer to certain seem text for imag the place of scriptur pretend to counten the set up of imag to worship them or to set them up at all in the place where god is worship ar first two exampl on of the cherubin over the ark of god the other of the brazen serpent secondli some text wherebi we ar command to worship certain creatur for their relat to god as to worship hi footstool and lastli some other text by which is author a religi honor of holi thing but befor i examin the forc of those place to prove that which is pretend i must first explain what is to be understood by worship and what by imag and idol what is worship i have alreadi shewn in the chapter of thi discours that to honor is to valu highli the power of ani person and that such valu is measur by our compar him with other but becaus there is noth to be compar with god in power we honor him not but dishonour him by ani valu less than infinit and thu honor is properli of it own natur secret and internal in the heart but the inward thought of men which appear outwardli in their word and action ar the sign of our honor and these goe by the name of worship in latin cultu therefor to prai to to swear by to obei to bee dilig and offici in serv in summ all word and action that betoken fear to offend or desir to pleas is worship whether those word and action be sincer or feign and becaus thei appear as sign of honor ar ordinarili also call honor distinct between divin and civil worship the worship we exhibit to those we esteem to be but men as to king and men in author is civil worship but the worship we exhibit to that which we think to bee god whatsoev the word ceremoni gestur or other action be is divin worship to fall prostrat befor a king in him that think him but a man is but civil worship and he that but putteth off hi hat in the church for thi caus that he thinketh it the hous of god worshippeth with divin worship thei that seek the distinct of divin and civil worship not in the intent of the worshipp but in the word douleia and latreia deceiv themselv for wherea there be two sort of servant that sort which is of those that ar absolut in the power of their master as slave taken in war and their issu whose bodi ar not in their own power their live depend on the will of their master in such manner as to forfeit them upon the least disobedi and that ar bought and sold as beast were call douloi that is properli slave and their servic douleia the other which is of those that serv for hire or in hope of benefit from their master voluntarili ar call thete that is domestiqu servant to whose servic the master have no further right than is contain in the coven made betwixt them these two kind of servant have thu much common to them both that their labour is appoint them by anoth whether as a slave or a voluntari servant and the word latri is the gener name of both signifi him that worketh for anoth whether as a slave or a voluntari servant so that latreia signifieth gener all servic but douleia the servic of bondmen on and the condit of slaveri and both ar us in scriptur to signifi our servic of god promiscu douleia becaus we ar god slave latreia becaus wee serv him and in all kind of servic is contain not on obedi but also worship that is such action gestur and word as signifi honor an imag what phantasm an imag in the most strict signif of the word is the resembl of some thing visibl in which sens the phantastical form apparit or seem of visibl bodi to the sight ar on imag such as ar the shew of a man or other thing in the water by reflexion or refract or of the sun or star by direct vision in the air which ar noth reall in the thing seen nor in the place where thy seem to bee nor ar their magnitud and figur the same with that of the object but changeabl by the variat of the organ of sight or by glass and ar present oftentim in our imagin and in our dream when the object is absent or chang into other colour and shape as thing that depend on upon the fanci and these ar the imag which ar origin and most properli call idea and idol and deriv from the languag of the graecian with whom the word eido signifieth to see thei ar also call phantasm which is in the same languag apparit and from these imag it is that on of the faculti of man natur is call the imagin and from henc it is manifest that there neither is nor can bee ani imag made of a thing invis it is also evid that there can be no imag of a thing infinit for all the imag and phantasm that ar made by the impress of thing visibl ar figur but figur is a quantiti everi wai determin and therefor there can bee no imag of god nor of the soul of man nor of spirit but on of bodi visibl that is bodi that have light in themselv or ar by such enlighten fiction material imag and wherea a man can fanci shape he never saw make up a figur out of the part of diver creatur as the poet make their centaur chimaera and other monster never seen so can he also give matter to those shape and make them in wood clai or metal and these ar also call imag not for the resembl of ani corporeal thing but for the resembl of some phantastical inhabit of the brain of the maker but in these idol as thei ar origin in the brain and as thei ar paint carv mould or moulten in matter there is a similitud of the on to the other for which the material bodi made by art mai be said to be the imag of the phantastical idol made by natur but in a larger us of the word imag is contain also ani represent of on thing by anoth so an earthli soveraign mai be call the imag of god and an inferiour magistr the imag of an earthli soveraign and mani time in the idolatri of the gentil there wa littl regard to the similitud of their material idol to the idol in their fanci and yet it wa call the imag of it for a stone unhewn ha been set up for neptun and diver other shape far differ from the shape thei conceiv of their god and at thi dai we see mani imag of the virgin mari and other saint unlik on anoth and without correspond to ani on man fanci and yet serv well enough for the purpos thei were erect for which wa no more but by the name on to repres the person mention in the histori to which everi man applyeth a mental imag of hi own make or none at all and thu an imag in the largest sens is either the resembl or the represent of some thing visibl or both togeth as it happeneth for the most part but the name of idol is extend yet further in scriptur to signifi also the sunn or a starr or ani other creatur visibl or invis when thei ar worship for god idolatri what have shewn what is worship and what an imag i will now put them togeth and examin what that idolatri is which is forbidden in the second command and other place of the scriptur to worship an imag is voluntarili to doe those external act which ar sign of honor either the matter of the imag which is wood stone or metal or some other visibl creatur or the phantasm of the brain for the resembl or represent whereof the matter wa form and figur or both togeth as on anim bodi compos of the matter and the phantasm as of a bodi and soul to be uncov befor a man of power and author or befor the throne of a princ or in such other place as hee ordaineth to that purpos in hi absenc is to worship that man or princ with civil worship as be a sign not of honor the stool or place but the person and is not idolatri but if hee that doth it should suppos the soul of the princ to be in the stool or should present a petit to the stool it were divin worship and idolatri to prai to a king for such thing as hee is abl to doe for us though we prostrat our selv befor him is but civil worship becaus we acknowledg no other power in him but human but voluntarili to prai unto him for fair weather or for ani thing which god on can doe for us is divin worship and idolatri on the other side if a king compel a man to it by the terrour of death or other great corporal punish it is not idolatri for the worship which the soveraign commandeth to bee done unto himself by the terrour of hi law is not a sign that he that obeyeth him doe inwardli honour him as a god but that he is desir to save himself from death or from a miser life and that which is not a sign of internal honor is no worship and therefor no idolatri neither can it bee said that hee that doe it scandalizeth or layeth ani stumbl block befor hi brother becaus how wise or learn soever he be that worshippeth in that manner anoth man cannot from thenc argu that he approveth it but that he doth it for fear and that it is not hi act but the act of the soveraign to worship god in some peculiar place or turn a man face toward an imag or determin place is not to worship or honor the place or imag but to acknowledg it holi that is to sai to acknowledg the imag or the place to be set apart from common us for that is the mean of the word holi which impli no new qualiti in the place or imag but on a new relat by appropri to god and therefor is not idolatri no more than it wa idolatri to worship god befor the brazen serpent or for the jew when thei were out of their own countrei to turn their face when thei prai toward the templ of jerusalem or for mose to put off hi shoe when he wa befor the flame bush the ground appertain to mount sinai which place god had chosen to appear in and to give hi law to the peopl of israel and wa therefor holi ground not by inhaer sanctiti but by separ to god us or for christian to worship in the church which ar onc solemnli dedic to god for that purpos by the author of the king or other true represent of the church but to worship god is inanim or inhibit such imag or place that is to sai an infinit substanc in a finit place is idolatri for such finit god ar but idol of the brain noth reall and ar commonli call in the scriptur by the name of vaniti and lye and noth also to worship god not as inanim or present in the place or imag but to the end to be put in mind of him or of some work of hi in case the place or imag be dedic or set up by privat author and not by the author of them that ar our soveraign pastor is idolatri for the command is thou shalt not make to thy self ani graven imag god command mose to set up the brazen serpent hee did not make it to himself it wa not therefor against the command but the make of the golden calf by aaron and the peopl as be done without author from god wa idolatri not on becaus thei held it for god but also becaus thei made it for a religi us without warrant either from god their soveraign or from mose that wa hi lieuten the gentil worship for god jupit and other that live were men perhap that had done great and gloriou act and for the children of god diver men and women suppos them gotten between an immortal deiti and a mortal man thi wa idolatri becaus thei made them so to themselv have no author from god neither in hi eternal law of reason nor in hi posit and reveal will but though our saviour wa a man whom wee also beleev to bee god immortal and the son of god yet thi is no idolatri becaus wee build not that beleef upon our own fanci or judgment but upon the word of god reveal in the scriptur and for the ador of the eucharist if the word of christ thi is my bodi signifi that he himself and the seem bread in hi hand and not on so but that all the seem morsel of bread that have ever sinc been and ani time hereaft shall bee consecr by priest bee so mani christ bodi and yet all of them but on bodi then is that no idolatri becaus it is author by our saviour but if that text doe not signifi that for there is no other that can be alledg for it then becaus it is a worship of human institut it is idolatri for it is not enough to sai god can transubstanti the bread into christ bodi for the gentil also held god to be omnipot and might upon that ground no less excus their idolatri by pretend as well as other as transubstanti of their wood and stone into god almighti wherea there be that pretend divin inspir to be a supernatural entr of the holi ghost into a man and not an acquisit of god grace by doctrin and studi i think thei ar in a veri danger dilemma for if thei worship not the men whom thei beleev to be so inspir thei fall into impieti as not ador god supernatural presenc and again if thei worship them thei commit idolatri for the apostl would never permit themselv to be so worship therefor the safest wai is to beleev that by the descend of the dove upon the apostl and by christ breath on them when hee gave them the holi ghost and by the give of it by imposit of hand ar understood the sign which god hath been pleas to us or ordain to be us of hi promis to assist those person in their studi to preach hi kingdom and in their convers that it might not be scandal but edifi to other scandal worship of imag besid the idolatr worship of imag there is also a scandal worship of them which is also a sin but not idolatri for idolatri is to worship by sign of an internal and reall honour but scandal worship is but seem worship and mai sometim bee join with an inward and hearti detest both of the imag and of the phantastical daemon or idol to which it is dedic and proce on from the fear of death or other grievou punish and is nevertheless a sin in them that so worship in case thei be men whose action ar look at by other as light to guid them by becaus follow their wai thei cannot but stumbl and fall in the wai of religion wherea the exampl of those we regard not work not on us at all but leav us to our own dilig and caution and consequ ar no caus of our fall if therefor a pastor lawfulli call to teach and direct other or ani other of whose knowledg there is a great opinion doe external honor to an idol for fear unless he make hi fear and unwillingness to it as evid as the worship he scandalizeth hi brother by seem to approv idolatri for hi brother argu from the action of hi teacher or of him whose knowledg he esteemeth great conclud it to bee lawful in it self and thi scandal is sin and a scandal given but if on be no pastor nor of emin reput for knowledg in christian doctrin doe the same and anoth follow him thi is no scandal given for he had no caus to follow such exampl but is a pretenc of scandal which hee taketh of himself for an excus befor men for an unlearn man that is in the power of an idolatr king or state if command on pain of death to worship befor an idol hee detesteth the idol in hi heart hee doth well though if he had the fortitud to suffer death rather than worship it he should doe better but if a pastor who as christ messeng ha undertaken to teach christ doctrin to all nation should doe the same it were not on a sinful scandal in respect of other christian men conscienc but a perfidi forsak of hi charg the summ of that which i have said hitherto concern the worship of imag is that that he that worshippeth in an imag or ani creatur either the matter thereof or ani fanci of hi own which he thinketh to dwell in it or both togeth or beleeveth that such thing hear hi prayer or see hi devot without ear or ey committeth idolatri and he that counterfeiteth such worship for fear of punish if he bee a man whose exampl hath power amongst hi brethren committeth a sin but he that worshippeth the creator of the world befor such an imag or in such a place as he hath not made or chosen of himself but taken from the command of god word as the jew did in worship god befor the cherubin and befor the brazen serpent for a time and in or toward the templ of jerusalem which wa also but for a time committeth not idolatri now for the worship of saint and imag and reliqu and other thing at thi dai practis in the church of rome i sai thei ar not allow by the word of god not brought into the church of rome from the doctrin there taught but partli left in it at the first convers of the gentil and afterward countenanc and confirm and augment by the bishop of rome answer to the argument from the cherubin and brazen serpent as for the proof alledg out of scriptur name those exampl of imag appoint by god to bee set up thei were not set up for the peopl or ani man to worship but that thei should worship god himself befor them as befor the cherubin over the ark and the brazen serpent for we read not that the priest or ani other did worship the cherubin but contrarili wee read king that hezekiah brake in piec the brazen serpent which mose had set up becaus the peopl burnt incens to it besid those exampl ar not put for our imit that we also should set up imag under pretenc of worship god befor them becaus the word of the second command thou shalt not make to thy self ani graven imag c distinguish between the imag that god command to be set up and those which wee set up to our selv and therefor from the cherubin or brazen serpent to the imag of man devis and from the worship command by god to the willworship of men the argument is not good thi also is to bee consid that as hezekiah brake in piec the brazen serpent becaus the jew did worship it to the end thei should doe so no more so also christian soveraign ought to break down the imag which their subject have been accustom to worship that there be no more occas of such idolatri for at thi dai the ignor peopl where imag ar worship doe realli beleev there is a divin power in the imag and ar told by their pastor that some of them have spoken and have bled and that miracl have been done by them which thei apprehend as done by the saint which thei think either is the imag it self or in it the israelit when thei worship the calf did think thei worship the god that brought them out of egypt and yet it wa idolatri becaus thei thought the calf either wa that god or had him in hi belli and though some man mai think it imposs for peopl to be so stupid as to think the imag to be god or a saint or to worship it in that notion yet it is manifest in scriptur to the contrari where when the golden calf wa made the peopl said exod these ar thy god o israel and where the imag of laban gen ar call hi god and wee see daili by experi in all sort of peopl that such men as studi noth but their food and eas ar content to beleev ani absurd rather than to troubl themselv to examin it hold their faith as it were by entail unalien except by an express and new law paint of fanci no idolatri abus them to religi worship is but thei inferr from some other place that it is lawful to paint angel and also god himself as from god walk in the garden from jacob see god at the top of the ladder and from other vision and dream but vision and dream whether natural or supernatural ar but phantasm and he that painteth an imag of ani of them maketh not an imag of god but of hi own phantasm which is make of an idol i sai not that to draw a pictur after a fanci is a sin but when it is drawn to hold it for a represent of god is against the second command and can be of no us but to worship and the same mai be said of the imag of angel and of men dead unless as monument of friend or of men worthi remembr for such us of an imag is not worship of the imag but a civil honor of the person not that is but that wa but when it is done to the imag which we make of a saint for no other reason but that we think he heareth our prayer and is pleas with the honour wee doe him when dead and without sens wee attribut to him more than human power and therefor it is idolatri see therefor there is no author neither in the law of mose nor in the gospel for the religi worship of imag or other represent of god which men set up to themselv or for the worship of the imag of ani creatur in heaven or earth or under the earth and wherea christian king who ar live represent of god ar not to be worship by their subject by ani act that signifieth a greater esteem of hi power than the natur of mortal man is capabl of it cannot be imagin that the religi worship now in us wa brought into the church by misunderstand of the scriptur it resteth therefor that it wa left in it by not destroi the imag themselv in the convers of the gentil that worship them how idolatri wa left in the church the caus whereof wa the immoder esteem and price set upon the workmanship of them which made the owner though convert from worship them as thei had done religi for daemon to retain them still in their hous upon pretenc of do it in the honor of christ of the virgin mari and of the apostl and other the pastor of the primit church as be easi by give them new name to make that an imag of the virgin mari and of her sonn our saviour which befor perhap wa call the imag of venu and cupid and so of a jupit to make a barnaba and of mercuri a paul and the like and as worldli ambit creep by degre into the pastor drew them to an endeavour of pleas the new made christian and also to a like of thi kind of honour which thei also might hope for after their deceas as well as those that had alreadi gain it so the worship of the imag of christ and hi apostl grow more and more idolatr save that somewhat after the time of constantin diver emperor and bishop and general councel observ and oppos the unlawfulness thereof but too late or too weakli canon of saint the canon of saint is anoth reliqu of gentilism it is neither a misunderstand of scriptur nor a new invent of the roman church but a custom as ancient as the commonwealth of rome it self the first that ever wa canon at rome wa romulu and that upon the narrat of juliu proculu that swore befor the senat he spake with him after hi death and wa assur by him he dwelt in heaven and wa there call quiriniu and would be propiti to the state of their new citi and thereupon the senat gave publiqu testimoni of hi sanctiti juliu caesar and other emperor after him had the like testimoni that is were canon for saint now defin and is the same with the apotheosi of the heathen the name of pontifex it is also from the roman heathen that the pope have receiv the name and power of pontifex maximu thi wa the name of him that in the ancient commonwealth of rome had the suprem author under the senat and peopl of regul all ceremoni and doctrin concern their religion and when augustu caesar chang the state into a monarchi he took to himself no more but thi offic and that of tribun of the peopl than is to sai the suprem power both in state and religion and the succeed emperor enjoi the same but when the emperour constantin live who wa the first that profess and author christian religion it wa conson to hi profess to caus religion to be regul under hi author by the bishop of rome though it doe not appear thei had so soon the name of pontifex but rather that the succeed bishop took it of themselv to counten the power thei exercis over the bishop of the roman provinc for it is not ani priviledg of st peter but the priviledg of the citi of rome which the emperor were alwai will to uphold that gave them such author over other bishop as mai be evid seen by that that the bishop of constantinopl when the emperour made that citi the seat of the empir pretend to bee equal to the bishop of rome though at last not without content the pope carri it and becam the pontifex maximu but in right on of the emperour and not without the bound of the empir nor ani where after the emperour had lost hi power in rome though it were the pope himself that took hi power from him from whenc wee mai by the wai observ that there is no place for the superior of the pope over other bishop except in the territori whereof he is himself the civil soveraign and where the emperour have soveraign power civil hath express chosen the pope for the chief pastor under himself of hi christian subject process of imag the carri about of imag in process is anoth reliqu of the religion of the greek and roman for thei also carri their idol from place to place in a kind of chariot which wa peculiarli dedic to that us which the latin call thensa and vehiculum deorum and the imag wa place in a frame or shrine which thei call ferculum and that which thei call pompa is the same that now is name process accord whereunto amongst the divin honor which were given to juliu caesar by the senat thi wa on that in the pomp or process at the circaean game he should have thensam ferculum a sacr chariot and a shrine which wa as much as to be carri up and down as a god just as at thi dai the pope ar carri by switzer under a canopi wax candl and torch light to these process also belong the bear of burn torch and candl befor the imag of the god both amongst the greek and roman for afterward the emperor of rome receiv the same honor as we read of caligula that at hi recept to the empir he wa carri from misenum to rome in the midst of a throng of peopl the way beset with altar and beast for sacrific and burn torch and of caracalla that wa receiv into alexandria with incens and with cast of flower and dadouchiai that is with torch for dadochoi were thei that amongst the greek carri torch light in the process of their god and in process of time the devout but ignor peopl did mani time honor their bishop with the like pomp of wax candl and the imag of our saviour and the saint constantli in the church it self and thu came in the us of wax candl and wa also establish by some of the ancient councel the heathen had also their aqua lustrali that is to sai holi water the church of rome imit them also in their holi day thei had their bacchanalia and we have our wake answer to them thei their saturnalia and we our carneval and shrovetuesdai liberti of servant thei their process of priapu wee our fetch in erect and danc about maypol and danc is on kind of worship thei had their process call ambarvalia and we our process about the field in the rogat week nor do i think that these ar all the ceremoni that have been left in the church from the first convers of the gentil but thei ar all that i can for the present call to mind and if a man would wel observ that which is deliv in the histori concern the religi rite of the greek and roman i doubt not but he might find mani more of these old empti bottl of gentilism which the doctor of the roman church either by neglig or ambit have fill up again with the new wine of christian that will not fail in time to break them chapter xlvi of darkness from vain philosophi and fabul tradit what philosophi is by philosophi is understood the knowledg acquir by reason from the manner of the gener of ani thing to the properti or from the properti to some possibl wai of gener of the same to the end to bee abl to produc as far as matter and human forc permit such effect as human life requireth so the geometrician from the construct of figur findeth out mani properti thereof and from the properti new wai of their construct by reason to the end to be abl to measur land and water and for infinit other us so the astronom from the rise set and move of the sun and starr in diver part of the heaven findeth out the caus of dai and night and of the differ season of the year wherebi he keepeth an account of time and the like of other scienc prudenc no part of philosophi by which definit it is evid that we ar not to account as ani part thereof that original knowledg call experi in which consisteth prudenc becaus it is not attain by reason but found as well in brute beast as in man and is but a memori of success of event in time past wherein the omiss of everi littl circumst alter the effect frustrateth the expect of the most prudent wherea noth is produc by reason aright but general eternal and immut truth no fals doctrin is part of philosophi nor ar we therefor to give that name to ani fals conclus for he that reasoneth aright in word he understandeth can never conclud an error no more is revel supernatural nor to that which ani man know by supernatural revel becaus it is not acquir by reason nor learn taken upon credit of author nor that which is gotten by reason from the author of book becaus it is not by reason from the caus to the effect nor from the effect to the caus and is not knowledg but faith of the begin and progress of philosophi the faculti of reason be consequ to the us of speech it wa not possibl but that there should have been some general truth found out by reason as ancient almost as languag it self the savag of america ar not without some good moral sentenc also thei have a littl arithmetick to add and divid in number not too great but thei ar not therefor philosoph for as there were plant of corn and wine in small quantiti dispers in the field and wood befor men knew their vertu or made us of them for their nourish or plant them apart in field and vineyard in which time thei fed on akorn and drank water so also there have been diver true general and profit specul from the begin as be the natural plant of human reason but thei were at first but few in number men live upon gross experi there wa no method that is to sai no sow nor plant of knowledg by it self apart from the weed and common plant of errour and conjectur and the caus of it be the want of leasur from procur the necess of life and defend themselv against their neighbour it wa imposs till the erect of great commonwealth it should be otherwis leasur is the mother of philosophi and commonwealth the mother of peac and leasur where first were great and flourish citi there wa first the studi of philosophi the gymnosophist of india the magi of persia and the priest of chaldea and egypt ar count the most ancient philosoph and those countrei were the most ancient of kingdom philosophi wa not risen to the graecian and other peopl of the west whose commonwealth no greater perhap then lucca or geneva had never peac but when their fear of on anoth were equal nor the leasur to observ ani thing but on anoth at length when warr had unit mani of these graecian lesser citi into fewer and greater then began seven men of several part of greec to get the reput of be wise some of them for moral and politiqu sentenc and other for the learn of the chaldean and egyptian which wa astronomi and geometri but we hear not yet of ani school of philosophi of the school of philosophi amongst the athenian after the athenian by the overthrow of the persian armi had gotten the dominion of the sea and therebi of all the island and maritim citi of the archipelago as well of asia as europ and were grown wealthi thei that had no employ neither at home nor abroad had littl els to emploi themselv in but either as st luke sai act in tell and hear new or in discours of philosophi publiqu to the youth of the citi everi master took some place for that purpos plato in certain publiqu walk call academia from on academu aristotl in the walk of the templ of pan call lycaeum other in the stoa or cover walk wherein the merchant good were brought to land other in other place where thei spent the time of their leasur in teach or in disput of their opinion and some in ani place where thei could get the youth of the citi togeth to hear them talk and thi wa it which carnead also did at rome when he wa ambassadour which caus cato to advis the senat to dispatch him quickli for fear of corrupt the manner of the young men that delight to hear him speak as thei thought fine thing from thi it wa that the place where ani of them taught and disput wa call schola which in their tongu signifieth leasur and their disput diatriba that is to sai pass of the time also the philosoph themselv had the name of their sect some of them from these their school for thei that follow plato doctrin were call academiqu the follow of aristotl peripatetiqu from the walk hee taught in and those that zeno taught stoiqu from the stoa as if we should denomin men from morefield from paulschurch and from the exchang becaus thei meet there often to prate and loyter nevertheless men were so much taken with thi custom that in time it spread it self over all europ and the best part of afriqu so as there were school publiqu erect and maintain for lectur and disput almost in everi commonwealth of the school of the jew there were also school ancient both befor and after the time of our saviour amongst the jew but thei were school of their law for though thei were call synagogu that is to sai congreg of the peopl yet in as much as the law wa everi sabbath dai read expound and disput in them thei differ not in natur but in name on from publiqu school and were not on in jerusalem but in everi citi of the gentil where the jew inhabit there wa such a school at damascu whereinto paul entr to persecut there were other at antioch iconium and thessalonica whereinto he entr to disput and such wa the synagogu of the libertin cyrenian alexandrian cilician and those of asia that is to sai the school of libertin and of jew that were stranger in jerusalem and of thi school thei were that disput with saint steven the school of graecian unprofit but what ha been the util of those school what scienc is there at thi dai acquir by their read and disput that wee have of geometri which is the mother of all natural scienc wee ar not indebt for it to the school plato that wa the best philosoph of the greek forbad entranc into hi school to all that were not alreadi in some measur geometrician there were mani that studi that scienc to the great advantag of mankind but there is no mention of their school nor wa there ani sect of geometrician nor did thei then pass under the name of philosoph the natural philosophi of those school wa rather a dream than scienc and set forth in senseless and insignific languag which cannot be avoid by those that will teach philosophi without have first attain great knowledg in geometri for natur worketh by motion the way and degre whereof cannot be known without the knowledg of the proport and properti of line and figur their moral philosophi is but a descript of their own passion for the rule of manner without civil govern is the law of natur and in it the law civil that determineth what is honest and dishonest what is just and unjust and gener what is good and evil wherea thei make the rule of good and bad by their own like and dislik by which mean in so great divers of tast there is noth gener agre on but everi on doth as far as he dare whatsoev seemeth good in hi own ey to the subvers of commonwealth their logiqu which should bee the method of reason is noth els but caption of word and invent how to puzzl such as should goe about to pose them to conclud there is noth so absurd that the old philosoph as cicero saith who wa on of them have not some of them maintain and i beleev that scarc ani thing can be more absurdli said in natural philosophi than that which now is call aristotl metaphysiqu nor more repugn to govern than much of that hee hath said in hi politiqu nor more ignorantli than a great part of hi ethiqu the school of the jew unprofit the school of the jew wa origin a school of the law of mose who command deut that at the end of everi seventh year at the feast of the tabernacl it should be read to all the peopl that thei might hear and learn it therefor the read of the law which wa in us after the captiv everi sabbath dai ought to have had no other end but the acquaint of the peopl with the command which thei were to obei and to expound unto them the write of the prophet but it is manifest by the mani reprehens of them by our saviour that thei corrupt the text of the law with their fals commentari and vain tradit and so littl understood the prophet that thei did neither acknowledg christ nor the work he did for which the prophet propheci so that by their lectur and disput in their synagogu thei turn the doctrin of their law into a phantastical kind of philosophi concern the incomprehens natur of god and of spirit which thei compound of the vain philosophi and theologi of the graecian mingl with their own fanci drawn from the obscur place of the scriptur and which might most easili bee wrest to their purpos and from the fabul tradit of their ancestor univers what it is that which is now call an univers is a joyn togeth and an incorpor under on govern of mani publiqu school in on and the same town or citi in which the princip school were ordain for the three profess that is to sai of the roman religion of the roman law and of the art of medicin and for the studi of philosophi it hath no otherwis place then as a handmaid to the roman religion and sinc the author of aristotl is on current there that studi is not properli philosophi the natur whereof dependeth not on author but aristotel and for geometri till of veri late time it had no place at all as be subservi to noth but rigid truth and if ani man by the ingenu of hi own natur had attain to ani degre of perfect therein hee wa commonli thought a magician and hi art diabolical error brought into religion from aristotl metaphysiqu now to descend to the particular tenet of vain philosophi deriv to the univers and thenc into the church partli from aristotl partli from blindness of understand i shall first consid their principl there is a certain philosophia prima on which all other philosophi ought to depend and consisteth princip in right limit of the signif of such appel or name as ar of all other the most universal which limit serv to avoid ambigu and aequivoc in reason and ar commonli call definit such as ar the definit of bodi time place matter form essenc subject substanc accid power act finit infinit quantiti qualiti motion action passion and diver other necessari to the explain of a man concept concern the natur and gener of bodi the explic that is the setl of the mean of which and the like term is commonli in the school call metaphysiqu as be a part of the philosophi of aristotl which hath that for titl but it is in anoth sens for there it signifieth as much as book written or place after hi natural philosophi but the school take them for book of supernatural philosophi for the word metaphysiqu will bear both these sens and inde that which is there written is for the most part so far from the possibl of be understood and so repugn to natural reason that whosoev thinketh there is ani thing to bee understood by it must need think it supernatural error concern abstract essenc from these metaphysiqu which ar mingl with the scriptur to make school divin wee ar told there be in the world certain essenc separ from bodi which thei call abstract essenc and substantial form for the interpret of which jargon there is need of somewhat more than ordinari attent in thi place also i ask pardon of those that ar not us to thi kind of discours for appli my self to those that ar the world i mean not the earth on that denomin the lover of it worldli men but the univers that is the whole mass of all thing that ar is corporeal that is to sai bodi and hath the dimens of magnitud name length bredth and depth also everi part of bodi is likewis bodi and hath the like dimens and consequ everi part of the univers is bodi and that which is not bodi is no part of the univers and becaus the univers is all that which is no part of it is noth and consequ no where nor doe it follow from henc that spirit ar noth for thei have dimens and ar therefor realli bodi though that name in common speech be given to such bodi on as ar visibl or palpabl that is that have some degre of opac but for spirit thei call them incorporeal which is a name of more honour and mai therefor with more pieti bee attribut to god himself in whom wee consid not what attribut expresseth best hi natur which is incomprehens but what best expresseth our desir to honour him to know now upon what ground thei sai there be essenc abstract or substantial form wee ar to consid what those word do properli signifi the us of word is to regist to our selv and make manifest to other the thought and concept of our mind of which word some ar the name of the thing conceiv as the name of all sort of bodi that work upon the sens and leav an impress in the imagin other ar the name of the imagin themselv that is to sai of those idea or mental imag we have of all thing wee see or rememb and other again ar name of name or of differ sort of speech as universal plural singular negat true fals syllogism interrog promis coven ar the name of certain form of speech other serv to shew the consequ or repugn of on name to anoth as when on saith a man is a bodi hee intendeth that the name of bodi is necessarili consequ to the name of man as be but several name of the same thing man which consequ is signifi by coupl them togeth with the word is and as wee us the verb is so the latin us their verb est and the greek their esti through all it declin whether all other nation of the world have in their several languag a word that answereth to it or not i cannot tell but i am sure thei have not need of it for the place of two name in order mai serv to signifi their consequ if it were the custom for custom is it that give word their forc as well as the word is or bee or ar and the like and if it were so that there were a languag without ani verb answer to est or is or bee yet the men that us it would bee not a jot the less capabl of infer conclud and of all kind of reason than were the greek and latin but what then would becom of these term of entiti essenc essential essenti that ar deriv from it and of mani more that depend on these appli as most commonli thei ar thei ar therefor no name of thing but sign by which wee make known that wee conceiv the consequ of on name or attribut to anoth as when we sai a man is a live bodi wee mean not that the man is on thing the live bodi anoth and the is or bee a third but that the man and the live bodi is the same thing becaus the consequ if hee bee a man hee is a live bodi is a true consequ signifi by that word is therefor to bee a bodi to walk to bee speak to live to see and the like infinit also corpor walk speak life sight and the like that signifi just the same ar the name of noth as i have elsewher more ampli express but to what purpos mai some man sai is such subtilti in a work of thi natur where i pretend to noth but what is necessari to the doctrin of govern and obedi it is to thi purpos that men mai no longer suffer themselv to be abus by them that by thi doctrin of separ essenc built on the vain philosophi of aristotl would fright them from obei the law of their countrei with empti name as men fright bird from the corn with an empti doublet a hat and a crook stick for it is upon thi ground that when a man is dead and buri thei sai hi soul that is hi life can walk separ from hi bodi and is seen by night amongst the grave upon the same ground thei sai that the figur and colour and tast of a peec of bread ha a be there where thei sai there is no bread and upon the same ground thei sai that faith and wisdom and other vertu ar sometim powr into a man sometim blown into him from heaven as if the vertuou and their vertu could be asund and a great mani other thing that serv to lessen the depend of subject on the soveraign power of their countrei for who will endeavour to obei the law if he expect obedi to be powr or blown into him or who will not obei a priest that can make god rather than hi soveraign nai than god himself or who that is in fear of ghost will not bear great respect to those that can make the holi water that drive them from him and thi shall suffic for an exampl of the error which ar brought into the church from the entiti and essenc of aristotl which it mai be he knew to be fals philosophi but writ it as a thing conson to and corrobor of their religion and fear the fate of socrat be onc fallen into thi error of separ essenc thei ar therebi necessarili involv in mani other absurd that follow it for see thei will have these form to be reall thei ar oblig to assign them some place but becaus thei hold them incorporeal without all dimens of quantiti and all men know that place is dimens and not to be fill but by that which is corporeal thei ar driven to uphold their credit with a distinct that thei ar not inde ani where circumscript but definit which term be meer word and in thi occas insignific pass on in latin that the vaniti of them mai bee conceal for the circumscript of a thing is noth els but the determin or defin of it place and so both the term of the distinct ar the same and in particular of the essenc of a man which thei sai is hi soul thei affirm it to be all of it in hi littl finger and all of it in everi other part how small soever of hi bodi and yet no more soul in the whole bodi than in ani on of those part can ani man think that god is serv with such absurd and yet all thi is necessari to beleev to those that will beleev the exist of an incorporeal soul separ from the bodi and when thei come to give account how an incorporeal substanc can be capabl of pain and be torment in the fire of hell or purgatori thei have noth at all to answer but that it cannot be known how fire can burn soul again wherea motion is chang of place and incorporeal substanc ar not capabl of place thei ar troubl to make it seem possibl how a soul can goe henc without the bodi to heaven hell or purgatori and how the ghost of men and i mai add of their cloth which thei appear in can walk by night in church churchyard and other place of sepultur to which i know not what thei can answer unless thei will sai thei walk definit not circumscript or spiritu not tempor for such egregi distinct ar equal applic to ani difficulti whatsoev nuncstan for the mean of etern thei will not have it to be an endless success of time for then thei should not be abl to render a reason how god will and praeordain of thing to come should not be befor hi praescienc of the same as the effici caus befor the effect or agent befor the action nor of mani other their bold opinion concern the incomprehens natur of god but thei will teach us that etern is the stand still of the present time a nuncstan as the school call it which neither thei nor ani els understand no more than thei would a hicstan for an infinit greatness of place on bodi in mani place and mani bodi in on place at onc and wherea men divid a bodi in their thought by numbr part of it and in numbr those part number also the part of the place it fill it cannot be but in make mani part wee make also mani place of those part wherebi there cannot bee conceiv in the mind of ani man more or fewer part than there ar place for yet thei will have us beleev that by the almighti power of god on bodi mai be at on and the same time in mani place and mani bodi at on and the same time in on place as if it were an acknowledg of the divin power to sai that which is is not or that which ha been ha not been and these ar but a small part of the incongru thei ar forc to from their disput philosoph in stead of admir and ador of the divin and incomprehens natur whose attribut cannot signifi what he is but ought to signifi our desir to honour him with the best appel we can think on but thei that ventur to reason of hi natur from these attribut of honour lose their understand in the veri first attempt fall from on inconveni into anoth without end and without number in the same manner as when a man ignor of the ceremoni of court com into the presenc of a greater person than he is us to speak to and stumbl at hi entranc to save himself from fall let slip hi cloak to recov hi cloak let fall hi hat and with on disord after anoth discov hi astonish and rustic absurd in natural philosophi as graviti the caus of heaviness then for physiqu that is the knowledg of the subordin and secundari caus of natural event thei render none at all but empti word if you desir to know why some kind of bodi sink natur downward toward the earth and other goe natur from it the school will tell you out of aristotl that the bodi that sink downward ar heavi and that thi heaviness is it that caus them to descend but if you ask what thei mean by heaviness thei will defin it to bee an endeavour to goe to the center of the earth so that the caus why thing sink downward is an endeavour to be below which is as much as to sai that bodi descend or ascend becaus thei doe or thei will tell you the center of the earth is the place of rest and conserv for heavi thing and therefor thei endeavour to be there as if stone and metal had a desir or could discern the place thei would bee at as man doe or love rest as man doe not or that a peec of glass were less safe in the window than fall into the street quantiti put into bodi alreadi made if we would know why the same bodi seem greater without ad to it on time than anoth thei sai when it seem less it is condens when greater rarefi what is that condens and rarefi condens is when there is in the veri same matter less quantiti than befor and rarefi when more as if there could be matter that had not some determin quantiti when quantiti is noth els but the determin of matter that is to sai of bodi by which we sai on bodi is greater or lesser than anoth by thu or thu much or as if a bodi were made without ani quantiti at all and that afterward more or less were put into it accord as it is intend the bodi should be more or less dens powr in of soul for the caus of the soul of man thei sai creatur infundendo and creando infunditur that is it is creat by powr it in and powr in by creation ubiqu of apparit for the caus of sens an ubiqu of speci that is of the shew or apparit of object which when thei be apparit to the ey is sight when to the ear hear to the palat tast to the nostril smell and to the rest of the bodi feel will the caus of will for caus of the will to doe ani particular action which is call volitio thei assign the faculti that is to sai the capac in general that men have to will sometim on thing sometim anoth which is call volunta make the power the caus of the act as if on should assign for caus of the good or evil act of men their abil to doe them ignor an occult caus and in mani occas thei put for caus of natural event their own ignor but disguis in other word as when thei sai fortun is the caus of thing conting that is of thing whereof thei know no caus and as when thei attribut mani effect to occult qualiti that is qualiti not known to them and therefor also as thei think to no man els and to sympathi antipathi antiperistasi specifical qualiti and other like term which signifi neither the agent that produceth them nor the oper by which thei ar produc if such metaphysiqu and physiqu as thi be not vain philosophi there wa never ani nor need st paul to give us warn to avoid it on make the thing incongru anoth the incongru and for their moral and civil philosophi it hath the same or greater absurd if a man doe an action of injustic that is to sai an action contrari to the law god thei sai is the prime caus of the law and also the prime caus of that and all other action but no caus at all of the injustic which is the inconform of the action to the law thi is vain philosophi a man might as well sai that on man maketh both a streight line and a crook and anoth maketh their incongru and such is the philosophi of all men that resolv of their conclus befor thei know their premis pretend to comprehend that which is incomprehens and of attribut of honour to make attribut of natur as thi distinct wa made to maintain the doctrin of freewil that is of a will of man not subject to the will of god privat appetit the rule of publiqu good aristotl and other heathen philosoph defin good and evil by the appetit of men and well enough as long as we consid them govern everi on by hi own law for in the condit of men that have no other law but their own appetit there can be no general rule of good and evil action but in a commonwealth thi measur is fals not the appetit of privat men but the law which is the will and appetit of the state is the measur and yet is thi doctrin still practis and men judg the goodness or wickedness of their own and of other men action and of the action of the commonwealth it self by their own passion and no man calleth good or evil but that which is so in hi own ey without ani regard at all to the publiqu law except on monk and frier that ar bound by vow to that simpl obedi to their superiour to which everi subject ought to think himself bound by the law of natur to the civil soveraign and thi privat measur of good is a doctrin not on vain but also pernici to the publiqu state and that lawful marriag is unchast it is also vain and fals philosophi to sai the work of marriag is repugn to chastiti or contin and by consequ to make them moral vice as thei doe that pretend chastiti and contin for the ground of deni marriag to the clergi for thei confess it is no more but a constitut of the church that requireth in those holi order that continu attend the altar and administr of the eucharist a continual abstin from women under the name of continual chastiti contin and puriti therefor thei call the lawful us of wive want of chastiti and contin and so make marriag a sin or at least a thing so impur and unclean as to render a man unfit for the altar if the law were made becaus the us of wive is incontin and contrari to chastiti then all marriag is vice if becaus it is a thing too impur and unclean for a man consecr to god much more should other natural necessari and daili work which all men doe render men unworthi to bee priest becaus thei ar more unclean but the secret foundat of thi prohibit of marriag of priest is not like to have been laid so slightli as upon such errour in moral philosophi nor yet upon the prefer of singl life to the estat of matrimoni which proceed from the wisdom of st paul who perceiv how inconveni a thing it wa for those that in those time of persecut were preacher of the gospel and forc to fly from on countrei to anoth to be clog with the care of wife and children but upon the design of the pope and priest of after time to make themselv the clergi that is to sai sole heir of the kingdom of god in thi world to which it wa necessari to take from them the us of marriag becaus our saviour saith that at the come of hi kingdom the children of god shall neither marri nor bee given in marriag but shall bee as the angel in heaven that is to sai spiritual see then thei had taken on them the name of spiritual to have allow themselv when there wa no need the proprieti of wive had been an incongru and that all govern but popular is tyranni from aristotl civil philosophi thei have learn to call all manner of commonwealth but the popular such as wa at that time the state of athen tyranni all king thei call tyrant and the aristocraci of the thirti governour set up there by the lacedemonian that subdu them the thirti tyrant as also to call the condit of the peopl under the democraci liberti a tyrant origin signifi no more simpli but a monarch but when afterward in most part of greec that kind of govern wa abolish the name began to signifi not on the thing it did befor but with it the hatr which the popular state bare toward it as also the name of king becam odiou after the depos of the king in rome as be a thing natural to all men to conceiv some great fault to be signifi in ani attribut that is given in despight and to a great enemi and when the same men shall be displeas with those that have the administr of the democraci or aristocraci thei ar not to seek for disgrac name to express their anger in but call readili the on anarchi and the other oligarchi or the tyranni of a few and that which offendeth the peopl is no other thing but that thei ar govern not as everi on of them would himself but as the publiqu represent be it on man or an assembl of men think fit that is by an arbitrari govern for which thei give evil name to their superior never know till perhap a littl after a civil warr that without such arbitrari govern such warr must be perpetual and that it is men and arm not word and promis that make the forc and power of the law that not men but law govern and therefor thi is anoth errour of aristotl politiqu that in a wel order commonwealth not men should govern but the law what man that ha hi natural sens though he can neither write nor read doe not find himself govern by them he fear and beleev can kill or hurt him when he obeyeth not or that beleev the law can hurt him that is word and paper without the hand and sword of men and thi is of the number of pernici error for thei induc men as oft as thei like not their governour to adhaer to those that call them tyrant and to think it lawful to rais warr against them and yet thei ar mani time cherish from the pulpit by the clergi law over the conscienc there is anoth errour in their civil philosophi which thei never learn of aristotl nor cicero nor ani other of the heathen to extend the power of the law which is the rule of action on to the veri thought and conscienc of men by examin and inquisit of what thei hold notwithstand the conform of their speech and action by which men ar either punish for answer the truth of their thought or constrain to answer an untruth for fear of punish it is true that the civil magistr intend to emploi a minist in the charg of teach mai enquir of him if hee bee content to preach such and such doctrin and in case of refusal mai deni him the employ but to forc him to accus himself of opinion when hi action ar not by law forbidden is against the law of natur and especi in them who teach that a man shall bee damn to eternal and extream torment if he die in a fals opinion concern an articl of the christian faith for who is there that know there is so great danger in an error when the natural care of himself compelleth not to hazard hi soul upon hi own judgement rather than that of ani other man that is unconcern in hi damnat privat interpret of law for a privat man without the author of the commonwealth that is to sai without permiss from the represent thereof to interpret the law by hi own spirit is anoth error in the politiqu but not drawn from aristotl nor from ani other of the heathen philosoph for none of them deni but that in the power of make law is comprehend also the power of explain them when there is need and ar not the scriptur in all place where thei ar law made law by the author of the commonwealth and consequ a part of the civil law of the same kind it is also when ani but the soveraign restraineth in ani man that power which the commonwealth hath not restrain as thei do that impropri the preach of the gospel to on certain order of men where the law have left it free if the state give me leav to preach or teach that is if it forbid me not no man can forbid me if i find my self amongst the idolat of america shall i that am a christian though not in order think it a sin to preach jesu christ till i have receiv order from rome or when i have preach shall not i answer their doubt and expound the scriptur to them that is shall i not teach but for thi mai some sai as also for administr to them the sacrament the necess shall be esteem for a suffici mission which is true but thi is true also that for whatsoev a dispens is due for the necess for the same there need no dispens when there is no law that forbid it therefor to deni these function to those to whom the civil soveraign hath not deni them is a take awai of a lawful liberti which is contrari to the doctrin of civil govern languag of schooledivin more exampl of vain philosophi brought into religion by the doctor of schooledivin might be produc but other men mai if thei pleas observ them of themselv i shall on add thi that the write of schooledivin ar noth els for the most part but insignific train of strang and barbar word or word otherwis us then in the common us of the latin tongu such as would pose cicero and varro and all the grammarian of ancient rome which if ani man would see prove let him as i have said onc befor see whether he can translat ani schooledivin into ani of the modern tongu as french english or ani other copiou languag for that which cannot in most of these be made intellig is no intellig in the latin which insignific of languag though i cannot note it for fals philosophi yet it hath a qualiti not on to hide the truth but also to make men think thei have it and desist from further search

no more unit in the empir of rome thi benefit of an universal monarchi consid the desir of men to bear rule is a suffici presumpt that the pope that pretend to it and for a long time enjoi it were the author of the doctrin by which it wa obtain name that the church now on earth is the kingdom of christ for that grant it must be understood that christ hath some lieuten amongst us by whom we ar to be told what ar hi command after that certain church had renounc thi universal power of the pope on would expect in reason that the civil soveraign in all those church should have recov so much of it as befor thei had unadvisedli let it goe wa their own right and in their own hand and in england it wa so in effect save that thei by whom the king administr the govern of religion by maintain their imploy to be in god right seem to usurp if not a supremaci yet an independ on the civil power and thei but seem to usurp it in as much as thei acknowledg a right in the king to depriv them of the exercis of their function at hi pleasur and maintain also by the presbyteri but in those place where the presbyteri took that offic though mani other doctrin of the church of rome were forbidden to be taught yet thi doctrin that the kingdom of christ is alreadi come and that it began at the resurrect of our saviour wa still retain but cui bono what profit did thei expect from it the same which the pope expect to have a soveraign power over the peopl for what is it for men to excommun their law king but to keep him from all place of god publiqu servic in hi own kingdom and with forc to resist him when he with forc endeavoureth to correct them or what is it without author from the civil soveraign to excommun ani person but to take from him hi lawful liberti that is to usurp an unlawful

whose govern these errour and the like encroach of ecclesiastiqu upon their offic at first crept in to the disturb of their possess and of the tranquil of their subject though thei suffer the same for want of foresight of the sequel and of insight into the design of their teacher mai nevertheless bee esteem accessori to their own and the publiqu dammag for without their author there could at first no sediti doctrin have been publiqu preach i sai thei might have hindr the same in the begin but when the peopl were onc possess by those spiritual men there wa no human remedi to be appli that ani man could invent and for the remedi that god should provid who never faileth in hi good time to destroi all the machin of men against the truth wee ar to attend hi good pleasur that suffereth mani time the prosper of hi enemi togeth with their ambit to grow to such a height as the violenc thereof openeth the ey which the wariness of their predecessour had befor seal up and make men by too much grasp let goe all as peter net wa broken by the struggl of too great a multitud of fish wherea the impati of those that strive to resist such encroach befor their subject ey were open did but encreas the power thei resist i doe not therefor blame the emperour frederick for hold the stirrop to our countryman pope adrian for such wa the disposit of hi subject then as if hee had not doe it hee wa not like to have succeed in the empir but i blame those that in the begin when their power wa entir by suffer such doctrin to be forg in the univers of their own dominion have holden the stirrop to all the succeed pope whilest thei mount into the throne of all christian soveraign to ride and tire both them and their peopl at their pleasur but as the invent of men ar woven so also ar thei ravel out the wai is the same but the order is invert the web begin at the first element of power which ar wisdom humil sincer and other vertu of the apostl whom the peopl convert obei out of rever not by oblig their conscienc were free and their word and action subject to none but the civil power afterward the presbyt as the flock of christ encreas assembl to consid what thei should teach and therebi oblig themselv to teach noth against the decre of their assembl made it to be thought the peopl were therebi oblig to follow their doctrin and when thei refus refus to keep them compani that wa then call excommun not as be infidel but as be disobedi and thi wa the first knot upon their liberti and the number of presbyt encreas the presbyt of the chief citi or provinc got themselv an author over the parochial presbyt and appropri to themselv the name of bishop and thi wa a second knot on christian liberti lastli the bishop of rome in regard of the imperial citi took upon him an author partli by the will of the emperour themselv and by the titl of pontifex maximu and at last when the emperour were grown weak by the priviledg of st peter over all other bishop of the empir which wa the third and last knot and the whole synthesi and construct of the pontifical power and therefor the analysi or resolut is by the same wai but begin with the knot that wa last ty as wee mai see in the dissolut of the praeterpolitical church govern in england first the power of the pope wa dissolv total by queen elizabeth and the bishop who befor exercis their function in right of the pope did afterward exercis the same in right of the queen and her successour though by retain the phrase of jure divino thei were thought to demand it by immedi right from god and so wa unti the first knot after thi the presbyterian late in england obtain the put down of episcopaci and so wa the second knot dissolv and almost at the same time the power wa taken also from the presbyterian and so we ar reduc to the independ of the primit christian to follow paul or cepha or apollo everi man as he liketh best which if it be without content and without measur the doctrin of christ by our affect to the person of hi minist the fault which the apostl reprehend in the corinthian is perhap the best first becaus there ought to be no power over the conscienc of men but of the word it self work faith in everi on not alway accord to the purpos of them that plant and water but of god himself that giveth the increas and secondli becaus it is unreason in them who teach there is such danger in everi littl errour to requir of a man endu with reason of hi own to follow the reason of ani other man or of the most voic of mani other men which is littl better then to ventur hi salvat at cross and pile nor ought those teacher to be displeas with thi loss of their antient author for there is none should know better then thei that power is preserv by the same vertu by which it is acquir that is to sai by wisdom humil clearness of doctrin and sincer of convers and not by suppress of the natural scienc and of the moral of natural reason nor by obscur languag nor by arrog to themselv more knowledg than thei make appear nor by piou fraud nor by such other fault as in the pastor of god church ar not onli fault but also scandal apt to make men stumbl on time or other upon the suppress of their author comparison of the papaci with the kingdom of fayri but after thi doctrin that the church now milit is the kingdom of god spoken of in the old and new testament wa receiv in the world the ambit and canvas for the offic that belong thereunto and especi for that great offic of be christ lieuten and the pomp of them that obtain therein the princip publiqu charg becam by degre so evid that thei lost the inward rever due to the pastoral function in so much as the wisest men of them that had ani power in the civil state need noth but the author of their princ to deni them ani further obedi for from the time that the bishop of rome had gotten to be acknowledg for bishop universal by pretenc of success to st peter their whole hierarchi or kingdom of darkness mai be compar not unfitli to the kingdom of fairi that is to the old wive fabl in england concern ghost and spirit and the feat thei plai in the night and if a man consid the original of thi great ecclesiastical dominion he will easili perceiv that the papaci is no other than the ghost of the deceas roman empir sit crown upon the grave thereof for so did the papaci start up on a sudden out of the ruin of that heathen power the languag also which thei us both in the church and in their publiqu act be latin which is not commonli us by ani nation now in the world what is it but the ghost of the old roman languag the fairi in what nation soever thei convers have but on universal king which some poet of our call king oberon but the scriptur call beelzebub princ of daemon the ecclesiastiqu likewis in whose dominion soever thei be found acknowledg but on universal king the pope the ecclesiastiqu ar spiritual men and ghostli father the fairi ar spirit and ghost fairi and ghost inhabit darkness solitud and grave the ecclesiastiqu walk in obscur of doctrin in monasteri church and churchyard the ecclesiastiqu have their cathedr church which in what town soever thei be erect by vertu of holi water and certain charm call exorcism have the power to make those town citi that is to sai seat of empir the fairi also have their enchant castl and certain gigantiqu ghost that domin over the region round about them the fairi ar not to be seiz on and brought to answer for the hurt thei do so also the ecclesiastiqu vanish awai from the tribun of civil justic the ecclesiastiqu take from young men the us of reason by certain charm compound of metaphysiqu and miracl and tradit and abus scriptur wherebi thei ar good for noth els but to execut what thei command them the fairi likewis ar said to take young children out of their cradl and to chang them into natural fool which common peopl do therefor call elv and ar apt to mischief in what shop or operatori the fairi make their enchant the old wive have not determin but the operatori of the clergi ar well enough known to be the univers that receiv their disciplin from author pontifical when the fairi ar displeas with ani bodi thei ar said to send their elv to pinch them the ecclesiastiqu when thei ar displeas with ani civil state make also their elv that is superstiti enchant subject to pinch their princ by preach sedit or on princ enchant with promis to pinch anoth the fairi marri not but there be amongst them incubi that have copul with flesh and bloud the priest also marri not the ecclesiastiqu take the cream of the land by donat of ignor men that stand in aw of them and by tyth so also it is in the fabl of fairi that thei enter into the dairi and feast upon the cream which thei skim from the milk what kind of monei is currant in the kingdom of fairi is not record in the stori but the ecclesiastiqu in their receipt accept of the same monei that we doe though when thei ar to make ani payment it is in canon indulg and mass to thi and such like resembl between the papaci and the kingdom of fairi mai be ad thi that as the fairi have no exist but in the fanci of ignor peopl rise from the tradit of old wive or old poet so the spiritual power of the pope without the bound of hi own civil dominion consisteth on in the fear that seduc peopl stand in of their excommun upon hear of fals miracl fals tradit and fals interpret of the scriptur it wa not therefor a veri difficult matter for henri by hi exorcism nor for qu elizabeth by her to cast them out but who know that thi spirit of rome now gone out and walk by mission through the dry place of china japan and the indi that yeeld him littl fruit mai not return or rather an assembl of spirit wors than he enter and inhabit thi clean swept hous and make the end thereof wors than the begin for it is not the roman clergi on that pretend the kingdom of god to be of thi world and therebi to have a power therein distinct from that of the civil state and thi is all i had a design to sai concern the doctrin of the politiqu which when i have review i shall willingli expos it to the censur of my countrei a review and conclus from the contrarieti of some of the natural faculti of the mind on to anoth as also of on passion to anoth and from their refer to convers there ha been an argument taken to inferr an imposs that ani on man should be suffici dispos to all sort of civil duti the sever of judgment thei sai make men censori and unapt to pardon the errour and infirm of other men and on the other side celer of fanci make the thought less steddi than is necessari to discern exactli between right and wrong again in all deliber and in all plead the faculti of solid reason is necessari for without it the resolut of men ar rash and their sentenc unjust and yet if there be not powerful eloqu which procureth attent and consent the effect of reason will be littl but these ar contrari faculti the former be ground upon principl of truth the other upon opinion alreadi receiv true or fals and upon the passion and interest of men which ar differ and mutabl and amongst the passion courag by which i mean the contempt of wound and violent death enclineth men to privat reveng and sometim to endeavour the unsetl of the publiqu peac and timorousness mani time disposeth to the desert of the publiqu defenc both these thei sai cannot stand togeth in the same person and to consid the contrarieti of men opinion and manner in general it is thei sai imposs to entertain a constant civil amiti with all those with whom the business of the world constrain us to convers which business consisteth almost in noth els but a perpetual content for honor rich and author to which i answer that these ar inde great difficulti but not imposs for by educ and disciplin thei mai bee and ar sometim reconcil judgment and fanci mai have place in the same man but by turn as the end which he aimeth at requireth as the israelit in egypt were sometim fasten to their labour of make brick and other time were rang abroad to gather straw so also mai the judgment sometim be fix upon on certain consider and the fanci at anoth time wandr about the world so also reason and eloqu though not perhap in the natural scienc yet in the moral mai stand veri well togeth for wheresoev there is place for adorn and prefer of errour there is much more place for adorn and prefer of truth if thei have it to adorn nor is there ani repugn between fear the law and not fear a publiqu enemi nor between abstain from injuri and pardon it in other there is therefor no such inconsist of human natur with civil duti as some think i have known cleerness of judgment and largeness of fanci strength of reason and graceful elocut a courag for the warr and a fear for the law and all emin in on man and that wa my most nobl and honor friend mr sidnei godolphin who hate no man nor hate of ani wa unfortun slain in the begin of the late civil warr in the publiqu quarrel by an indiscern and an undiscern hand to the law of natur declar in the chapter i would have thi ad that everi man is bound by natur as much as in him lieth to protect in warr the author by which he is himself protect in time of peac for he that pretendeth a right of natur to preserv hi own bodi cannot pretend a right of natur to destroi him by whose strength he is preserv it is a manifest contradict of himself and though thi law mai bee drawn by consequ from some of those that ar there alreadi mention yet the time requir to have it inculc and remembr and becaus i find by diver english book late print that the civil warr have not yet suffici taught men in what point of time it is that a subject becom oblig to the conquerour nor what is conquest nor how it come about that it oblig men to obei hi law therefor for farther satisfact of men therein i sai the point of time wherein a man becom subject of a conquerour is that point wherein have liberti to submit to him he consenteth either by express word or by other suffici sign to be hi subject when it is that a man hath the liberti to submit i have show befor in the end of the chapter name that for him that hath no oblig to hi former soveraign but that of an ordinari subject it is then when the mean of hi life is within the guard and garrison of the enemi for it is then that he hath no longer protect from him but is protect by the advers parti for hi contribut see therefor such contribut is everi where as a thing inevit notwithstand it be an assist to the enemi esteem lawful as total submiss which is but an assist to the enemi cannot be esteem unlawful besid if a man consid that thei who submit assist the enemi but with part of their estat wherea thei that refus assist him with the whole there is no reason to call their submiss or composit an assist but rather a detriment to the enemi but if a man besid the oblig of a subject hath taken upon him a new oblig of a souldier then he hath not the liberti to submit to a new power as long as the old on keep the field and giveth him mean of subsist either in hi armi or garrison for in thi case he cannot complain of want of protect and mean to live as a souldier but when that also fail a souldier also mai seek hi protect wheresoev he ha most hope to have it and mai lawfulli submit himself to hi new master and so much for the time when he mai do it lawfulli if hee will if therefor he doe it he is undoubtedli bound to be a true subject for a contract lawfulli made cannot lawfulli be broken by thi also a man mai understand when it is that men mai be said to be conquer and in what the natur of conquest and the right of a conquerour consisteth for thi submiss is it implyeth them all conquest is not the victori it self but the acquisit by victori of a right over the person of men he therefor that is slain is overcom but not conquer he that is taken and put into prison or chain is not conquer though overcom for he is still an enemi and mai save himself if hee can but he that upon promis of obedi hath hi life and liberti allow him is then conquer and a subject and not befor the roman us to sai that their general had pacifi such a provinc that is to sai in english conquer it and that the countrei wa pacifi by victori when the peopl of it had promis imperata facer that is to doe what the roman peopl command them thi wa to be conquer but thi promis mai be either express or tacit express by promis tacit by other sign as for exampl a man that hath not been call to make such an express promis becaus he is on whose power perhap is not consider yet if he live under their protect openli hee is understood to submit himself to the govern but if he live there secretli he is lyabl to ani thing that mai bee done to a spie and enemi of the state i sai not hee doe ani injustic for act of open hostil bear not that name but that he mai be justli put to death likewis if a man when hi countri is conquer be out of it he is not conquer nor subject but if at hi return he submit to the govern he is bound to obei it so that conquest to defin it is the acquir of the right of soveraignti by victori which right is acquir in the peopl submiss by which thei contract with the victor promis obedi for life and liberti in the th chapter i have set down for on of the caus of the dissolut of commonwealth their imperfect gener consist in the want of an absolut and arbitrari legisl power for want whereof the civil soveraign is fain to handl the sword of justic unconstantli and as if it were too hot for him to hold on reason whereof which i have not there mention is thi that thei will all of them justifi the war by which their power wa at first gotten and whereon as thei think their right dependeth and not on the possess as if for exampl the right of the king of england did depend on the goodness of the caus of william the conquerour and upon their lineal and directest descent from him by which mean there would perhap be no tie of the subject obedi to their soveraign at thi dai in all the world wherein whilest thei needless think to justifi themselv thei justifi all the successeful rebellion that ambit shall at ani time rais against them and their successor therefor i put down for on of the most effectual seed of the death of ani state that the conquerour requir not on a submiss of men action to them for the futur but also an approb of all their action past when there is scarc a commonwealth in the world whose begin can in conscienc be justifi and becaus the name of tyranni signifieth noth more nor less than the name of soveraignti be it in on or mani men save that thei that us the former word ar understood to bee angri with them thei call tyrant i think the toler of a profess hatr of tyranni is a toler of hatr to commonwealth in gener and anoth evil seed not differ much from the former for to the justif of the caus of a conqueror the reproach of the caus of the conquer is for the most part necessari but neither of them necessari for the oblig of the conquer and thu much i have thought fit to sai upon the review of the first and second part of thi discours in the th chapter i have suffici declar out of the scriptur that in the commonwealth of the jew god himself wa made the soveraign by pact with the peopl who were therefor call hi peculiar peopl to distinguish them from the rest of the world over whom god reign not by their consent but by hi own power and that in thi kingdom mose wa god lieuten on earth and that it wa he that told them what law god appoint to doe execut especi in capital punish not then think it a matter of so necessari consider as i find it sinc wee know that gener in all commonwealth the execut of corporeal punish wa either put upon the guard or other souldier of the soveraign power or given to those in whom want of mean contempt of honour and hardness of heart concur to make them sue for such an offic but amongst the israelit it wa a posit law of god their soveraign that he that wa convict of a capital crime should be stone to death by the peopl and that the wit should cast the first stone and after the wit then the rest of the peopl thi wa a law that design who were to be the execution but not that ani on should throw a stone at him befor convict and sentenc where the congreg wa judg the wit were nevertheless to be heard befor thei proceed to execut unless the fact were commit in the presenc of the congreg it self or in sight of the lawful judg for then there need no other wit but the judg themselv nevertheless thi manner of proceed be not throughli understood hath given occas to a danger opinion that ani man mai kill anoth is some case by a right of zeal as if the execut done upon offend in the kingdom of god in old time proceed not from the soveraign command but from the author of privat zeal which if we consid the text that seem to favour it is quit contrari first where the levit fell upon the peopl that had made and worship the golden calf and slew three thousand of them it wa by the command of mose from the mouth of god as is manifest exod and when the son of a woman of israel had blasphem god thei that heard it did not kill him but brought him befor mose who put him under custodi till god should give sentenc against him as appear levit again number when phineha kill zimri and cosbi it wa not by right of privat zeal their crime wa commit in the sight of the assembl there need no witness the law wa known and he the heir appar to the soveraignti and which is the principal point the lawfulness of hi act depend wholli upon a subsequ ratif by mose whereof he had no caus to doubt and thi presumpt of a futur ratif is sometim necessari to the safeti of a commonwealth as in a sudden rebellion ani man that can suppress it by hi own power in the countrei where it begin mai lawfulli doe it and provid to have it ratifi or pardon whilest it is in do or after it is done also numb it is express said whosoev shall kill the murther shall kill him upon the word of wit but wit suppos a formal judicatur and consequ condemn that pretenc of ju zelotarum the law of mose concern him that enticeth to idolatri that is to sai in the kingdom of god to a renounc of hi allegi deut forbid to conceal him and command the accus to caus him to be put to death and to cast the first stone at him but not to kill him befor he be condemn and deut ver the process against idolatri is exactli set down for god there speaketh to the peopl as judg and commandeth them when a man is accus of idolatri to enquir dilig of the fact and find it true then to stone him but still the hand of the witness throweth the first stone thi is not privat zeal but publiqu condemn in like manner when a father hath a rebelli son the law is deut that he shall bring him befor the judg of the town and all the peopl of the town shall stone him lastli by pretenc of these law it wa that st steven wa stone and not by pretenc of privat zeal for befor hee wa carri awai to execut he had plead hi caus befor the high priest there is noth in all thi nor in ani other part of the bibl to counten execut by privat zeal which be oftentim but a conjunct of ignor and passion is against both the justic and peac of a commonwealth in the th chapter i have said that it is not declar in what manner god spake supernatur to mose not that he spake not to him sometim by dream and vision and by a supernatural voic as to other prophet for the manner how he spake unto him from the mercyseat is express set down number in these word from that time forward when mose entr into the tabernacl of the congreg to speak with god he heard a voic which spake unto him from over the mercys which is over the ark of the testimoni from between the cherubin he spake unto him but it is not declar in what consist the praeemin of the manner of god speak to mose abov that of hi speak to other prophet as to samuel and to abraham to whom he also spake by a voic that is by vision unless the differ consist in the cleerness of the vision for face to face and mouth to mouth cannot be liter understood of the infiniteness and incomprehens of the divin natur and as to the whole doctrin i see not yet but the principl of it ar true and proper and the ratiocin solid for i ground the civil right of soveraign and both the duti and liberti of subject upon the known natural inclin of mankind and upon the articl of the law of natur of which no man that pretend but reason enough to govern hi privat famili ought to be ignor and for the power ecclesiastical of the same soveraign i ground it on such text as ar both evid in themselv and conson to the scope of the whole scriptur and therefor am perswad that he that shall read it with a purpos on to be inform shall be inform by it but for those that by write or publiqu discours or by their emin action have alreadi engag themselv to the maintain of contrari opinion thei will not bee so easili satisfi for in such case it is natural for men at on and the same time both to proce in read and to lose their attent in the search of object to that thei had read befor of which in a time wherein the interest of men ar chang see much of that doctrin which serveth to the establish of a new govern must need be contrari to that which conduc to the dissolut of the old there cannot choos but be veri mani in that part which treateth of a christian commonwealth there ar some new doctrin which it mai be in a state where the contrari were alreadi fulli determin were a fault for a subject without leav to divulg as be an usurp of the place of a teacher but in thi time that men call not on for peac but also for truth to offer such doctrin as i think true and that manifestli tend to peac and loyalti to the consider of those that ar yet in deliber is no more but to offer new wine to bee put into new cask that both mai be preserv togeth and i suppos that then when novelti can breed no troubl nor disord in a state men ar not gener so much inclin to the rever of antiqu as to preferr ancient error befor new and well prove truth there is noth i distrust more than my elocut which nevertheless i am confid except the mischanc of the press is not obscur that i have neglect the ornament of quot ancient poet orat and philosoph contrari to the custom of late time whether i have done well or ill in it proceedeth from my judgment ground on mani reason for first all truth of doctrin dependeth either upon reason or upon scriptur both which give credit to mani but never receiv it from ani writer secondli the matter in question ar not of fact but of right wherein there is no place for wit there is scarc ani of those old writer that contradicteth not sometim both himself and other which make their testimoni insuffici fourthli such opinion as ar taken on upon credit of antiqu ar not intrins the judgment of those that cite them but word that pass like gape from mouth to mouth fiftli it is mani time with a fraudul design that men stick their corrupt doctrin with the clove of other men wit sixtli i find not that the ancient thei cite took it for an ornament to doe the like with those that wrote befor them seventhli it is an argument of indigest when greek and latin sentenc unchew come up again as thei us to doe unchang lastli though i rever those men of ancient time that either have written truth perspicu or set us in a better wai to find it out our selv yet to the antiqu it self i think noth due for if we will rever the ag the present is the oldest if the antiqu of the writer i am not sure that gener thei to whom such honor is given were more ancient when thei wrote than i am that am write but if it bee well consid the prais of ancient author proce not from the rever of the dead but from the competit and mutual envi of the live to conclud there is noth in thi whole discours nor in that i writ befor of the same subject in latin as far as i can perceiv contrari either to the word of god or to good manner or to the disturb of the publiqu tranquil therefor i think it mai be profit print and more profit taught in the univers in case thei also think so to whom the judgment of the same belongeth for see the univers ar the fountain of civil and moral doctrin from whenc the preacher and the gentri draw such water as thei find us to sprinkl the same both from the pulpit and in their convers upon the peopl there ought certainli to be great care taken to have it pure both from the venim of heathen politician and from the incant of deceiv spirit and by that mean the most men know their duti will be the less subject to serv the ambit of a few discont person in their purpos against the state and be the less griev with the contribut necessari for their peac and defenc and the governour themselv have the less caus to maintain at the common charg ani greater armi than is necessari to make good the publiqu liberti against the invas and encroach of forraign enemi and thu i have brought to an end my discours of civil and ecclesiastical govern occas by the disord of the present time without partial without applic and without other design than to set befor men ey the mutual relat between protect and obedi of which the condit of human natur and the law divin both natural and posit requir an inviol observ and though in the revolut of state there can be no veri good constel for truth of thi natur to be born under as have an angri aspect from the dissolv of an old govern and see but the back of them that erect a new yet i cannot think it will be condemn at thi time either by the publiqu judg of doctrin or by ani that desir the continu of publiqu peac and in thi hope i return to my interrupt specul of bodi natural wherein if god give me health to finish it i hope the novelti will as much pleas as in the doctrin of thi artificial bodi it useth to offend for such truth as opposeth no man profit nor pleasur is to all men welcom fini end of the project
