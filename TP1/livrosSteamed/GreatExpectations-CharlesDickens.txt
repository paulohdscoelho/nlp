by a signal from the sergeant s hand while two or three of hi men dispers themselv among the grave and also examin the porch thei came in again without find anyth and then we struck out on the open marsh through the gate at the side of the churchyard a bitter sleet came rattl against us here on the east wind and joe took me on hi back now that we were out upon the dismal wilder where thei littl thought i had been within eight or nine hour and had seen both men hide i consid for the first time with great dread if we should come upon them would my particular convict suppos that it wa i who had brought the soldier there he had ask me if i wa a deceiv imp and he had said i should be a fierc young hound if i join the hunt against him would he believ that i wa both imp and hound in treacher earnest and had betrai him it wa of no us ask myself thi question now there i wa on joe s back and there wa joe beneath me charg at the ditch like a hunter and stimul mr wopsl not to tumbl on hi roman

mist either the mist wa not out again yet or the wind had dispel it under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the mound of the batteri and the opposit shore of the river were plain though all of a wateri lead color with my heart thump like a blacksmith at joe s broad shoulder i look all about for ani sign of the convict i could see none i could hear none mr wopsl had greatli alarm me more than onc by hi blow and hard breath but i knew the sound by thi time and could dissoci them from the object of pursuit i got a dread start when i thought i heard the file still go but it wa onli a sheepbel the sheep stop in their eat and look timidli at us and the cattl their head turn from the wind and sleet stare angrili as if thei held us respons for both annoy but except these thing and the shudder of the dy dai in everi blade of grass there wa no break in the bleak still of the marsh the soldier were move on in the direct of the old batteri and we were move on a littl wai behind them when all of a sudden we all stop for there had reach us on the wing of the wind and rain a long shout it wa repeat it wa at a distanc toward the east but it wa long and loud nai there seem to be two or more shout rais togetherif on might judg from a confus in the sound to thi effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speak under their breath when joe and i came up after anoth moment s listen joe who wa a good judg agre and mr wopsl who wa a bad judg agre the sergeant a decis man order that the sound should not be answer but that the cours should be chang and that hi men should make toward it at the doubl so we slant to the right where the east wa and joe pound awai so wonderfulli that i had to hold on tight to keep my seat it wa a run inde now and what joe call in the onli two word he spoke all the time a winder down bank and up bank and over gate and splash into dike and break among coars rush no man care where he went as we came nearer to the shout it

confound me and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strang room mani hour you ar to wait here you boi said estella and disappear and close the door i took the opportun of be alon in the courtyard to look at my coars hand and my common boot my opinion of those accessori wa not favor thei had never troubl me befor but thei troubl me now as vulgar appendag i determin to ask joe why he had ever taught me to call those picturecard jack which ought to be call knave i wish joe had been rather more genteelli brought up and then i should have been so too she came back with some bread and meat and a littl mug of beer she put the mug down on the stone of the yard and gave me the bread and meat without look at me as insol as if i were a dog in disgrac i wa so humili hurt spurn offend angri sorryi cannot hit upon the right name for the smartgod know what it name wasthat tear start to my ey the moment thei sprang there the girl look at me with a quick delight in have been the caus of them thi gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so she gave a contemptu tossbut with a sens i thought of have made too sure that i wa so woundedand left me but when she wa gone i look about me for a place to hide my face in and got behind on of the gate in the brewerylan and lean my sleev against the wall there and lean my forehead on it and cri as i cri i kick the wall and took a hard twist at my hair so bitter were my feel and so sharp wa the smart without a name that need counteract my sister s bring up had made me sensit in the littl world in which children have their exist whosoev bring them up there is noth so fine perceiv and so fine felt as injustic it mai be onli small injustic that the child can be expos to but the child is small and it world is small and it rockinghors stand as mani hand high accord to scale as a bigbon irish hunter within myself i had sustain from my babyhood a perpetu conflict with injustic i had known from the time when i could speak that my sister in her caprici and violent coercion wa unjust to me i had cherish a profound convict that her bring me up by hand gave her no right to bring me up by jerk through all my punish disgrac fast and vigil and other penitenti perform i had nurs thi assur and to my commun so much with it in a solitari and unprotect wai i in great part refer the fact that i wa moral timid and veri sensit i got rid of my injur feel for the time by kick them into the breweri wall and twist them out of my hair and then i smooth my face with my sleev and came from behind the gate the bread and meat were accept and the beer wa warm and tingl and i wa soon in spirit to look about me to be sure it wa a desert place down to the pigeonhous in the breweryyard which had been blown crook on it pole by some high wind and would have made the pigeon think themselv at sea if there had been ani pigeon there to be rock by it but there were no pigeon in the dovecot no hors in the stabl no pig in the sty no malt in the storehous no smell of grain and beer in the copper or the vat all the us and scent of the breweri might have evapor with it last reek of smoke in a byyard there wa a wilder of empti cask which had a certain sour remembr of better dai linger about them but it wa too sour to be accept as a sampl of the beer that wa goneand in thi respect i rememb those reclus as be like most other behind the furthest end of the breweri wa a rank garden with an old wall not so high but that i could struggl up and hold on long enough to look over it and see that the rank garden wa the garden of the hous and that it wa overgrown with tangl weed but that there wa a track upon the green and yellow path as if some on sometim walk there and that estella wa walk awai from me even then but she seem to be everywher for when i yield to the temptat present by the cask and began to walk on them i saw her walk on them at the end of the yard of cask she had her back toward me and held her pretti brown hair spread out in her two hand and never look round and pass out of my view directli so in the breweri itselfbi which i mean the larg pave lofti place in which thei us to make the beer and where the brew utensil still were when i first went into it and rather oppress by it gloom stood near the door look about me i saw her pass among the extinguish fire and ascend some light iron stair and go out by a galleri high overhead as if she were go out into the sky it wa in thi place and at thi moment that a strang thing happen to my fanci i thought it a strang thing then and i thought it a stranger thing long afterward i turn my eyesa littl dim by look up at the frosti lighttoward a great wooden beam in a low nook of the build near me on my right hand and i saw a figur hang there by the neck a figur all in yellow white with but on shoe to the feet and it hung so that i could see that the fade trim of the dress were like earthi paper and that the face wa miss havisham s with a movement go over the whole counten as if she were try to call to me in the terror of see the figur and in the terror of be certain that it had not been there a moment befor i at first ran from it and then ran toward it and my terror wa greatest of all when i found no figur there noth less than the frosti light of the cheer sky the sight of peopl pass beyond the bar of the courtyard gate and the reviv influenc of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought me round even with those aid i might not have come to myself as soon as i did but that i saw estella approach with the kei to let me out she would have some fair reason for look down upon me i thought if she saw me frighten and she would have no fair reason she gave me a triumphant glanc in pass me as if she rejoic that my hand were so coars and my boot were so thick and she open the gate and stood hold it i wa pass out without look at her when she touch me with a taunt hand why don t you cry becaus i don t want to you do said she you have been cry till you ar half blind and you ar near cry again now she laugh contemptu push me out and lock the gate upon me i went straight to mr pumblechook s and wa immens reliev to find him not at home so leav word with the shopman on what dai i wa want at miss havisham s again i set off on the fourmil walk to our forg ponder as i went along on all i had seen and deepli revolv

from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back and have my face ignomini shove against the kitchen wall becaus i did not answer those question at suffici length if a dread of not be understood be hidden in the breast of other young peopl to anyth like the extent to which it us to be hidden in minewhich i consid probabl as i have no particular reason to suspect myself of have been a monstrosityit is the kei to mani reserv i felt convinc that if i describ miss havisham s as my ey had seen it i should not be understood not onli that but i felt convinc that miss havisham too would not be understood and although she wa perfectli incomprehens to me i entertain an impress that there would be someth coars and treacher in my drag her as she realli wa to sai noth of miss estella befor the contempl of mr joe consequ i said as littl as i could and had my face shove against the kitchen wall the worst of it wa that that bulli old pumblechook prei upon by a devour curios to be

upon my daili remembr to which the anvil wa a feather there have been occas in my later life i suppos as in most live when i have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all it interest and romanc to shut me out from anyth save dull endur ani more never ha that curtain drop so heavi and blank as when my wai in life lai stretch out straight befor me through the newli enter road of apprenticeship to joe i rememb that at a later period of my time i us to stand about the churchyard on sundai even when night wa fall compar my own perspect with the windi marsh view and make out some like between them by think how flat and low both were and how on both there came an unknown wai and a dark mist and then the sea i wa quit as deject on the first workingdai of my apprenticeship as in that aftertim but i am glad to know that i never breath a murmur to joe while my indentur last it is about the onli thing i am glad to know of myself in that connect for though it includ what i proce to add all the merit of what i proce to add wa joe s it wa not becaus i wa faith but becaus joe wa faith that i never ran awai and went for a soldier or a sailor it wa not becaus i had a strong sens of the virtu of industri but becaus joe had a strong sens of the virtu of industri that i work with toler zeal against the grain it is not possibl to know how far the influenc of ani amiabl honestheart dutydo man fli out into the world but it is veri possibl to know how it ha touch on s self in go by and i know right well that ani good that intermix itself with my apprenticeship came of plain content joe and not of restlessli aspir discont me what i want who can sai how can i sai when i never knew what i dread wa that in some unlucki hour i be at my grimiest and commonest should lift up my ey and see estella look in at on of the wooden window of the forg i wa haunt by the fear that she would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hand do the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despis me often after dark when i wa pull the bellow for joe and we were sing old clem and when the thought how we us to sing it at miss havisham s would seem to show me estella s face in the fire with her pretti hair flutter in the wind and her ey scorn meoften at such a time i would look toward those panel of black night in the wall which the wooden window then were and would fanci that i saw her just draw her face awai and would believ that she had come at last after that when we went into supper the place and the meal would have a more home look than ever and i would feel more asham of home than ever in my own ungraci breast chapter xv as i wa get too big for mr wopsl s greataunt s room my educ under that preposter femal termin not howev until biddi had

wa there or in the yard and there wa a surgeon and there wa joe and there were a group of women all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen the unemploi bystand drew back when thei saw me and so i becam awar of my sisterli without sens or movement on the bare board where she had been knock down by a tremend blow on the back of the head dealt by some unknown hand when her face wa turn toward the

at the fire as she took up her work again and said she would be veri particular and joe still detain hi knee said ay ay i ll be ekerv partickl pip and then thei congratul me again and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my be a gentleman that i didn t half like it infinit pain were then taken by biddi to convei to my sister some idea of what had happen to the best of my belief those effort entir fail she laugh and nod her head a great mani time and even repeat after biddi the word pip and properti but i doubt if thei had more mean in them than an elect cry and i cannot suggest a darker pictur of her state of mind i never could have believ it without experi but as joe and biddi becam more at their cheer eas again i becam quit gloomi dissatisfi with my fortun of cours i could not be but it is possibl that i mai have been without quit know it dissatisfi with myself ani how i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand look into the fire as those two talk about my go awai and about what thei should do without me and all that and whenev i caught on of them look at me though never so pleasantli and thei often look at meparticularli biddi i felt offend as if thei were express some mistrust of me though heaven know thei never did by word or sign at those time i would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen door open at onc upon the night and stood open on summer even to air the room the veri star to which i then rais my ey i am afraid i took to be but poor and humbl star for glitter on the rustic object among which i had pass my life saturdai night said i when we sat at our supper of bread and chees and beer five more dai and then the dai befor the dai thei ll soon go ye pip observ joe whose voic sound hollow in hi beermug thei ll

and took a long look at it as a mean littl room that i should soon be part from and rais abov for ever it wa furnish with fresh young remembr too and even at the same moment i fell into much the same confus divis of mind between it and the better room to which i wa go as i had been in so often between the forg and miss havisham s and biddi and estella the sun had been shine brightli all dai on the roof of my attic and the room wa warm as i put the window open and stood look out i saw joe come slowli forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two in the air and then i saw biddi come and

london we briton had at that time particularli settl that it wa treason to doubt our have and our be the best of everyth otherwis while i wa scare by the immens of london i think i might have had some faint doubt whether it wa not rather ugli crook narrow and dirti mr jagger had duli sent me hi address it wa littl britain and he had written after it on hi card just out of smithfield and close by

great coronet outsid and rag thing behind for i don t know how mani footmen to hold on by and a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from yield to the temptat i had scarc had time to enjoi the coach and to think how like a strawyard it wa and yet how like a ragshop and to wonder why the hors nosebag were kept insid when i observ the coachman begin to get down as if we were go to stop present and stop we present did in a gloomi street at certain offic with an open door whereon wa paint mr jagger how much i ask the coachman the coachman answer a shillingunless you wish to make it more i natur said i had no wish to make it more then it must be a shill observ the coachman i don t want to get into troubl i know him he darkli close an ey at mr jagger s name and shook hi head when he had got hi shill and had in cours of time complet the ascent to hi box and had got awai which appear to reliev hi mind i went into the front offic with my littl portmanteau in my hand and ask wa mr

cast on a shelf of face peculiarli swollen and twitchi about the nose mr jagger s own highback chair wa of deadli black horsehair with row of brass nail round it like a coffin and i fanci i could see how he lean back in it and bit hi forefing at the client the room wa but small and the client seem to have had a habit of back up against the wall the wall especi opposit to mr jagger s chair be greasi with shoulder i recal too that the oneei gentleman had shuffl forth against the wall when i wa the innoc caus of hi be turn out i sat down in the cliental chair place over against mr jagger s

there were upstair and whether thei all claim to have the same detriment masteri of their fellowcreatur i wonder what wa the histori of all the odd litter about the room and how it came there i wonder whether the two swollen face were of mr jagger s famili and if he were so unfortun as to have had a pair of such illlook relat why he stuck them on that dusti perch for the black and fli to settl on instead of give them a place at home of cours i had no experi of a london summer dai and my spirit mai have been oppress by the hot exhaust air and by the dust and grit that lai thick on everyth but i

pursu miss havisham close and profess to be devot to her i believ she had not shown much suscept up to that time but all the suscept she possess certainli came out then and she passion love him there is no doubt that she perfectli idol him he practis on her affect in that systemat wai that he got great sum of monei from her and he induc her to bui her brother out of a share in the breweri which had been weakli left him by hi father at an immens price on the plea that when he wa her husband he must hold and manag it all your guardian wa not at that time in miss havisham s counsel and she wa

she charg him in the presenc of her intend husband with be disappoint in the hope of fawn upon her for hi own advanc and if he were to go to her now it would look trueeven to himand even to her to

it most heartlessli broke the marriag off i can t tell you becaus i don t know when she recov from a bad ill that she had she laid the whole place wast as you have seen it and she ha never sinc look upon the light of dai is that all the stori i ask after consid it all i know of it and inde i onli know so much through piec it out for myself for my father alwai avoid it and even when miss havisham invit me to go there told me no more of it than it wa absolut requisit i should understand but i have forgotten on thing it ha been suppos that the man to whom she gave her misplac confid act

degradationif there can be deeperand ruin ar thei aliv now i don t know you said just now that estella wa not relat to miss havisham but adopt when adopt herbert shrug hi shoulder there ha alwai been an estella sinc i have heard of a miss havisham i know no more and now handel said he final throw off the stori as it were there is a perfectli open understand between us all that i know about miss

for secur s sake abstract the note and give me nutshel but what is hi sleight of hand to mine when i fold up my own nutshel and pass them on myself as note have settl that i must go to the blue boar my mind wa much disturb by indecis whether or not to take the aveng it wa tempt to think of that expens mercenari publicli air hi boot in the archwai of the blue boar s postingyard it wa almost solemn to imagin him casual produc in the tailor s shop and confound the disrespect sens of trabb s boi on the other hand trabb s boi might worm himself into hi intimaci and tell him thing or reckless and desper wretch as i knew he could be might hoot him in the high street my patro too might hear of him and not approv on the whole i resolv to leav the aveng behind it wa the afternoon coach by which i had taken my place and as winter had now come round i should not arriv at my destin until two or three hour after dark our time of start from the cross kei wa two o clock i arriv on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare attend by the avengerif i mai connect that express with on who never attend on me if he could possibl help it at that time it wa customari to carri convict down to the dockyard by stagecoach as i had often heard of them in the capac of outsid passeng and had more than onc seen them on the high road dangl their iron leg over the coach roof i had no caus to be surpris when herbert meet me in the yard came up and told me there were two convict go down with me but i had a reason that wa an old reason now for constitution falter whenev i heard the word convict you don t mind them handel said herbert o no i thought you seem as if you didn t like them i can t pretend that i do like them and i suppos you don t particularli but i don t mind them see there thei ar said herbert come out of the tap what a degrad and vile sight it is thei had been treat their guard i suppos for thei had a gaoler with them and all three came out wipe their mouth on their hand the two convict were handcuf togeth and had iron on their legsiron of a pattern that i knew well thei wore the dress that i likewis knew well their keeper had a brace of pistol and carri a thickknob bludgeon under hi arm but he wa on term of good understand with them and stood with them besid him look on at the puttingto of the hors rather with an air as if the convict were an interest exhibit not formal open at the moment and he the curat on wa a taller and stouter man than the other and appear as a matter of cours accord to the mysteri wai of the world both convict and free to have had allot to him the smaller suit of cloth hi arm and leg were like great pincushion of those shape and hi attir disguis him absurdli but i knew hi halfclos ey at on glanc there stood the man whom i had seen on the settl at the three jolli bargemen on a saturdai night and who had brought me down with hi invis gun it wa easi to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in hi life he look across at me and hi ey apprais my watchchain and then he incident spat and said someth to the other convict and thei laugh and slu themselv round with a clink of their coupl manacl and look at someth els the great number on their back as if thei were street door their coars mangi ungainli outer surfac as if thei were lower anim their iron leg apologet garland with pockethandkerchief and the wai in which all present look at them and kept from them made them as herbert had said a most disagre and degrad spectacl but thi wa not the worst of it it came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a famili remov from london and that there were no place for the two prison but on the seat in front behind the coachman hereupon a choler gentleman who had taken the fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion and said that it wa a breach of contract to mix him up with such villain compani and that it wa poison and pernici and infam and shame and i don t know what els at thi time the coach wa readi and the coachman impati and we were all prepar to get up and the prison had come over with their keeperbring with them that curiou flavor of breadpoultic baiz ropeyarn and hearthston which attend the convict presenc don t take it so much amiss sir plead the keeper to the angri passeng i ll sit next you myself i ll put em on the outsid of the row thei won t interfer with you sir you needn t know thei re there and don t blame me growl the convict i had recogn i don t want to go i am quit readi to stai behind as fur as i am concern ani on s welcom to my place or mine said the other gruffli i wouldn t have incommod none of you if i d had my wai then thei both laugh and began crack nut and spit the shell abouta i realli think i should have like to do myself if i had been in their place and so despis at length it wa vote that there wa no help for the angri gentleman and that he must either go in hi chanc compani or remain behind so he got into hi place still make complaint and the keeper got into the place next him and the convict haul themselv up as well as thei could and the convict i had recogn sat behind me with hi breath on the hair of my head goodby handel herbert call out as we start i thought what a bless fortun it wa that he had found anoth name for me than pip it is imposs to express with what acut i felt the convict s breath not onli on the back of my head but all along my spine the sensat wa like be touch in the marrow with some pungent and search acid it set my veri teeth on edg he seem to have more breath busi to do than anoth man and to make more nois in do it and i wa consciou of grow highshould on on side in my shrink endeavor to fend him off the weather wa miser raw and the two curs the cold it made us all letharg befor we had gone far and when we had left the halfwai hous behind we habitu doze and shiver and were silent i doze off myself in consid the question whether i ought to restor a coupl of pound sterl to thi creatur befor lose sight of him and how it could best be done in the act of dip forward as if i were go to bath among the hors i woke in a fright and took the question up again but i must have lost it longer than i had thought sinc although i could recogn noth in the dark and the fit light and shadow of our lamp i trace marsh countri in the cold damp wind that blew at us cower forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind the convict were closer to me than befor the veri first word i heard them interchang as i becam consciou were the word of my own thought two on pound note how did he get em said the convict i had never seen how should i know return the other he had em stow awai somehow giv him by friend i expect i wish said the other with a bitter curs upon the cold that i had em here two on pound note or friend two on pound note i d sell all the friend i ever had for on and think it a bless good bargain well so he sai so he sai resum the convict i had recogn it wa all said and done in half a minut behind a pile of timber in the dockyard you re a go to be discharg ye i wa would i find out that boi that had fed him and kep hi secret and give him them

gone with him so that of all dai in the year on thi dai i might not have had newgat in my breath and on my cloth i beat the prison dust off my feet as i saunter to and fro and i shook it out of my

said god forbid and no more it wa imposs for me to avoid see that she care to attract me that she made herself win and would have won me even if the task had need pain yet thi made me none the happier for even if she had not taken that tone of our be dispos of by other i should have felt that she held my heart in her hand becaus she wilfulli chose to do it and not becaus it would have wrung ani tender in her to crush it and throw it awai when we pass through hammersmith i show her where mr matthew pocket live and said it wa no great wai from richmond and that i hope i should see her sometim

difficult to distinguish between thi edifi busi proceed and actual pai the monei in point of meritori charact the two thing seem about equal when we had written a littl while i would ask herbert how

put them down at seven hundr i had the highest opinion of the wisdom of thi same margin but i am bound to acknowledg that on look back i deem it to have been an expens devic for we alwai ran into new

upon the ground among the other bridal wreck and wa a miser sight to see it wa with a depress heart that i walk in the starlight for an hour and more about the courtyard and about the breweri and about the ruin garden when i at last took courag to return to the room i found estella sit at miss havisham s knee take up some stitch in on of those old articl of dress that were drop to piec and of which i have often been remind sinc by the fade tatter of old banner that i have seen hang up in cathedr afterward estella and i plai at card as of yoreonli we were skil now and plai french gamesand so the even wore awai and i went to bed i lai in that separ build across the courtyard it wa the first time i had ever lain down to rest in sati hous and sleep refus to come near me a thousand miss havisham haunt me she wa on thi side of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the halfopen door of the dressingroom in the dressingroom in the room overhead in the room beneatheverywher at last when the night wa slow to creep on toward two o clock i felt that i absolut could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i must get up i therefor got up and put on my cloth and went out across the yard into the long stone passag design to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind but i wa no sooner in the passag than i extinguish my candl for i saw miss havisham go along it in a ghostli manner make a low cry i follow her at a distanc and saw her go up the staircas she carri a bare candl in her hand which she had probabl taken from on of the sconc in her own room and wa a most unearthli object by it light stand at the bottom of the staircas i felt the mildew air of the feastchamb without see her open the door and i heard her walk there and so across into her own room and so across again into that never ceas the low cry after a time i tri in the dark both to get out and to go back but i could do neither until some streak of dai strai in and show me where to lai my hand dure the whole interv whenev i went to the bottom of the staircas i heard her footstep saw her light pass abov and heard her ceaseless low cry befor we left next dai there wa no reviv of the differ between her and estella nor wa it ever reviv on ani similar occas and there were four similar occas to the best of my remembr nor did miss havisham s manner toward estella in anywis chang except that i believ it to have someth like fear infus among it former characterist it is imposs to turn thi leaf of my life without put

thi i softli remov the kei to the outsid of hi door and turn it on him befor i again sat down by the fire gradual i slip from the chair and lai on the floor when i awok without have part in my sleep with the percept of my wretched the clock of the eastward church were strike five the candl were wast out the fire wa dead and the wind and rain intensifi the thick black dark thi is the end of the

and though he had been at hi desk he could have done noth for me i went straight back to the templ where i found the terribl provi drink rum and water and smoke negrohead in safeti next dai the cloth i had order all came home and he put them on whatev he put on becam him less it dismal seem to me than what he had worn befor to my think there wa someth in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguis him the more i dress him and the better i dress him the more he look like the slouch fugit on the marsh thi effect on my anxiou fanci wa partli refer no doubt to hi old face and manner grow more familiar to me but i believ too that he drag on of hi leg as if there were still a weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there wa convict in the veri grain of the man the influenc of hi solitari hutlif were upon him besid and gave him a savag air that no dress could tame ad to these were the influenc of hi subsequ brand life among men and crown all hi conscious that he wa dodg and

to wear that touch of powder and i had conced the powder after overcom the short but i can compar the effect of it when on to noth but the probabl effect of roug upon the dead so aw wa the manner in which everyth in him that it wa most desir to repress start through that thin layer of pretenc and seem to come blaze out at the crown of hi head it wa abandon as soon as tri and he wore hi grizzl hair cut short word cannot tell what a sens i had at the same time of the dread mysteri that he wa to me when he fell asleep of an even with hi knot hand clench the side of the easychair and hi bald head tattoo with deep wrinkl fall forward on hi breast i would sit and look at him wonder what he had done and load him with all the crime in the calendar until the impuls wa power on me to start up and fly from him everi hour so increas my abhorr of him that i even think i might have yield to thi impuls in the first agoni of be so haunt notwithstand all he had done for me and the risk he ran but for the knowledg that herbert must soon come back onc i actual did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress myself in my worst cloth hurriedli intend to leav him there with everyth els i possess and enlist for india as a privat soldier i doubt if a ghost could have been more terribl to me up in those lone room in the long even and long night with the wind and the rain alwai rush by a

muzzl i ever will be herbert said certainli but look as if there were no specif consol in thi and remain perplex and dismai we were anxiou for the time when he would go to hi lodg and leav us togeth but he wa evid jealou of leav us togeth and sat late it wa midnight befor i took him round to essex street and saw him safe in at hi own dark door when it close upon him i experienc the first moment of relief i had known sinc the night of hi arriv never quit free from an uneasi remembr of the man on the stair i had alwai look about me in take my guest out after dark and in bring him back and i look about me now difficult as it is in a larg citi to avoid the suspicion of be watch when the mind is consciou of danger in that regard i could not persuad myself that ani of the peopl within sight care about my movement the few who were pass pass on their sever wai and the street wa empti when i turn back into the templ nobodi had come out at the gate with us nobodi went in at the gate with me as i cross by the fountain i saw hi light back window look bright and quiet and when i stood for a few moment in the doorwai of the build where i live befor go up the stair garden court wa as still and lifeless as the staircas wa when i ascend it herbert receiv me with open arm and i had never felt befor so blessedli what it is to have a friend when he had spoken some sound word of sympathi and encourag we sat down to consid the question what wa to be done the chair that provi had occupi still remain where it had stoodfor he had a barrack wai with him of hang about on spot in on unsettl manner and go through on round of observ with hi pipe and hi negrohead and hi jackknif and hi pack of card and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slatei sai hi chair remain where it had stood herbert unconsci took it but next moment start out of it push it awai and took anoth he had no occas to sai after that that he had conceiv an avers for my patron neither had i occas to confess my own we interchang that confid without shape a syllabl what said i to herbert when he wa safe in anoth chair what is to be done my poor dear handel he repli hold hi head i am too stun to think so wa i herbert when the blow first fell still someth must be done he is intent upon variou new expenseshors and carriag and lavish appear of all kind he must be stop somehow you mean that you can t accept how can i i interpos as herbert paus think of him look at him an involuntari shudder pass over both of us yet i am afraid the dread truth is herbert that he is attach to me strongli attach to me wa there ever such a fate my poor dear handel herbert repeat then said i after all stop short here never take anoth penni from him think what i ow him alreadi then again i am heavili in debtveri heavili for me who have now no expectationsand i have been bred to no call and i am fit for noth well well well herbert remonstr don t sai fit for noth what am i fit for i know onli on thing that i am fit for and that is to go for a soldier and i might have gone my dear herbert but for the prospect of take counsel with your friendship and affect of cours i broke down there and of cours herbert beyond seiz a warm grip of my hand pretend not to know it anyhow my dear handel said he present soldier won t do if you were to renounc thi patronag and these favor i suppos you would do so with some faint hope of on dai repai what you have alreadi had not veri strong that hope if you went soldier besid it s absurd you would be infinit better in clarrik s hous small as it is i am work up toward a partnership you know poor fellow he littl suspect with whose monei but there is anoth question said herbert thi is an ignor determin man who ha long had on fix idea more than that he seem to me i mai misjudg him to be a man of a desper and fierc charact i know he is i return let me tell you what evid i have seen of it and i told him what i had not mention in my narr of that encount with the other convict see then said herbert think of thi he come here at the peril of hi life for the realiz of hi fix idea in the moment of realiz after all hi toil and wait you cut the ground from under hi feet destroi hi idea and make hi gain worthless to him do you see noth that he might do under the disappoint i have seen it herbert and dream of it ever sinc the fatal night of hi arriv noth ha been in my thought so distinctli as hi put himself in the wai of be taken then you mai reli upon it said herbert that there would be great danger of hi do it that is hi power over you as long as he remain in england and that would be hi reckless cours if you forsook him i wa so struck by the horror of thi idea which had weigh upon me from the first and the work out of which would make me regard myself in some sort as hi murder that i could not rest in my chair but began pace to and fro i said to herbert meanwhil that even if provi were recogn and taken in spite of himself i should be wretch as the caus howev innoc ye even though i wa so wretch in have him at larg and near me and even though i would far rather have work at the forg all the dai of my life than i would ever have come to thi but there wa no stave off the question what wa to be done the first and the main thing to be done said herbert is to get him out of england you will have to go with him and then he mai be induc to go but get him where i will could i prevent hi come back my good handel is it not obviou that with newgat in the next street there must be far greater hazard in your break your mind to him and make him reckless here than elsewher if a pretext to get him awai could be made out of that other convict or out of anyth els in hi life now there again said i stop befor herbert with my open hand held out as if thei contain the desper of the case i know noth of hi life it ha almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him befor me so bound up with my fortun and misfortun and yet so unknown to me except as the miser wretch who terrifi me two dai in my childhood herbert got up and link hi arm in mine and we slowli walk to and fro togeth studi the carpet handel said herbert stop you feel convinc that you can take no further benefit from him do you fulli sure you would too if you were in my place and you feel convinc that you must break with him herbert can you ask me and you have and ar bound to have that tender for the life he ha risk on your account that you must save him if possibl from throw it awai then you must get him out of england befor you stir a finger to extric yourself that done extric yourself in heaven s name and we ll see it out togeth dear old boi it wa a comfort to shake hand upon it and walk up and down again with onli that done now herbert said i with refer to gain some knowledg of hi histori there is but on wai that i know of i must ask him point blank ye ask him said herbert when we sit at breakfast in the morn for he had said on take leav of herbert that he would

mai be sure with a fierc look i never heerd no more of him herbert had been write with hi pencil in the cover of a book he softli push the book over to me as provi stood smoke with hi ey on the fire and i read in it young havisham s name wa arthur compeyson is the man who profess to be miss havisham s lover i shut the book and nod slightli to herbert and put the book by but we neither of us said anyth and both look at provi as he stood smoke by the fire chapter xliii why should i paus to ask how much of my shrink from provi might be trace to estella why should i loiter on my road to compar the state of mind in which i had tri to rid myself of the stain of the prison befor meet her at the coachoffic with the state of mind in which i now reflect on the abyss between estella in her pride and beauti and the return transport whom i harbor the road would be none the smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not be help nor i extenu a new fear had been engend in my mind by hi narr or rather hi narr had given form and purpos to the fear that wa alreadi there if compeyson were aliv and should discov hi return i could hardli doubt the consequ that compeyson stood in mortal fear of him neither of the two could know much better than i and that ani such man as that man had been describ to be would hesit to releas himself for good from a dread enemi by the safe mean of becom an inform wa scarc to be imagin never had i breath and never would i breatheor so i resolveda word of estella to provi but i said to herbert that befor i could go abroad i must see both estella and miss havisham thi wa when we were left alon on the night of the dai when provi told us hi stori i resolv to go out to richmond next dai and i went on my present myself at mr brandlei s estella s maid wa call to tell that estella had gone into the countri where to sati hous as usual not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there without me when wa she come back there wa an air of reserv in the answer which increas my perplex and the answer wa that her maid believ she wa onli come back at all for a littl while i could make noth of thi except that it wa meant that i should make noth of it and i went home again in complet discomfitur anoth night consult with herbert after provi wa gone home i alwai took him home and alwai look well about me led us to the conclus that noth should be said about go abroad until i came back from miss havisham s in the mean time herbert and i were to consid separ what it would be best to sai whether we should devis ani pretenc of be afraid that he wa under suspici observ or whether i who had never yet been abroad should propos an expedit we both knew that i had but to propos anyth and he would consent we agre that hi remain mani dai in hi present hazard wa not to be thought of next dai i had the mean to feign that i wa under a bind promis to go down to joe but i wa capabl of almost ani mean toward joe or hi name provi wa to be strictli care while i wa gone and herbert wa to take the charg of him that i had taken i wa to be absent onli on night and on my return the gratif of hi impati for my start as a gentleman on a greater scale wa to be begun it occur to me then and as i afterward found to herbert also that he might be best got awai across the water on that pretencea to make purchas or the like have thu clear the wai for my expedit to miss havisham s i set off by the earli morn coach befor it wa yet light and wa out on the open countri road when the dai came creep on halt and whimper and shiver and wrap in patch of cloud and rag of mist like a beggar when we drove up to the blue boar after a drizzli ride whom should i see come out under the gatewai toothpick in hand to look at the coach but bentlei drumml as he pretend not to see me i pretend not to see him it wa a veri lame pretenc on both side the lamer becaus we both went into the coffeeroom where he had just finish hi breakfast and where i

wa fit on hi bed for the conveni of sweep the river in hi two cabin room at the top of the hous which were fresh and airi and in which mr barlei wa less audibl than below i found provi comfort settl he express no alarm and seem to feel none that wa worth mention but it struck me that he wa softenedindefin for i could not have said how and could never afterward recal how when i tri but certainli the opportun that the dai s rest had given me for reflect had result in my fulli determin to sai noth to him respect compeyson for anyth i knew hi animos toward the man might otherwis lead to hi seek him out and rush on hi own destruct therefor when herbert and i sat down with him by hi fire i ask him first of all whether he reli on wemmick s judgment and sourc of inform ay ay dear boi he answer with a grave nod jagger know then i have talk with wemmick said i and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advic thi i did accur with the reserv just mention and i told him how wemmick had heard in newgat prison whether from offic or prison i could not sai that he wa under some suspicion and that my chamber had been watch how wemmick had recommend hi keep close for a time and my keep awai from him and what wemmick had said about get him abroad i ad that of cours when the time came i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might be safest in wemmick s judgment what wa to follow that i did not touch upon neither inde wa i at all clear or comfort about it in my own mind now that i saw him in that softer condit and in declar peril for my sake as to alter my wai of live by enlarg my expens i put it to him whether in our present unsettl and difficult circumst it would not be simpli ridicul if it were no wors he could not deni thi and inde wa veri reason throughout hi come back wa a ventur he said and he had alwai known it to be a ventur he would do noth to make it a desper ventur and he had veri littl fear of hi safeti with such good help herbert who had been look at the fire and ponder here said that someth had come into hi thought aris out of wemmick s suggest which it might be worth while to pursu we ar both good watermen handel and could take him down the river ourselv when the right time come no boat would then be hire for the purpos and no boatmen that would save at least a chanc of suspicion and ani chanc is worth save never mind the season don t you think it might be a good thing if you began at onc to keep a boat at the templ stair and were in the habit of row up and down the river you fall into that habit and then who notic or mind do it twenti or fifti time and there is noth special in your do it the twentyfirst or fiftyfirst i like thi scheme and provi wa quit elat by it we agre that it should be carri into execut and that provi should never recogn us if we came below bridg and row past mill pond bank but we further agre that he should pull down the blind in that part of hi window which gave upon the east whenev he saw us and all wa right our confer be now end and everyth arrang i rose to go remark to herbert that he and i had better not go home togeth and that i would take half an hour s start of him i don t like to leav you here i said to provi though i cannot doubt your be safer here than near me goodby dear boi he answer clasp my hand i don t know when we mai meet again and i don t like goodby sai good night good night herbert will go regularli between us and when the time come you mai be certain i shall be readi good night good night we thought it best that he should stai in hi own room and we left him on the land outsid hi door hold a light over the stairrail to light us downstair look back at him i thought of the first night of hi return when our posit were revers and when i littl suppos my heart could ever be as heavi and anxiou at part from him as it wa now old barlei wa growl and swear when we repass hi door with no appear of have ceas or of mean to ceas when we got to the foot of the stair i ask herbert whether he had preserv the name of provi he repli certainli not and that the lodger wa mr campbel he also explain that the utmost known of mr campbel there wa that he herbert had mr campbel consign to him and felt a strong person interest in hi be well care for and live a seclud life so when we went into the parlor where mr whimpl and clara were seat at work i said noth of my own interest in mr campbel but kept it to myself when i had taken leav of the pretti gentl darkei girl and of the motherli woman who had not outliv her honest sympathi with a littl affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper ropewalk had grown quit a differ place old barlei might be as old as the hill and might swear like a whole field of trooper but there were redeem youth and trust and hope enough in chink s basin to fill it to overflow and then i thought of estella and of our part and went home veri sadli all thing were as quiet in the templ as ever i had seen them the window of the room on that side late occupi by provi were dark and still and there wa no lounger in garden court i walk past the fountain twice or thrice befor i descend the step that were between me and my room but i wa quit alon herbert come to my bedsid when he came infor i went straight to bed dispirit and fatiguedmad the same report open on of the window after that he look out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement wa as solemnli empti as the pavement of ani cathedr at that same hour next dai i set myself to get the boat it wa soon done and the boat wa brought round to the templ stair and lai where i could reach her within a minut or two then i began to go out as for train and practic sometim alon sometim with herbert i wa often out in cold rain and sleet but nobodi took much note of me after i had been out a few time at first i kept abov blackfriar bridg but as the hour of the tide chang i took toward london bridg it wa old london bridg in those dai and at certain state of the tide there wa a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reput but i knew well enough how to shoot the bridg after see it done and so began to row about among the ship in the pool and down to erith the first time i pass mill pond bank herbert and i were pull a pair of oar and both in go and return we saw the blind toward the east come down herbert wa rare there less frequent than three time in a week and he never brought me a singl word of intellig that wa at all alarm still i knew that there wa caus for alarm and i could not get rid of the notion of be watch onc receiv it is a haunt idea how mani undesign person i suspect of watch me it would be hard to calcul in short i wa alwai full of fear for the rash man who wa in hide herbert had sometim said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at on of our window after dark when the tide wa run down and to think that it wa flow with everyth it bore toward clara but i thought with dread that it wa flow toward magwitch and that ani black mark on it surfac might be hi pursuer go swiftli silent and sure to take him chapter xlvii some week pass without bring ani chang we wait for wemmick and he made no sign if i had never known him out of littl britain and had never enjoi the privileg of be on a familiar foot at the castl i might have doubt him not so for a moment know him as i did my worldli affair began to wear a gloomi appear and i wa press for monei by more than on creditor even i myself began to know the want of monei i mean of readi monei in my own pocket and to reliev it by convert some easili spare articl of jeweleri into cash but i had quit determin that it would be a heartless fraud to take more monei from my patron in the exist state of my uncertain thought and plan therefor i had sent him the unopen pocketbook by herbert to hold in hi own keep and i felt a kind of satisfactionwheth it wa a fals kind or a true i hardli knowin not have profit by hi generos sinc hi revel of himself as the time wore on an impress settl heavili upon me that estella wa marri fear of have it confirm though it wa all but a convict i avoid the newspap and beg herbert to whom i had confid the circumst of our last interview never to speak of her to me why i hoard up thi last wretch littl rag of the robe of hope that wa rent and given to the wind how do i know why did you who read thi commit that not dissimilar inconsist of your own last year last month last week it wa an unhappi life that i live and it on domin anxieti tower over all it other anxieti like a high mountain abov a rang of mountain

you rememb that there wa a chase after two convict and that we join in it and that gargeri took you on hi back and that i took the lead and you kept up with me as well as you could i rememb it all veri well better than he thoughtexcept the last claus and you rememb that we came up with the two in a ditch and that there wa a scuffl between them and that on of them had been sever handl and much maul about the face by the other i see it all befor me and that the soldier light torch and put the two in the centr and that we went on to see the last of them over the black marsh with the

disquiet into which thi convers threw me or the special and peculiar terror i felt at compeyson s have been behind me like a ghost for if he had ever been out of my thought for a few moment togeth sinc the hide had begun it wa in those veri moment when he wa closest to me and to think that i should be so unconsci and off my guard after all my care wa as if i had shut an avenu of a hundr door to keep him out and then had found him at my elbow i could not doubt either that he wa there becaus i wa there and that howev slight an appear of danger there might be about us danger wa alwai near and activ i put such question to mr wopsl as when did the man come in he could not tell me that he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man it wa not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identifi him but he had from the first vagu associ him with me and known him as somehow belong to me in the old villag time how wa he dress prosper but not notic otherwis he thought in black wa hi face at all disfigur no he believ not i believ not too for although in my brood state i had taken no especi notic of the peopl behind me i thought it like that a face at all disfigur would have attract my attent when mr wopsl had impart to me all that he could recal or i extract and when i had treat him to a littl appropri refresh after the fatigu of the even we part it wa between twelv and on o clock when i reach the templ and the gate were shut no on wa near me when i went in and went home herbert had come in and we held a veri seriou council by the fire but there wa noth to be done

begin of eitherand we went along cheapsid and slant off to littl britain while the light were spring up brilliantli in the shop window and the street lamplight scarc find ground enough to plant their ladder on in the midst of the afternoon s bustl were skip up and down and run in and out open more red ey in the gather fog than my rushlight tower at the hummum had open white ey in the ghostli wall at the offic in littl britain there wa the usual letterwrit handwash candlesnuf and safelock that close the busi of the dai as i stood idl by mr jagger s fire it rise and fall flame made the two cast on the shelf look as if thei were plai a diabol game at bopeep with me while the pair of coars fat offic candl that dimli light mr jagger as he wrote in a corner were decor with dirti windingsheet as if in remembr of a host of hang client we went to gerrard street all three togeth in a hackneycoach and as soon as we got there dinner wa serv although i should not have thought of make in that place the most distant refer by so much as a look to wemmick s walworth sentiment yet i should have had no object to catch hi ey now and then in a friendli wai but it wa not to be done he turn hi ey on mr jagger whenev he rais them from the tabl and wa as dry and distant to me as if there were twin wemmick and thi wa the wrong on did you send that note of miss havisham s to mr pip wemmick mr jagger ask soon after we began dinner no sir return wemmick it wa go by post when you brought mr pip into the offic here it is he hand it to hi princip instead of to me it s a note of two line pip said mr jagger hand it on sent up to me by miss havisham on account of her not be sure of your address she tell me that she want to see you on a littl matter of busi you mention to her you ll go down ye said i cast my ey over the note which wa exactli in those term when do you think of go down i have an impend engag said i glanc at wemmick who wa put fish into the postoffic that render me rather uncertain of my time at onc i think if mr pip ha the intent of go at onc said wemmick to mr jagger he needn t write an answer you know receiv thi as an intim that it wa best not to delai i settl that i would go tomorrow and said so wemmick drank a glass of wine and look with a grimli satisfi air at mr jagger but not at me so pip our friend the spider said mr jagger ha plai hi card he ha won the pool it wa as much as i could do to assent hah he is a promis fellowin hi waybut he mai not have it all hi own wai the stronger will win in the end but the stronger ha to be found out first if he should turn to and beat her sure i interrupt with a burn face and heart you do not serious think that he is scoundrel enough for that mr jagger i didn t sai so pip i am put a case if he should turn to and beat her he mai possibl get the strength on hi side if it should be a question of intellect he certainli will not it would be chanc work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumst becaus it s a tossup between two result mai i ask what thei ar a fellow like our friend the spider answer mr jagger either beat or cring he mai cring and growl or cring and not growl but he either beat or cring ask wemmick hi opinion either beat or cring said wemmick not at all address himself to me so here s to mr bentlei drumml said mr jagger take a decant of choicer wine from hi dumbwait and fill for each of us and for himself and mai the question of supremaci be settl to the ladi s satisfact to the satisfact of the ladi and the gentleman it never will be now molli molli molli molli how slow you ar todai she wa at hi elbow when he address her put a dish upon the tabl as she withdrew her hand from it she fell back a step or two nervous mutter some excus and a certain action of her finger as she spoke arrest my attent what s the matter said mr jagger noth onli the subject we were speak of said i wa rather pain to me the action of her finger wa like the action of knit she stood look at her master not understand whether she wa free to go or whether he had more to sai to her and would call her back if she did go her look wa veri intent sure i had seen exactli such ey and such hand on a memor occas veri late he dismiss her and she glide out of the room but she remain befor me as plainli as if she were still there i look at those hand i look at those ey i look at that flow hair and i compar them with other hand other ey other hair that i knew of and with what those might be after twenti year of a brutal husband and a stormi life i look again at those hand and ey of the housekeep and thought of the inexplic feel that had come over me when i last walkednot alonein the ruin garden and through the desert breweri i thought how the same feel had come back when i saw a face look at me and a hand wave to me from a stagecoach window and how it had come back again and had flash about me like lightn when i had pass in a carriagenot alonethrough a sudden glare of light in a dark street i thought how on link of associ had help that identif in the theatr and how such a link want befor had been rivet for me now when i had pass by a chanc swift from estella s name to the finger with their knit action and the attent ey and i felt absolut certain that thi woman wa estella s mother mr jagger had seen me with estella and wa not like to have miss the sentiment i had been at no pain to conceal he nod when i said the subject wa pain to me clap me on the back put round the wine again and went on with hi dinner onli twice more did the housekeep reappear and then her stai in the room wa veri short and mr jagger wa sharp with her but her hand were estella s hand and her ey were estella s ey and if she had reappear a hundr time i could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my convict wa the truth it wa a dull even for wemmick drew hi wine when it came round quit as a matter of businessjust as he might have drawn hi salari when that came roundand with hi ey on hi chief sat in a state of perpetu readi for crossexamin as to the quantiti of wine hi postoffic wa as indiffer and readi as ani other postoffic for it quantiti of letter from my point of view he wa the wrong twin all the time and onli extern like the wemmick of walworth we took our leav earli and left togeth even when we were grope among mr jagger s stock of boot for our hat i felt that the right twin wa on hi wai back and we had not gone half a dozen yard down gerrard street in the walworth direct befor i found that i wa walk arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had evapor into the even air well said wemmick that s over he s a wonder man without hi live like but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine with himand i dine more comfort unscrew i felt that thi wa a good statement of the case and told him so wouldn t sai it to anybodi but yourself he answer i know that what is said between you and me goe no further i ask him if he had ever seen miss havisham s adopt daughter mr bentlei drumml he said no to avoid be too abrupt i then spoke of the ag and of miss skiffin he look rather sly when i mention miss skiffin and stop in the street to blow hi nose with a roll of the head and a flourish not quit free from latent boast wemmick said i do you rememb tell me befor i first went to mr jagger s privat hous to notic that housekeep did i he repli ah i dare sai i did deuc take me he ad suddenli i know i did i find i am not quit unscrew yet a wild beast tame you call her and what do you call her the same how did mr jagger tame her wemmick that s hi secret she ha been with him mani a long year i wish you would tell me her stori i feel a particular interest in be acquaint with it you know that what is said between you and me goe no further well wemmick repli i don t know her storythat is i don t know all of it but what i do know i ll tell you we ar in our privat and person capac of cours of cours a score or so of year ago that woman wa tri at the old bailei for murder and wa acquit she wa a veri handsom young woman and i believ had some gypsi blood in her anyhow it wa hot enough when it wa up as you mai suppos but she wa acquit mr jagger wa for her pursu wemmick with a look full of mean and work the case in a wai quit astonish it wa a desper case and it wa compar earli dai with him then and he work it to gener admir in fact it mai almost be said to have made him he work it himself at the policeoffic dai after dai for mani dai contend against even a committ and at the trial where he couldn t work it himself sat under counsel andeveri on knewput in all the salt and pepper the murder person wa a womana woman a good ten year older veri much larger and veri much stronger it wa a case of jealousi thei both led tramp live and thi woman in gerrard street here had been marri veri young over the broomstick as we sai to a tramp man and wa a perfect furi in point of jealousi the murder womanmor a match for the man certainli in point of yearswa found dead in a barn near hounslow heath there had been a violent struggl perhap a fight she wa bruis and scratch and torn and had been held by the throat at last and choke now there wa no reason evid to implic ani person but thi woman and on the improb of her have been abl to do it mr jagger princip rest hi case you mai be sure said wemmick touch me on the sleev that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hand then though he sometim doe now i had told wemmick of hi show us her wrist that dai of the dinner parti well sir wemmick went on it happenedhappen don t you seethat thi woman wa so veri artfulli dress from the time of her apprehens that she look much slighter than she realli wa in particular her sleev ar alwai rememb to have been so skilfulli contriv that her arm had quit a delic look she had onli a bruis or two about hernoth for a trampbut the back of her hand were lacer and the question wa wa it with fingernail now mr jagger show that she had struggl through a great lot of brambl which were not as high as her face but which she could not have got through and kept her hand out of and bit of those brambl were actual found in her skin and put in evid as well as the fact that the brambl in question were found on examin to have been broken through and to have littl shred of her dress and littl spot of blood upon them here and there but the boldest point he made wa thi it wa attempt to be set up in proof of her jealousi that she wa under strong suspicion of have at about the time of the murder frantic destroi her child by thi mansom three year oldto reveng herself upon him mr jagger work that in thi wai we sai these ar not mark of fingernail but mark of brambl and we show you the brambl you sai thei ar mark of fingernail and you set up the hypothesi that she destroi her child you must accept all consequ of that hypothesi for anyth we know she mai have destroi her child and the child in cling to her mai have scratch her hand what then you ar not try her for the murder of her child why don t you as to thi case if you will have scratch we sai that for anyth we know you mai have account for them assum for the sake of argument that you have not invent them to sum up sir said wemmick mr jagger wa altogeth too mani for the juri and thei gave in ha she been in hi servic ever sinc ye but not onli that said wemmick she went into hi servic immedi after her acquitt tame as she is now she ha sinc been taught on thing and anoth in the wai of her duti but she wa tame from the begin do you rememb the sex of the child said to have been a girl you have noth more to sai to me tonight noth i got your letter and destroi it noth we exchang a cordial goodnight and i went home with new matter for my thought though with no relief from the old chapter xlix put miss havisham s note in my pocket that it might serv as my credenti for so soon reappear at sati hous in case her wayward should lead her to express ani surpris at see me i went down again by the coach next dai but i alight at the halfwai hous and breakfast there and walk the rest of the distanc for i sought to get into the town quietli by the unfrequ wai and to leav it in the same manner the best light of the dai wa gone when i pass along the quiet echo court behind the high street the nook of ruin where the old monk had onc had their refectori and garden and where the strong wall were now press into the servic of humbl shed and stabl were almost as silent as the old monk in their grave the cathedr chime had at onc a sadder and a more remot sound to me as i hurri on avoid observ than thei had ever had befor so the swell of the old organ wa born to my ear like funer music and the rook as thei hover about the grai tower and swung in the bare high tree of the priori garden seem to call to me that the place wa chang and that estella wa gone out of it for ever an elderli woman whom i had seen befor as on of the servant who live in the supplementari hous across the back courtyard open the gate the light candl stood in the dark passag within as of old and i took it up and ascend the staircas alon miss havisham wa not in her own room but wa in the larger room across the land look in at the door after knock in vain i saw her sit on the hearth in a rag chair close befor and lost in the contempl of the ashi fire do as i had often done i went in

voic is it real it is i pip mr jagger gave me your note yesterdai and i have lost no time thank you thank you as i brought anoth of the rag chair to the hearth and sat down i remark a new express on her face as if she were afraid of me i want she said to pursu that subject you mention to me when you were last here and to show you that i am not all stone but perhap you can never believ now that there is anyth human in my heart when i said some reassur word she stretch out her tremul right hand as though she wa go to touch me but she recal it again befor i understood the action or knew how to receiv it you said speak for your friend that you could tell me how to do someth us and good someth that you would like done is it not someth that i would like done veri much what is it i began

often have been rais to heaven from her mother s side to see her with her white hair and her worn face kneel at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame i entreat her to rise and got my arm about her to help her up but she onli press that hand of mine which wa nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept i had never seen her shed a tear befor and in the hope that the relief might do her good i bent over her without speak she wa not kneel now but wa down upon the ground o she cri despairingli what have i done what have i done if you mean miss havisham what have you done to injur

wrung her hand and crush her white hair and return to thi cry over and over again what have i done i knew not how to answer or how to comfort her that she had done a grievou thing in take an impression child to mould into the form that her wild resent spurn affect and wound pride found vengeanc in i knew full well but that in shut out the light of dai she had shut out infinit more that in seclus she had seclud herself from a thousand natur and heal influenc that her mind brood solitari had grown diseas as all mind do and must and will that revers the appoint order of their maker i knew equal well and could i look upon her without compass see her punish in the ruin she wa in her profound unfit for thi earth on which she wa place in the vaniti of sorrow which had becom a master mania

havisham had told me all she knew of estella i had said and done what i could to eas her mind no matter with what other word we part we part twilight wa close in when i went downstair into the natur air i call to the woman who had open the gate when i enter that i would not troubl her just yet but would walk round the place befor leav for i had a presenti that i should never be there again and i felt that the dy light wa suit to my last view of it by the wilder of cask that i had walk on long ago and on which the rain of year had fallen sinc rot them in mani place and leav miniatur swamp and pool of water upon those that stood on end i made my wai to the ruin garden i went all round it round by the corner where herbert and i had fought our battl round by the path where estella and i had walk so cold so lone so dreari all take the breweri on my wai back i rais the rusti latch of a littl door at the garden end of it and walk through i wa go out at the opposit doornot easi to open now for the damp wood had start and swell and the hing were yield and the threshold wa encumb with a growth of funguswhen i turn my head to look back a childish associ reviv with wonder forc in the moment of the slight action and i fanci that i saw miss havisham hang to the beam so strong wa the impress that i stood under the beam shudder from head to foot befor i knew it wa a fancythough to be sure i wa there in an instant the mourn of the place and time and the great terror of thi illus though it wa but momentari caus me to feel an indescrib aw as i came out between the open wooden gate where i had onc wrung my hair after estella had wrung my heart pass on into the front courtyard i hesit whether to call the woman to let me out at the lock gate of which she had the kei or first to go upstair and assur myself that miss havisham wa as safe and well as i had left her i took the latter cours and went up i look into the room where i had left her and i saw her seat in the rag chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back toward me in the moment when i wa withdraw my head to go quietli awai i saw a great flame light spring up in the same moment i saw her run at me shriek with a whirl of fire blaze all about her and soar at least as mani feet abov her head as she wa high i had a doublecap greatcoat on and over my arm anoth thick coat that i got them off close with her threw her down and got them over her that i drag the great cloth from the tabl for the same purpos and with it drag down the heap of rotten in the midst and all the ugli thing that shelter there that we were on the ground struggl like desper enemi and that the closer i cover her the more wildli she shriek and tri to free herselfthat thi occur i knew through the result but not through anyth i felt or thought or knew i did i knew noth until i knew that we were on the floor by the great tabl and that patch of tinder yet alight were float in the smoki air which a moment ago had been her fade bridal dress then i look round and saw the disturb beetl and spider run awai over the floor and the servant come in with breathless cri at the door i still held her forcibl down with all my strength like a prison who might escap and i doubt if i even knew who she wa or why we had struggl or that she had been in flame or that the flame were out until i saw the patch of tinder that had been her garment no longer alight but fall in a black shower around us she wa insens and i wa afraid to have her move or even touch assist wa sent for and i held her until it came as if i unreason fanci i think i did that if i let her go the fire would break out again and consum her when i got up on the surgeon s come to her with other aid i wa astonish to see that both my hand were burnt for i had no knowledg of it through the sens of feel on examin it wa pronounc that she had receiv seriou hurt but that thei of themselv were far from hopeless the danger lai mainli in the nervou shock by the surgeon s direct her bed wa carri into that room and laid upon the great tabl which happen to be well suit to the dress of her injuri when i saw her again an hour afterward she lai inde where i had seen her strike her stick and had heard her sai that she would lie on dai though everi vestig of her dress wa burnt as thei told me she still had someth of her old ghastli bridal appear for thei had cover her to the throat with white cottonwool and as she lai with a white sheet loos overli that the phantom air of someth that had been and wa chang wa still upon her i found on question the servant that estella wa

toward midnight she began to wander in her speech and after that it gradual set in that she said innumer time in a low solemn voic what have i done and then when she first came i meant to save her from miseri like mine and then take the pencil and write under my name i forgiv her she never chang the order of these three sentenc but she sometim left out a word in on or other of them never put in anoth word but alwai leav a blank and go on to the next word as i could do no servic there and as i had nearer home that press reason for anxieti and fear which even her wander could not drive out of my mind i decid in the cours of the night that i would return by the earli morn coach walk on a mile or so and be taken up clear of the town at about six o clock of the morn therefor i lean over her

town yet i had to give him all the detail now and the special of the occas caus our talk to be less dry and hard and less strictli regul by the rule of evid than it had been befor while i describ the disast mr jagger stood accord to hi wont befor the fire wemmick lean back in hi chair stare at me with hi hand in the pocket of hi trouser and hi pen put horizont into the post the two brutal cast alwai insepar in my mind from the offici proceed seem to be congest consid whether thei didn t smell fire at the present moment my narr finish and their question exhaust i then produc miss havisham s

to give me some inform rel to her adopt daughter and she gave me all she possess did she said mr jagger bend forward to look at hi boot and then straighten himself hah i don t think i should have done so if i had been miss havisham but she ought to know her own busi best i know more of the histori of miss havisham s adopt child than miss havisham herself doe sir i know her mother mr jagger look at me inquiringli and repeat mother i have seen her mother within these three dai ye said mr jagger and so have you sir and you have seen her still more recent ye said mr jagger perhap i know more of estella s histori than even you do said i i know her father too a certain stop that mr jagger came to in hi mannerh wa too selfpossess to chang hi manner but he could not help it be brought to an indefin attent stopassur me that he did not know who her father wa thi i had strongli suspect from provi s account as herbert had repeat it of hi have kept himself dark which i piec on to the fact that he himself wa not mr jagger s client until some four year later and when he could have no reason for claim hi ident but i could not be sure of thi unconsci on mr jagger s part befor though i wa quit sure of it now so you know the young ladi s father pip said mr jagger ye i repli and hi name is provisfrom new south wale even mr jagger start when i said those word it wa the slightest start that could escap a man the most carefulli repress and the sooner check but he did start though he made it a part of the action of take out hi pockethandkerchief how wemmick receiv the announc i am unabl to sai for i wa afraid to look at him just then lest mr jagger s sharp should detect that there had been some commun unknown to him between us and on what evid pip ask mr jagger veri coolli as he paus with hi handkerchief half wai to hi nose doe provi make thi claim he doe not make it said i and ha never made it and ha no knowledg or belief that hi daughter is in exist for onc the power pockethandkerchief fail my repli wa so unexpect that mr jagger put the handkerchief back into hi pocket without complet the usual perform fold hi arm and look with stern attent at me though with an immov face then i told him all i knew and how i knew it with the on reserv that i left him to infer that i knew from miss havisham what i in fact knew from wemmick i wa veri care inde as to that nor did i look toward wemmick until i had finish all i had to tell and had been for some time silent meet mr jagger s look when i did at last turn my ey in wemmick s direct i found that he had unpost hi pen and wa intent upon the tabl befor him hah said mr jagger at last as he move toward the paper on the tabl what item wa it you were at wemmick when mr pip came in but i could not submit to be thrown off in that wai and i made a passion almost an indign appeal to him to be more frank and manli with me i remind him of the fals hope into which i had laps the length of time thei had last and the discoveri i had made and i hint at the danger that weigh upon my spirit i repres myself as be sure worthi of some littl confid from him in return for the confid i had just now impart i said that i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i want assur of the truth from him and if he ask me why i want it and why i thought i had ani right to it i would tell him littl as he care for such poor dream that i had love estella dearli and long and that although i had lost her and must live a bereav life whatev concern her wa still nearer and dearer to me than anyth els in the world and see that mr jagger stood quit still and silent and appar quit obdur under thi appeal i turn to wemmick and said wemmick i know you to be a man with a gentl heart i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the innoc cheer play wai with which you refresh your busi life and i entreat you to sai a word for me to mr jagger and to repres to him that all circumst consid he ought to be more open with me i have never seen two men look more oddli at on anoth than mr jagger and wemmick did after thi apostroph at first a misgiv cross me that wemmick would be instantli dismiss from hi employ but it melt as i saw mr jagger relax into someth like a smile and wemmick becom bolder what s all thi said mr jagger you with an old father and you with pleasant and play wai well return wemmick if i don t bring em here what doe it matter pip said mr jagger lai hi hand upon my arm and smile openli thi man must be the most cun impostor in all london not a bit of it return wemmick grow bolder and bolder i think you re anoth again thei exchang their former odd look each appar still distrust that the other wa take him in you with a pleasant home said mr jagger sinc it don t interfer with busi return wemmick let it be so now i look at you sir i shouldn t wonder if you might be plan and contriv to have a pleasant home of your own on of these dai when you re tire of all thi work mr jagger nod hi head retrospect two or three time and actual drew a sigh pip said he we won t talk about poor dream you know more about such thing than i have much fresher experi of that kind but now about thi other matter i ll put a case to you mind i admit noth he wait for me to declar that i quit understood that he expressli said that he admit noth now pip said mr jagger put thi case put the case that a woman under such circumst as you have mention held her child conceal and wa oblig to commun the fact to her legal advis on hi repres to her that he must know with an ey to the latitud of hi defenc how the fact stood about that child put the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentr rich ladi to adopt and bring up i follow you sir put the case that he live in an atmospher of evil and that all he saw of children wa their be gener in great number for certain destruct put the case that he often saw children solemnli tri at a crimin bar where thei were held up to be seen put the case that he habitu knew of their be imprison whip transport neglect cast out qualifi in all wai for the hangman and grow up to be hang put the case that pretti nigh all the children he saw in hi daili busi life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn to develop into the fish that were to come to hi netto be prosecut defend forsworn made orphan bedevil somehow i follow you sir put the case pip that here wa on pretti littl child out of the heap who could be save whom the father believ dead and dare make no stir about as to whom over the mother the legal advis had thi power i know what you did and how you did it you came so and so you did such and such thing to divert suspicion i have track you through it all and i tell it you all part with the child unless it should be necessari to produc it to clear you and then it shall be produc give the child into my hand and i will do my best to bring you off if you ar save your child is save too if you ar lost your child is still save put the case that thi wa done and that the woman wa clear i understand you perfectli but that i make no admiss that you make no admiss and wemmick repeat no admiss put the case pip that passion and the terror of death had a littl shaken the woman s intellect and that when she wa set at liberti she wa scare out of the wai of the world and went to him to be shelter put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the old wild violent natur whenev he saw an inkl of it break out by assert hi power over her in the old wai do you comprehend the imaginari case quit put the case that the child grew up and wa marri for monei that the mother wa still live that the father wa still live that the mother and father unknown to on anoth were dwell within so mani mile furlong yard if you like of on anoth that the secret wa still a secret except that you had got wind of it put that last case to yourself veri carefulli i do i ask wemmick to put it to himself veri carefulli and wemmick said i do for whose sake would you reveal the secret for the father s i think he would not be much the better for the mother for the mother s i think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she wa for the daughter s i think it would hardli serv her to establish her parentag for the inform of her husband and to drag her back to disgrac after an escap of twenti year pretti secur to last for life but add the case that you had love her pip and had made her the subject of those poor dream which have at on time or anoth been in the head of more men than you think like then i tell you that you had betterand would much sooner when you had thought well of itchop off that bandag left hand of your with your bandag right hand and then pass the chopper on to wemmick there to cut that off too i look at wemmick whose face wa veri grave he grave touch hi lip with hi forefing i did the same mr jagger did the same now wemmick said the latter then resum hi usual manner what item wa it you were at when mr pip came in stand by for a littl while thei were at work i observ that the odd look thei had cast at on anoth were repeat sever time with thi differ now that each of them seem suspici not to sai consciou of have shown himself in a weak and unprofession light to the other for thi reason i suppos thei were now inflex with on anoth mr jagger be highli dictatori and wemmick obstin justifi himself whenev there wa the smallest point in abey for a moment i had never seen them on such ill term for gener thei got on veri well inde togeth but thei were both happili reliev by the opportun appear of mike the client with the fur cap and the habit of wipe hi nose on hi sleev whom i had seen on the veri first dai of my appear within those wall thi individu who either in hi own person or in that of some member of hi famili seem to be alwai in troubl which in that place meant newgat call to announc that hi eldest daughter wa taken up on suspicion of shoplift as he impart thi melancholi circumst to wemmick mr jagger stand magisteri befor the fire and take no share in the proceed mike s ey happen to twinkl with a tear what ar you about demand wemmick with the utmost indign what do you come snivel here for i didn t go to do it mr wemmick you did said wemmick how dare you you re not in a fit state to come here if you can t come here without splutter like a

against it the direct that i took wa not that in which my old home lai nor that in which we had pursu the convict my back wa turn toward the distant hulk as i walk on and though i could see the old light awai on the spit of sand i saw them over my shoulder i knew the limekiln as well as i knew the old batteri but thei were mile apart so that if a light had been burn at each point that night there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright speck at first i had to shut some gate after me and now and then to stand still while the cattl that were ly in the bankedup pathwai aros and blunder down among the grass and reed but after a littl while i seem to have the whole flat to myself it wa anoth halfhour befor i drew near to the kiln the lime wa burn with

lighter the white vapor of the kiln wa pass from us as we went by and as i had thought a prayer befor i thought a thanksgiv now entreat herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescuewhich at first he had flatli refus to do but had insist on my remain quieti learnt that i had in my hurri drop the letter open in our chamber where he come home to bring with him startop whom he had met in the street

avoid now as thei went along herbert reflect that i might after all have been brought there on some genuin and servic errand tend to provi s safeti and bethink himself that in that case interrupt must be mischiev left hi guid and startop on the edg of the quarri and went on by himself and stole round the hous two or three time endeavour to ascertain whether all wa right within as he could hear noth

follow by the other two when i told herbert what had pass within the hous he wa for our immedi go befor a magistr in the town late at night as it wa and get out a warrant but i had alreadi consid that such a cours by detain us there or bind us to come back might be fatal to provi there wa no gainsai thi difficulti and we relinquish all thought of pursu orlick at that time for the present under the circumst we deem it prudent to make rather light of the matter to trabb s boi who i am convinc would have been much affect by disappoint if he had known that hi intervent save me from the limekiln not that trabb s boi wa of a malign natur but that he had too much spare vivac and that it wa in hi constitut to want varieti and excit at anybodi s expens when we part i present him with two guinea which seem to meet hi view and told him that i wa sorri ever to have had an ill opinion of him which made no impress on him at all wednesdai be so close upon us we determin to go back to london that night three in the postchais the rather as we should then be clear awai befor the night s adventur began to be talk of herbert got a larg bottl of stuff for my arm and by dint of have thi stuff drop over it all the night through i wa just abl to bear it pain on the journei it wa daylight when we reach the templ and i went at onc to bed and lai in bed all dai my terror as i lai there of fall ill and be unfit for tomorrow wa so beset that i wonder it did not disabl me of itself it would have done so pretti sure in conjunct with the mental wear and tear i had suffer but for the unnatur strain upon me that tomorrow wa so anxious look forward to charg with such consequ it result so impenetr hidden though so near no precaut could have been more obviou than our refrain from commun with him that dai yet thi again increas my restless i start at everi footstep and everi sound believ that he wa discov and taken and thi wa the messeng to tell me so i persuad myself that i knew he wa taken that there wa someth more upon my mind than a fear or a presenti that the fact had occur and i had a mysteri knowledg of it as the dai wore on and no ill new came as the dai close in and dark fell my overshadow dread of be disabl by ill befor tomorrow morn altogeth master me my burn arm throb and my burn head throb and i fanci i wa begin to wander i count up to high number to make sure of myself and repeat passag that i knew in prose and vers it happen sometim that in the mere escap of a fatigu mind i doze for some moment or forgot then i would sai to myself with a start now it ha come and i am turn deliri thei kept me veri quiet all dai and kept my arm constantli dress and gave me cool drink whenev i fell asleep i awok with the notion i had had in the sluicehous that a long time had elaps and the opportun to save him wa gone about midnight i got out of bed and went to herbert with the convict that i had been asleep for fourandtwenti hour and that wednesdai wa past it wa the last selfexhaust effort of my fret for after that i slept soundli wednesdai morn wa dawn when i look out of window the wink light upon the bridg were alreadi pale the come sun wa like a marsh of fire on the horizon the river still dark and mysteri wa span by bridg that were turn coldli grai with here and there at top a warm touch from the burn in the sky as i look along the cluster roof with churchtow and spire shoot into the unusu clear air the sun rose up and a veil seem to be drawn from the river and million of sparkl burst out upon it water from me too a veil seem to be drawn and i felt strong and well herbert lai asleep in hi bed and our old fellowstud lai asleep on the sofa i could not dress myself without help but i made up the fire which wa still burn and got some coffe readi for them in good time thei too start up strong and well and we admit the sharp morn air at the window and look at the tide that wa still flow toward us when it turn at nine o clock said herbert cheerfulli look out for us and stand readi you over there at mill pond bank chapter liv it wa on of those march dai when the sun shine hot and the wind blow cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade we had our peacoat with us and i took a bag of all my worldli possess i took no more than the few necessari that fill the bag where i might go what i might do or when i might return were question utterli unknown to me nor did i vex my mind with them for it wa wholli set on provi s safeti i onli wonder for the pass moment as i stop at the door and look back under what alter circumst i should next see those room if ever we loiter down to the templ stair and stood loiter there as if we were not quit decid to go upon the water at all of cours i had taken care that the boat should be readi and everyth in order after a littl show of indecis which there were none to see but the two or three amphibi creatur belong to our templ stair we went on board and cast off herbert in the bow i steer it wa then about highwaterhalfpast eight our plan wa thi the tide begin to run down at nine and be with us until three we intend still to creep on after it had turn and row against it until dark we should then be well in those long reach below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is broad and solitari where the watersid inhabit ar veri few and where lone publichous ar scatter here and there of which we could choos on for a restingplac there we meant to lie by all night the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would start from london at about nine on thursdai morn we should know at what time to expect them accord to where we were and would hail the first so that if by ani accid we were not taken abroad we should have anoth chanc we knew the distinguish mark of each vessel the relief of be at last engag in the execut of the purpos wa so great to me that i felt it difficult to realiz the condit in which i had been a few hour befor the crisp air the sunlight the movement on the river and the move river itselfth road that ran with us seem to sympath with us anim us and encourag us onfreshen me with new hope i felt mortifi to be of so littl us in the boat but there were few better oarsmen than my two friend and thei row with a steadi stroke that wa to last all dai at that time the steamtraff on the thame wa far below it present extent and watermen s boat were far more numer of barg sail collier and coastingtrad there were perhap as mani as now but of steamship great and small not a tith or a twentieth part so mani earli as it wa there were plenti of sculler go here and there that morn and plenti of barg drop down with the tide the navig of the river between bridg in an open boat wa a much easier and common matter in those dai than it is in these and we went ahead among mani skiff and wherri briskli old london bridg wa soon pass and old billingsg market with it oysterboat and dutchmen and the white tower and

felt cold upon the river but it wa a bright dai and the sunshin wa veri cheer the tide ran strong i took care to lose none of it and our steadi stroke carri us on thoroughli well by impercept degre as the tide ran out we lost more and more of the nearer wood and hill and drop lower and lower between the muddi bank but the tide wa yet with us when we were off gravesend as our charg wa wrap in hi cloak i purpos pass within a boat or two s length of the float custom hous and so out to catch the stream alongsid of two emigr ship and under the bow of a larg transport with troop on the forecastl look down at us and soon the tide began to slacken and the craft ly at anchor to swing and present thei had all swung round and the ship that were take advantag of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could stand carefulli off from low shallow and mudbank our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of have occasion let her drive with the tide for a minut or two that a quarter of an hour s rest prove full as much as thei want we got ashor among some slipperi stone while we at and drank what we had with us and look about it wa like my own marsh countri flat and monoton and with a dim horizon while the wind river turn and turn and the great float buoi upon it turn and turn and everyth els seem strand and still for now the last of the fleet of ship wa round the last low point we had head and the last green barg strawladen with a brown sail had follow and some ballastlight shape like a child s first rude imit of a boat lai low in the mud and a littl squat shoallighthous on open pile stood crippl in the mud on stilt and crutch and slimi stake stuck out of the mud and slimi stone stuck out of the mud and red landmark and tidemark stuck out of the mud and an old landingstag and an old roofless build slip into the mud and all about us wa stagnat and mud we push off again and made what wai we could it wa much harder work now but herbert and startop persev and row and row and row until the sun went down by that time the river had lift us a littl so that we could see abov the bank there wa the red sun on the low level of the shore in a purpl haze fast deepen into black and there wa the solitari flat marsh and far awai there were the rise ground between which and us there seem to be no life save here and there in the foreground a melancholi gull as the night wa fast fall and as the moon be past the full would not rise earli we held a littl council a short on for clearli our cours wa to lie by at the first lone tavern we could find so thei pli their oar onc more and i look out for anyth like a hous thu we held on speak littl for four or five dull mile it wa veri cold and a collier come by us with her galleyfir smoke and flare look like a comfort home the night wa as dark by thi time as it would be until morn and what light we had seem to come more from the river than the sky as the oar in their dip struck at a few reflect star at thi dismal time we were evid all possess by the idea that we were follow as the tide made it flap heavili at irregular interv against the shore and whenev such a sound came on or other of us wa sure to start and look in that direct here and there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a littl creek and we were all suspici of such place and ei them nervous sometim what wa that rippl on of us would sai in a low voic or anoth is that a boat yonder and afterward we would fall into a dead silenc and i would sit impati think with what an unusu amount of nois the oar work in the thowel at length we descri a light and a roof and present afterward ran alongsid a littl causewai made of stone that had been pick up hard by leav the rest in the boat i step ashor and found the light to be in a window of a publichous it wa a dirti place enough and i dare sai not unknown to smuggl adventur but there wa a good fire in the kitchen and there were egg and bacon to eat and variou liquor to drink also there were two doublebed room such as thei were the landlord said no other compani wa in the hous than the landlord hi wife and a grizzl male creatur the jack of the littl causewai who wa as slimi and smeari as if he had been lowwat mark too with thi assist i went down to the boat again and we all came ashor and brought out the oar and rudder and boathook and all els and haul her up for the night we made a veri good meal by the kitchen fire and then apport the bedroom herbert and startop were to occupi on i and our charg the other we found the air as carefulli exclud from both as if air were fatal to life and there were more dirti cloth and bandbox under the bed than i should have thought the famili possess but we consid ourselv well off notwithstand for a more solitari place we could not have found while we were comfort ourselv by the fire after our meal the jackwho wa sit in a corner and who had a bloat pair of shoe on which he had exhibit while we were eat our egg and bacon as interest relic that he had taken a few dai ago from the feet of a drown seaman wash ashoreask me if we had seen a fouroar gallei go up with the tide when i told him no he said she must have gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there thei must ha thought better on t for some reason or anoth said the jack and gone down a fouroar gallei did you sai said i a four said the jack and two sitter did thei come ashor here thei put in with a stone twogallon jar for some beer i d ha been glad to pison the beer myself said the jack or put some rattl physic in it why i know why said the jack he spoke in a slushi voic as if much mud had wash into hi throat he think said the landlord a weakli medit man with a pale ey who seem to reli greatli on hi jack he think thei wa what thei wasn t i know what i think observ the jack you think custum us jack said the landlord i do said the jack then you re wrong jack am i in the infinit mean of hi repli and hi boundless confid in hi view the jack took on of hi bloat shoe off look into it knock a few stone out of it on the kitchen floor and put it

on tide and down with anoth and both with and against anoth without there be custum us at the bottom of it sai which he went out in disdain and the landlord have no on to repli upon found it impractic to pursu the subject thi dialogu made us all uneasi and me veri uneasi the dismal wind wa mutter round the hous the tide wa flap at the shore and i had a feel that we were cage and threaten a fouroar gallei hover about in so unusu a wai as to attract thi notic wa an ugli circumst that i could not get rid of when i had induc provi to go up to bed i went outsid with my two companion startop by thi time knew the state of the case and held anoth council whether we should remain at the hous until near the steamer s time which would be about on in the afternoon or whether we should put off earli in the morn wa the question we discuss on the whole we deem it the better cours to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the steamer s time and then to get out in her track and drift easili with the tide have settl to do thi we return into the hous and went to bed i lai down with the greater part of my cloth on and slept well for a few hour when i awok the wind had risen and the sign of the hous the ship wa creak and bang about with nois that startl me rise softli for my charg lai fast asleep i look out of the window it command the causewai where we had haul up our boat and as my ey adapt themselv to the light of the cloud moon i saw two men look into her thei pass by under the window look at noth els and thei did not go down to the landingplac which i could discern to be empti but struck across the marsh in the direct of the nore my first impuls wa to call up herbert and show him the two men go awai but reflect befor i got into hi room which wa at the back of the hous and adjoin mine that he and startop had had a harder dai than i and were fatigu i forbor go back to my window i could see the two men move over the marsh in that light howev i soon lost them and feel veri cold lai down to think of the matter and fell asleep again we were up earli as we walk to and fro all four togeth befor breakfast i deem it right to recount what i had seen again our charg wa the least anxiou of the parti it wa veri like that the men belong to the custom hous he said quietli and that thei had no thought of us i tri to persuad myself that it wa soa inde it might easili be howev i propos that he and i should walk awai togeth to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasibl at about noon thi be consid a good precaut soon after breakfast he and i set forth without sai anyth at the tavern he smoke hi pipe as we went along and sometim stop to clap me on the shoulder on would have suppos that it wa i who wa in danger not he and that he wa reassur me we spoke veri littl as we approach the point i beg him to remain in a shelter place while i went on to reconnoitr for it wa toward it that the men had pass in the night he compli and i went on alon there wa no boat off the point nor ani boat drawn up anywher near it nor were there ani sign of the men have embark there but to be sure the tide wa high and there might have been some footpint under water when he look out from hi shelter in the distanc and saw that i wave my hat to him to come up he rejoin me and there we wait sometim ly on the bank wrap in our coat and sometim move about to warm ourselv until we saw our boat come round we got aboard easili and row out into the track of the steamer by that time it want but ten minut of on o clock and we began to look out for her smoke but it wa halfpast on befor we saw her smoke and soon afterward we saw behind it the smoke of anoth steamer as thei were come on at full speed we got the two bag readi and took that opportun of sai goodby to herbert and startop we had all shaken hand cordial and neither herbert s ey nor mine were quit dry when i saw a fouroar gallei shoot out from under the bank but a littl wai ahead of us and row out into the same track a stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer s smoke by reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she wa visibl come head on i call to herbert and startop to keep befor the tide that she might see us ly by for her and i adjur provi to sit quit still wrap in hi cloak he answer cheerili trust to me dear boi and sat like a statu meantim the gallei which wa veri skilfulli handl had cross us let us come up with her and fallen alongsid leav just room enough for the plai of the oar she kept alongsid drift when we drift and pull a stroke or two when we pull of the two sitter on held the rudderlin and look at us attentivelya did all the rower the other sitter wa wrap up much as provi wa and seem to shrink and whisper some instruct to the steerer as he look at us not a word wa spoken in either boat startop could make out after a few minut which steamer wa first and gave me the word hamburg in a low voic as we sat face to face she wa near us veri fast and the beat of her peddl grew louder and louder i felt as if her shadow were absolut upon us when the gallei hail us i answer you have a return transport there said the man who held the line that s the man wrap in the cloak hi name is abel magwitch otherwis provi i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrend and you to assist at the same moment without give ani audibl direct to hi crew he ran the gallei abroad of us thei had pull on sudden stroke ahead had got their oar in had run athwart us and were hold on to our gunwal befor we knew what thei were do thi caus great confus on board the steamer and i heard them call to us and heard the order given to stop the paddl and heard them stop but felt her drive down upon us irresist in the same moment i saw the steersman of the gallei lai hi hand on hi prison s shoulder and saw that both boat were swing round with the forc of the tide and saw that all hand on board the steamer were run forward quit frantic still in the same moment i saw the prison start up lean across hi captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrink sitter in the gallei still in the same moment i saw that the face disclos wa the face of the other convict of long ago still in the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me it wa but for an instant that i seem to struggl with a thousand millweir and a thousand flash of light that instant past i wa taken on board the gallei herbert wa there and startop wa there but our boat wa gone and the two convict were gone what with the cri aboard the steamer and the furiou blow off of her steam and her drive on and our drive on i could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the gallei right her with great speed and pull certain swift strong stroke ahead lai upon their oar everi man look silent and eagerli at the water astern present a dark object wa seen in it bear toward us on the tide no man spoke but the steersman held up hi hand and all softli back water and kept the boat straight and true befor it as it came nearer i saw it to be magwitch swim but not swim freeli he wa taken on board and instantli manacl at the wrist and ankl the gallei wa kept steadi and the silent eager lookout at the water wa resum but the rotterdam steamer now came up and appar not understand what had happen came on at speed by the time she had been hail and stop both steamer were drift awai from us and we were rise and fall in a troubl wake of water the lookout wa kept long after all wa still again and the two steamer were gone but everybodi knew that it wa hopeless now at length we gave it up and pull under the shore toward the tavern we had late left where we were receiv with no littl surpris here i wa abl to get some comfort for magwitchprovi no longerwho had receiv some veri sever injuri in the chest and a deep cut in the head he told me that he believ himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer and to have been struck on the head in rise the injuri to hi chest which render hi breath extrem pain he thought he had receiv against the side of the gallei he ad that he did not pretend to sai what he might or might not have done to compeyson but that in the moment of hi lai hi hand on hi cloak to identifi him that villain had stagger up and stagger back and thei had both gone overboard togeth when the sudden wrench of him magwitch out of our boat and the endeavor of hi captor to keep him in it had capsiz us he told me in a whisper that thei had gone down fierc lock in each other s arm and that there had been a struggl under water and that he had disengag himself struck out and swum awai i never had ani reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thu told me the offic who steer the gallei gave the same account of their go overboard when i ask thi offic s permiss to chang the prison s wet cloth by purchas ani spare garment i could get at the publichous he gave it readili mere observ that he must take charg of everyth hi prison had about him so the pocketbook which had onc been in my hand pass into the offic s he further gave me leav to accompani the prison to london but declin to accord that grace to my two friend the jack at the ship wa instruct where the drown man had gone down and undertook to search for the bodi in the place where it wa likeliest to come ashor hi interest in it recoveri seem to me to be much heighten when he heard that it had stock on probabl it took about a dozen drown men to fit him out complet and that mai have been the reason why the differ articl of hi dress were in variou stage of decai we remain at the publichous until the tide turn and then magwitch wa carri down to the gallei and put on board herbert and startop were to get to london by land as soon as thei could we had a dole part and when i took my place by magwitch s side i felt that that wa my place henceforth while he live for now my repugn to him had all melt awai and in the hunt wound shackl creatur who held my hand in hi i onli saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affection gratefulli and gener toward me with great constanc through a seri of year i onli saw in him a much better man than i had been to joe hi breath becam more difficult and pain as the night drew on and often he could not repress a groan i tri to rest him on the arm i could us in ani easi posit but it wa dread to think that i could not be sorri at heart for hi be badli hurt sinc it wa unquestion best that he should die that there were still live peopl enough who were abl and will to identifi him i could not doubt that he would be lenient treat i could not hope he who had been present in the worst light at hi trial who had sinc broken prison and had been tri again who had return from transport under a life sentenc and who had occas the death of the man who wa the caus of hi arrest as we return toward the set sun we had yesterdai left behind us and as the stream of our hope seem all run back i told him how griev i wa to think that he had come home for my sake dear boi he answer i m quit content to take my chanc i ve seen my boi and he can be a gentleman without me no i had thought about that while we had been there side by side no apart from ani inclin of my own i understood wemmick s hint now i foresaw that be convict hi possess would be forfeit to the crown looke here dear boi said he it s best as a gentleman should not be know to belong to me now onli come to see me as if you come by chanc along wemmick sit where i can see you when i am swore to for the last o mani time and i don t ask no more i will never stir from your side said i when i am suffer to be near you pleas god i will be as true to you as you have been to me i felt hi hand trembl as it held mine and he turn hi face awai as he lai in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in hi throatsoften now like all the rest of him it wa a good thing that he had touch thi point for it put into my mind what i might not otherwis have thought of until too latethat he need never know how hi hope of enrich me had perish chapter lv he wa taken to the polic court next dai and would have been immedi commit for trial but that it wa necessari to send down for an old offic of the prisonship from which he had onc escap to speak to hi ident nobodi doubt it but compeyson who had meant to depos to it wa tumbl on the tide dead and it happen that there wa not at that time ani prison offic in london who could give the requir evid i had gone direct to mr jagger at hi privat hous on my arriv over night to retain hi assist and mr jagger on the prison s behalf would admit noth it wa the sole resourc for he told me that the case must be over in five minut when the wit wa there and that no power on earth could prevent it go against us i impart to mr jagger my design of keep him in ignor of the fate of hi wealth mr jagger wa querul and angri with me for have let it slip through my finger and said we must memori by and by and try at all event for some of it but he did not conceal from me that although there might be mani case in which the forfeitur would not be exact there were no circumst in thi case to make it on of them i understood that veri well i wa not relat to the outlaw or connect with him by ani recogniz tie he had put hi hand to no write or settlement in my favor befor hi apprehens and to do so now would be idl i had no claim and i final resolv and ever afterward abid by the resolut that my heart should never be sicken with the hopeless task of attempt to establish on there appear to be reason for suppos that the drown inform had hope for a reward out of thi forfeitur and had obtain some accur knowledg of magwitch s affair when hi bodi wa found mani mile from the scene of hi death and so horribl disfigur that he wa onli recogniz by the content of hi pocket note were still legibl fold in a case he carri among these were the name of a bankinghous in new south wale where a sum of monei wa and the design of certain land of consider valu both these head of inform were in a list that magwitch while in prison gave to mr jagger of the possess he suppos i should inherit hi ignor poor fellow at last serv him he never mistrust but that my inherit wa quit safe with mr jagger s aid after three dai delai dure which the crown prosecut stood over for the product of the wit from the prisonship the wit came and complet the easi case he wa commit to take hi trial at the next session which would come on in a month it wa at thi dark time of my life that herbert

that i wa like a child in hi hand he would sit and talk to me in the old confid and with the old simplic and in the old unassert protect wai so that i would half believ that all my life sinc the dai of the old kitchen wa on of the mental troubl of the fever that wa gone he did everyth for me except the household work for which he had engag a veri decent woman after pai off the laundress on hi first arriv which i do assur you pip he would often sai in explan of that liberti i found her a tap the spare bed like a cask of beer and draw off the feather in a bucket for sale which she would have tap yourn next and draw d it off with you a lai on it and wa then a carri awai the coal gradiw in the souptureen and wegetabledish and the wine and spirit in your wellington boot we look forward to the dai when i should go out for a ride as we had onc look forward to the dai of my apprenticeship and when the dai came and an open carriag wa got into the lane joe wrap me up took me in hi arm carri me down to it and put me in as if i were still the small helpless creatur to whom he had so abundantli given of the wealth of hi great natur and joe got in besid me and we drove awai togeth into the countri where the rich summer growth wa alreadi on the tree and on the grass and sweet summer scent fill all the air the dai happen to be sundai and when i look on the loveli around me and thought how it had grown and chang and how the littl wildflow had been form and the voic of the bird had been strengthen by dai and by night under the sun and under the star while poor i lai burn and toss on my bed the mere remembr of have burn and toss there came like a check upon my peac but when i heard the sundai bell and look around a littl more upon the outspread beauti i felt that i wa not nearli thank enoughthat i wa too weak yet to be even thatand i laid my head on joe s shoulder as i had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it wa too much for my young sens more composur came to me after a while and we talk as we us to talk ly on the grass at the old batteri there wa no chang whatev in joe exactli what he had been in my ey then he wa in my ey still just as simpli faith and as simpli right when we got back again and he lift me out and carri meso easilyacross the court and up the stair i thought of that event christma dai when he had carri me over the marsh we had not yet made ani allus to my chang of fortun nor did i know how much of my late histori he wa acquaint with i wa so doubt of myself now and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfi myself whether i ought to refer to it when he did not have you heard joe i ask him that even upon further consider as he smoke hi pipe at the window who my patron wa i heerd return joe as it were not miss havisham old chap did you hear who it wa joe well i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you the banknot at the jolli bargemen pip so it wa astonish said joe in the placidest wai did you hear that he wa dead joe i present ask with increas diffid which him as sent the banknot pip ye i think said joe after medit a long time and look rather evas at the windowseat as i did hear tell that how he were someth or anoth in a gener wai in that direct did you hear anyth of hi circumst joe not partickl pip if you would like to hear joe i wa begin when joe got up and came to my sofa looke here old chap said joe bend over me ever the best of friend ain t us pip i wa asham to answer him weri good then said joe as if i had answer that s all right that s agre upon then why go into subject old chap which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessari there s subject enough as betwixt two sech without onnecessari on lord to think of your poor sister and her rampag and don t you rememb tickler i do inde joe looke here old chap said joe i done what i could to keep you and tickler in sunder but my power were not alwai fulli equal to my inclin for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it were not so much said joe in hi favorit argument wai that she drop into me too if i put myself in opposit to her but that she drop into you alwai heavier for it i notic that it ain t a grab at a man s whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your sister wa quit welcom that ud put a man off from get a littl child out of punish but when that littl child is drop into heavier for that grab of whisker or shake then that man nater up and sai to himself where is the good as you ar a do i grant you i see the arm sai the man but i don t see the good i call upon you sir therefor to pint out the good the man sai i observ as joe wait for me to speak the man sai joe assent is he right that man dear joe he is alwai right well old chap said joe then abid by your word if he s alwai right which in gener he s more like wrong he s right when he sai thi suppos ever you kep ani littl matter to yourself when you wa a littl child you kep it mostli becaus you know d as j gargeri s power to part you and tickler in sunder were not fulli equal to hi inclin theerfor think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do not let us pass remark upon onnecessari subject biddi giv herself a deal o troubl with me afor i left for i am almost aw dull as i should view it in thi light and view it in thi light as i should so put it both of which said joe quit charm with hi logic arrang be done now thi to you a true friend sai name you mustn t go a overdo on it but you must have your supper and your wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheet the delicaci with which joe dismiss thi theme and the sweet tact and kind with which biddywho with her woman s wit had found me out so soonhad prepar him for it made a deep impress on my mind but whether joe knew how poor i wa and how my great expect had all dissolv like our own marsh mist befor the sun i could not understand anoth thing in joe that i could not understand when it first began to develop itself but which i soon arriv at a sorrow comprehens of wa thi as i becam stronger and better joe becam a littl less easi with me in my weak and entir depend on him the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone and call me by the old name the dear old pip old chap that now were music in my ear i too had fallen into the old wai onli happi and thank that he let me but impercept though i held by them fast joe s hold upon them began to slacken and wherea i wonder at thi at first i soon began to understand that the caus of it wa in me and that the fault of it wa all mine ah had i given joe no reason to doubt my constanc and to think that in prosper i should grow cold to him and cast him off had i given joe s innoc heart no caus to feel instinct that as i got stronger hi hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go befor i pluck myself awai it wa on the third or fourth occas of my go out walk in the templ garden lean on joe s arm that i saw thi chang in him veri plainli we had been sit in the bright warm sunlight look at the river and i chanc to sai as we got up see joe i can walk quit strongli now you shall see me walk back by myself which do not overdo it
