littl back librari or bookcloset au troisi me no rue dun t faubourg st germain for on hour at least we had maintain a profound silenc while each to ani casual observ might have seem intent and exclus occupi with the curl eddi of smoke that oppress the atmospher of the chamber for myself howev i wa mental discuss certain topic which had form matter for convers between us at an earlier period of the even i mean the affair of the rue morgu and the mysteri attend the murder of mari rog t i look upon it therefor as someth of a coincid when the door of our apart wa thrown open and admit our old acquaint monsieur g the prefect of the parisian polic we gave him a hearti welcom for there wa nearli half as much of the entertain as of the contempt about the man and we had not seen him for sever year we had been sit in the dark and dupin now aros for the purpos of light a lamp but sat down again without do so upon g s sai that he had call to consult us or rather to ask the opinion of my friend about some offici busi which had occas a great deal of troubl if it is ani point requir reflect observ dupin as he forebor to enkindl the wick we shall examin it to better purpos in the dark that is anoth of your odd notion said the prefect who had a fashion of call everi thing odd that wa beyond hi comprehens and thu live amid an absolut legion of odditi veri true said dupin as he suppli hi visit with a pipe and roll toward him a comfort chair and what is the difficulti now i ask noth more in the assassin wai i hope oh no noth of that natur the fact is the busi is veri simpl inde and i make no doubt that we can manag it suffici well ourselv but then i thought dupin would like to hear the detail of it becaus it is so excess odd simpl and odd said dupin why ye and not exactli that either the fact is we have all been a good deal puzzl becaus the affair is so simpl and yet baffl us altogeth perhap it is the veri simplic of the thing which put you at fault said my friend what nonsens you do talk repli the prefect laugh heartili perhap the mysteri is a littl too plain said dupin oh good heaven who ever heard of such an idea a littl too selfevid ha ha haha ha haho ho ho roar our visit profoundli amus oh dupin you will be the death of me yet and what after all is the matter on hand i ask why i will tell you repli the prefect as he gave a long steadi and contempl puff and settl himself in hi chair i will tell you in a few word but befor i begin let me caution you that thi is an affair demand the greatest secreci and that i should most probabl lose the posit i now hold were it known that i confid it to ani on proce said i or not said dupin well then i have receiv person inform from a veri high quarter that a certain document of the last import ha been purloin from the royal apart the individu who purloin it is known thi beyond a doubt he wa seen to take it it is known also that it still remain in hi possess how is thi known ask dupin it is clearli infer repli the prefect from the natur of the document and from the nonappear of certain result which would at onc aris from it pass out of the robber s possess that is to sai from hi emploi it as he must design in the end to emploi it be a littl more explicit i said well i mai ventur so far as to sai that the paper give it holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immens valuabl the prefect wa fond of the cant of diplomaci still i do not quit understand said dupin no well the disclosur of the document to a third person who shall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personag of most exalt station and thi fact give the holder of the document an ascend over the illustri personag whose honor and peac ar so jeopard but thi ascend i interpos would depend upon the robber s knowledg of the loser s knowledg of the robber who would dare the thief said g is the minist d who dare all thing those unbecom as well as those becom a man the method of the theft wa not less ingeni than bold the document in questiona letter to be frankhad been receiv by the personag rob while alon in the royal boudoir dure it perus she wa suddenli interrupt by the entranc of the other exalt personag from whom especi it wa her wish to conceal it after a hurri and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer she wa forc to place it open as it wa upon a tabl the address howev wa uppermost and the content thu unexpos the letter escap notic at thi junctur enter the minist d hi lynx ey immedi perceiv the paper recognis the handwrit of the address observ the confus of the personag address and fathom her secret after some busi transact hurri through in hi ordinari manner he produc a letter somewhat similar to the on in question open it pretend to read it and then place it in close juxtaposit to the other again he convers for some fifteen minut upon the public affair at length in take leav he take also from the tabl the letter to which he had no claim it right owner saw but of cours dare not call attent to the act in the presenc of the third personag who stood at her elbow the minist decamp leav hi own letteron of no importanceupon the tabl here then said dupin to me you have precis what you demand to make the ascend completeth robber s knowledg of the loser s knowledg of the robber ye repli the prefect and the power thu attain ha for some month past been wield for polit purpos to a veri danger extent the personag rob is more thoroughli convinc everi dai of the necess of reclaim her letter but thi of cours cannot be done openli in fine driven to despair she ha commit the matter to me than whom said dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no more sagaci agent could i suppos be desir or even imagin you flatter me repli the prefect but it is possibl that some such opinion mai have been entertain it is clear said i as you observ that the letter is still in possess of the minist sinc it is thi possess and not ani employ of the letter which bestow the power with the employ the power depart true said g and upon thi convict i proceed my first care wa to make thorough search of the minist s hotel and here my chief embarrass lai in the necess of search without hi knowledg beyond all thing i have been warn of the danger which would result from give him reason to suspect our design but said i you ar quit au fait in these investig the parisian polic have done thi thing often befor o ye and for thi reason i did not despair the habit of the minist gave me too a great advantag he is frequent absent from home all night hi servant ar by no mean numer thei sleep at a distanc from their master s apart and be chiefli neapolitan ar readili made drunk i have kei as you know with which i can open ani chamber or cabinet in pari for three month a night ha not pass dure the greater part of which i have not been engag person in ransack the d hotel my honor is interest and to mention a great secret the reward is enorm so i did not abandon the search until i had becom fulli satisfi that the thief is a more astut man than myself i fanci that i have investig everi nook and corner of the premis in which it is possibl that the paper can be conceal but is it not possibl i suggest that although the letter mai be in possess of the minist as it unquestion is he mai have conceal it elsewher than upon hi own premis thi is bare possibl said dupin the present peculiar condit of affair at court and especi of those intrigu in which d is known to be involv would render the instant avail of the documentit suscept of be produc at a moment s noticea point of nearli equal import with it possess it suscept of be produc said i that is to sai of be destroi said dupin true i observ the paper is clearli then upon the premis as for it be upon the person of the minist we mai consid that as out of the question entir said the prefect he ha been twice waylaid as if by footpad and hi person rigor search under my own inspect you might have spare yourself thi troubl said dupin d i presum is not altogeth a fool and if not must have anticip these waylai as a matter of cours not altogeth a fool said g but then he s a poet which i take to be onli on remov from a fool true said dupin after a long and thought whiff from hi meerschaum although i have been guilti of certain doggrel myself suppos you detail said i the particular of your search why the fact is we took our time and we search everi where i have had long experi in these affair i took the entir build room by room devot the night of a whole week to each we examin first the furnitur of each apart we open everi possibl drawer and i presum you know that to a properli train polic agent such a thing as a secret drawer is imposs ani man is a dolt who permit a secret drawer to escap him in a search of thi kind the thing is so plain there is a certain amount of bulkof spaceto be account for in everi cabinet then we have accur rule the fiftieth part of a line could not escap us after the cabinet we took the chair the cushion we probe with the fine long needl you have seen me emploi from the tabl we remov the top why so sometim the top of a tabl or other similarli arrang piec of furnitur is remov by the person wish to conceal an articl then the leg is excav the articl deposit within the caviti and the top replac the bottom and top of bedpost ar emploi in the same wai but could not the caviti be detect by sound i ask by no mean if when the articl is deposit a suffici wad of cotton be place around it besid in our case we were oblig to proce without nois but you could not have removedy could not have taken to piec all articl of furnitur in which it would have been possibl to make a deposit in the manner you mention a letter mai be compress into a thin spiral roll not differ much in shape or bulk from a larg knittingneedl and in thi form it might be insert into the rung of a chair for exampl you did not take to piec all the chair certainli not but we did betterw examin the rung of everi chair in the hotel and inde the joint of everi descript of furnitur by the aid of a most power microscop had there been ani trace of recent disturb we should not have fail to detect it instantli a singl grain of gimletdust for exampl would have been as obviou as an appl ani disord in the glueingani unusu gape in the jointswould have suffic to insur detect i presum you look to the mirror between the board and the plate and you probe the bed and the bedcloth as well as the curtain and carpet that of cours and when we had absolut complet everi particl of the furnitur in thi wai then we examin the hous itself we divid it entir surfac into compart which we number so that none might be miss then we scrutin each individu squar inch throughout the premis includ the two hous immedi adjoin with the microscop as befor the two hous adjoin i exclaim you must have had a great deal of troubl we had but the reward offer is prodigi you includ the ground about the hous all the ground ar pave with brick thei gave us compar littl troubl we examin the moss between the brick and found it undisturb you look among d s paper of cours and into the book of the librari certainli we open everi packag and parcel we not onli open everi book but we turn over everi leaf in each volum not content ourselv with a mere shake accord to the fashion of some of our polic offic we also measur the thick of everi bookcov with the most accur admeasur and appli to each the most jealou scrutini of the microscop had ani of the bind been recent meddl with it would have been utterli imposs that the fact should have escap observ some five or six volum just from the hand of the binder we carefulli probe longitudin with the needl you explor the floor beneath the carpet beyond doubt we remov everi carpet and examin the board with the microscop and the paper on the wall ye you look into the cellar we did then i said you have been make a miscalcul and the letter is not upon the premis as you suppos i fear you ar right there said the prefect and now dupin what would you advis me to do to make a thorough research of the premis that is absolut needless repli g i am not more sure that i breath than i am that the letter is not at the hotel i have no better advic to give you said dupin you have of cours an accur descript of the letter oh ye and here the prefect produc a memorandumbook proceed to read aloud a minut account of the intern and especi of the extern appear of the miss document soon after finish the perus of thi descript he took hi departur more entir depress in spirit than i had ever known the good gentleman befor in about a month afterward he paid us anoth visit and found us occupi veri nearli as befor he took a pipe and a chair and enter into some ordinari convers at length i said well but g what of the purloin letter i presum you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreach the minist confound him sai iy i made the reexamin howev as dupin suggestedbut it wa all labor lost as i knew it would be how much wa the reward offer did you sai ask dupin why a veri great deala veri liber rewardi don t like to sai how much precis but on thing i will sai that i wouldn t mind give my individu check for fifti thousand franc to ani on who could obtain me that letter the fact is it is becom of more and more import everi dai and the reward ha been late doubl if it were trebl howev i could do no more than i have done why ye said dupin drawlingli between the whiff of hi meerschaum i reallythink g you have not exert yourselfto the utmost in thi matter you mightdo a littl more i think eh howin what wai whypuff puffyou mightpuff puffemploi counsel in the matter ehpuff puff puff do you rememb the stori thei tell of abernethi no hang abernethi to be sure hang him and welcom but onc upon a time a certain rich miser conceiv the design of spung upon thi abernethi for a medic opinion get up for thi purpos an ordinari convers in a privat compani he insinu hi case to the physician as that of an imaginari individu we will suppos said the miser that hi symptom ar such and such now doctor what would you have direct him to take take said abernethi why take advic to be sure but said the prefect a littl discompos i am perfectli will to take advic and to pai for it i would realli give fifti thousand franc to ani on who would aid me in the matter in that case repli dupin open a drawer and produc a checkbook you mai as well fill me up a check for the amount mention when you have sign it i will hand you the letter i wa astound the prefect appear absolut thunderstricken for some minut he remain speechless and motionless look incredul at my friend with open mouth and ey that seem start from their socket then appar recov himself in some measur he seiz a pen and after sever paus and vacant stare final fill up and sign a check for fifti thousand franc and hand it across the tabl to dupin the latter examin it carefulli and deposit it in hi pocketbook then unlock an escritoir took thenc a letter and gave it to the prefect thi functionari grasp it in a perfect agoni of joi open it with a trembl hand cast a rapid glanc at it content and then scrambl and struggl to the door rush at length unceremoni from the room and from the hous without have utter a syllabl sinc dupin had request him to fill up the check when he had gone my friend enter into some explan the parisian polic he said ar exceedingli abl in their wai thei ar persev ingeni cun and thoroughli vers in the knowledg which their duti seem chiefli to demand thu when g detail to us hi mode of search the premis at the hotel d i felt entir confid in hi have made a satisfactori investigationso far as hi labor extend so far as hi labor extend said i ye said dupin the measur adopt were not onli the best of their kind but carri out to absolut perfect had the letter been deposit within the rang of their search these fellow would beyond a question have found it i mere laughedbut he seem quit seriou in all that he said the measur then he continu were good in their kind and well execut their defect lai in their be inapplic to the case and to the man a certain set of highli ingeni resourc ar with the prefect a sort of procrustean bed to which he forcibl adapt hi design but he perpetu err by be too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand and mani a schoolboi is a better reason than he i knew on about eight year of ag whose success at guess in the game of even and odd attract univers admir thi game is simpl and is plai with marbl on player hold in hi hand a number of these toi and demand of anoth whether that number is even or odd if the guess is right the guesser win on if wrong he lose on the boi to whom i allud won all the marbl of the school of cours he had some principl of guess and thi lai in mere observ and admeasur of the astut of hi oppon for exampl an arrant simpleton is hi oppon and hold up hi close hand ask ar thei even or odd our schoolboi repli odd and lose but upon the second trial he win for he then sai to himself the simpleton had them even upon the first trial and hi amount of cun is just suffici to make him have them odd upon the second i will therefor guess odd he guess odd and win now with a simpleton a degre abov the first he would have reason thu thi fellow find that in the first instanc i guess odd and in the second he will propos to himself upon the first impuls a simpl variat from even to odd as did the first simpleton but then a second thought will suggest that thi is too simpl a variat and final he will decid upon put it even as befor i will therefor guess even he guess even and win now thi mode of reason in the schoolboi whom hi fellow term lucki what in it last analysi is it it is mere i said an identif of the reason s intellect with that of hi oppon it is said dupin and upon inquir of the boi by what mean he effect the thorough identif in which hi success consist i receiv answer as follow when i wish to find out how wise or how stupid or how good or how wick is ani on or what ar hi thought at the moment i fashion the express of my face as accur as possibl in accord with the express of hi and then wait to see what thought or sentiment aris in my mind or heart as if to match or correspond with the express thi respons of the schoolboi li at the bottom of all the spuriou profund which ha been attribut to rochefoucault to la bougiv to machiavelli and to campanella and the identif i said of the reason s intellect with that of hi oppon depend if i understand you aright upon the accuraci with which the oppon s intellect is admeasur for it practic valu it depend upon thi repli dupin and the prefect and hi cohort fail so frequent first by default of thi identif and secondli by illadmeasur or rather through nonadmeasur of the intellect with which thei ar engag thei consid onli their own idea of ingenu and in search for anyth hidden advert onli to the mode in which thei would have hidden it thei ar right in thi muchthat their own ingenu is a faith repres of that of the mass but when the cun of the individu felon is divers in charact from their own the felon foil them of cours thi alwai happen when it is abov their own and veri usual when it is below thei have no variat of principl in their investig at best when urg by some unusu emergencybi some extraordinari rewardthei extend or exagger their old mode of practic without touch their principl what for exampl in thi case of d ha been done to vari the principl of action what is all thi bore and probe and sound and scrutin with the microscop and divid the surfac of the build into regist squar incheswhat is it all but an exagger of the applic of the on principl or set of principl of search which ar base upon the on set of notion regard human ingenu to which the prefect in the long routin of hi duti ha been accustom do you not see he ha taken it for grant that all men proce to conceal a letternot exactli in a gimlet hole bore in a chairlegbut at least in some outofthewai hole or corner suggest by the same tenor of thought which would urg a man to secret a letter in a gimlethol bore in a chairleg and do you not see also that such recherch s nook for conceal ar adapt onli for ordinari occas and would be adopt onli by ordinari intellect for in all case of conceal a dispos of the articl concealeda dispos of it in thi recherch manneri in the veri first instanc presum and presum and thu it discoveri depend not at all upon the acumen but altogeth upon the mere care patienc and determin of the seeker and where the case is of importanceor what amount to the same thing in the polici ey when the reward is of magnitudeth qualiti in question have never been known to fail you will now understand what i meant in suggest that had the purloin letter been hidden ani where within the limit of the prefect s examinationin other word had the principl of it conceal been comprehend within the principl of the prefectit discoveri would have been a matter altogeth beyond question thi functionari howev ha been thoroughli mystifi and the remot sourc of hi defeat li in the supposit that the minist is a fool becaus he ha acquir renown as a poet all fool ar poet thi the prefect feel and he is mere guilti of a non distributio medii in thenc infer that all poet ar fool but is thi realli the poet i ask there ar two brother i know and both have attain reput in letter the minist i believ ha written learnedli on the differenti calculu he is a mathematician and no poet you ar mistaken i know him well he is both as poet and mathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he could not have reason at all and thu would have been at the merci of the prefect you surpris me i said by these opinion which have been contradict by the voic of the world you do not mean to set at naught the welldigest idea of centuri the mathemat reason ha long been regard as the reason par excel il y a pari r repli dupin quot from chamfort que tout id e publiqu tout convent re ue est un sottis car ell a convenu au plu grand nombr the mathematician i grant you have done their best to promulg the popular error to which you allud and which is none the less an error for it promulg as truth with an art worthi a better caus for exampl thei have insinu the term analysi into applic to algebra the french ar the origin of thi particular decept but if a term is of ani importanceif word deriv ani valu from applicabilitythen analysi convei algebra about as much as in latin ambitu impli ambit religio religion or homin honesti a set of honorablemen you have a quarrel on hand i see said i with some of the algebraist of pari but proce i disput the avail and thu the valu of that reason which is cultiv in ani especi form other than the abstractli logic i disput in particular the reason educ by mathemat studi the mathemat ar the scienc of form and quantiti mathemat reason is mere logic appli to observ upon form and quantiti the great error li in suppos that even the truth of what is call pure algebra ar abstract or gener truth and thi error is so egregi that i am confound at the univers with which it ha been receiv mathemat axiom ar not axiom of gener truth what is true of relationof form and quantityi often grossli

believ and the infer ar made not so much through laps of memori as through an unaccount addl of the brain in short i never yet encount the mere mathematician who could be trust out of equal root or on who did not clandestin hold it as a point of hi faith that x px wa absolut and uncondition equal to q sai to on of these gentlemen by wai of experi if you pleas that you believ occas mai occur where x px is not altogeth equal to q and have made him understand what you mean get out of hi reach as speedili as conveni for beyond doubt he will endeavor to knock you down i mean to sai continu dupin while i mere laugh at hi last observ that if the minist had been no more than a mathematician the prefect would have been under no necess of give me thi check i know him howev as both mathematician and poet and my measur were adapt to hi capac with refer to the circumst by which he wa surround i knew him as a courtier too and as a bold intrigu such a man i consid could not fail to be awar of the ordinari polici mode of action he could not have fail to anticipateand event have prove that he did not fail to anticipateth waylai to which he wa subject he must have foreseen i reflect the secret investig of hi premis hi frequent absenc from home at night which were hail by the prefect as certain aid to hi success i regard onli as ruse to afford opportun for thorough search to the polic and thu the sooner to impress them with the convict to which g in fact did final arriveth convict that the letter wa not upon the premis i felt also that the whole train of thought which i wa at some pain in detail to you just now concern the invari principl of polici action in search for articl concealedi felt that thi whole train of thought would necessarili pass through the mind of the minist it would imper lead him to despis all the ordinari nook of conceal he could not i reflect be so weak as not to see that the most intric and remot recess of hi hotel would be as open as hi commonest closet to the ey to the probe to the gimlet and to the microscop of the prefect i saw in fine that he would be driven as a matter of cours to simplic if not deliber induc to it as a matter of choic you will rememb perhap how desper the prefect laugh when i suggest upon our first interview that it wa just possibl thi mysteri troubl him so much on account of it be so veri selfevid ye said i i rememb hi merriment well i realli thought he would have fallen into convuls the materi world continu dupin abound with veri strict analog to the immateri and thu some color of truth ha been given to the rhetor dogma that metaphor or simil mai be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a descript the principl of the vi inerti for exampl seem to be ident in physic and metaphys it is not more true in the former that a larg bodi is with more difficulti set in motion than a smaller on and that it subsequ momentum is commensur with thi difficulti than it is in the latter that intellect of the vaster capac while more forcibl more constant and more event in their movement than those of inferior grade ar yet the less readili move and more embarrass and full of hesit in the first few step of their progress again have you ever notic which of the street sign over the shopdoor ar the most attract of attent i have never given the matter a thought i said there is a game of puzzl he resum which is plai upon a map on parti plai requir anoth to find a given wordth name of town river state or empireani word in short upon the motlei and perplex surfac of the chart a novic in the game gener seek to embarrass hi oppon by give them the most minut letter name but the adept select such word as stretch in larg charact from on end of the chart to the other these like the overlarg letter sign and placard of the street escap observ by dint of be excess obviou and here the physic oversight is precis analog with the moral inapprehens by which the intellect suffer to pass unnot those consider which ar too obtrus and too palpabl selfevid but thi is a point it appear somewhat abov or beneath the understand of the prefect he never onc thought it probabl or possibl that the minist had deposit the letter immedi beneath the nose of the whole world by wai of best prevent ani portion of that world from perceiv it but the more i reflect upon the dare dash and discrimin ingenu of d upon the fact that the document must alwai have been at hand if he intend to us it to good purpos and upon the decis evid obtain by the prefect that it wa not hidden within the limit of that dignitari s ordinari searchth more satisfi i becam that to conceal thi letter the minist had resort to the comprehens and sagaci expedi of not attempt to conceal it at all full of these idea i prepar myself with a pair of green spectacl and call on fine morn quit by accid at the ministeri hotel i found d at home yawn loung and dawdl as usual and pretend to be in the last extrem of ennui he is perhap the most realli energet human be now alivebut that is onli when nobodi see him to be even with him i complain of my weak ey and lament the necess of the spectacl under cover of which i cautious and thoroughli survei the whole apart while seemingli intent onli upon the convers of my host i paid especi attent to a larg writingt near which he sat and upon which lai confusedli some miscellan letter and other paper with on or two music instrument and a few book here howev after a long and veri deliber scrutini i saw noth to excit particular suspicion at length my ey in go the circuit of the room fell upon a trumperi fillagre cardrack of pasteboard that hung dangl by a dirti blue ribbon from a littl brass knob just beneath the middl of the mantelpiec in thi rack which had three or four compart were five or six visit card and a solitari letter thi last wa much soil and crumpl it wa torn nearli in two across the middlea if a design in the first instanc to tear it entir up as worthless had been alter or stai in the second it had a larg black seal bear the d cipher veri conspicu and wa address in a diminut femal hand to d the minist himself it wa thrust carelessli and even as it seem contemptu into on of the uppermost divis of the rack no sooner had i glanc at thi letter than i conclud it to be that of which i wa in search to be sure it wa to all appear radic differ from the on of which the prefect had read us so minut a descript here the seal wa larg and black with the d cipher there it wa small and red with the ducal arm of the s famili here the address to the minist diminut and feminin there the superscript to a certain royal personag wa markedli bold and decid the size alon form a point of correspond but then the radic of these differ which wa excess the dirt the soil and torn condit of the paper so inconsist with the true method habit of d and so suggest of a design to delud the behold into an idea of the worthless of the document these thing togeth with the hyperobtrus situat of thi document full in the view of everi visit and thu exactli in accord with the conclus to which i had previous arriv these thing i sai were strongli corrobor of suspicion in on who came with the intent to suspect i protract my visit as long as possibl and while i maintain a most anim discuss with the minist upon a topic which i knew well had never fail to interest and excit him i kept my attent realli rivet upon the letter in thi examin i commit to memori it extern appear and arrang in the rack and also fell at length upon a discoveri which set at rest whatev trivial doubt i might have entertain in scrutin the edg of the paper i observ them to be more chafe than seem necessari thei present the broken appear which is manifest when a stiff paper have been onc fold and press with a folder is refold in a revers direct in the same creas or edg which had form the origin fold thi discoveri wa suffici it wa clear to me that the letter had been turn as a glove insid out redirect and reseal i bade the minist good morn and took my departur at onc leav a gold snuffbox upon the tabl the next morn i call for the snuffbox when we resum quit eagerli the convers of the preced dai while thu engag howev a loud report as if of a pistol wa heard immedi beneath the window of the hotel and wa succeed by a seri of fear scream and the shout of a terrifi mob d rush to a casement threw it open and look out in the meantim i step to the cardrack took the letter put it in my pocket and replac it by a facsimil so far as regard extern which i had carefulli prepar at my lodgingsimit the d cipher veri readili by mean of a seal form of bread the disturb in the street had been occas by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket he had fire it

i sai to turn over some page of the firstment veri remark work i wa not a littl astonish to discov that the literari world ha hitherto been strang in error respect the fate of the vizier s daughter scheherazad as that fate is depict in the arabian night and that the denouement there given if not altogeth inaccur as far as it goe is at least to blame in not have gone veri much farther for full inform on thi interest topic i must refer the inquisit reader to the isitsoornot itself but in the meantim i shall be pardon for give a summari of what i there discov it will be rememb that in the usual version of the tale a certain monarch have good caus to be jealou of hi queen not onli put her to death but make a vow by hi beard and the prophet to espous each night the most beauti maiden in hi dominion and the next morn to deliv her up to the execution have fulfil thi vow for mani year to the letter and with a religi punctual and method that confer great credit upon him as a man of devout feel and excel sens he wa interrupt on afternoon no doubt at hi prayer by a visit from hi grand vizier to whose daughter it appear there had occur an idea her name wa scheherazad and her idea wa that she would either redeem the land from the depopul tax upon it beauti or perish after the approv fashion of all heroin in the attempt accordingli and although we do not find it to be leapyear which make the sacrific more meritori she deput her father the grand vizier to make an offer to the king of her hand thi hand the king eagerli acceptsh had intend to take it at all event and had put off the matter from dai to dai onli through fear of the vizierbut in accept it now he give all parti veri distinctli to understand that grand vizier or no grand vizier he ha not the slightest design of give up on iota of hi vow or of hi privileg when therefor the fair scheherazad insist upon marri the king and did actual marri him despit her father s excel advic not to do ani thing of the kindwhen she would and did marri him i sai will i nill i it wa with her beauti black ey as thoroughli open as the natur of the case would allow it seem howev that thi polit damsel who had been read machiavelli beyond doubt had a veri ingeni littl plot in her mind on the night of the wed she contriv upon i forget what speciou pretenc to have her sister occupi a couch suffici near that of the royal pair to admit of easi convers from bed to bed and a littl befor cockcrow she took care to awaken the good monarch her husband who bore her none the wors will becaus he intend to wring her neck on the morrowsh manag to awaken him i sai although on account of a capit conscienc and an easi digest he slept well by the profound interest of a stori about a rat and a black cat i think which she wa narrat all in an underton of cours to her sister when the dai broke it so happen that thi histori wa not altogeth finish and that scheherazad in the natur of thing could not finish it just then sinc it wa high time for her to get up and be bowstrunga thing veri littl more pleasant than hang onli a trifl more genteel the king s curios howev prevail i am sorri to sai even over hi sound religi principl induc him for thi onc to postpon the fulfil of hi vow until next morn for the purpos and with the hope of hear that night how it fare in the end with the black cat a black cat i think it wa and the rat the night have arriv howev the ladi scheherazad not onli put the finish stroke to the black cat and the rat the rat wa blue but befor she well knew what she wa about found herself deep in the intricaci of a narrat have refer if i am not altogeth mistaken to a pink hors with green wing that went in a violent manner by clockwork and wa wound up with an indigo kei with thi histori the king wa even more profoundli interest than with the otherand as the dai broke befor it conclus notwithstand all the queen s endeavor to get through with it in time for the bowstring there wa again no resourc but to postpon that ceremoni as befor for twentyfour hour the next night there happen a similar accid with a similar result and then the nextand then again the next so that in the end the good monarch have been unavoid depriv of all opportun to keep hi vow dure a period of no less than on thousand and on night either forget it altogeth by the expir of thi time or get himself absolv of it in the regular wai or what is more probabl break it outright as well as the head of hi father confessor at all event scheherazad who be lineal descend from ev fell heir perhap to the whole seven basket of talk which the latter ladi we all know pick up from under the tree in the garden of edenscheherazad i sai final triumph and the tariff upon beauti wa repeal now thi conclus which is that of the stori as we have it upon record is no doubt excess proper and pleasantbut ala like a great mani pleasant thing is more pleasant than true and i am indebt altogeth to the isitsoornot for the mean of correct the error le mieux sai a french proverb est l ennemi du bien and in mention that scheherazad had inherit the seven basket of talk i should have ad that she put them out at compound interest until thei amount to seventyseven my dear sister said she on the thousandandsecond night i quot the languag of the isitsoornot at thi point verbatim my dear sister said she now that all thi littl difficulti about the bowstr ha blown over and that thi odiou tax is so happili repeal i feel that i have been guilti of great indiscret in withhold from you and the king who i am sorri to sai snoresa thing no gentleman would do the full conclus of sinbad the sailor thi person went through numer other and more interest adventur than those which i relat but the truth is i felt sleepi on the particular night of their narrat and so wa seduc into cut them shorta grievou piec of misconduct for which i onli trust that allah will forgiv me but even yet it is not too late to remedi my great neglectand as soon as i have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far that he mai stop make that horribl nois i will forthwith entertain you and him if he pleas with the sequel of thi veri remark stori hereupon the sister of scheherazad as i have it from the isitsoornot express no veri particular intens of gratif but the king have been suffici pinch at length ceas snore and final said hum and then hoo when the queen understand these word which ar no doubt arab to signifi that he wa all attent and would do hi best not to snore ani moreth queen i sai have arrang these matter to her satisfact reenter thu at onc into the histori of sinbad the sailor at length in my old ag these ar the word of sinbad himself as retail by scheherazad at length in my old ag and after enjoi mani year of tranquil at home i becam onc more possess of a desir of visit foreign countri and on dai without acquaint ani of my famili with my design i pack up some bundl of such merchandis as wa most preciou and least bulki and engag a porter to carri them went with him down to the seashor to await the arriv of ani chanc vessel that might convei me out of the kingdom into some region which i had not as yet explor have deposit the packag upon the sand we sat down beneath some tree and look out into the ocean in the hope of perceiv a ship but dure sever hour we saw none whatev at length i fanci that i could hear a singular buzz or hum sound and the porter after listen awhil declar that he also could distinguish it present it grew louder and then still louder so that we could have no doubt that the object which caus it wa approach us at length on the edg of the horizon we discov a black speck which rapidli increas in size until we made it out to be a vast monster swim with a great part of it bodi abov the surfac of the sea it came toward us with inconceiv swift throw up huge wave of foam around it breast and illumin all that part of the sea through which it pass with a long line of fire that extend far off into the distanc as the thing drew near we saw it veri distinctli it length wa equal to that of three of the loftiest tree that grow and it wa as wide as the great hall of audienc in your palac o most sublim and munific of the caliph it bodi which wa unlik that of ordinari fish wa as solid as a rock and of a jetti black throughout all that portion of it which float abov the water with the except of a narrow bloodr streak that complet begirdl it the belli which float beneath the surfac and of which we could get onli a glimps now and then as the monster rose and fell with the billow wa entir cover with metal scale of a color like that of the moon in misti weather the back wa flat and nearli white and from it there extend upward of six spine about half the length of the whole bodi the horribl creatur had no mouth that we could perceiv but as if to make up for thi defici it wa provid with at least four score of ey that protrud from their socket like those of the green dragonfli and were arrang all around the bodi in two row on abov the other and parallel to the bloodr streak which seem to answer the purpos of an eyebrow two or three of these dread ey were much larger than the other and had the appear of solid gold although thi beast approach us as i have befor said with the greatest rapid it must have been move altogeth by necromancyfor it had neither fin like a fish nor webfeet like a duck nor wing like the seashel which is blown along in the manner of a vessel nor yet did it writh itself forward as do the eel it head and it tail were shape precis alik onli not far from the latter were two small hole that serv for nostril and through which the monster puf out it thick breath with prodigi violenc and with a shriek disagre nois our terror at behold thi hideou thing wa veri great but it wa even surpass by our astonish when upon get a nearer look we perceiv upon the creatur s back a vast number of anim about the size and shape of men and altogeth much resembl them except that thei wore no garment as men do be suppli by natur no doubt with an ugli uncomfort cover a good deal like cloth but fit so tight to the skin as to render the poor wretch laughabl awkward and put them appar to sever pain on the veri tip of their head were certain squarelook box which at first sight i thought might have been intend to answer as turban but i soon discov that thei were excess heavi and solid and i therefor conclud thei were contriv design by their great weight to keep the head of the anim steadi and safe upon their shoulder around the neck of the creatur were fasten black collar badg of servitud no doubt such as we keep on our dog onli much wider and infinit stiffer so that it wa quit imposs for these poor victim to move their head in ani direct without move the bodi at the same time and thu thei were doom to perpetu contempl of their nosesa view puggish and snubbi in a wonder if not posit in an aw degre when the monster had nearli reach the shore where we stood it suddenli push out on of it ey to a great extent and emit from it a terribl flash of fire accompani by a dens cloud of smoke and a nois that i can compar to noth but thunder as the smoke clear awai we saw on of the odd mananim stand near the head of the larg beast with a trumpet in hi hand through which put it to hi mouth he present address us in loud harsh and disagre accent that perhap we should have mistaken for languag had thei not come altogeth through the nose be thu evid spoken to i wa at a loss how to repli as i could in no manner understand what wa said and in thi difficulti i turn to the porter who wa near swoon through affright and demand of him hi opinion as to what speci of monster it wa what it want and what kind of creatur those were that so swarm upon it back to thi the porter repli as well as he could for trepid that he had onc befor heard of thi seabeast that it wa a cruel demon with bowel of sulphur and blood of fire creat by evil genii as the mean of inflict miseri upon mankind that the thing upon it back were vermin such as sometim infest cat and dog onli a littl larger and more savag and that these vermin had their us howev evilfor through the tortur thei caus the beast by their nibbl and sting it wa goad into that degre of wrath which wa requisit to make it roar and commit ill and so fulfil the veng and malici design of the wick genii thi account determin me to take to my heel and without onc even look behind me i ran at full speed up into the hill while the porter ran equal fast although nearli in an opposit direct so that by these mean he final made hi escap with my bundl of which i have no doubt he took excel carealthough thi is a point i cannot determin as i do not rememb that i ever beheld him again for myself i wa so hotli pursu by a swarm of the menvermin who had come to the shore in boat that i wa veri soon overtaken bound hand and foot and convei to the beast which immedi swam out again into the middl of the sea i now bitterli repent my folli in quit a comfort home to peril my life in such adventur as thi but regret be useless i made the best of my condit and exert myself to secur the goodwil of the mananim that own the trumpet and who appear to exercis author over hi fellow i succeed so well in thi endeavor that in a few dai the creatur bestow upon me variou token of hi favor and in the end even went to the troubl of teach me the rudiment of what it wa vain enough to denomin it languag so that at length i wa enabl to convers with it readili and came to make it comprehend the ardent desir i had of see the world washish squashish squeak sinbad heydiddl diddl grunt unt grumbl hiss fiss whiss said he to me on dai after dinnerbut i beg a thousand pardon i had forgotten that your majesti is not convers with the dialect of the cockneigh so the mananim were call i presum becaus their languag form the connect link between that of the hors and that of the rooster with your permiss i will translat washish squashish and so forththat is to sai i am happi to find my dear sinbad that you ar realli a veri excel fellow we ar now about do a thing which is call circumnavig the globe and sinc you ar so desir of see the world i will strain a point and give you a free passag upon back of the beast when the ladi scheherazad had proceed thu far relat the isitsoornot the king turn over from hi left side to hi right and said it is in fact veri surpris my dear queen that you omit hitherto these latter adventur of sinbad do you know i think them exceedingli entertain and strang the king have thu express himself we ar told the fair scheherazad resum her histori in the follow word sinbad went on in thi manner with hi narr to the caliph i thank the mananim for it kind and soon found myself veri much at home on the beast which swam at a prodigi rate through the ocean although the surfac of the latter is in that part of the world by no mean flat but round like a pomegran so that we wentso to sayeith up hill or down hill all the time that i think wa veri singular interrupt the king nevertheless it is quit true repli scheherazad i have my doubt rejoin the king but prai be so good as to go on with the stori i will said the queen the beast continu sinbad to the caliph swam as i have relat up hill and down hill until at length we arriv at an island mani hundr of mile in circumfer but which nevertheless had been built in the middl of the sea by a coloni of littl thing like caterpillar hum said the king leav thi island said sinbadfor scheherazad it must be understood took no notic of her husband s illmann ejacul leav thi island we came to anoth where the forest were of solid stone and so hard that thei shiver to piec the finesttemp ax with which we endeavour to cut them down hum said the king again but scheherazad pai him no attent continu in the languag of sinbad pass beyond thi last island we reach a countri where there wa a cave that ran to the distanc of thirti or forti mile within the bowel of the earth and that contain a greater number of far more spaciou and more magnific palac than ar to be found in all damascu and bagdad from the roof of these palac there hung myriad of gem like diamond but larger than men and in among the street of tower and pyramid and templ there flow immens river as black as eboni and swarm with fish that had no ey hum said the king we then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofti mountain down whose side there stream torrent of melt metal some of which were twelv mile wide and sixti mile long while from an abyss on the summit issu so vast a quantiti of ash that the sun wa entir blot out from the heaven and it becam darker than the darkest midnight so that when we were even at the distanc of a hundr and fifti mile from the mountain it wa imposs to see the whitest object howev close we held it to our ey hum said the king after quit thi coast the beast continu hi voyag until we met with a land in which the natur of thing seem reversedfor we here saw a great lake at the bottom of which more than a hundr feet beneath the surfac of the water there flourish in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuri tree hoo said the king some hundr mile farther on brought us to a climat where the atmospher wa so dens as to sustain iron or steel just as our own doe feather fiddl de dee said the king proceed still in the same direct we present arriv at the most magnific region in the whole world through it there meander a gloriou river for sever thousand of mile thi river wa of unspeak depth and of a transpar richer than that of amber it wa from three to six mile in width and it bank which aros on either side to twelv hundr feet in perpendicular height were crown with everblossom tree and perpetu sweetscent flower that made the whole territori on gorgeou garden but the name of thi luxuri land wa the kingdom of horror and to enter it wa inevit death humph said the king we left thi kingdom in great hast and after some dai came to anoth where we were astonish to perceiv myriad of monstrou anim with horn resembl scyth upon their head these hideou beast dig for themselv vast cavern in the soil of a funnel shape and line the side of them with rock so dispos on upon the other that thei fall instantli when trodden upon by other anim thu precipit them into the monster s den where their blood is immedi suck and their carcass afterward hurl contemptu out to an immens distanc from the cavern of death pooh said the king continu our progress we perceiv a district with veget that grew not upon ani soil but in the air there were other that sprang from the substanc of other veget other that deriv their substanc from the bodi of live anim and then again there were other that glow all over with intens fire other that move from place to place at pleasur and what wa still more wonder we discov flower that live and breath and move their limb at will and had moreov the detest passion of mankind for enslav other creatur and confin them in horrid and solitari prison until the fulfil of appoint task pshaw said the king quit thi land we soon arriv at anoth in which the bee and the bird ar mathematician of such geniu and erudit that thei give daili instruct in the scienc of geometri to the wise men of the empir the king of the place have offer a reward for the solut of two veri difficult problem thei were solv upon the spotth on by the bee and the other by the bird but the king keep their solut a secret it wa onli after the most profound research and labor and the write of an infin of big book dure a long seri of year that the menmathematician at length arriv at the ident solut which had been given upon the spot by the bee and by the bird oh my said the king we had scarc lost sight of thi empir when we found ourselv close upon anoth from whose shore there flew over our head a flock of fowl a mile in breadth and two hundr and forti mile long so that although thei flew a mile dure everi minut it requir no less than four hour for the whole flock to pass over usin which there were sever million of million of fowl oh fy said the king no sooner had we got rid of these bird which occas us great annoy than we were terrifi by the appear of a fowl of anoth kind and infinit larger than even the roc which i met in my former voyag for it wa bigger than the biggest of the dome on your seraglio oh most munific of caliph thi terribl fowl had no head that we could perceiv but wa fashion entir of belli which wa of a prodigi fat and round of a softlook substanc smooth shine and stripe with variou color in it talon the monster wa bear awai to hi eyri in the heaven a hous from which it had knock off the roof and in the interior of which we distinctli saw human be who beyond doubt were in a state of fright despair at the horribl fate which await them we shout with all our might in the hope of frighten the bird into let go of it prei but it mere gave a snort or puff as if of rage and then let fall upon our head a heavi sack which prove to be fill with sand stuff said the king it wa just after thi adventur that we encount a contin of immens extent and prodigi solid but which nevertheless wa support entir upon the back of a skyblu cow that had no fewer than four hundr horn that now i believ said the king becaus i have read someth of the kind befor in a book we pass immedi beneath thi contin swim in between the leg of the cow and after some hour found ourselv in a wonder countri inde which i wa inform by the mananim wa hi own nativ land inhabit by thing of hi own speci thi elev the mananim veri much in my esteem and in fact i now began to feel asham of the contemptu familiar with which i had treat him for i found that the mananim in gener were a nation of the most power magician who live with worm in their brain which no doubt serv to stimul them by their pain writh and wriggl to the most miracul effort of imagin nonsens said the king among the magician were domest sever anim of veri singular kind for exampl there wa a huge hors whose bone were iron and whose blood wa boil water in place of corn he had black stone for hi usual food and yet in spite of so hard a diet he wa so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighti than the grandest templ in thi citi at a rate surpass that of the flight of most bird twattl said the king i saw also among these peopl a hen without feather but bigger than a camel instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick her blood like that of the hors to whom in fact she wa nearli relat wa boil water and like him she at noth but wood or black stone thi hen brought forth veri frequent a hundr chicken in the dai and after birth thei took up their resid for sever week within the stomach of their mother fa lal said the king on of thi nation of mighti conjuror creat a man out of brass and wood and leather and endow him with such ingenu that he would have beaten at chess all the race of mankind with the except of the great caliph haroun alraschid anoth of these magi construct of like materi a creatur that put to shame even the geniu of him who made it for so great were it reason power that in a second it perform calcul of so vast an extent that thei would have requir the unit labor of fifti thousand fleshi men for a year but a still more wonder conjuror fashion for himself a mighti thing that wa neither man nor beast but which had brain of lead intermix with a black matter like pitch and finger that it emploi with such incred speed and dexter that it would have had no troubl in write out twenti thousand copi of the koran in an hour and thi with so exquisit a precis that in all the copi there should not be found on to vari from anoth by the breadth of the finest hair thi thing wa of prodigi strength so that it erect or overthrew the mightiest empir at a breath but it power were exercis equal for evil and for

be quot for their detail although their effect is exceedingli feebl in convei an impress of the spectacl between lofoden and mosko he sai the depth of the water is between thirtysix and forti fathom

even absurd amid the thunder of the abyss you have had a good look at the whirl now said the old man and if you will creep round thi crag so as to get in it lee and deaden the roar of the water i will tell you a stori that will convinc you i ought to know someth of the moskoestr m i place myself as desir and he proceed myself and my two brother onc own a schoonerrig smack of about seventi ton burthen with which we were in the habit of fish among the island beyond mosko nearli to vurrgh in all violent eddi at sea there is good fish at proper opportun if on ha onli the courag to attempt it but among the whole of the lofoden coastmen we three were the onli on who made a regular busi of go out to the island as i tell you the usual ground ar a great wai lower down to the southward there fish can be got at all hour without much risk and therefor these place ar prefer the choic spot over here among the rock howev not onli yield the finest varieti but in far greater abund so that we often got in a singl dai what the more timid of the craft could not scrape togeth in a week in fact we made it a matter of desper speculationth risk of life stand instead of labor and courag answer for capit we kept the smack in a cove about five mile higher up the coast than thi and it wa our practic in fine weather to take advantag of the fifteen minut slack to push across the main channel of the moskoestr m far abov the pool and then drop down upon anchorag somewher near otterholm or sandflesen where the eddi ar not so violent as elsewher here we us to remain until nearli time for slackwat again when we weigh and made for home we never set out upon thi expedit without a steadi side wind for go and comingon that we felt sure would not fail us befor our returnand we seldom made a miscalcul upon thi point twice dure six year we were forc to stai all night at anchor on account of a dead calm which is a rare thing inde just about here and onc we had to remain on the ground nearli a week starv to death ow to a gale which blew up shortli after our arriv and made the channel too boister to be thought of upon thi occas we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everyth for the whirlpool threw us round and round so violent that at length we foul our anchor and drag it if it had not been that we drift into on of the innumer cross currentsher todai and gone tomorrowwhich drove us under the lee of flimen where by good luck we brought up i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulti we encount on the ground it is a bad spot to be in even in good weatherbut we made shift alwai to run the gauntlet of the moskoestr m itself without accid although at time my heart ha been in my mouth when we happen to be a minut or so behind or befor the slack the wind sometim wa not as strong as we thought it at start and then we made rather less wai than we could wish while the current render the smack unmanag my eldest brother had a son eighteen year old and i had two stout boi of my own these would have been of great assist at such time in us the sweep as well as afterward in fishingbut somehow although we ran the risk ourselv we had not the heart to let the young on get into the dangerfor after all is said and done it wa a horribl danger and that is the truth it is now within a few dai of three year sinc what i am go to tell you occur it wa on the tenth dai of juli a dai which the peopl of thi part of the world will never forgetfor it wa on in which blew the most terribl hurrican that ever came out of the heaven and yet all the morn and inde until late in the afternoon there wa a gentl and steadi breez from the southwest while the sun shone brightli so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what wa to follow the three of usmi two brother and myselfhad cross over to the island about two o clock p m and had soon nearli load the smack with fine fish which we all remark were more plenti that dai than we had ever known them it wa just seven by my watch when we weigh and start for home so as to make the worst of the str m at slack water which we knew would be at eight we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for some time spank along at a great rate never dream of danger for inde we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it all at onc we were taken aback by a breez from over helseggen thi wa most unusualsometh that had never happen to us beforeand i began to feel a littl uneasi without exactli know why we put the boat on the wind but could make no headwai at all for the eddi and i wa upon the point of propos to return to the anchorag when look astern we saw the whole horizon cover with a singular coppercolor cloud that rose with the most amaz veloc in the meantim the breez that had head us off fell awai and we were dead becalm drift about in everi direct thi state of thing howev did not last long enough to give us time to think about it in less than a minut the storm wa upon usin less than two the sky wa entir overcastand what with thi and the drive sprai it becam suddenli so dark that we could not see each other in the smack such a hurrican as then blew it is folli to attempt describ the oldest seaman in norwai never experienc ani thing like it we had let our sail go by the run befor it cleverli took us but at the first puff both our mast went by the board as if thei had been saw offth mainmast take with it my youngest brother who had lash himself to it for safeti our boat wa the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water it had a complet flush deck with onli a small hatch near the bow and thi hatch it had alwai been our custom to batten down when about to cross the str m by wai of precaut against the chop sea but for thi circumst we should have founder at oncefor we lai entir buri for some moment how my elder brother escap destruct i cannot sai for i never had an opportun of ascertain for my part as soon as i had let the foresail run i threw myself flat on deck with my feet against the narrow gunwal of the bow and with my hand grasp a ringbolt near the foot of the foremast it wa mere instinct that prompt me to do thiswhich wa undoubtedli the veri best thing i could have donefor i wa too much flurri to think for some moment we were complet delug as i sai and all thi time i held my breath and clung to the bolt when i could stand it no longer i rais myself upon my knee still keep hold with my hand and thu got my head clear present our littl boat gave herself a shake just as a dog doe in come out of the water and thu rid herself in some measur of the sea i wa now try to get the better of the stupor that had come over me and to collect my sens so as to see what wa to be done when i felt somebodi grasp my arm it wa my elder brother and my heart leap for joi for i had made sure that he wa overboardbut the next moment all thi joi wa turn into horrorfor he put hi mouth close to my ear and scream out the word moskoestr m no on ever will know what my feel were at that moment i shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the agu i knew what he meant by that on word well enoughi knew what he wish to make me understand with the wind that now drove us on we were bound for the whirl of the str m and noth could save us you perceiv that in cross the str m channel we alwai went a long wai up abov the whirl even in the calmest weather and then had to wait and watch carefulli for the slackbut now we were drive right upon the pool itself and in such a hurrican as thi to be sure i thought we shall get there just about the slackther is some littl hope in that but in the next moment i curs myself for be so great a fool as to dream of hope at all i knew veri well that we were doom had we been ten time a ninetygun ship by thi time the first furi of the tempest had spent itself or perhap we did not feel it so much as we scud befor it but at all event the sea which at first had been kept down by the wind and lai flat and froth now got up into absolut mountain a singular chang too had come over the heaven around in everi direct it wa still as black as pitch but nearli overhead there burst out all at onc a circular rift of clear skya clear as i ever sawand of a deep bright blueand through it there blaze forth the full moon with a lustr that i never befor knew her to wear she lit up everi thing about us with the greatest distinctnessbut oh god what a scene it wa to light up i now made on or two attempt to speak to my brotherbut in some manner which i could not understand the din had so increas that i could not make him hear a singl word although i scream at the top of my voic in hi ear present he shook hi head look as pale as death and held up on of hi finger as if to sai listen at first i could not make out what he meantbut soon a hideou thought flash upon me i drag my watch from it fob it wa not go i glanc at it face by the moonlight and then burst into tear as i flung it far awai into the ocean it had run down at seven o clock we were behind the time of the slack and the whirl of the str m wa in full furi when a boat is well built properli trim and not deep laden the wave in a strong gale when she is go larg seem alwai to slip from beneath herwhich appear veri strang to a landsmanand thi is what is call ride in sea phrase well so far we had ridden the swell veri cleverli but present a gigant sea happen to take us right under the counter and bore us with it as it roseupupa if into the sky i would not have believ that ani wave could rise so high and then down we came with a sweep a slide and a plung that made me feel sick and dizzi as if i wa fall from some lofti mountaintop in a dream but while we were up i had thrown a quick glanc aroundand that on glanc wa all suffici i saw our exact posit in an instant the moskoestr m whirlpool wa about a quarter of a mile dead aheadbut no more like the everydai moskoestr m than the whirl as you now see it is like a millrac if i had not known where we were and what we had to expect i should not have recognis the place at all as it wa i involuntarili close my ey in horror the lid clench themselv togeth as if in a spasm it could not have been more than two minut afterward until we suddenli felt the wave subsid and were envelop in foam the boat made a sharp half turn to larboard and then shot off in it new direct like a thunderbolt at the same moment the roar nois of the water wa complet drown in a kind of shrill shrieksuch a sound as you might imagin given out by the wastepip of mani thousand steamvessel let off their steam all togeth we were now in the belt of surf that alwai surround the whirl and i thought of cours that anoth moment would plung us into the abyssdown which we could onli see indistinctli on account of the amaz veloc with which we wore born along the boat did not seem to sink into the water at all but to skim like an airbubbl upon the surfac of the surg her starboard side wa next the whirl and on the larboard aros the world of ocean we had left it stood like a huge writh wall between us and the horizon it mai appear strang but now when we were in the veri jaw of the gulf i felt more compos than when we were onli approach it have made up my mind to hope no more i got rid of a great deal of that terror which unman me at first i suppos it wa despair that strung my nerv it mai look like boastingbut what i tell you is truthi began to reflect how magnific a thing it wa to die in such a manner and how foolish it wa in me to think of so paltri a consider as my own individu life in view of so wonder a manifest of god s power i do believ that i blush with shame when thi idea cross my mind after a littl while i becam possess with the keenest curios about the whirl itself i posit felt a wish to explor it depth even at the sacrific i wa go to make and my princip grief wa that i should never be abl to tell my old companion on shore about the mysteri i should see these no doubt were singular fanci to occupi a man s mind in such extremityand i have often thought sinc that the revolut of the boat around the pool might have render me a littl lighthead there wa anoth circumst which tend to restor my selfpossess and thi wa the cessat of the wind which could not reach us in our present situationfor as you saw yourself the belt of surf is consider lower than the gener bed of the ocean and thi latter now tower abov us a high black mountain ridg if you have never been at sea in a heavi gale you can form no idea of the confus of mind occas by the wind and sprai togeth thei blind deafen and strangl you and take awai all power of action or reflect but we were now in a great measur rid of these annoyancesjust as deathcondemn felon in prison ar allow petti indulg forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain how often we made the circuit of the belt it is imposs to sai we career round and round for perhap an hour fly rather than float get gradual more and more into the middl of the surg and then nearer and nearer to it horribl inner edg all thi time i had never let go of the ringbolt my brother wa at the stern hold on to a small empti watercask which had been secur lash under the coop of the counter and wa the onli thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us as we approach the brink of the pit he let go hi hold upon thi and made for the ring from which in the agoni of hi terror he endeavor to forc my hand as it wa not larg enough to afford us both a secur grasp i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt thi actalthough i knew he wa a madman when he did ita rave maniac through sheer fright i did not care howev to contest the point with him i knew it could make no differ whether either of us held on at all so i let him have the bolt and went astern to the cask thi there wa no great difficulti in do for the smack flew round steadili enough and upon an even keelonli swai to and fro with the immens sweep and swelter of the whirl scarc had i secur myself in my new posit when we gave a wild lurch to starboard and rush headlong into the abyss i mutter a hurri prayer to god and thought all wa over as i felt the sicken sweep of the descent i had instinct tighten my hold upon the barrel and close my ey for some second i dare not open themwhil i expect instant destruct and wonder that i wa not alreadi in my deathstruggl with the water but moment after moment elaps i still live the sens of fall had ceas and the motion of the vessel seem much as it had been befor while in the belt of foam with the except that she now lai more along i took courag and look onc again upon the scene never shall i forget the sensat of aw horror and admir with which i gaze about me the boat appear to be hang as if by magic midwai down upon the interior surfac of a funnel vast in circumfer prodigi in depth and whose perfectli smooth side might have been mistaken for eboni but for the bewild rapid with which thei spun around and for the gleam and ghastli radianc thei shot forth as the rai of the full moon from that circular rift amid the cloud which i have alreadi describ stream in a flood of golden glori along the black wall and far awai down into the inmost recess of the abyss at first i wa too much confus to observ anyth accur the gener burst of terrif grandeur wa all that i beheld when i recov myself a littl howev my gaze fell instinct downward in thi direct i wa abl to obtain an unobstruct view from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclin surfac of the pool she wa quit upon an even keelthat is to sai her deck lai in a plane parallel with that of the waterbut thi latter slope at an angl of more than fortyf degre so that we seem to be ly upon our beamend i could not help observ nevertheless that i had scarc more difficulti in maintain my hold and foot in thi situat than if we had been upon a dead level and thi i suppos wa ow to the speed at which we revolv the rai of the moon seem to search the veri bottom of the profound gulf but still i could make out noth distinctli on account of a thick mist in which everyth there wa envelop and over which there hung a magnific rainbow like that narrow and totter bridg which mussulmen sai is the onli pathwai between time and etern thi mist or sprai wa no doubt occas by the clash of the great wall of the funnel as thei all met togeth at the bottombut the yell that went up to the heaven from out of that mist i dare not attempt to describ our first slide into the abyss itself from the belt of foam abov had carri us a great distanc down the slope but our farther descent wa by no mean proportion round and round we sweptnot with ani uniform movementbut in dizzi swing and jerk that sent us sometim onli a few hundr yardssometim nearli the complet circuit of the whirl our progress downward at each revolut wa slow but veri percept look about me upon the wide wast of liquid eboni on which we were thu born i perceiv that our boat wa not the onli object in the embrac of the whirl both abov and below us were visibl fragment of vessel larg mass of build timber and trunk of tree with mani smaller articl such as piec of hous furnitur broken box barrel and stave i have alreadi describ the unnatur curios which had taken the place of my origin terror it appear to grow upon me as i drew nearer and nearer to my dread doom i now began to watch with a strang interest the numer thing that float in our compani i must have been deliriousfor i even sought amus in specul upon the rel veloc of their sever descent toward the foam below thi fir tree i found myself at on time sai will certainli be the next thing that take the aw plung and disappear and then i wa disappoint to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down befor at length after make sever guess of thi natur and be deceiv in allthi factth fact of my invari miscalculationset me upon a train of reflect that made my limb again trembl and my heart beat heavili onc more it wa not a new terror that thu affect me but the dawn of a more excit hope thi hope aros partli from memori and partli from present observ i call to mind the great varieti of buoyant matter that strew the coast of lofoden have been absorb and then thrown forth by the moskoestr m by far the greater number of the articl were shatter in the most extraordinari wayso chafe and roughen as to have the appear of be stuck full of splintersbut then i distinctli recollect that there were some of them which were not disfigur at all now i could not account for thi differ except by suppos that the roughen fragment were the onli on which had been complet absorbedthat the other had enter the whirl at so late a period of the tide or for some reason had descend so slowli after enter that thei did not reach the bottom befor the turn of the flood came or of the ebb as the case might be i conceiv it possibl in either instanc that thei might thu be whirl up again to the level of the ocean without undergo the fate of those which had been drawn in more earli or absorb more rapidli i made also three import observ the first wa that as a gener rule the larger the bodi were the more rapid their descentth second that between two mass of equal extent the on spheric and the other of ani other shape the superior in speed of descent wa with the sphereth third that between two mass of equal size the on cylindr and the other of ani other shape the cylind wa absorb the more slowli sinc my escap i have had sever convers on thi subject with an old schoolmast of the district and it wa from him that i learn the us of the word cylind and sphere he explain to mealthough i have forgotten the explanationhow what i observ wa in fact the natur consequ of the form of the float fragmentsand show me how it happen that a cylind swim in a vortex offer more resist to it suction and wa drawn in with greater difficulti than an equal bulki bodi of ani form whatev there wa on startl circumst which went a great wai in enforc these observ and render me anxiou to turn them to account and thi wa that at everi revolut we pass someth like a barrel or els the yard or the mast of a vessel while mani of these thing which had been on our level when i first open my ey upon the wonder of the whirlpool were now high up abov us and seem to have move but littl from their origin station i no longer hesit what to do i resolv to lash myself secur to the water cask upon which i now held to cut it loos from the counter and to throw myself with it into the water i attract my brother s attent by sign point to the float barrel that came near us and did everyth in my power to make him understand what i wa about to do i thought at length that he comprehend my designbut whether thi wa the case or not he shook hi head despairingli and refus to move from hi station by the ringbolt it wa imposs to reach him the emerg admit of no delai and so with a bitter struggl i resign him to hi fate fasten myself to the cask by mean of the lash which secur it to the counter and precipit myself with it into the sea without anoth moment s hesit the result wa precis what i had hope it might be as it is myself who now tell you thi talea you see that i did escapeand as you ar alreadi in possess of the mode in which thi escap wa effect and must therefor anticip all that i have farther to sayi will bring my stori quickli to conclus it might have been an hour or thereabout after my quit the smack when have descend to a vast distanc beneath me it made three or four wild gyrat in rapid success and bear my love brother with it plung headlong at onc and forev into the chao of foam below the barrel to which i wa attach sunk veri littl farther than half the distanc between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which i leap overboard befor a great chang took place in the charact of the whirlpool the slope of the side of the vast funnel becam moment less and less steep the gyrat of the whirl grew gradual less and less violent by degre the froth and the rainbow disappear and the bottom of the gulf seem slowli to upris the sky wa clear the wind had gone down and the full moon wa set radiantli in the west when i found myself on the surfac of the ocean in full view of the shore of lofoden and abov the spot where the pool of the moskoestr m had been it wa the hour of the slackbut the sea still heav in mountain wave from the effect of the hurrican i wa born violent into the channel of the str m and in a few minut wa hurri down the coast into the ground of

hurri remark in refer to von kempelen s discoveri i have ani design to look at the subject in a scientif point of view my object is simpli in the first place to sai a few word of von kempelen himself with whom some year ago i had the honor of a slight person acquaint sinc everi thing which concern him must necessarili at thi moment be of interest and in the second place to look in a gener wai and specul at the result of the discoveri it mai be as well howev to premis the cursori observ which i have to offer by deni veri decidedli what seem to be a gener impress glean as usual in a case of thi

chemist had not onli conceiv the idea now in question but had actual made no inconsider progress experiment in the veri ident analysi now so triumphantli brought to an issu by von kempelen who although he make not the slightest allus to it is without doubt i sai it unhesitatingli and can prove it if requir indebt to the diari for at least the first hint of hi own undertak the paragraph from the courier and enquir which is now go the round of the press and which purport to claim the invent for a mr kissam of brunswick main appear to me i confess a littl apocryph for sever reason although there is noth either imposs or veri improb in the statement made i need not go into detail my opinion of the paragraph is found princip upon it manner it doe not look true person who ar narrat fact ar

happen it that he took no step on the instant to reap the immens benefit which the merest bumpkin must have known would have result to him individu if not to the world at larg from the discoveri it seem to me quit incred that ani man of common understand could have discov what mr kissam sai he did and yet have subsequ act so like a babyso like an owla mr kissam admit that he did bythewai who is mr kissam and is not the whole paragraph in the courier and enquir a fabric got up to make a talk it must be confess that it ha an amazingli moonhoaxyair veri littl depend is to be place upon it in my

than ordinari dislik to quackeri but he wa morbidli afraid of appear empir so that howev fulli he might have been convinc that he wa on the right track in the matter now in question he would never have spoken out until he had everi thing readi for the most practic demonstr i verili believ that hi last moment would have been render wretch could he have suspect that hi wish in regard to burn thi diari full of crude specul would have been unattend to as it seem thei were i sai hi wish for that he meant to includ thi notebook among the miscellan paper direct to be burnt i think there can be no manner of doubt whether it escap the flame by good fortun or by bad yet remain to be seen that the passag quot abov with the other similar on refer to gave von kempelen the hint i do not in the slightest degre question but i repeat it yet remain to be seen whether thi moment discoveri itself moment under ani circumst will be of servic or disservic to mankind at larg that von kempelen and hi immedi friend will reap a rich harvest it would be folli to doubt for a moment thei will scarc be so weak as not to realiz in time by larg purchas of hous and land with other properti of intrins valu in the brief account of von kempelen which appear in the home journal and ha sinc been extens copi sever misapprehens of the german origin seem to have been made by the translat who profess to have taken the passag from a late number of the presburg schnellpost viel ha evid been misconceiv as it often is and what the translat render by sorrow is probabl lieden which in it true version suffer would give a total differ complexion to the whole account but of cours much of thi is mere guess on my part von kempelen howev is by no mean a misanthrop in appear at least whatev he mai be in fact my acquaint with him wa casual altogeth and i am scarc warrant in sai that i know him at all but to have seen and convers with a man of so prodigi a notorieti as he ha attain or will attain in a few dai is not a small matter as time go the literari world speak of him confid as a nativ of presburg misl perhap by the account in the home journal but i am pleas in be abl to state posit sinc i have it from hi own lip that he wa born in utica in the state of new york although both hi parent i believ ar of presburg descent the famili is connect in some wai with maelzel of automatonchessplay memori in person he is short and stout with larg fat blue ey sandi hair and whisker a wide but pleas mouth fine teeth and i think a roman nose there is some defect in on of hi feet hi address is frank and hi whole manner notic for bonhomi altogeth he look speak and act as littl like a misanthrop as ani man i ever saw we were fellowsojourn for a week about six year ago at earl s hotel in provid rhode island and i presum that i convers with him at variou time for some three or four hour altogeth hi princip topic were those of the dai and noth that fell from him led me to suspect hi scientif attain he left the hotel befor me intend to go to new york and thenc to bremen it wa in the latter citi that hi great discoveri wa first made public or rather it wa there that he wa first suspect of have made it thi is about all that i person know of the now immort von kempelen but i have thought that even these few detail would have interest for the public there can be littl question that most of the marvel rumor afloat about thi affair ar pure invent entitl to about as much credit as the stori of aladdin s lamp and yet in a case of thi kind as in the case of the discoveri in california it is clear that the truth mai be stranger than fiction the follow anecdot at least is so well authent that we mai receiv it implicitli von kempelen had never been even toler well off dure hi resid at bremen and often it wa well known he had been put to extrem shift in order to rais trifl sum when the great excit occur about the forgeri on the hous of gutsmuth co suspicion wa direct toward von kempelen on account of hi have purchas a consider properti in gasperitch lane and hi refus when question to explain how he becam possess of the purchas monei he wa at length arrest but noth decis appear against him wa in the end set at liberti the polic howev kept a strict watch upon hi movement and thu discov that he left home frequent take alwai the same road and invari give hi watcher the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crook passag known by the flash name of the dondergat final by dint of great persever thei trace him to a garret in an old hous of seven stori in an allei call flatzplatzand come upon him suddenli found him as thei imagin in the midst of hi counterfeit oper hi agit is repres as so excess that the offic had not the slightest doubt of hi guilt after handcuf him thei search hi room or rather room for it appear he occupi all the mansard open into the garret where thei caught him wa a closet ten feet by eight fit up with some chemic apparatu of which the object ha not yet been ascertain in on corner of the closet wa a veri small furnac with a glow fire in it and on the fire a kind of duplic crucibletwo crucibl connect by a tube on of these crucibl wa nearli full of lead in a state of fusion but not reach up to the apertur of the tube which wa close to the brim the other crucibl had some liquid in it which as the offic enter seem to be furious dissip in vapor thei relat that on find himself taken kempelen seiz the crucibl with both hand which were encas in glove that afterward turn out to be asbest and threw the content on the tile floor it wa now that thei handcuf him and befor proceed to ransack the premis thei search hi person but noth unusu wa found about him except a paper parcel in hi coatpocket contain what wa afterward ascertain to be a mixtur of antimoni and some unknown substanc in nearli but not quit equal proport all attempt at analyz the unknown substanc have so far fail but that it will ultim be analyz is not to be doubt pass out of the closet with their prison the offic went through a sort of antechamb in which noth materi wa found to the chemist s sleepingroom thei here rummag some drawer and box but discov onli a few paper of no import and some good coin silver and gold at length look under the bed thei saw a larg common hair trunk without hing hasp or lock and with the top ly carelessli across the bottom portion upon attempt to draw thi trunk out from under the bed thei found that with their unit strength there were three of them all power men thei could not stir it on inch much astonish at thi on of them crawl under the bed and look into the trunk said no wonder we couldn t move itwhi it s full to the brim of old bit of brass put hi feet now against the wall so as to get a good purchas and push with all hi forc while hi companion pull with all their the trunk with much difficulti wa slid out from under the bed and it content examin the suppos brass with which it wa fill wa all in small smooth piec vari from the size of a pea to that of a dollar but the piec were irregular in shape although more or less flatlook upon the whole veri much as lead look when thrown upon the ground in a molten state and there suffer to grow cool now not on of these offic for a moment suspect thi metal to be ani thing but brass the idea of it be gold never enter their brain of cours how could such a wild fanci have enter it and their astonish mai be well conceiv when the next dai it becam known all over bremen that the lot of brass which thei had cart so contemptu to the polic offic without put themselv to the troubl of pocket the smallest scrap wa not onli goldreal goldbut gold far finer than ani emploi in coinagegold in fact absolut pure virgin without the slightest appreci alloi i need not go over the detail of von kempelen s confess as far as it went and releas for these ar familiar to the public that he ha actual realiz in spirit and in effect if not to the letter the old chimaera of the philosoph s stone no sane person is at liberti to doubt the opinion of arago ar of cours entitl to the greatest consider but he is by no mean infal and what he sai of bismuth in hi report to the academi must be taken cum grano sali the simpl truth is that up to thi period all analysi ha fail and until von kempelen choos to let us have the kei to hi own publish enigma it is more than probabl that the matter will remain for year in statu quo all that as yet can fairli be said to be known is that pure gold can be made at will and veri readili from lead in connect with certain other substanc in kind and in proport unknown specul of cours is busi as to the immedi and ultim result of thi discoverya discoveri which few think person will hesit in refer to an increas interest in the matter of gold gener by the late develop in california and thi reflect bring us inevit to anotherth exceed inopportun of von kempelen s analysi if mani were prevent from adventur to california by the mere apprehens that gold would so materi diminish in valu on account of it plenti in the mine there as to render the specul of go so far in search of it a doubt onewhat impress will be wrought now upon the mind of those about to emigr and especi upon the mind of those actual in the miner region by the announc of thi astound discoveri of von kempelen a discoveri which declar in so mani word that beyond it intrins worth for manufactur purpos whatev that worth mai be gold now is or at least soon will be for it cannot be suppos that von kempelen can long retain hi secret of no greater valu than lead and of far inferior valu to silver it is inde exceedingli difficult to specul prospect upon the consequ of the discoveri but on thing mai be posit maintainedthat the announc of the discoveri six month ago would have had materi influenc in regard to the settlement of california in europ as yet the most notic result have been a rise of two hundr per cent in the price of lead and nearli twentyf per cent that of silver mesmer revel whatev doubt mai still envelop the rational of mesmer it startl fact ar now almost univers admit of these latter those who doubt ar your mere doubter by professionan unprofit and disreput tribe there can be no more absolut wast of time than the attempt to prove at the present dai that man by mere exercis of will can so impress hi fellow as to cast him into an abnorm condit of which the phenomena resembl veri close those of death or at least resembl them more nearli than thei do the phenomena of ani other normal condit within our cogniz that while in thi state the person so impress emploi onli with effort and then feebli the extern organ of sens yet perceiv with keenli refin percept and through channel suppos unknown matter beyond the scope of the physic organ that moreov hi intellectu faculti ar wonderfulli exalt and invigor that hi sympathi with the person so impress him ar profound and final that hi suscept to the impress increas with it frequenc while in the same proport the peculiar phenomena elicit ar more extend and more pronounc i sai that thesewhich ar the law of mesmer in it gener featuresit would be supererog to demonstr nor shall i inflict upon my reader so needless a demonstr todai my purpos at present is a veri differ on inde i am impel even in the teeth of a world of prejudic to detail without comment the veri remark substanc of a colloqui occur between a sleepwak and myself i had been long in the habit of mesmer the person in question mr vankirk and the usual acut suscept and exalt of the mesmer percept had superven for mani month he had been labor under confirm phthisi the more distress effect of which had been reliev by my manipul and on the night of wednesdai the fifteenth instant i wa summon to hi bedsid the invalid wa suffer with acut pain in the region of the heart and breath with great difficulti have all the ordinari symptom of asthma in spasm such as these he had usual found relief from the applic of mustard to the nervou centr but tonight thi had been attempt in vain as i enter hi room he greet me with a cheer smile and although evid in much bodili pain appear to be mental quit at eas i sent for you tonight he said not so much to administ to my bodili ailment as to satisfi me concern certain psychal impress which of late have occas me much anxieti and surpris i need not tell you how sceptic i have hitherto been on the topic of the soul s immort i cannot deni that there ha alwai exist as if in that veri soul which i have been deni a vagu halfsenti of it own exist but thi halfsenti at no time amount to convict with it my reason had noth to do all attempt at logic inquiri result inde in leav me more sceptic than befor i had been advis to studi cousin i studi him in hi own work as well as in those of hi european and american echo the charl elwood of mr brownson for exampl wa place in my hand i read it with profound attent throughout i found it logic but the portion which were not mere logic were unhappili the initi argument of the disbeliev hero of the book in hi sum up it seem evid to me that the reason had not even succeed in convinc himself hi end had plainli forgotten hi begin like the govern of trinculo in short i wa not long in perceiv that if man is to be intellectu convinc of hi own immort he will never be so convinc by the mere abstract which have been so long the fashion of the moralist of england of franc and of germani abstract mai amus and exercis but take no hold on the mind here upon earth at least philosophi i am persuad will alwai in vain call upon us to look upon qualiti as thing the will mai assentth soulth intellect never i repeat then that i onli half felt and never intellectu believ but latterli there ha been a certain deepen of the feel until it ha come so nearli to resembl the acquiesc of reason that i find it difficult to distinguish between the two i am enabl too plainli to trace thi effect to the mesmer influenc i cannot better explain my mean than by the hypothesi that the mesmer exalt enabl me to perceiv a train of ratiocin which in my abnorm exist convinc but which in full accord with the mesmer phenomena doe not extend except through it effect into my normal condit in sleepwak the reason and it conclusionth caus and it effectar present togeth in my natur state the caus vanish the effect onli and perhap onli partial remain these consider have led me to think that some good result might ensu from a seri of welldirect question propound to me while mesmer you have often observ the profound selfcogniz evinc by the sleepwakerth extens knowledg he displai upon all point relat to the mesmer condit itself and from thi selfcogniz mai be deduc hint for the proper conduct of a catech i consent of cours to make thi experi a few pass threw mr vankirk into the mesmer sleep hi breath becam immedi more easi and he seem to suffer no physic uneasi the follow convers then ensuedv in the dialogu repres the patient and p myself p ar you asleep v yesno i would rather sleep more soundli p after a few more pass do you sleep now v ye p how do you think your present ill will result v after a long hesit and speak as if with effort i must die p doe the idea of death afflict you v veri quickli nono p ar you pleas with the prospect v if i were awak i should like to die but now it is no matter the mesmer condit is so near death as to content me p i wish you would explain yourself mr vankirk v i am will to do so but it requir more effort than i feel abl to make you do not question me properli p what then shall i ask v you must begin at the begin p the begin but where is the begin v you know that the begin is god thi wa said in a low fluctuat tone and with everi sign of the most profound vener p what then is god v hesit for mani minut i cannot tell p is not god spirit v while i wa awak i knew what you meant by spirit but now it seem onli a wordsuch for instanc as truth beautya qualiti i mean p is not god immateri v there is no immaterialityit is a mere word that which is not matter is not at allunless qualiti ar thing p is god then materi v no thi repli startl me veri much p what then is he v after a long paus and mutteringli i seebut it is a thing difficult to tell anoth long paus he is not spirit for he exist nor is he matter as you understand it but there ar gradat of matter of which man know noth the grosser impel the finer the finer pervad the grosser the atmospher for exampl impel the electr principl while the electr principl permeat the atmospher these gradat of matter increas in rariti or fine until we arriv at a matter unparticledwithout particlesindivisibleon and here the law of impuls and permeat is modifi the ultim or unparticl matter not onli permeat all thing but impel all thingsand thu is all thing within itself thi matter is god what men attempt to embodi in the word thought is thi matter in motion p the metaphysician maintain that all action is reduc to motion and think and that the latter is the origin of the former v ye and i now see the confus of idea motion is the action of mindnot of think the unparticl matter or god in quiescenc is as nearli as we can conceiv it what men call mind and the power of selfmov equival in effect to human volit is in the unparticl matter the result of it uniti and omnipreval how i know not and now clearli see that i shall never know but the unparticl matter set in motion by a law or qualiti exist within itself is think p can you give me no more precis idea of what you term the unparticl matter v the matter of which man is cogniz escap the sens in gradat we have for exampl a metal a piec of wood a drop of water the atmospher a ga calor electr the luminifer ether now we call all these thing matter and embrac all matter in on gener definit but in spite of thi there can be no two idea more essenti distinct than that which we attach to a metal and that which we attach to the luminifer ether when we reach the latter we feel an almost irresist inclin to class it with spirit or with nihil the onli consider which restrain us is our concept of it atom constitut and here even we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom as someth possess in infinit minut solid palpabl weight destroi the idea of the atom constitut and we should no longer be abl to regard the ether as an entiti or at least as matter for want of a better word we might term it spirit take now a step beyond the luminifer etherconc a matter as much more rare than the ether as thi ether is more rare than the metal and we arriv at onc in spite of all the school dogma at a uniqu massan unparticl matter for although we mai admit infinit littl in the atom themselv the infinitud of littl in the space between them is an absurd there will be a pointther will be a degre of rariti at which if the atom ar suffici numer the interspac must vanish and the mass absolut coalesc but the consider of the atom constitut be now taken awai the natur of the mass inevit glide into what we conceiv of spirit it is clear howev that it is as fulli matter as befor the truth is it is imposs to conceiv spirit sinc it is imposs to imagin what is not when we flatter ourselv that we have form it concept we have mere deceiv our understand by the consider of infinit rarifi matter p there seem to me an insurmount object to the idea of absolut coalescenceand that is the veri slight resist experienc by the heavenli bodi in their revolut through spacea resist now ascertain it is true to exist in some degre but which is nevertheless so slight as to have been quit overlook by the sagac even of newton we know that the resist of bodi is chiefli in proport to their densiti absolut coalesc is absolut densiti where there ar no interspac there can be no yield an ether absolut dens would put an infinit more effectu stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adam or of iron v your object is answer with an eas which is nearli in the ratio of it appar unanswerabilitya regard the progress of the star it can make no differ whether the star pass through the ether or the ether through it there is no astronom error more unaccount than that which reconcil the known retard of the comet with the idea of their passag through an ether for howev rare thi ether be suppos it would put a stop to all sider revolut in a veri far briefer period than ha been admit by those astronom who have endeavor to slur over a point which thei found it imposs to comprehend the retard actual experienc is on the other hand about that which might be expect from the friction of the ether in the instantan passag through the orb in the on case the retard forc is momentari and complet within itselfin the other it is endlessli accumul p but in all thisin thi identif of mere matter with godi there noth of irrever i wa forc to repeat thi question befor the sleepwak fulli comprehend my mean v can you sai why matter should be less reverenc than mind but you forget that the matter of which i speak is in all respect the veri mind or spirit of the school so far as regard it high capac and is moreov the matter of these school at the same time god with all the power attribut to spirit is but the perfect of matter p you assert then that the unparticl matter in motion is thought v in gener thi motion is the univers thought of the univers mind thi thought creat all creat thing ar but the thought of god p you sai in gener v ye the univers mind is god for new individu matter is necessari p but you now speak of mind and matter as do the metaphysician v yesto avoid confus when i sai mind i mean the unparticl or ultim matter by matter i intend all els p you were sai that for new individu matter is necessari v ye for mind exist unincorpor is mere god to creat individu think be it wa necessari to incarn portion of the divin mind thu man is individu divest of corpor investitur he were god now the particular motion of the incarn portion of the unparticl matter is the thought of man as the motion of the whole is that of god p you sai that divest of the bodi man will be god v after much hesit i could not have said thi it is an absurd p refer to my note you did sai that divest of corpor investitur man were god v and thi is true man thu divest would be godwould be unindividu but he can never be thu divestedat least never will beels we must imagin an action of god return upon itselfa purposeless and futil action man is a creatur creatur ar thought of god it is the natur of thought to be irrevoc p i do not comprehend you sai that man will never put off the bodi v i sai that he will never be bodiless p explain v there ar two bodiesth rudiment and the complet correspond with the two condit of the worm and the butterfli what we call death is but the pain metamorphosi our present incarn is progress preparatori temporari our futur is perfect ultim immort the ultim life is the full design p but of the worm s metamorphosi we ar palpabl cogniz v we certainlybut not the worm the matter of which our rudiment bodi is compos is within the ken of the organ of that bodi or more distinctli our rudiment organ ar adapt to the matter of which is form the rudiment bodi but not to that of which the ultim is compos the ultim bodi thu escap our rudiment sens and we perceiv onli the shell which fall in decai from the inner form not that inner form itself but thi inner form as well as the shell is appreci by those who have alreadi acquir the ultim life p you have often said that the mesmer state veri nearli resembl death how is thi v when i sai that it resembl death i mean that it resembl the ultim life for when i am entranc the sens of my rudiment life ar in abey and i perceiv extern thing directli without organ through a medium which i shall emploi in the ultim unorgan life p unorgan v ye organ ar contriv by which the individu is brought into sensibl relat with particular class and form of matter to the exclus of other class and form the organ of man ar adapt to hi rudiment condit and to that onli hi ultim condit be unorgan is of unlimit comprehens in all point but oneth natur of the volit of godthat is to sai the motion of the unparticl matter you will have a distinct idea of the ultim bodi by conceiv it to be entir brain thi it is not but a concept of thi natur will bring you near a comprehens of what it is a lumin bodi impart vibrat to the luminifer ether the vibrat gener similar on within the retina these again commun similar on to the optic nerv the nerv convei similar on to the brain the brain also similar on to the unparticl matter which permeat it the motion of thi latter is thought of which percept is the first undul thi is the mode by which the mind of the rudiment life commun with the extern world and thi extern world is to the rudiment life limit through the idiosyncrasi of it organ but in the ultim unorgan life the extern world reach the whole bodi which is of a substanc have affin to brain as i have said with no other intervent than that of an infinit rarer ether than even the luminifer and to thi etherin unison with itth whole bodi vibrat set in motion the unparticl matter which permeat it it is to the absenc of idiosyncrat organ therefor that we must attribut the nearli unlimit percept of the ultim life to rudiment be organ ar the cage necessari to confin them until fledg p you speak of rudiment be ar there other rudiment think be than man v the multitudin conglomer of rare matter into nebul planet sun and other bodi which ar neither nebul sun nor planet is for the sole purpos of suppli pabulum for the idiosyncrasi of the organ of an infin of rudiment be but for the necess of the rudiment prior to the ultim life there would have been no bodi such as these each of these is tenant by a distinct varieti of organ rudiment think creatur in all the organ vari with the featur of the

seem the sole palpabl and for the accommod of which we blindli deem space createdbut that space itselfthat infin of which the truli substant vast swallow up the starshadowsblot them out as nonent from the percept of the angel p you sai that but for the necess of the rudiment life there would have been no star but why thi necess v in the inorgan life as well as in the inorgan matter gener there is noth to imped the action of on simpl uniqu lawth divin volit with the view of produc impedi the organ life and matter complex substanti and lawencumb were contriv p but againwhi need thi impedi have

organ life and matter the violat of law is render to a certain extent practic thu pain which in the inorgan life is imposs is possibl in the organ p but to what good end is pain thu render possibl v all thing ar either good or bad by comparison a suffici analysi will show that pleasur in all case is but the contrast of pain posit pleasur is a mere idea to be happi at ani on point we must have suffer at the same never to suffer would have been never to have been bless but it ha been shown that in the inorgan life pain cannot be thu the necess for the organ the pain of the primit life of earth is the sole basi of the bliss of the ultim life in heaven p still there is on of your express which i find it imposs to comprehend the truli substant vast of infin v thi probabl is becaus you have no suffici gener concept of the term substanc itself we must not regard it as a qualiti but as a sentimentit is the percept in think be of the adapt of matter to their organ there ar mani thing

alarm me and induc me to awak him at onc no sooner had i done thi than with a bright smile irradi all hi featur he fell back upon hi pillow and expir i notic that in less than a minut afterward hi

ha excit discuss it would have been a miracl had it notespeci under the circumst through the desir of all parti concern to keep the affair from the public at least for the present or until we had farther opportun for investigationthrough our endeavor to effect thisa garbl or exagger account made it wai into societi and becam the sourc of mani unpleas misrepresent and veri natur of a great deal of disbelief it is now render necessari that i give the factsa far as i comprehend them myself thei ar succinctli these my attent for the last three year had been repeatedli drawn to the subject of mesmer and about nine month ago it occur to me quit suddenli that in the seri of experi made hitherto there had been a veri remark and most unaccount omissionno person had as yet been mesmer in articulo morti it remain to be seen first whether in such condit there exist in the patient ani suscept to the magnet influenc secondli whether if ani exist it wa impair or increas by the condit thirdli to what extent or for how long a period the encroach of death might be arrest by the process there were other point to be ascertain but these most excit my curiosityth last in especi from the immens import charact of it consequ in look around me for some subject by whose mean i might test these particular i wa brought to think of my friend m ernest valdemar the wellknown compil of the bibliotheca forensica and author under the nom de plume of issachar marx of the polish version of wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar who ha resid princip at harlaem ny sinc the year is or wa particularli notic for the extrem spare of hi personhi lower limb much resembl those of john randolph and also for the white of hi whisker in violent contrast to the black of hi hairth latter in consequ be veri gener mistaken for a wig hi tempera wa markedli nervou and render him a good subject for mesmer experi on two or three occas i had put him to sleep with littl difficulti but wa disappoint in other result which hi peculiar constitut had natur led me to anticip hi will wa at no period posit or thoroughli under my control and in regard to clairvoy i could accomplish with him noth to be reli upon i alwai attribut my failur at these point to the disord state of hi health for some month previou to my becom acquaint with him hi physician had declar him in a confirm phthisi it wa hi custom inde to speak calmli of hi approach dissolut as of a matter neither to be avoid nor regret when the idea to which i have allud first occur to me it wa of cours veri natur that i should think of m valdemar i knew the steadi philosophi of the man too well to apprehend ani scrupl from him and he had no rel in america who would be like to interfer i spoke to him frankli upon the subject and to my surpris hi interest seem vividli excit i sai to my surpris for although he had alwai yield hi person freeli to my experi he had never befor given me ani token of sympathi with what i did hi diseas wa of that charact which would admit of exact calcul in respect to the epoch of it termin in death and it wa final arrang between us that he would send for me about twentyfour hour befor the period announc by hi physician as that of hi deceas it is now rather more than seven month sinc i receiv from m valdemar himself the subjoin note my dear p you mai as well come now d and f ar agre that i cannot hold out beyond tomorrow midnight and i think thei have hit the time veri nearli valdemar i receiv thi note within half an hour after it wa written and in fifteen minut more i wa in the dy man s chamber i had not seen him for ten dai and wa appal by the fear alter which the brief interv had wrought in him hi face wore a leaden hue the ey were utterli lustreless and the emaci wa so extrem that the skin had been broken through by the cheekbon hi expector wa excess the puls wa bare percept he retain nevertheless in a veri remark manner both hi mental power and a certain degre of physic strength he spoke with distinctnesstook some palli medicin without aidand when i enter the room wa occupi in pencil memoranda in a pocketbook he wa prop up in the bed by pillow doctor d and f were in attend after press valdemar s hand i took these gentlemen asid and obtain from them a minut account of the patient s condit the left lung had been for eighteen month in a semioss or cartilagin state and wa of cours entir useless for all purpos of vital the right in it upper portion wa also partial if not thoroughli ossifi while the lower region wa mere a mass of purul tubercl run on into anoth sever extens perfor exist and at on point perman adhes to the rib had taken place these appear in the right lobe were of compar recent date the ossif had proceed with veri unusu rapid no sign of it had been discov a month befor and the adhes had onli been observ dure the three previou dai independ of the phthisi the patient wa suspect of aneur of the aorta but on thi point the osseou symptom

tongu i presum that no member of the parti then present had been unaccustom to deathb horror but so hideou beyond concept wa the appear of m valdemar at thi moment that there wa a gener shrink back from the region of the bed i now feel that i have reach a point of thi narr at which everi reader will be startl into posit disbelief it is my busi howev simpli to proce there wa no longer the faintest sign of vital in m valdemar and conclud him to be dead we were consign him to the charg of the nurs when a strong vibratori motion wa observ in the tongu thi continu for perhap a minut at the expir of thi period there issu from the distend and motionless jaw a voicesuch as it would be mad in me to attempt describ there ar inde two or three epithet which might be consid as applic to it in

himself we address ourselv again to an investig of m valdemar s condit it remain in all respect as i have last describ it with the except that the mirror no longer afford evid of respir an attempt to draw blood from the arm fail i should mention too that thi limb wa no farther subject to my will i endeavor in vain to make it follow the direct of my hand the onli real indic inde of the mesmer influenc wa now found in the vibratori movement of the tongu whenev i address m valdemar a question he seem to be make an effort to repli but had no longer suffici volit to queri put to him by ani other person than myself he seem utterli insensiblealthough i endeavor to place each member of the compani in mesmer rapport with him i believ that i have now relat all that is necessari to an understand of the sleepwak s state at thi epoch other nurs were procur and at ten o clock i left the hous in compani with the two physician and mr ll in the afternoon we all call again to see the patient hi condit remain precis the same we had now some discuss as to the proprieti and feasibl of awaken him but we had littl difficulti in agre that no good purpos would be serv by so do it wa evid that so far death or what is usual term death had been arrest by the mesmer process it seem clear to us all that to awaken m valdemar would be mere to insur hi instant or at least hi speedi dissolut

progress and termin of the diseas were the incid of half an hour but the princ prospero wa happi and dauntless and sagaci when hi dominion were half depopul he summon to hi presenc a thousand hale and lightheart friend from among the knight and dame of hi court and with these retir to the deep seclus of on of hi castel abbei thi wa an extens and magnific structur the creation of the princ s own eccentr yet august tast a strong and lofti wall girdl it in thi wall had gate of iron the courtier have enter brought furnac and massi hammer and weld the bolt thei resolv to leav mean neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impuls of despair or of frenzi from within the abbei wa ampli provis with such precaut the courtier might bid defianc to contagion the extern world could take care of itself in the meantim it wa folli to griev or to think the princ had provid all the applianc of pleasur there were buffoon there were improvisatori there were balletdanc there were musician there wa beauti there wa wine all these and secur were within without wa the red death it wa toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of hi seclus and while the pestil rage most furious abroad that the princ prospero entertain hi thousand friend at a mask ball of the most unusu magnific it wa a voluptu scene that masquerad but first let me tell of the room in which it wa held there were sevenan imperi suit in mani palac howev such suit form a long and straight vista while the fold door slide back nearli to the wall on either hand so that the view of the whole extent is scarc imped here the case wa veri differ as might have been expect from the duke s love of the bizarr the apart were so irregularli dispos that the vision embrac but littl more than on at a time there wa a sharp turn at everi twenti or thirti yard and at each turn a novel effect to the right and left in the middl of each wall a tall and narrow gothic window look out upon a close corridor which pursu the wind of the suit these window were of stain glass whose color vari in accord with the prevail hue of the decor of the chamber into which it open that at the eastern extrem wa hung for exampl in blueand vividli blue were it window the second chamber wa purpl in it ornament and tapestri and here the pane were purpl the third wa green throughout and so were the casement the fourth wa furnish and light with orangeth fifth with whiteth sixth with violet the seventh apart wa close shroud in black velvet tapestri that hung all over the ceil and down the wall fall in heavi fold upon a carpet of the same materi and hue but in thi chamber onli the color of the window fail to correspond with the decor the pane here were scarleta deep blood color now in no on of the seven apart wa there ani lamp or candelabrum amid the profus of golden ornament that lai scatter to and fro or depend from the roof there wa no light of ani kind eman from lamp or candl within the suit of chamber but in the corridor that follow the suit there stood opposit to each window a heavi tripod bear a brazier of fire that project it rai through the tint glass and so glaringli illumin the room and thu were produc a multitud of gaudi and fantast appear but in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that stream upon the dark hang through the bloodtint pane wa ghastli in the extrem and produc so wild a look upon the counten of those who enter that there were few of the compani bold enough to set foot within it precinct at all it wa in thi apart also that there stood against the western wall a gigant clock of eboni it pendulum swung to and fro with a dull heavi monoton clang and when the minutehand made the circuit of the face and the hour wa to be stricken there came from the brazen lung of the clock a sound which wa clear and loud and deep and exceedingli music but of so peculiar a note and emphasi that at each laps of an hour the musician of the orchestra were constrain to paus momentarili in their perform to hearken to the sound and thu the waltzer perforc ceas their evolut and there wa a brief disconcert of the whole gai compani and while the chime of the clock yet rang it wa observ that the giddiest grew pale and the more ag and sedat pass their hand over their brow as if in confus reveri or medit but when the echo had fulli ceas a light laughter at onc pervad the assembl the musician look at each other and smile as if at their own nervous and folli and made whisper vow each to the other that the next chime of the clock should produc in them no similar emot and then after the laps of sixti minut which embrac three thousand and six hundr second of the time that fli there came yet anoth chime of the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremul and medit as befor but in spite of these thing it wa a gai and magnific revel the tast of the duke were peculiar he had a fine ey for color and effect he disregard the decora of mere fashion hi plan were bold and fieri and hi concept glow with barbar lustr there ar some who would have thought him mad hi follow felt that he wa not it wa necessari to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he wa not he had direct in great part the moveabl embellish of the seven chamber upon occas of thi great fete and it wa hi own guid tast which had given charact to the masquerad be sure thei were grotesqu there were much glare and glitter and piquanc and phantasmmuch of what ha been sinc seen in hernani there were arabesqu figur with unsuit limb and appoint there were deliri fanci such as the madman fashion there wa much of the beauti much of the wanton much of the bizarr someth of the terribl and not a littl of that which might have excit disgust to and fro in the seven chamber there stalk in fact a multitud of dream and theseth dreamswrith in and about take hue from the room and caus the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their step and anon there strike the eboni clock which stand in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment all is still and all is silent save the voic of the clock the dream ar stifffrozen as thei stand but the echo of the chime die awaythei have endur but an instantand a light halfsubdu laughter float after them as thei depart and now again the music swell and the dream live and writh to and fro more merrili than ever take hue from the manytint window through which stream the rai from the tripod but to the chamber which li most westwardli of the seven there ar now none of the masker who ventur for the night is wane awai and there flow a ruddier light through the bloodcolor pane and the black of the sabl draperi appal and to him whose foot fall upon the sabl carpet there come from the near clock of eboni a muffl peal more solemnli emphat than ani which reach their ear who indulg in the more remot gaieti of the other apart but these other apart were dens crowd and in them beat feverishli the heart of life and the revel went whirlingli on until at length there commenc the sound of midnight upon the clock and then the music ceas as i have told and the evolut of the waltzer were quiet and there wa an uneasi cessat of all thing as befor but now there were twelv stroke to be sound by the bell of the clock and thu it happen perhap that more of thought crept with more of time into the medit of the thought among those who revel and thu too it happen perhap that befor the last echo of the last chime had utterli sunk into silenc there were mani individu in the crowd who had found leisur to becom awar of the presenc of a mask figur which had arrest the attent of no singl individu befor and the rumor of thi new presenc have spread itself whisperingli around there aros at length from the whole compani a buzz or murmur express of disapprob and surprisethen final of terror of horror and of disgust in an assembl of phantasm such as i have paint it mai well be suppos that no ordinari appear could have excit such sensat in truth the masquerad licens of the night wa nearli unlimit but the figur in question had outherod herod and gone beyond the bound of even the princ s indefinit decorum there ar chord in the heart of the most reckless which cannot be touch without emot even with the utterli lost to whom life and death ar equal jest there ar matter of which no jest can be made the whole compani inde seem now deepli to feel that in the costum and bear of the stranger neither wit nor proprieti exist the figur wa tall and gaunt and shroud from head to foot in the habili of the grave the mask which conceal the visag wa made so nearli to resembl the counten of a stiffen corps that the closest scrutini must have had difficulti in detect the cheat and yet all thi might have been endur if not approv by the mad revel around but the mummer had gone so far as to assum the type of the red death hi vestur wa dabbl in bloodand hi broad brow with all the featur of the face wa besprinkl with the scarlet horror when the ey of princ prospero fell upon thi spectral imag which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fulli to sustain it role stalk to and fro among the waltzer he wa seen to be convuls in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distast but in the next hi brow redden with rage who dare he demand hoars of the courtier who stood near him who dare insult us with thi blasphem mockeri seiz him and unmask himthat we mai know whom we have to hang at sunris from the battlement it wa in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the princ prospero as he utter these word thei rang throughout the seven room loudli and clearlyfor the princ wa a bold and robust man and the music had becom hush at the wave of hi hand it wa in the blue room where stood the princ with a group of pale courtier by hi side at first as he spoke there wa a slight rush movement of thi group in the direct of the intrud who at the moment wa also near at hand and now with deliber and state step made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain nameless aw with which the mad assumpt of the mummer had inspir the whole parti there were found none who put forth hand to seiz him so that unimped he pass within a yard of the princ s person and while the vast assembl as if with on impuls shrank from the centr of the room to the wall he made hi wai uninterruptedli but with the same solemn and measur step which had distinguish him from the first through the blue chamber to the purplethrough the purpl to the greenthrough the green to the orangethrough thi again to the whiteand even thenc to the violet er a decid movement had been made to arrest him it wa then howev that the princ prospero madden with rage and the shame of hi own momentari cowardic rush hurriedli through the six chamber while none follow him on account of a deadli terror that had seiz upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approach in rapid impetuos to within three or four feet of the retreat figur when the latter have attain the extrem of the velvet apart turn suddenli and confront hi pursuer there wa a sharp cryand the dagger drop gleam upon the sabl carpet upon which instantli afterward fell prostrat in death the princ prospero then summon the wild courag of despair a throng of the revel at onc threw themselv into the black apart and seiz the mummer whose tall figur stood erect and motionless
