pygmalion need not a prefac but a sequel which i have suppli in it due place the english have no respect for their languag and will not teach their children to speak it thei spell it so abomin that no man can teach himself what it sound like it is imposs for an englishman to open hi mouth without make some other englishman hate or despis him german and spanish ar access to foreign english is not access even to englishmen the reform england need todai is an energet phonet enthusiast that is why i have made such a on the hero of a popular plai there have been hero of that kind cry in the wilder for mani year past when i becam interest in the subject toward the end of the eighteenseventi melvil bell wa dead but alexand j elli wa still a live patriarch with an impress head alwai cover by a velvet skull cap for which he would apolog to public meet in a veri courtli manner he and tito pagliardini anoth phonet veteran were men whom it wa imposs to dislik henri sweet then a young man lack their sweet of charact he wa about as conciliatori to convent mortal as ibsen or samuel butler hi great abil as a phonetician he wa i think the best of them all at hi job would have entitl him to high offici recognit and perhap enabl him to popular hi subject but for hi satan contempt for all academ dignitari and person in gener who thought more of greek than of phonet onc in the dai when the imperi institut rose in south kensington and joseph chamberlain wa boom the empir i induc the editor of a lead monthli review to commiss an articl from sweet on the imperi import of hi subject when it arriv it contain noth but a savag deris attack on a professor of languag and literatur whose chair sweet regard as proper to a phonet expert onli the articl be libel had to be return as imposs and i had to renounc my dream of drag it author into the limelight when i met him afterward for the first time for mani year i found to my astonish that he who had been a quit toler present young man had actual manag by sheer scorn to alter hi person appear until he had becom a sort of walk repudi of oxford and all it tradit it must have been larg in hi own despit that he wa squeez into someth call a readership of phonet there the futur of phonet rest probabl with hi pupil who all swore by him but noth could bring the man himself into ani sort of complianc with the univers to which he nevertheless clung by divin right in an intens oxonian wai i daresai hi paper if he ha left ani includ some satir that mai be publish without too destruct result fifti year henc he wa i believ not in the least an illnatur man veri much the opposit i should sai but he would not suffer fool gladli those who knew him will recogn in my third act the allus to the patent shorthand in which he us to write postcard and which mai be acquir from a four and sixpenni manual publish by the clarendon press the postcard which mr higgin describ ar such as i have receiv from sweet i would deciph a sound which a cocknei would repres by zerr and a frenchman by seu and then write demand with some heat what on earth it meant sweet with boundless contempt for my stupid would repli that it not onli meant but obvious wa the word result as no other word contain that sound and capabl of make sens with the context exist in ani languag spoken on earth that less expert mortal should requir fuller indic wa beyond sweet patienc therefor though the whole point of hi current shorthand is that it can express everi sound in the languag perfectli vowel as well as conson and that your hand ha to make no stroke except the easi and current on with which you write m n and u l p and q scribbl them at whatev angl come easiest to you hi unfortun determin to make thi remark and quit legibl script serv also as a shorthand reduc it in hi own practic to the most inscrut of cryptogram hi true object wa the provis of a full accur legibl script for our nobl but illdress languag but he wa led past that by hi contempt for the popular pitman system of shorthand which he call the pitfal system the triumph of pitman wa a triumph of busi organ there wa a weekli paper to persuad you to learn pitman there were cheap textbook and exercis book and transcript of speech for you to copi and school where experienc teacher coach you up to the necessari profici sweet could not organ hi market in that fashion he might as well have been the sybil who tore up the leav of propheci that nobodi would attend to the four and sixpenni manual mostli in hi lithograph handwrit that wa never vulgarli advert mai perhap some dai be taken up by a syndic and push upon the public as the time push the encyclopaedia britannica but until then it will certainli not prevail against pitman i have bought three copi of it dure my lifetim and i am inform by the publish that it cloister exist is still a steadi and healthi on i actual learn the system two sever time and yet the shorthand in which i am write these line is pitman and the reason is that my secretari cannot transcrib sweet have been perforc taught in the school of pitman therefor sweet rail at pitman as vainli as thersit rail at ajax hi railleri howev it mai have eas hi soul gave no popular vogu to current shorthand pygmalion higgin is not a portrait of sweet to whom the adventur of eliza doolittl would have been imposs still as will be seen there ar touch of sweet in the plai with higginss physiqu and tempera sweet might have set the thame on fire as it wa he impress himself profession on europ to an extent that made hi compar person obscur and the failur of oxford to do justic to hi emin a puzzl to foreign specialist in hi subject i do not blame oxford becaus i think oxford is quit right in demand a certain social amen from it nursl heaven know it is not exorbit in it requir for although i well know how hard it is for a man of geniu with a serious underr subject to maintain seren and kindli relat with the men who underr it and who keep all the best place for less import subject which thei profess without origin and sometim without much capac for them still if he overwhelm them with wrath and disdain he cannot expect them to heap honor on him of the later gener of phonetician i know littl among them tower the poet laureat to whom perhap higgin mai ow hi milton sympathi though here again i must disclaim all portraitur but if the plai make the public awar that there ar such peopl as phonetician and that thei ar among the most import peopl in england at present it will serv it turn i wish to boast that pygmalion ha been an extrem success plai all over europ and north america as well as at home it is so intens and deliber didact and it subject is esteem so dry that i delight in throw it at the head of the wiseacr who repeat the parrot cry that art should never be didact it goe to prove my content that art should never be anyth els final and for the encourag of peopl troubl with accent that cut them off from all high employ i mai add that the chang wrought by professor higgin in the flower girl is neither imposs nor uncommon the modern concierg daughter who fulfil her ambit by plai the queen of spain in rui bla at the theatr francai is onli on of mani thousand of men and women who have slough off their nativ dialect and acquir a new tongu but the thing ha to be done scientif or the last state of the aspir mai be wors than the first

ragshop in which romanc keep it stock of happi end to misfit all stori now the histori of eliza doolittl though call a romanc becaus of the transfigur it record seem exceedingli improb is common enough such transfigur have been achiev by hundr of resolut ambiti young women sinc nell gwynn set them the exampl by plai queen and fascin king in the theatr in which she began by sell orang nevertheless peopl in all direct have assum for no other reason than that she becam the heroin of a romanc that she must have marri the hero of it thi is unbear not onli becaus her littl drama if act on such a thoughtless assumpt must be spoil but becaus the true sequel is patent to anyon with a sens of human natur in gener and of feminin instinct in particular eliza in tell higgin she would not marri him if he ask her wa not coquet she wa announc a wellconsid decis when a bachelor interest and domin and teach and becom import to a spinster as higgin with eliza she alwai if she ha charact enough to be capabl of it consid veri serious inde whether she will plai for becom that bachelor wife especi if he is so littl interest in marriag that a determin and devot woman might captur him if she set herself resolut to do it her decis will depend a good deal on whether she is realli free to choos and that again will depend on her ag and incom if she is at the end of her youth and ha no secur for her livelihood she will marri him becaus she must marri anybodi who will provid for her but at eliza ag a goodlook girl doe not feel that pressur she feel free to pick and choos she is therefor guid by her instinct in the matter eliza instinct tell her not to marri higgin it doe not tell her to give him up it is not in the slightest doubt as to hi remain on of the strongest person interest in her life it would be veri sore strain if there wa anoth woman like to supplant her with him but as she feel sure of him on that last point she ha no doubt at all as to her cours and would not have ani even if the differ of twenti year in ag which seem so great to youth did not exist between them as our own instinct ar not appeal to by her conclus let us see whether we cannot discov some reason in it when higgin excus hi indiffer to young women on the ground that thei had an irresist rival in hi mother he gave the clue to hi inveter oldbachelordom the case is uncommon onli to the extent that remark mother ar uncommon if an imagin boi ha a suffici rich mother who ha intellig person grace digniti of charact without harsh and a cultiv sens of the best art of her time to enabl her to make her hous beauti she set a standard for him against which veri few women can struggl besid effect for him a disengag of hi affect hi sens of beauti and hi ideal from hi specif sexual impuls thi make him a stand puzzl to the huge number of uncultiv peopl who have been brought up in tasteless home by commonplac or disagre parent and to whom consequ literatur paint sculptur music and affection person relat come as mode of sex if thei come at all the word passion mean noth els to them and that higgin could have a passion for phonet and ideal hi mother instead of eliza would seem to them absurd and unnatur nevertheless when we look round and see that hardli anyon is too ugli or disagre to find a wife or a husband if he or she want on whilst mani old maid and bachelor ar abov the averag in qualiti and cultur we cannot help suspect that the disentangl of sex from the associ with which it is so commonli confus a disentangl which person of geniu achiev by sheer intellectu analysi is sometim produc or aid by parent fascin now though eliza wa incap of thu explain to herself higginss formid power of resist to the charm that prostrat freddi at the first glanc she wa instinct awar that she could never obtain a complet grip of him or come between him and hi mother the first necess of the marri woman to put it shortli she knew that for some mysteri reason he had not the make of a marri man in him accord to her concept of a husband as on to whom she would be hi nearest and fondest and warmest interest even had there been no motherriv she would still have refus to accept an interest in herself that wa secondari to philosoph interest had mr higgin di there would still have been milton and the univers alphabet landor remark that to those who have the greatest power of love love is a secondari affair would not have recommend landor to eliza put that along with her resent of higginss domin superior and her mistrust of hi coax clever in get round her and evad her wrath when he had gone too far with hi impetu bulli and you will see that eliza instinct had good ground for warn her not to marri her pygmalion and now whom did eliza marri for if higgin wa a predestin old bachelor she wa most certainli not a predestin old maid well that can be told veri shortli to those who have not guess it from the indic she ha herself given them almost immedi after eliza is stung into proclaim her consid determin not to marri higgin she mention the fact that young mr frederick eynsford hill is pour out hi love for her daili through the post now freddi is young practic twenti year younger than higgin he is a gentleman or as eliza would qualifi him a toff and speak like on he is nice dress is treat by the colonel as an equal love her unaffectedli and is not her master nor ever like to domin her in spite of hi advantag of social stand eliza ha no us for the foolish romant tradit that all women love to be master if not actual bulli and beaten when you go to women sai nietzsch take your whip with you sensibl despot have never confin that precaut to women thei have taken their whip with them when thei have dealt with men and been slavishli ideal by the men over whom thei have flourish the whip much more than by women no doubt there ar slavish women as well as slavish men and women like men admir those that ar stronger than themselv but to admir a strong person and to live under that strong person thumb ar two differ thing the weak mai not be admir and heroworship but thei ar by no mean dislik or shun and thei never seem to have the least difficulti in marri peopl who ar too good for them thei mai fail in emerg but life is not on long emerg it is mostli a string of situat for which no except strength is need and with which even rather weak peopl can cope if thei have a stronger partner to help them out accordingli it is a truth everywher in evid that strong peopl masculin or feminin not onli do not marri stronger peopl but do not show ani prefer for them in select their friend when a lion meet anoth with a louder roar the first lion think the last a bore the man or woman who feel strong enough for two seek for everi other qualiti in a partner than strength the convers is also true weak peopl want to marri strong peopl who do not frighten them too much and thi often lead them to make the mistak we describ metaphor as bite off more than thei can chew thei want too much for too littl and when the bargain is unreason beyond all bear the union becom imposs it end in the weaker parti be either discard or born as a cross which is wors peopl who ar not onli weak but silli or obtus as well ar often in these difficulti thi be the state of human affair what is eliza fairli sure to do when she is place between freddi and higgin will she look forward to a lifetim of fetch higginss slipper or to a lifetim of freddi fetch her there can be no doubt about the answer unless freddi is biolog repuls to her and higgin biolog attract to a degre that overwhelm all her other instinct she will if she marri either of them marri freddi and that is just what eliza did complic ensu but thei were econom not romant freddi had no monei and no occup hi mother jointur a last relic of the opul of largeladi park had enabl her to struggl along in earlscourt with an air of gentil but not to procur ani seriou secondari educ for her children much less give the boi a profess a clerkship at thirti shill a week wa beneath freddi digniti and extrem distast to him besid hi prospect consist of a hope that if he kept up appear somebodi would do someth for him the someth appear vagu to hi imagin as a privat secretaryship or a sinecur of some sort to hi mother it perhap appear as a marriag to some ladi of mean who could not resist her boi nice fanci her feel when he marri a flower girl who had becom declasse under extraordinari circumst which were now notori it is true that eliza situat did not seem wholli inelig her father though formerli a dustman and now fantast disclass had becom extrem popular in the smartest societi by a social talent which triumph over everi prejudic and everi disadvantag reject by the middl class which he loath he had shot up at onc into the highest circl by hi wit hi dustmanship which he carri like a banner and hi nietzschean transcend of good and evil at intim ducal dinner he sat on the right hand of the duchess and in countri hous he smoke in the pantri and wa made much of by the butler when he wa not feed in the diningroom and be consult by cabinet minist but he found it almost as hard to do all thi on four thousand a year as mr eynsford hill to live in earlscourt on an incom so pitiabl smaller that i have not the heart to disclos it exact figur he absolut refus to add the last straw to hi burden by contribut to eliza support thu freddi and eliza now mr and mr eynsford hill would have spent a penniless honeymoon but for a wed present of pound from the colonel to eliza it last a long time becaus freddi did not know how to spend monei never have had ani to spend and eliza social train by a pair of old bachelor wore her cloth as long as thei held togeth and look pretti without the least regard to their be mani month out of fashion still pound will not last two young peopl for ever and thei both knew and eliza felt as well that thei must shift for themselv in the end she could quarter herself on wimpol street becaus it had come to be her home but she wa quit awar that she ought not to quarter freddi there and that it would not be good for hi charact if she did not that the wimpol street bachelor object when she consult them higgin declin to be bother about her hous problem when that solut wa so simpl eliza desir to have freddi in the hous with her seem of no more import than if she had want an extra piec of bedroom furnitur plea as to freddi charact and the moral oblig on him to earn hi own live were lost on higgin he deni that freddi had ani charact and declar that if he tri to do ani us work some compet person would have the troubl of undo it a procedur involv a net loss to the commun and great unhappi to freddi himself who wa obvious intend by natur for such light work as amus eliza which higgin declar wa a much more us and honor occup than work in the citi when eliza refer again to her project of teach phonet higgin abat not a jot of hi violent opposit to it he said she wa not within ten year of be qualifi to meddl with hi pet subject and as it wa evid that the colonel agre with him she felt she could not go against them in thi grave matter and that she had no right without higginss consent to exploit the knowledg he had given her for hi knowledg seem to her as much hi privat properti as hi watch eliza wa no communist besid she wa superstiti devot to them both more entir and frankli after her marriag than befor it it wa the colonel who final solv the problem which had cost him much perplex cogit he on dai ask eliza rather shyli whether she had quit given up her notion of keep a flower shop she repli that she had thought of it but had put it out of her head becaus the colonel had said that dai at mr higginss that it would never do the colonel confess that when he said that he had not quit recov from the dazzl impress of the dai befor thei broke the matter to higgin that even the sole comment vouchsaf by him veri nearli led to a seriou quarrel with eliza it wa to the effect that she would have in freddi an ideal errand boi freddi himself wa next sound on the subject he said he had been think of a shop himself though it had present itself to hi penniless as a small place in which eliza should sell tobacco at on counter whilst he sold newspap at the opposit on but he agre that it would be extraordinarili jolli to go earli everi morn with eliza to covent garden and bui flower on the scene of their first meet a sentiment which earn him mani kiss from hi wife he ad that he had alwai been afraid to propos anyth of the sort becaus clara would make an aw row about a step that must damag her matrimoni chanc and hi mother could not be expect to like it after cling for so mani year to that step of the social ladder on which retail trade is imposs thi difficulti wa remov by an event highli unexpect by freddi mother clara in the cours of her incurs into those artist circl which were the highest within her reach discov that her convers qualif were expect to includ a ground in the novel of mr hg well she borrow them in variou direct so energet that she swallow them all within two month the result wa a convers of a kind quit common todai a modern act of the apostl would fill fifti whole bibl if anyon were capabl of write it poor clara who appear to higgin and hi mother as a disagre and ridicul person and to her own mother as in some inexplic wai a social failur had never seen herself in either light for though to some extent ridicul and mimick in west kensington like everybodi els there she wa accept as a ration and normalor shall we sai inevitablesort of human be at worst thei call her the pusher but to them no more than to herself had it ever occur that she wa push the air and push it in a wrong direct still she wa not happi she wa grow desper her on asset the fact that her mother wa what the epsom greengroc call a carriag ladi had no exchang valu appar it had prevent her from get educ becaus the onli educ she could have afford wa educ with the earlscourt green grocer daughter it had led her to seek the societi of her mother class and that class simpli would not have her becaus she wa much poorer than the greengroc and far from be abl to afford a maid could not afford even a housemaid and had to scrape along at home with an illiber treat gener servant under such circumst noth could give her an air of be a genuin product of largeladi park and yet it tradit made her regard a marriag with anyon within her reach as an unbear humili commerci peopl and profession peopl in a small wai were odiou to her she ran after painter and novelist but she did not charm them and her bold attempt to pick up and practis artist and literari talk irrit them she wa in short an utter failur an ignor incompet pretenti unwelcom penniless useless littl snob and though she did not admit these disqualif for nobodi ever face unpleas truth of thi kind until the possibl of a wai out dawn on them she felt their effect too keenli to be satisfi with her posit clara had a startl eyeopen when on be suddenli waken to enthusiasm by a girl of her own ag who dazzl her and produc in her a gush desir to take her

puissant pen and place her at the angl of view from which the life she wa lead and the societi to which she clung appear in it true relat to real human need and worthi social structur he effect a convers and a convict of sin compar to the most sensat feat of gener booth or gypsi smith clara snobberi went bang life suddenli began to move with her without know how or why she began to make friend and enemi some of the acquaint to whom she had been a tediou or indiffer or ridicul afflict drop her other becam cordial to her amaz she found that some quit nice peopl were satur with well and that thi access to idea wa the secret of their nice peopl she had thought deepli religi and had tri to concili on that tack with disastr result suddenli took an interest in her and reveal a hostil to convent religion which she had never conceiv possibl except among the most desper charact thei made her read galsworthi and galsworthi expos the vaniti of largeladi park and finish her it exasper her to think that the dungeon in which she had languish for so mani unhappi year had been unlock all the time and that the impuls she had so carefulli struggl with and stifl for the sake of keep well with societi were precis those by which alon she could have come into ani sort of sincer human contact in the radianc of these discoveri and the tumult of their reaction she made a fool of herself as freeli and conspicu as when she so rashli adopt eliza explet in mr higginss drawingroom for the newborn wellsian had to find her bear almost as ridicul as a babi but nobodi hate a babi for it ineptitud or think the wors of it for try to eat the match and clara lost no friend by her folli thei laugh at her to her face thi time and she had to defend herself and fight it out as best she could when freddi paid a visit to earlscourt which he never did when he could possibl help it to make the desol announc that he and hi eliza were think of blacken the largeladi scutcheon by open a shop he found the littl household alreadi convuls by a prior announc from clara that she also wa go to work in an old furnitur shop in dover street which had been start by a fellow wellsian thi appoint clara ow after all to her old social accomplish of push she had made up her mind that cost what it might she would see mr well in the flesh and she had achiev her end at a garden parti she had better luck than so rash an enterpris deserv mr well came up to her expect ag had not wither him nor could custom stale hi infinit varieti in half an hour hi pleasant neat and compact hi small hand and feet hi

as she happen to talk to the ladi of the furnitur shop and that ladi also desir abov all thing to know mr well and sell pretti thing to him she offer clara a job on the chanc of achiev that end through her and so it came about that eliza luck held and the expect opposit to the flower shop melt awai the shop is in the arcad of a railwai station not veri far from the victoria and albert museum and if you live in that neighborhood you mai go there ani dai and bui a buttonhol from eliza now here is a last opportun for romanc would you not like to be assur that the shop wa an immens success thank to eliza charm and her earli busi experi in covent garden ala the truth is the truth the shop did not pai for a long time simpli becaus eliza and her freddi did not know how to keep it true eliza had not to begin at the veri begin she knew the name and price of the cheaper flower and her elat wa unbound when she found that freddi like all youth educ at cheap pretenti and thoroughli ineffici school knew a littl latin it wa veri littl but enough to make him appear to her a porson or bentlei and to put him at hi eas with botan nomenclatur unfortun he knew noth els and eliza though she could count monei up to eighteen shill or so and had acquir a certain familiar with the languag of milton from her struggl to qualifi herself for win higginss bet could not write out a bill without utterli disgrac the establish freddi power of state in latin that balbu built a wall and that gaul wa divid into three part did not carri with it the slightest knowledg of account or busi colonel picker had to explain to him what a chequ book and a bank account meant and the pair were by no mean easili teachabl freddi back up eliza in her obstin refus to believ that thei could save monei by engag a bookkeep with some knowledg of the busi how thei argu could you possibl save monei by go to extra expens when you alreadi could not make both end meet but the colonel after make the end meet over and over again at last gentli insist and eliza humbl to the dust by have to beg from him so often and stung by the uproari deris of higgin to whom the notion of freddi succeed at anyth wa a joke that never pall grasp the fact that busi like phonet ha to be learn on the piteou spectacl of the pair spend their even in shorthand school and polytechn class learn bookkeep and typewrit with incipi junior clerk male and femal from the elementari school let me not dwell there were even class at the london school of econom and a humbl person appeal to the director of that institut to recommend a cours bear on the flower busi he be a humorist explain to them the method of the celebr dickensian essai on chines metaphys by the gentleman who read an articl on china and an articl on metaphys and combin the inform he suggest that thei should combin the london school with kew garden eliza to whom the procedur of the dickensian gentleman seem perfectli correct as in fact it wa and not in the least funni which wa onli her ignor took hi advic with entir graviti but the effort that cost her the deepest humili wa a request to higgin whose pet artist fanci next to milton vers wa calligraphi and who himself wrote a most beauti italian hand that he would teach her to write he declar that she wa congenit incap of form a singl letter worthi of the least of milton word but she persist and again he suddenli threw himself into the task of teach her with a combin of stormi intens concentr patienc and occasion burst of interest disquisit on the beauti and nobil the august mission and destini of human handwrit eliza end by acquir an extrem uncommerci script which wa a posit extens of her person beauti and spend three time as much on stationeri as anyon els becaus certain qualiti and shape of paper becam indispens to her she could not even address an envelop in the usual wai becaus it made the margin all wrong their commerci school dai were a period of disgrac and despair for the young coupl thei seem to be learn noth about flower shop at last thei gave it up as hopeless and shook the dust of the shorthand school and the polytechn and the london school of econom from their feet for ever besid the busi wa in some mysteri wai begin to take care of itself thei had somehow forgotten their object to emploi other peopl thei came to the conclus that their own wai wa the best and that thei had realli a remark talent for busi the colonel who had been compel for some year to keep a suffici sum on current account at hi banker to make up their deficit found that the provis wa unnecessari the young peopl were prosper it is true that there wa not quit fair plai between them and their competitor in trade their weekend in the countri cost them noth and save them the price of their sundai dinner for the motor car wa the colonel and he and higgin paid the hotel bill mr f hill florist and greengroc thei soon discov that there wa monei in asparagu and asparagu led to other veget had an air which stamp the busi as classi and in privat life he wa still frederick eynsford hill esquir not that there wa ani swank about him nobodi but eliza knew that he had been christen frederick challon eliza herself swank like anyth that is all that is how it ha turn out it is astonish how much eliza still manag to meddl in the housekeep at wimpol street in spite of the shop and her own famili and it is notabl that though she never nag her husband and frankli love the colonel as if she were hi favorit daughter she ha never got out of the habit of nag higgin that wa establish on the fatal night when she won hi bet for him she snap hi head off on the faintest provoc or on none he no longer dare to teas her by assum an abysm inferior of freddi mind to hi own he storm and bulli and derid but she stand up to him so ruthlessli that the colonel ha to ask her from time to time to be kinder to higgin and it is the onli request of hi that bring a mulish express into her face noth but some emerg or calam great enough to break down all like and dislik and throw them both back on their common humanityand mai thei be spare ani such trialwil ever alter
