food and shelter the necessari of life for man in thi climat mai accur enough be distribut under the sever head of food shelter cloth and fuel for not till we have secur these ar we prepar to entertain the true problem of life with freedom and a prospect of success man ha invent not onli hous but cloth and cook food and possibl from the accident discoveri of the warmth of fire and the

too rapid or for want of fuel or from some defect in the draught the fire goe out of cours the vital heat is not to be confound with fire but so much for analog it appear therefor from the abov list that the express anim life is nearli synonym with the express anim heat for while food mai be regard as the fuel which keep up the fire within usand fuel serv onli to prepar that food or to increas the warmth of our bodi by addit from withoutshelt and cloth also serv onli to retain the heat thu gener and absorb the grand necess then for our bodi is to keep warm to keep the vital heat in us what pain we accordingli take not onli with our food and cloth and shelter but with our bed which ar our nightcloth rob the nest and breast of bird to prepar thi shelter within a shelter as the mole ha it

etc and for the studiou lamplight stationeri and access to a few book rank next to necessari and can all be obtain at a trifl cost yet some not wise go to the other side of the globe to barbar and

but unnatur hot as i impli befor thei ar cook of cours la mode most of the luxuri and mani of the socal comfort of life ar not onli not indispens but posit hindranc to the elev of mankind with respect to luxuri and comfort the wisest have ever live a more simpl and meagr life than the poor the ancient philosoph chines hindoo persian and greek were a class than which none ha been poorer in outward rich none so rich in inward we know not much about them it is remark that we know so much of them as we do the same is true of the more modern reform and benefactor of their race none can be an imparti or wise observ of human life but from the vantag ground of what we should call voluntari poverti of a life of luxuri the fruit is luxuri whether in agricultur or commerc or literatur or art there ar nowadai professor of philosophi but not philosoph yet it is admir to profess becaus it wa onc admir to live to be a philosoph is not mere to have subtl thought nor even to found a school but so to love wisdom as to live accord to it dictat a life of simplic independ magnanim and trust it is to solv some of the problem of life not onli theoret but practic the success of great scholar and thinker is commonli a courtierlik success not kingli not manli thei make shift to live mere by conform practic as their father did and ar in no sens the progenitor of a nobl race of men but why do men degener ever what make famili run out what is the natur of the luxuri which enerv and destroi nation ar we sure that there is none of it in our own live the philosoph is in advanc of hi ag even in the outward form of hi life he is not fed shelter cloth warm like hi contemporari how can a man be a philosoph and not maintain hi vital heat by better method than other men when a man is warm by the sever mode which i have describ what doe he want next sure not more warmth of the same kind as more and richer food larger and more splendid hous finer and more abund cloth more numer incess and hotter fire and the like when he ha obtain those thing which ar necessari to life there is anoth altern than to obtain the superflu and that is to adventur on life now hi vacat from humbler toil have commenc the soil it appear is suit to the seed for it ha sent it radicl downward and it mai now send it shoot upward also with confid why ha man root himself thu firmli in the earth but that he mai rise in the same proport into the heaven abovefor the nobler plant ar valu for the fruit thei bear at last in the air and light far from the ground and ar not treat like the humbler escul which though thei mai be biennial ar cultiv onli till thei have perfect their root and often cut down at top for thi purpos so that most would not know them in their flower season i do not mean to prescrib rule to

of warmth or comfort first of warmth then the warmth of the affect we mai imagin a time when in the infanc of the human race some enterpris mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter everi child begin the world again to some extent and love to stai outdoor even in wet and cold it plai hous as well as hors have an instinct for it who doe not rememb the interest with which when young he look at

littl yanke shrewd lest after all he find himself in a workhous a labyrinth without a clue a museum an almshous a prison or a splendid mausoleum instead consid first how slight a shelter is absolut necessari i have seen penobscot indian in thi town live in tent of thin cotton cloth while the snow wa nearli a foot deep around them and i thought that thei would be glad to have it deeper to keep out the wind formerli when how to get my live honestli with freedom left for my proper pursuit wa a question which vex me even more than it doe now for unfortun i am becom somewhat callou i us to see a larg box by the railroad six feet long by three wide in which the labor lock up their tool at night and it suggest to me that everi man who wa hard push might get such a on for a dollar and have bore a few auger hole in it to admit the air at least get into it when it rain and at night and hook down the lid and so have freedom in hi love and in hi soul be free thi did not appear the worst nor by ani mean a despic altern you could sit up as late as you pleas and whenev you got up go abroad without ani landlord or houselord dog you for rent mani a man is harass to death to pai the rent of a larger and more luxuri box who would not have frozen to death in such a box as thi i am far from jest economi is a subject which admit of be treat with leviti but it cannot so be dispos of a comfort hous for a rude and hardi race that live mostli out of door wa onc made here almost entir of such materi as natur furnish readi to their hand gookin who wa superintend of the indian subject to the massachusett coloni write in sai the best of their hous ar cover veri neatli tight and warm with bark of tree slip from their bodi at those season when the sap is up and made into great flake with pressur of weighti timber when thei ar green the meaner sort ar cover with mat which thei make of a kind of bulrush and ar also indiffer tight and warm but not so good as the former some i have seen sixti or a hundr feet long and thirti feet broad i have often lodg in their wigwam and found them as warm as the best english hous he add that thei were commonli carpet and line within with wellwrought embroid mat and were furnish with variou utensil the indian had advanc so far as to regul the effect of the wind by a mat suspend over the hole in the roof and move by a string such a lodg wa in the first instanc construct in a dai or two at most and taken down and put up in a few hour and everi famili own on or it apart in on in the savag state everi famili own a shelter as good as the best and suffici for it coarser and simpler want but i think that i speak within bound when i sai that though the bird of the air have their nest and the fox their hole and the savag their wigwam in modern civil societi not more than on half the famili own a shelter in the larg town and citi where civil especi prevail the number of those who own a shelter is a veri small fraction of the whole the rest pai an annual tax for thi outsid garment of all becom indispens summer and winter which would bui a villag of indian wigwam but now help to keep them poor as long as thei live i do not mean to insist here on the disadvantag of hire compar with own but it is evid that the savag own hi shelter becaus it cost so littl while the civil man hire hi commonli becaus he cannot afford to own it nor can he in the long run ani better afford to hire but answer on by mere pai thi tax the poor civil man secur an abod which is a palac compar with the savag an annual rent of from twentyf to a hundr dollar these ar the countri rate entitl him to the benefit of the improv of centuri spaciou apart clean paint and paper rumford fireplac back plaster venetian blind copper pump spring lock a commodi cellar and mani other thing but how happen it that he who is said to enjoi these thing is so commonli a poor civil man while the savag who ha them not is rich as a savag if it is assert that civil is a real advanc in the condit of manand i think that it is though onli the wise improv their advantagesit must be shown that it ha produc better dwell without make them more costli and the cost of a thing is the amount of what i will call life which is requir to be exchang for it immedi or in the long run an averag hous in thi neighborhood cost perhap eight hundr dollar and to lai up thi sum will take from ten to fifteen year of the labor life even if he is not encumb with a familyestim the pecuniari valu of everi man labor at on dollar a dai for if some receiv more other receiv lessso that he must have spent more than half hi life commonli befor hi wigwam will be earn if we suppos him to pai a rent instead thi is but a doubt choic of evil would the savag have been wise to exchang hi wigwam for a palac on these term it mai be guess that i reduc almost the whole advantag of hold thi superflu properti as a fund in store against the futur so far as the individu is concern mainli to the defrai of funer expens but perhap a man is not requir to buri himself nevertheless thi point to an import distinct between the civil man and the savag and no doubt thei have design on us for our benefit in make the life of a civil peopl an institut in which the life of the individu is to a great extent absorb in order to preserv and perfect that of the race but i wish to show at what a sacrific thi advantag is at present obtain and to suggest that we mai possibl so live as to secur all the advantag without suffer ani of the disadvantag what mean ye by sai that the poor ye have alwai with you or that the father have eaten sour grape and the children teeth ar set on edg as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occas ani more to us thi proverb in israel behold all soul ar mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die when i consid my neighbor the farmer of concord who ar at least as well off as the other class i find that for the most part thei have been toil twenti thirti or forti year that thei mai becom the real owner of their farm which commonli thei have inherit with encumbr or els bought with hire moneyand we mai regard on third of that toil as the cost of their housesbut commonli thei have not paid for them yet it is true the encumbr sometim outweigh the valu of the farm so that the farm itself becom on great encumbr and still a man is found to inherit it be well acquaint with it as he sai on appli to the assessor i am surpris to learn that thei cannot at onc name a dozen in the town who own their farm free and clear if you would know the histori of these homestead inquir at the bank where thei ar mortgag the man who ha actual paid for hi farm with labor on it is so rare that everi neighbor can point to him i doubt if there ar three such men in concord what ha been said of the merchant that a veri larg major even ninetyseven in a hundr ar sure to fail is equal true of the farmer with regard to the merchant howev on of them sai pertin that a great part of their failur ar not genuin pecuniari failur but mere failur to fulfil their engag becaus it is inconveni that is it is the moral charact that break down but thi put an infinit wors face on the matter and suggest besid that probabl not even the other three succe in save their soul but ar perchanc bankrupt in a wors sens than thei who fail honestli bankruptci and repudi ar the springboard from which much of our civil vault and turn it somerset but the savag stand on the unelast plank of famin yet the middlesex cattl show goe off here with clat annual as if all the joint of the agricultur machin were suent the farmer is endeavor to solv the problem of a livelihood by a formula more complic than the problem itself to get hi shoestr he specul in herd of cattl with consumm skill he ha set hi trap with a hair spring to catch comfort and independ and then as he turn awai got hi own leg into it thi is the reason he is poor and for a similar reason we ar all poor in respect to a thousand savag comfort though surround by luxuri as chapman sing the fals societi of men for earthli great all heavenli comfort rarefi to air and when the farmer ha got hi hous he mai not be the richer but the poorer for it and it be the hous that ha got him as i understand it that wa a valid object urg by momu against the hous which minerva made that she had not made it movabl by which mean a bad neighborhood might be avoid and it mai still be urg for our hous ar such unwieldi properti that we ar often imprison rather than hous in them and the bad neighborhood to be avoid is our own scurvi selv i know on or two famili at least in thi town who for nearli a gener have been wish to sell their hous in the outskirt and move into the villag but have not been abl to accomplish it and onli death will set them free grant that the major ar abl at last either to own or hire the modern hous with all it improv while civil ha been improv our hous it ha not equal improv the men who ar to inhabit them it ha creat palac but it wa not so easi to creat noblemen and king and if the civil man pursuit ar no worthier than the savag if he is emploi the greater part of hi life in obtain gross necessari and comfort mere why should he have a better dwell than the former but how do the poor minor fare perhap it will be found that just in proport as some have been place in outward circumst abov the savag other have been degrad below him the luxuri of on class is counterbalanc by the indig of anoth on the on side is the palac on the other ar the almshous and silent poor the myriad who built the pyramid to be the tomb of the pharaoh were fed on garlic and it mai be were not decent buri themselv the mason who finish the cornic of the palac return at night perchanc to a hut not so good as a wigwam it is a mistak to suppos that in a countri where the usual evid of civil exist the condit of a veri larg bodi of the inhabit mai not be as degrad as that of savag i refer to the degrad poor not now to the degrad rich to know thi i should not need to look farther than to the shanti which everywher border our railroad that last improv in civil where i see in my daili walk human be live in sti and all winter with an open door for the sake of light without ani visibl often imagin woodpil and the form of both old and young ar perman contract by the long habit of shrink from cold and miseri and the develop of all their limb and faculti is check it certainli is fair to look at that class by whose labor the work which distinguish thi gener ar accomplish such too to a greater or less extent is the condit of the oper of everi denomin in england which is the great workhous of the world or i could refer you to ireland which is mark as on of the white or enlighten spot on the map contrast the physic condit of the irish with that of the north american indian or the south sea island or ani other savag race befor it wa degrad by contact with the civil man yet i have no doubt that that peopl ruler ar as wise as the averag of civil ruler their condit onli prove what squalid mai consist with civil i hardli need refer now to the labor in our southern state who produc the stapl export of thi countri and ar themselv a stapl product of the south but to confin myself to those who ar said to be in moder circumst most men appear never to have consid what a hous is and ar actual though needlessli poor all their live becaus thei think that thei must have such a on as their neighbor have as if on were to wear ani sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him or gradual leav off palmleaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin complain of hard time becaus he could not afford to bui him a crown it is possibl to invent a hous still more conveni and luxuri than we have which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pai for shall we alwai studi to obtain more of these thing and not sometim to be content with less shall the respect citizen thu grave teach by precept and exampl the necess of the young man provid a certain number of superflu glowsho and umbrella and empti guest chamber for empti guest befor he di why should not our furnitur be as simpl as the arab or the indian when i think of the benefactor of the race whom we have apotheos as messeng from heaven bearer of divin gift to man i do not see in my mind ani retinu at their heel ani carload of fashion furnitur or what if i were to allowwould it not be a singular allowancethat our furnitur should be more complex than the arab in proport as we ar moral and intellectu hi superior at present our hous ar clutter and defil with it and a good housewif would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole and not leav her morn work undon morn work by the blush of aurora and the music of memnon what should be man morn work in thi world i had three piec of limeston on my desk but i wa terrifi to find that thei requir to be dust daili when the furnitur of my mind wa all undust still and threw them out the window in disgust how then could i have a furnish hous i would rather sit in the open air for no dust gather on the grass unless where man ha broken ground it is the luxuri and dissip who set the fashion which the herd so dilig follow the travel who stop at the best hous so call soon discov thi for the publican presum him to be a sardanapalu and if he resign himself to their tender merci he would soon be complet emascul i think that in the railroad car we ar inclin to spend more on luxuri than on safeti and conveni and it threaten without attain these to becom no better than a modern drawingroom with it divan and ottoman and sunshad and a hundr other orient thing which we ar take west with us invent for the ladi of the harem and the effemin nativ of the celesti empir which jonathan should be asham to know the name of i would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowd on a velvet cushion i would

pedest for it there is not a nail to hang a pictur on nor a shelf to receiv the bust of a hero or a saint when i consid how our hous ar built and paid for or not paid for and their intern economi manag and sustain i wonder that the floor doe not give wai under the visitor while he is admir the gewgaw upon the mantelpiec and let him through into the cellar to some solid and honest though earthi

that the greatest genuin leap due to human muscl alon on record is that of certain wander arab who ar said to have clear twentyf feet on level ground without factiti support man is sure to come to

crop wa so light that thei were forc to cut their bread veri thin for a long season the secretari of the provinc of new netherland write in dutch in for the inform of those who wish to take up land there state more particularli that those in new netherland and especi in new england who have no mean to build farmhous at first accord to their wish dig a squar pit in the ground cellar fashion six

floor thi cellar with plank and wainscot it overhead for a ceil rais a roof of spar clear up and cover the spar with bark or green sod so that thei can live dry and warm in these hous with their entir famili for two three and four year it be understood that partit ar run through those cellar which ar adapt to the size of the famili the wealthi and princip men in new england in the begin of the coloni commenc their first dwellinghous in thi fashion for two reason firstli in order not to wast time in build and not to want food the next season secondli in order not to discourag poor labor peopl whom thei brought over in number from fatherland in the cours of three or four year when the countri becam adapt to agricultur thei built themselv handsom hous spend on them sever thousand in thi cours which our ancestor took there wa a show of prudenc at least as if their principl were to satisfi the more press want first but ar the more press want satisfi now when i think of acquir for myself on of our luxuri dwell i am deter for so to speak the countri is not yet adapt to human cultur and we ar still forc to cut our spiritu bread far thinner than our forefath did their wheaten not that all architectur ornament is to be neglect even in the rudest period but let our hous first be line with beauti where thei come in contact with our live like the tenement of the shellfish and not overlaid with it but ala i have been insid on or two of them and know what thei ar line with though we ar not so degener but that we might possibl live in a cave or a wigwam or wear skin todai it certainli is better to accept the advantag though so dearli bought which the invent and industri of mankind offer in such a neighborhood as thi board and shingl lime and brick ar cheaper and more easili obtain than suitabl cave or whole log or bark in suffici quantiti or even welltemp clai or flat stone i speak understandingli on thi subject for i have made myself acquaint with it both theoret and practic with a littl more wit we might us these materi so as to becom richer than the richest now ar and make our civil a bless the civil man is a more experienc and wiser savag but to make hast to my own experi near the end of march i borrow an ax and went down to the wood by walden pond nearest to where i intend to build my hous and began to cut down some tall arrowi white pine still in their youth for timber it is difficult to begin without borrow but perhap it is the most gener cours thu to permit your fellowmen to have an interest in your enterpris the owner of the ax as he releas hi hold on it said that it wa the appl of hi ey but i return it sharper than i receiv it it wa a pleasant hillsid where i work cover with pine wood through which i look out on the pond and a small open field in the wood where pine and hickori were spring up the ic in the pond wa not yet dissolv though there were some open space and it wa all darkcolor and satur with water there were some slight flurri of snow dure the dai that i work there but for the most part when i came out on to the railroad on my wai home it yellow sand heap stretch awai gleam in the hazi atmospher and the rail shone in the spring sun and i heard the lark and pewe and other bird alreadi come to commenc anoth year with us thei were pleasant spring dai in which the winter of man discont wa thaw as well as the earth and the life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself on dai when my ax had come off and i had cut a green hickori for a wedg drive it with a stone and had place the whole to soak in a pondhol in order to swell the wood i saw a stripe snake run into the water and he lai on the bottom appar without inconveni as long as i stai there or more than a quarter of an hour perhap becaus he had not yet fairli come out of the torpid state it appear to me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and primit condit but if thei should feel the influenc of the spring of spring arous them thei would of necess rise to a higher and more ether life i had previous seen the snake in frosti morn in my path with portion of their bodi still numb and inflex wait for the sun to thaw them on the st of april it rain and melt the ic and in the earli part of the dai which wa veri foggi i heard a strai goos grope about over the pond and cackl as if lost or like the spirit of the fog so i went on for some dai cut and hew timber and also stud and rafter all with my narrow ax not have mani communic or scholarlik thought sing to myself men sai thei know mani thing but lo thei have taken wing the art and scienc and a thousand applianc the wind that blow is all that ani bodi know i hew the main timber six inch squar most of the stud on two side onli and the rafter and floor timber on on side leav the rest of the bark on so that thei were just as straight and much stronger than saw on each stick wa carefulli mortis or tenon by it stump for i had borrow other tool by thi time my dai in the

gave me a note or two as i drove along the woodland path i wa inform treacher by a young patrick that neighbor seelei an irishman in the interv of the cart transfer the still toler straight and drivabl nail stapl and spike to hi pocket and then stood when i came back to pass the time of dai and look freshli up unconcern with spring thought at the devast there be a dearth of work as he said he wa there to repres spectatordom and help make thi seemingli insignific event on with the remov of the god of troi i dug my cellar in the side of a hill slope to the south where a woodchuck had formerli dug hi burrow down through sumach and blackberri root and the lowest stain of veget six feet squar by seven deep to a fine sand where potato would not freez in ani winter the side were left shelv and not stone but the sun have never shone on them the sand still keep it place it wa but two hour work i took particular pleasur in thi break of ground for in almost all latitud men dig into the earth for an equabl temperatur under the most splendid hous in the citi is still to be found the cellar where thei store their root as of old and long after the superstructur ha disappear poster remark it dent in the earth the hous is still but a sort of porch at the entranc of a burrow at length in the begin of mai with the help of some of my acquaint rather to improv so good an occas for neighborli than from ani necess i set up the frame of my hous no man wa ever more honor in the charact of hi raiser than i thei ar destin i trust to assist at the rais of loftier structur on dai i began to occupi my hous on the th of juli as soon as it wa board and roof for the board were carefulli featheredg and lap so that it wa perfectli impervi to rain but befor board i laid the foundat of a chimnei at on end bring two cartload of stone up the hill from the pond in my arm i built the chimnei after my hoe in the fall befor a fire becam necessari for warmth do my cook in the meanwhil out of door on the ground earli in the morn which mode i still think is in some respect more conveni and agreeabl than the usual on when it storm befor my bread wa bake i fix a few board over the fire and sat under them to watch my loaf and pass some pleasant hour in that wai in those dai when my hand were much emploi i read but littl but the least scrap of paper which lai on the ground my holder or tablecloth afford me as much entertain in fact answer the same purpos as the iliad it would be worth the while to build still more deliber than i did consid for instanc what foundat a door a window a cellar a garret have in the natur of man and perchanc never rais ani superstructur until we found a better reason for it than our tempor necess even there is some of the same fit in a man build hi own hous that there is in a bird build it own nest who know but if men construct their dwell with their own hand and provid food for themselv and famili simpli and honestli enough the poetic faculti would be univers develop as bird univers sing when thei ar so engag but ala we do like cowbird and cuckoo which lai their egg in nest which other bird have built and cheer no travel with their chatter and unmus note shall we forev resign the pleasur of construct to the carpent what doe architectur amount to in the experi of the mass of men i never in all my walk came across a man engag in so simpl and natur an occup as build hi hous we belong to the commun it is not the tailor alon who is the ninth part of a man it is as much the preacher and the merchant and the farmer where is thi divis of labor to end and what object doe it final serv no doubt anoth mai also think for me but it is not therefor desir that he should do so to the exclus of my think for myself true there ar architect so call in thi countri and i have heard of on at least possess with the idea of make architectur ornament have a core of truth a necess and henc a beauti as if it were a revel to him all veri well perhap from hi point of view but onli a littl better than the common dilettant a sentiment reform in architectur he began at the cornic not at the foundat it wa onli how to put a core of truth within the ornament that everi sugarplum in fact might have an almond or carawai seed in itthough i hold that almond ar most wholesom without the sugarand not how the inhabit the indwel might build truli within and without and let the ornament take care of themselv what reason man ever suppos that ornament were someth outward and in the skin merelythat the tortois got hi spot shell or the shellfish it motheropearl tint by such a contract as the inhabit of broadwai their triniti church but a man ha no more to do with the style of architectur of hi hous than a tortois with that of it shell nor need the soldier be so idl as to try to paint the precis color of hi virtu on hi standard the enemi will find it out he mai turn pale when the trial come thi man seem to me to lean over the cornic and timidli whisper hi half truth to the rude occup who realli knew it better than he what of architectur beauti i now see i know ha gradual grown from within outward out of the necess and charact of the indwel who is the onli builderout of some unconsci truth and nobl without ever a thought for the appear and whatev addit beauti of thi kind is destin to be produc will be preced by a like unconsci beauti of life the most interest dwell in thi countri as the painter know ar the most unpretend humbl log hut and cottag of the poor commonli it is the life of the inhabit whose shell thei ar and not ani peculiar in their surfac mere which make them picturesqu and equal interest will be the citizen suburban box when hi life shall be as simpl and as agreeabl to the imagin and there is as littl strain after effect in the style of hi dwell a great proport of architectur ornament ar liter hollow and a septemb gale would strip them off like borrow plume without injuri to the substanti thei can do without architectur who have no oliv nor wine in the cellar what if an equal ado were made about the ornament of style in literatur and the architect of our bibl spent as much time about their cornic as the architect of our church do so ar made the belleslettr and the beauxart and their professor much it concern a man forsooth how a few stick ar slant over him or under him and what color ar daub upon hi box it would signifi somewhat if in ani earnest sens he slant them and daub it but the spirit have depart out of the tenant it is of a piec with construct hi own coffinth architectur of the graveand carpent is but anoth name for coffinmak on man sai in hi despair or indiffer to life take up a hand of the earth at your feet and paint your hous that color is he think of hi last and narrow hous toss up a copper for it as well what an abund of leisur he must have why do you take up a hand of dirt better paint your hous your own complexion let it turn pale or blush for you an enterpris to improv the style of cottag architectur when you have got my ornament readi i will wear them befor winter i built a chimnei and shingl the side of my hous which were alreadi impervi to rain with imperfect and sappi shingl made of the first slice of the log whose edg i wa oblig to straighten with a plane i have thu a tight shingl and plaster hous ten feet wide by fifteen long and eightfeet post with a garret and a closet a larg window on each side two trap door on door at the end and a brick fireplac opposit the exact cost of my hous pai the usual price for such materi as i us but not count the work all of which wa done by myself wa as follow and i give the detail becaus veri few ar abl to tell exactli what their hous cost and fewer still if ani the separ cost of the variou materi which compos them board mostli shanti board refus shingl for roof side lath two secondhand window with glass on thousand old brick two cask of lime that wa high hair more than i need mantletre iron nail hing and screw latch chalk transport i carri a good part on my back in all these ar all the materi except the timber stone and sand which i claim by squatter right i have also a small woodsh adjoin made chiefli of the stuff which wa left after build the hous i intend to build me a hous which will surpass ani on the main street in concord in grandeur and luxuri as soon as it pleas me as much and will cost me no more than my present on i thu found that the student who wish for a shelter can obtain on for a lifetim at an expens not greater than the rent which he now pai annual if i seem to boast more than is becom my excus is that i brag for human rather than for myself and my shortcom and inconsist do not affect the truth of my statement notwithstand much cant and hypocrisychaff which i find it difficult to separ from my wheat but for which i am as sorri as ani mani will breath freeli and stretch myself in thi respect it is such a relief to both the moral and physic system and i am resolv that i will not through humil becom the devil attornei i will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth at cambridg colleg the mere rent of a student room which is onli a littl larger than my own is thirti dollar each year though the corpor had the advantag of build thirtytwo side by side and under on roof and the occup suffer the inconveni of mani and noisi neighbor and perhap a resid in the fourth stori i cannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these respect not onli less educ would be need becaus forsooth more would alreadi have been acquir but the pecuniari expens of get an educ would in a great measur vanish those conveni which the student requir at cambridg or elsewher cost him or somebodi els ten time as great a sacrific of life as thei would with proper manag on both side those thing for which the most monei is demand ar never the thing which the student most want tuition for instanc is an import item in the term bill while for the far more valuabl educ which he get by associ with the most cultiv of hi contemporari no charg is made the mode of found a colleg is commonli to get up a subscript of dollar and cent and then follow blindli the principl of a divis of labor to it extremea principl which should never be follow but with circumspectionto call in a contractor who make thi a subject of specul and he emploi irishmen or other oper actual to lai the foundat while the student that ar to be ar said to be fit themselv for it and for these oversight success gener have to pai i think that it would be better than thi for the student or those who desir to be benefit by it even to lai the foundat themselv the student who secur hi covet leisur and retir by systemat shirk ani labor necessari to man obtain but an ignobl and unprofit leisur defraud himself of the experi which alon can make leisur fruit but sai on you do not mean that the student should go to work with their hand instead of their head i do not mean that exactli but i mean someth which he might think a good deal like that i mean that thei should not plai life or studi it mere while the commun support them at thi expens game but earnestli live it from begin to end how could youth better learn to live than by at onc try the experi of live methink thi would exercis their mind as much as mathemat if i wish a boi to know someth about the art and scienc for instanc i would not pursu the common cours which is mere to send him into the neighborhood of some professor where anyth is profess and practis but the art of lifeto survei the world through a telescop or a microscop and never with hi natur ey to studi chemistri and not learn how hi bread is made or mechan and not learn how it is earn to discov new satellit to neptun and not detect the mote in hi ey or to what vagabond he is a satellit himself or to be devour by the monster that swarm all around him while contempl the monster in a drop of vinegar which would have advanc

attent from seriou thing thei ar but improv mean to an unimprov end an end which it wa alreadi but too easi to arriv at as railroad lead to boston or new york we ar in great hast to construct a magnet telegraph from main to texa but main and texa it mai be have noth import to commun either is in such a predica as the man who wa earnest to be introduc to a distinguish deaf woman but when he wa present and on end of her ear trumpet wa put into hi hand had noth to sai as if the main object were to talk fast and not to talk sensibl we ar eager to tunnel under the atlant and bring the old world some week nearer to the new but perchanc the first new that will leak through into the broad flap american ear will be that the princess adelaid ha the whoop cough after all the man whose hors trot a mile in a minut doe not carri the most import messag he is not an evangelist nor doe he come round eat locust and wild honei i doubt if fly childer ever carri a peck of corn to mill on sai to me i wonder that you do not lai up monei you love to travel you might take the car and go to fitchburg todai and see the countri but i am wiser than that i have learn that the swiftest travel is he that goe afoot i sai to my friend suppos we try who will get there first the distanc is thirti mile the fare nineti cent that is almost a dai wage i rememb when wage were sixti cent a dai for labor on thi veri road well i start now on foot and get there befor night i have travel at that rate by the week togeth you will in the meanwhil have earn your fare and arriv there some time tomorrow or possibl thi even if you ar lucki enough to get a job in season instead of go to fitchburg you will be work here the greater part of the dai and so if the railroad reach round the world i think that i should keep ahead of you and as for see the countri and get experi of that kind i should have to cut your acquaint altogeth such is the univers law which no man can ever outwit and with regard to the railroad even we mai sai it is as broad as it is long to make a railroad round the world avail to all mankind is equival to grade the whole surfac of the planet men have an indistinct notion that if thei keep up thi activ of joint stock and spade long enough all will at length ride somewher in next to no time and for noth but though a crowd rush to the depot and the conductor shout all aboard when the smoke is blown awai and the vapor condens it will be perceiv that a few ar ride but the rest ar run overand it will be call and will be a melancholi accid no doubt thei can ride at last who shall have earn their fare that is if thei surviv so long but thei will probabl have lost their elast and desir to travel by that time thi spend of the best part of on life earn monei in order to enjoi a question liberti dure the least valuabl part of it remind me of the englishman who went to india to make a fortun first in order that he might return to england and live the life of a poet he should have gone up garret at onc what exclaim a million irishmen start up from all the shanti in the land is not thi railroad which we have built a good thing ye i answer compar good that is you might have done wors but i wish as you ar brother of mine that you could have spent your time better than dig in thi dirt befor i finish my hous wish to earn ten or twelv dollar by some honest and agreeabl method in order to meet my unusu expens i plant about two acr and a half of light and sandi soil near it chiefli with bean but also a small part with potato corn pea and turnip the whole lot contain eleven acr mostli grow up to pine and hickori and wa sold the preced season for eight dollar and eight cent an acr on farmer said that it wa good for noth but to rais cheep squirrel on i put no manur whatev on thi land not be the owner but mere a squatter and not expect to cultiv so much again and i did not quit hoe it all onc i got out sever cord of stump in plow which suppli me with fuel for a long time and left small circl of virgin mould easili distinguish through the summer by the greater luxuri of the bean there the dead and for the most part unmerchant wood behind my hous and the driftwood from the pond have suppli the remaind of my fuel i wa oblig to hire a team and a man for the plow though i held the plow myself my farm outgo for the first season were for implement seed work etc the seed corn wa given me thi never cost anyth to speak of unless you plant more than enough i got twelv bushel of bean and eighteen bushel of potato besid some pea and sweet corn the yellow corn and turnip were too late to come to anyth my whole incom from the farm wa deduct the outgo there ar left besid produc consum and on hand at the time thi estim wa made of the valu of the amount on hand much more than balanc a littl grass which i did not rais all thing consid that is consid the import of a man soul and of todai notwithstand the short time occupi by my experi nai partli even becaus of it transient charact i believ that that wa do better than ani farmer in concord did that year the next year i did better still for i spade up all the land which i requir about a third of an acr and i learn from the experi of both year not be in the least aw by mani celebr work on husbandri arthur young among the rest that if on would live simpli and eat onli the crop which he rais and rais no more than he at and not exchang it for an insuffici quantiti of more luxuri and expens thing he would need to cultiv onli a few rod of ground and that it would be cheaper to spade up that than to us oxen to plow it and to select a fresh spot from time to time than to manur the old and he could do all hi necessari farm work as it were with hi left hand at odd hour in the summer and thu he would not be ti to an ox or hors or cow or pig as at present i desir to speak imparti on thi point and as on not interest in the success or failur of the present econom and social arrang i wa more independ than ani farmer in concord for i wa not anchor to a hous or farm but could follow the bent of my geniu which is a veri crook on everi moment besid be better off than thei alreadi if my hous had been burn or my crop had fail i should have been nearli as well off as befor i am wont to think that men ar not so much the keeper of herd as herd ar the keeper of men the former ar so much the freer men and oxen exchang work but if we consid necessari work onli the oxen will be seen to have greatli the advantag their farm is so much the larger man doe some of hi part of the exchang work in hi six week of hai and it is no boi plai certainli no nation that live simpli in all respect that is no nation of philosoph would commit so great a blunder as to us the labor of anim true there never wa and is not like soon to be a nation of philosoph nor am i certain it is desir that there should be howev i should never have broken a hors or bull and taken him to board for ani work he might do for me for fear i should becom a horseman or a herdsman mere and if societi seem to be the gainer by so do ar we certain that what is on man gain is not anoth loss and that the stableboi ha equal caus with hi master to be satisfi grant that some public work would not have been construct without thi aid and let man share the glori of such with the ox and hors doe it follow that he could not have accomplish work yet more worthi of himself in that case when men begin to do not mere unnecessari or artist but luxuri and idl work with their assist it is inevit that a few do all the exchang work with the oxen or in other word becom the slave of the strongest man thu not onli work for the anim within him but for a symbol of thi he work for the anim without him though we have mani substanti hous of brick or stone the prosper of the farmer is still measur by the degre to which the barn overshadow the hous thi town is said to have the largest hous for oxen cow and hors hereabout and it is not behindhand in it public build but there ar veri few hall for free worship or free speech in thi counti it should not be by their architectur but why not even by their power of abstract thought that nation should seek to commemor themselv how much more admir the bhagvatgeeta than all the ruin of the east tower and templ ar the luxuri of princ a simpl and independ mind doe not toil at the bid

not most of the stone a nation hammer goe toward it tomb onli it buri itself aliv as for the pyramid there is noth to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so mani men could be found degrad enough to spend their live construct a tomb for some ambiti boobi whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have drown in the nile and then given hi bodi to the dog i might possibl invent some excus for them and him but i have no time for it as for the religion and love of art of the builder it is much the same all the world over whether the build be an egyptian templ or the unit state bank

it be a light on and do not nip me in a vital part but perchanc it would be wisest never to put on paw into it i would observ by the wai that it cost me noth for curtain for i have no gazer to shut out but the sun and moon and i am will that thei should look in the moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of mine nor will the sun injur my furnitur or fade my carpet and if he is sometim too warm a friend i find it still better economi to retreat behind some curtain which natur ha provid than to add a singl item to the detail of housekeep a ladi onc offer me a mat but as i had no room to spare within the hous nor time to spare within or without to shake it i declin it prefer to wipe my feet on the sod befor my door it is best to avoid the begin of evil not long sinc i wa present at the

previous provid themselv with new cloth new pot pan and other household utensil and furnitur thei collect all their worn out cloth and other despic thing sweep and cleans their hous squar and the whole town of their filth which with all the remain grain and other old provis thei cast togeth into on common heap and consum it with fire after have taken medicin and fast for three dai all the fire

the end of everi fiftytwo year in the belief that it wa time for the world to come to an end i have scarc heard of a truer sacrament that is as the dictionari defin it outward and visibl sign of an inward and spiritu grace than thi and i have no doubt that thei were origin inspir directli from heaven to do thu though thei have no biblic record of the revel for more than five year i maintain myself thu sole by the labor of my hand and i found that by work about six week in a year i could meet all the expens of live the whole of my winter as well as most of my summer i had free and clear for studi i have thoroughli tri schoolkeep and found that my expens were in proport or rather out of proport to my incom for i wa oblig to dress and train not to sai think and believ accordingli and i lost my time into the bargain as i did not teach for the good of my fellowmen but simpli for a livelihood thi wa a failur i have tri trade but i found that it would take ten year to get under wai in that and that then i should probabl be on my wai to the devil i wa actual afraid that i might by that time be do what is call a good busi when formerli i wa look about to see what i could do for a live some sad experi in conform to the wish of friend be fresh in my mind to tax my ingenu i thought often and serious of pick huckleberri that sure i could do and it small profit might sufficefor my greatest skill ha been to want but littleso littl capit it requir so littl distract from my wont mood i foolishli thought while my acquaint went unhesitatingli into trade or the profess i contempl thi occup as most like their rang the hill all summer to pick the berri which came in my wai and thereaft carelessli dispos of them so to keep the flock of admetu i also dream that i might gather the wild herb or carri evergreen to such villag as love to be remind of the wood even to the citi by haycart load but i have sinc learn that trade curs everyth it handl and though you trade in messag from heaven the whole curs of trade attach to the busi as i prefer some thing to other and especi valu my freedom as i could fare hard and yet succe well i did not wish to spend my time in earn rich carpet or other fine furnitur or delic cookeri or a hous in the grecian or the gothic style just yet if there ar ani to whom it is no interrupt to acquir these thing and who know how to us them when acquir i relinquish to them the pursuit some ar industri and appear to love labor for it own sake or perhap becaus it keep them out of wors mischief to such i have at present noth to sai those who would not know what to do with more leisur than thei now enjoi i might advis to work twice as hard as thei dowork till thei pai for themselv and get their free paper for myself i found that the occup of a daylabor wa the most independ of ani especi as it requir onli thirti or forti dai in a year to support on the labor dai end with the go down of the sun and he is then free to devot himself to hi chosen pursuit independ of hi labor but hi employ who specul from month to month ha no respit from on end of the year to the other in short i am convinc both by faith and experi that to maintain on self on thi earth is not a hardship but a pastim if we will live simpli and wise as the pursuit of the simpler nation ar still the sport of the more artifici it is not necessari that a man should earn hi live by the sweat of hi brow unless he sweat easier than i do on young man of my acquaint who ha inherit some acr told me that he thought he should live as i did if he had the mean i would not have ani on adopt my mode of live on ani account for besid that befor he ha fairli learn it i mai have found out anoth for myself i desir that there mai be as mani differ person in the world as possibl but i would have each on be veri care to find out and pursu hi own wai and not hi father or hi mother or hi neighbor instead the youth mai build or plant or sail onli let him not be hinder from do that which he tell me he would like to do it is by a mathemat point onli that we ar wise as the sailor or the fugit slave keep the polestar in hi ey but that is suffici guidanc for all our life we mai not arriv at our port within a calcul period but we would preserv the true cours undoubtedli in thi case what is true for on is truer still for a thousand as a larg hous is not proportion more expens than a small on sinc on roof mai cover on cellar underli and on wall separ sever apart but for my part i prefer the solitari dwell moreov it will commonli be cheaper to build the whole yourself than to convinc anoth of the advantag of the common wall and when you have done thi the common partit to be much cheaper must be a thin on and that other mai prove a bad neighbor and also not keep hi side in repair the onli cooper which is commonli possibl is exceedingli partial and superfici and what littl true cooper there is is as if it were not be a harmoni inaud to men if a man ha faith he will cooper with equal faith everywher if he ha not faith he will continu to live like the rest of the world whatev compani he is join to to cooper in the highest as well as the lowest sens mean to get our live togeth i heard it propos late that two young men should travel togeth over the world the on without monei earn hi mean as he went befor the mast and behind the plow the other carri a bill of exchang in hi pocket it wa easi to see that thei could not long be companion or cooper sinc on would not oper at all thei would part at the first interest crisi in their adventur abov all as i have impli the man who goe alon can start todai but he who travel with anoth must wait till that other is readi and it mai be a long time befor thei get off but all thi is veri selfish i have heard some of my townsmen sai i confess that i have hitherto indulg veri littl in philanthrop enterpris i have made some sacrific to a sens of duti and among other have sacrif thi pleasur also there ar those who have us all their art to persuad me to undertak the support of some poor famili in the town and if i had noth to dofor the devil find employ for the idlei might try my hand at some such pastim as that howev when i have thought to indulg myself in thi respect and lai their heaven under an oblig by maintain certain poor person in all respect as comfort as i maintain myself and have even ventur so far as to make them the offer thei have on and all unhesitatingli prefer to remain poor while my townsmen and women ar devot in so mani wai to the good of their fellow i trust that on at least mai be spare to other and less human pursuit you must have a geniu for chariti as well as for anyth els as for doinggood that is on of the profess which ar full moreov i have tri it fairli and strang as it mai seem am satisfi that it doe not agre with my constitut probabl i should not conscious and deliber forsak my particular call to do the good which societi demand of me to save the univers from annihil and i believ that a like but infinit greater steadfast elsewher is all that now preserv it but i would not stand between ani man and hi geniu and to him who doe thi work which i declin with hi whole heart and soul and life i would sai persever even if the world call it do evil as it is most like thei will i am far from suppos that my case is a peculiar on no doubt mani of my reader would make a similar defenc at do somethingi will not engag that my neighbor shall pronounc it goodi do not hesit to sai that i should be a capit fellow to hire but what that is it is for my employ to find out what good i do in the common sens of that word must be asid from my main path and for the most part wholli unintend men sai practic begin where you ar and such as you ar without aim mainli to becom of more worth and with kind aforethought go about do good if i were to preach at all in thi strain i should sai rather set about be good as if the sun should stop when he had kindl hi fire up to the splendor of a moon or a star of the sixth magnitud and go about like a robin goodfellow peep in at everi cottag window inspir lunat and taint meat and make dark visibl instead of steadili increas hi genial heat and benefic till he is of such bright that no mortal can look him in the face and then and in the meanwhil too go about the world in hi own orbit do it good or rather as a truer philosophi ha discov the world go about him get good when phaeton wish to prove hi heavenli birth by hi benefic had the sun chariot but on dai and drove out of the beaten track he burn sever block of hous in the lower street of heaven and scorch the surfac of the earth and dri up everi spring and made the great desert of sahara till at length jupit hurl him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt and the sun through grief at hi death did not shine for a year there is no odor so bad as that which aris from good taint it is human it is divin carrion if i knew for a certainti that a man wa come to my hous with the consciou design of do me good i should run for my life as from that dry and parch wind of the african desert call the simoom which fill the mouth and nose and ear and ey with dust till you ar suffoc for fear that i should get some of hi good done to mesom of it viru mingl with my blood noin thi case i would rather suffer evil the natur wai a man is not a good man to me becaus he will feed me if i should be starv or warm me if i should be freez or pull me out of a ditch if i should ever fall into on i can find you a newfoundland dog that will do as much philanthropi is not love for on fellowman in the broadest sens howard wa no doubt an exceedingli kind and worthi man in hi wai and ha hi reward but compar speak what ar a hundr howard to us if their philanthropi do not help us in our best estat when we ar most worthi to be help i never heard of a philanthrop meet in which it wa sincer propos to do ani good to me or the like of me the jesuit were quit balk by those indian who be burn at the stake suggest new mode of tortur to their tormentor be superior to physic suffer it sometim chanc that thei were superior to ani consol which the missionari could offer and

freeli forgiv them all thei did be sure that you give the poor the aid thei most need though it be your exampl which leav them far behind if you give monei spend yourself with it and do not mere abandon it to them we make curiou mistak sometim often the poor man is not so cold and hungri as he is dirti and rag and gross it is partli hi tast and not mere hi misfortun if you give him monei he will perhap bui more rag with it i wa wont to piti the clumsi irish labor who cut ic on the pond in such mean and rag cloth while i shiver in my more tidi and somewhat more fashion garment till on bitter cold dai on who had slip into the water came to my hous to warm him and i saw him strip off three pair of pant and two pair of stock er he got down to the skin though thei were dirti and rag enough it is true and that he could afford to refus the extra garment which i offer him he had so mani intra on thi duck wa the veri thing he need then i began to piti myself and i saw that it would be a greater chariti to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole slopshop on him there ar a thousand hack at the branch of evil to on who is strike at the root and it mai be that he who bestow the largest amount of time and monei on the needi is do the most by hi mode of life to produc that miseri which he strive in vain to reliev it is the piou slavebreed devot the proce of everi tenth slave

buffet the winter through and see the spring come in the futur inhabit of thi region wherev thei mai place their hous mai be sure that thei have been anticip an afternoon suffic to lai out the land

perchanc for a man is rich in proport to the number of thing which he can afford to let alon my imagin carri me so far that i even had the refus of sever farmsth refus wa all i wantedbut i never got my finger burn by actual possess the nearest that i came to actual possess wa when i bought the hollowel place and had begun to sort my seed and collect materi with which to make a wheelbarrow to carri it on or off with but befor the owner gave me a deed of it hi wifeeveri man ha such a wifechang her mind and wish to keep it and he offer me ten dollar to releas him now to speak the truth i had but ten cent in the world and it surpass my arithmet to tell if i wa that man who had ten cent or who had a farm or ten dollar or all togeth howev i let him keep the ten dollar and the farm too for i had carri it far enough or rather to be gener i sold him the farm for just what i gave for it and as he wa not a rich man made him a present of ten dollar and still had my ten cent and seed and materi for a wheelbarrow left i found thu that i had been a rich man without ani damag to my poverti but i retain the landscap and i have sinc annual carri off what it yield without a wheelbarrow with respect to landscap i am monarch of all i survei my right there is none to disput i have frequent seen a poet withdraw have enjoi the most valuabl part of a farm while the crusti farmer suppos that he

on as i have said i do not propos to write an od to deject but to brag as lustili as chanticl in the morn stand on hi roost if onli to wake my neighbor up when first i took up my abod in the wood that is began to spend my night as well as dai there which by accid wa on independ dai or the fourth of juli my hous wa not finish for winter but wa mere a defenc against the rain without plaster or chimnei the wall be of rough weatherstain board with wide chink which made it cool at night the upright white hewn stud and freshli plane door and window case gave it a clean and airi look especi in the morn when it timber were satur with dew so that i fanci that by noon some sweet gum would exud from them to my imagin it retain throughout the dai more or less of thi auror charact remind me of a certain hous on a mountain which i had visit a year befor thi wa an airi and unplast cabin fit to entertain a travel god and where a goddess might trail her garment the wind which pass over my dwell were such as sweep over the ridg of mountain bear the broken strain or celesti part onli of terrestri music the morn wind forev blow the poem of creation is uninterrupt but few ar the ear that hear it olympu is but the outsid of the earth everywher the onli hous i had been the owner of befor if i except a boat wa a tent which i us occasion when make excurs in the summer and thi is still roll up in my garret but the boat after pass from hand to hand ha gone down the stream of time with thi more substanti shelter about me i had made some progress toward settl in the world thi frame so slightli clad wa a sort of crystal around me and react on the builder it wa suggest somewhat as a pictur in outlin i did not need to go outdoor to take the air for the atmospher within had lost none of it fresh it wa not so much within door as behind a door where i sat even in the rainiest weather the harivansa sai an abod without bird is like a meat without season such wa not my abod for i found myself suddenli neighbor to the bird not by have imprison on but have cage myself near them i wa not onli nearer to some of those which commonli frequent the garden and the orchard but to those smaller and more thrill songster of the forest which never or rare serenad a villagerth wood thrush the veeri the scarlet tanag the field sparrow the whippoorwil and mani other i wa seat by the shore of a small pond about a mile and a half south of the villag of concord and somewhat higher than it in the midst of an extens wood between that town and lincoln and about two mile south of that our onli field known to fame concord battl ground but i wa so low in the wood that the opposit shore half a mile off like the rest cover with wood wa my most distant horizon for the first week whenev i look out on the pond it impress me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain it bottom far abov the surfac of other lake and as the sun aros i saw it throw off it nightli cloth of mist and here and there by degre it soft rippl or it smooth reflect surfac wa reveal while the mist like ghost were stealthili withdraw in everi direct into the wood as at the break up of some nocturn conventicl the veri dew seem to hang upon the tree later into the dai than usual as on the side of mountain thi small lake wa of most valu as a neighbor in the interv of a gentl rainstorm in august when both air and water be perfectli still but the sky overcast midafternoon had all the seren of even and the wood thrush sang around and wa heard from shore to shore a lake like thi is never smoother than at such a time and the clear portion of the air abov it be shallow and darken by cloud the water full of light and reflect becom a lower heaven itself so much the more import from a hilltop near by where the wood had been recent cut off there wa a pleas vista southward across the pond through a wide indent in the hill which form the shore there where their opposit side slope toward each other suggest a stream flow out in that direct through a wood vallei but stream there wa none that wai i look between and over the near green hill to some distant and higher on in the horizon ting with blue inde by

thirti mile an hour without a doubt whether thei do or not but whether we should live like baboon or like men is a littl uncertain if we do not get out sleeper and forg rail and devot dai and night to

from the read of a book the book exist for us perchanc which will explain our miracl and reveal new on the at present unutter thing we mai find somewher utter these same question that disturb and

establish worship among men let him humbl commun with zoroast then and through the liber influenc of all the worthi with jesu christ himself and let our church go by the board we boast that we belong to the nineteenth centuri and ar make the most rapid stride of ani nation but consid how littl thi villag doe for it own cultur i do not wish to flatter my townsmen nor to be flatter by them for that will not advanc either of us we need to be provokedgoad like oxen as we ar into a trot we have a compar decent system of common school school for infant onli but except the halfstarv lyceum in the winter and latterli the puni begin of a librari suggest by the state no school for ourselv we spend more on almost ani articl of bodili aliment or ailment than on our mental aliment it is time that we had uncommon school that we did not leav off our educ when we begin to be men and women it is time that villag were univers and their elder inhabit the fellow of univers with leisureif thei ar inde so well offto pursu liber studi the rest of their live shall the world be confin to on pari or on oxford forev cannot student be board here and get a liber educ under the ski of concord can we not hire some abelard to lectur to us ala what with fodder the cattl and tend the store we ar kept from school too long and our educ is sadli neglect in thi countri the villag should in some respect take the place of the nobleman of europ it should be the patron of the fine art it is rich enough it want onli the magnanim and refin it can spend monei enough on such thing as farmer and trader valu but it is thought utopian to propos spend monei for thing which more intellig men know to be of far more worth thi town ha spent seventeen thousand dollar on a townhous thank fortun or polit but probabl it will not spend so much on live wit the true meat to put into that shell in a hundr year the on hundr and twentyf dollar annual subscrib for a lyceum in the winter is better spent than ani other equal sum rais in the town if we live in the nineteenth centuri why should we not enjoi the advantag which the nineteenth centuri offer why should our life be in ani respect provinci if we will read newspap why not skip the gossip of boston and take the best newspap in the world at oncenot be suck the pap of neutral famili paper or brows oliv branch here in new england let the report of all the learn societi come to us and we will see if thei know anyth why should we leav it to harper brother and red co to select our read as the nobleman of cultiv tast surround himself with whatev conduc to hi culturegeniuslearningwitbook paintingsstatuarymusicphilosoph instrument and the like so let the villag donot stop short at a pedagogu a parson a sexton a parish librari and three selectmen becaus our pilgrim forefath got through a cold winter onc on a bleak rock with these to act collect is accord to the spirit of our institut and i am confid that as our circumst ar more flourish our mean ar greater than the nobleman new england can hire all the wise men in the world to come and teach her and board them round the while and not be provinci at all that is the uncommon school we want instead of noblemen let us have nobl villag of men if it is necessari omit on bridg over the river go round a littl there and throw on arch at least over the darker gulf of ignor which surround us sound but while we ar confin to book though the most select and classic and read onli particular written languag which ar themselv but dialect and provinci we ar in danger of forget the languag which all thing

you throw two stone into calm water so near that thei break each other undul if we ar mere loquaci and loud talker then we can afford to stand veri near togeth cheek by jowl and feel each other breath

physic endur and content he wa cousin to the pine and the rock i ask him onc if he wa not sometim tire at night after work all dai and he answer with a sincer and seriou look gorrappit i never wa tire in my life but the intellectu and what is call spiritu man in him were slumber as in an infant he had been instruct onli in that innoc and ineffectu wai in which the cathol priest teach the aborigin by which the pupil is never educ to the degre of conscious but onli to the degre of trust and rever and a child is not made a man but kept a child when natur made him she gave him a strong bodi and content for hi portion and prop him on everi side with rever and relianc that he might live out hi threescor year and ten a child he wa so genuin and unsophist that no introduct would serv to introduc him more than if you introduc a woodchuck to your neighbor he had got to find him out as you did he would not plai ani part men paid him wage for work and so help to feed and cloth him but he never exchang opinion with them he wa so simpli and natur humbleif he can be call humbl who never aspiresthat humil wa no distinct qualiti in him nor could he conceiv of it wiser men were demigod to him if you told him that such a on wa come he did as if he thought that anyth so grand would expect noth of himself but take all the respons on itself and let him be forgotten still he never heard the sound of prais he particularli reverenc the writer and the preacher their perform were miracl when i told him that i wrote consider he thought for a long time that it wa mere the handwrit which i meant for he could write a remark good hand himself i sometim found the name of hi nativ parish handsom written in the snow by the highwai with the proper french accent and knew that he had pass i ask him if he ever wish to write hi thought he said that he had read and written letter for those who could not but he never tri to write thoughtsno he could not he could not tell what to put first it would kill him and then there wa spell to be attend to at the same time i heard that a distinguish wise man and reform ask him if he did not want the world to be chang but he answer with a chuckl of surpris in hi canadian accent not know that the question had ever been entertain befor no i like it well enough it would have suggest mani thing to a philosoph to have deal with him to a stranger he appear to know noth of thing in gener yet i sometim saw in him a man whom i had not seen befor and i did not know whether he wa as wise as shakespear or as simpli ignor as a child whether to suspect him of a fine poetic conscious or of stupid a townsman told me that when he met him saunter through the villag in hi small closefit cap and whistl to himself he remind him of a princ in disguis hi onli book were an almanac and an arithmet in which last he wa consider expert the former wa a sort of cyclopaedia to him which he suppos to contain an abstract of human knowledg as inde it doe to a consider extent i love to sound him on the variou reform of the dai and he never fail to look at them in the most simpl and practic light he had never heard of such thing befor could he do without factori i ask he had worn the homemad vermont grai he said and that wa good could he dispens with tea and coffe did thi countri afford ani beverag besid water he had soak hemlock leav in water and drank it and thought that wa better than water in warm weather when i ask him if he could do without monei he show the conveni of monei in such a wai as to suggest and coincid with the most philosoph account of the origin of thi institut and the veri deriv of the word pecunia if an ox were hi properti and he wish to get needl and thread at the store he thought it would be inconveni and imposs soon to go on mortgag some portion of the creatur each time to that amount he could defend mani institut better than ani philosoph becaus in describ them as thei concern him he gave the true reason for their preval and specul had not suggest to him ani other at anoth time hear plato definit of a mana bipe without feathersand that on exhibit a cock pluck and call it plato man he thought it an import differ that the knee bent the wrong wai he would sometim exclaim how i love to talk by georg i could talk all dai i ask him onc when i had not seen him for mani month if he had got a new idea thi summer good lordsaid he a man that ha to work as i do if he doe not forget the idea he ha had he will do well mai be the man you hoe with is inclin to race then by gorri your mind must be there you think of weed he would sometim ask me first on such occas if i had made ani improv on winter dai i ask him if he wa alwai satisfi with himself wish to suggest a substitut within him for the priest without and some higher motiv for live satisfi said he some men ar satisfi with on thing and some with anoth on man perhap if he ha got enough will be satisfi to sit all dai with hi back to the fire and hi belli to the tabl by georg yet i never by ani manoeuvr could get him to take the spiritu view of thing the highest that he appear to conceiv of wa a simpl expedi such as you might expect an anim to appreci and thi practic is true of most men if i suggest ani improv in hi mode of life he mere answer without express ani regret that it wa too late yet he thoroughli believ in honesti and the like virtu there wa a certain posit origin howev slight to be detect in him and i occasion observ that he wa think for himself and express hi own opinion a phenomenon so rare that i would ani dai walk ten mile to observ it and it amount to the reorigin of mani of the institut of societi though he hesit and perhap fail to express himself distinctli he alwai had a present thought behind yet hi think wa so primit and immers in hi anim life that though more promis than a mere learn man it rare ripen to anyth which can be report he suggest that there might be men of geniu in the lowest grade of life howev perman humbl and illiter who take their own view alwai or do not pretend to see at all who ar as bottomless even as walden pond wa thought to be though thei mai be dark and muddi mani a travel came out of hi wai to see me and the insid of my hous and as an excus for call ask for a glass of water i told them that i drank at the pond and point thither offer to lend them a dipper far off as i live i wa not exempt from the annual visit which occur methink about the first of april when everybodi is on the move and i had my share of good luck though there were some curiou specimen among my visitor halfwit men from the almshous and elsewher came to see me but i endeavor to make them exercis all the wit thei had and make their confess to me in such case make wit the theme of our convers and so wa compens inde i found some of them to be wiser than the socal overs of the poor and selectmen of the town and thought it wa time that the tabl were turn with respect to wit i learn that there wa not much

occasion after my hoe wa done for the dai i join some impati companion who had been fish on the pond sinc morn as silent and motionless as a duck or a float leaf and after practis variou kind of philosophi had conclud commonli by the time i arriv that he belong to the ancient sect of c nobit there wa on older man an excel fisher and skill in all kind of woodcraft who wa pleas to look upon my hous as a build erect for the conveni of fishermen and i wa equal pleas when he sat in my doorwai to arrang hi line onc in a while we sat togeth on the pond he at on end of the boat and i at the other but not mani word pass between us for he had grown deaf in hi later year but he occasion hum a psalm which harmon well enough with my philosophi our intercours wa thu altogeth on of unbroken harmoni far more pleas to rememb than if it had been carri on by speech when as wa commonli the case i had none to commun with i us to rais the echo by strike with a paddl on the side of my boat fill the surround wood with circl and dilat sound stir them up as the keeper of a menageri hi wild beast until i elicit a growl from everi wood vale and hillsid in warm even i frequent sat in the boat plai the flute and saw the perch which i seem to have charm hover around me and the moon travel over the rib bottom which wa strew with the wreck of the forest formerli i had come to thi pond adventur from time to time in dark summer night with a companion and make a fire close to the water edg which we thought attract the fish we caught pout with a bunch of worm strung on a thread and when we had done far in the night threw the burn brand high into the air like skyrocket which come down into the pond were quench with a loud hiss and we were suddenli grope in total dark through thi whistl a tune we took our wai to the haunt of men again but now i had made my home by the shore sometim after stai in a villag parlor till the famili had all retir i have return to the wood and partli with a view to the next dai dinner spent the hour of midnight fish from a boat by moonlight serenad by owl and fox and hear from time to time the creak note of some unknown bird close at hand these experi were veri memor and valuabl to meanchor in forti feet of water and twenti or thirti rod from the shore surround sometim by thousand of small perch and shiner dimpl the surfac with their tail in the moonlight and commun by a long flaxen line with mysteri nocturn fish which had their dwell forti feet below or sometim drag sixti feet of line about the pond as i drift in the gentl night breez now and then feel a slight vibrat along it indic of some life prowl about it extrem of dull uncertain blunder purpos there and slow to make up it mind at length you slowli rais pull hand over hand some horn pout squeak and squirm to the upper air it wa veri queer especi in dark night when your thought had wander to vast and cosmogon theme in other sphere to feel thi faint jerk which came to interrupt your dream and link you to natur again it seem as if i might next cast my line upward into the air as well as downward into thi element which wa scarc more dens thu i caught two fish as it were with on hook the sceneri of walden is on a humbl scale and though veri beauti doe not approach to grandeur nor can it much concern on who ha not long frequent it or live by it shore yet thi pond is so remark for it depth and puriti as to merit a particular descript it is a clear and deep green well half a mile long and a mile and three quarter in circumfer and contain about sixtyon and a half acr a perenni spring in the midst of pine and oak wood without ani visibl inlet or outlet except by the cloud and evapor the surround hill rise abruptli from the water to the height of forti to eighti feet though on the southeast and east thei attain to about on hundr and on hundr and fifti feet respect within a quarter and a third of a mile thei ar exclus woodland all our concord water have two color at least on when view at a distanc and anoth more proper close at hand the first depend more on the light and follow the sky in clear weather in summer thei appear blue at a littl distanc especi if agit and at a great distanc all appear alik in stormi weather thei ar sometim of a dark slatecolor the sea howev is said to be blue on dai and green anoth without ani percept chang in the atmospher i have seen our river when the landscap be cover with snow both water and ic were almost as green as grass some consid blue to be the color of pure water whether liquid or solid but look directli down into our water from a boat thei ar seen to be of veri differ color walden is blue at on time and green at anoth even from the same point of view ly between the earth and the heaven it partak of the color of both view from a hilltop it reflect the color of the sky but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the sand then a light green which gradual deepen to a uniform dark green in the bodi of the pond in some light view even from a hilltop it is of a vivid green next the shore some have refer thi to the reflect of the verdur but it is equal green there against the railroad sandbank and in the spring befor the leav ar expand and it mai be simpli the result of the prevail blue mix with the yellow of the sand such is the color of it iri thi is that portion also where in the spring the ic be warm by the heat of the sun reflect from the bottom and also transmit through the earth melt first and form a narrow canal about the still frozen middl like the rest of our water when much agit in clear weather so that the surfac of the wave mai reflect the sky at the right angl or becaus there is more light mix with it it appear at a littl distanc of a darker blue than the sky itself and at such a time be on it surfac and look with divid vision so as to see the reflect i have discern a matchless and indescrib light blue such as water or changeabl silk and sword blade suggest more cerulean than the sky itself altern with the origin dark green on the opposit side of the wave which last appear but muddi in comparison it is a vitreou greenish blue as i rememb it like those patch of the winter sky seen through cloud vista in the west befor sundown yet a singl glass of it water held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantiti of air it is well known that a larg plate of glass will have a green tint ow as the maker sai to it bodi but a small piec of the same will be colorless how larg a bodi of walden water would be requir to reflect a green tint i have never prove the water of our river is black or a veri dark brown to on look directli down on it and like that of most pond impart to the bodi of on bath in it a yellowish ting but thi water is of such crystallin puriti that the bodi of the bather appear of an alabast white still more unnatur which as the limb ar magnifi and distort withal produc a monstrou effect make fit studi for a michael angelo the water is so transpar that the bottom can easili be discern at the depth of twentyf or thirti feet paddl over it you mai see mani feet beneath the surfac the school of perch and shiner perhap onli an inch long yet the former easili distinguish by their transvers bar and you think that thei must be ascet fish that find a subsist there onc in the winter mani year ago when i had been cut hole through the ic in order to catch pickerel as i step ashor i toss my ax back on to the ic but as if some evil geniu had direct it it slid four or five rod directli into on of the hole where the water wa twentyf feet deep out of curios i lai down on the ic and look through the hole until i saw the ax a littl on on side stand on it head with it helv erect and gentli swai to and fro with the puls of the pond and there it might have stood erect and swai till in the cours of time the handl rot off if i had not disturb it make anoth hole directli over it with an ic chisel which i had and cut down the longest birch which i could find in the neighborhood with my knife i made a slipnoos which i attach to it end and let it down carefulli pass it over the knob of the handl and drew it by a line along the birch and so pull the ax out again the shore is compos of a belt of smooth round white stone like pavingston except on or two short sand beach and is so steep that in mani place a singl leap will carri you into water over your head and were it not for it remark transpar that would be the last to be seen of it bottom till it rose on the opposit side some think it is bottomless it is nowher muddi and a casual observ would sai that there were no weed at all in it and of notic plant except in the littl meadow recent overflow which do not properli belong to it a closer scrutini doe not detect a flag nor a bulrush nor even a lili yellow or white but onli a few small heartleav and potamogeton and perhap a watertarget or two all which howev a bather might not perceiv and these plant ar clean and bright like the element thei grow in the stone extend a rod or two into the water and then the bottom is pure sand except in the deepest part where there is usual a littl sediment probabl from the decai of the leav which have been waft on to it so mani success fall and a bright green weed is brought up on anchor even in midwint we have on other pond just like thi white pond in nine acr corner about two and a half mile westerli but though i am acquaint with most of the pond within a dozen mile of thi centr i do not know a third of thi pure and welllik charact success nation perchanc have drank at admir and fathom it and pass awai and still it water is green and pellucid as ever not an intermit spring perhap on that spring morn when adam and ev were driven out of eden walden pond wa alreadi in exist and even then break up in a gentl spring rain accompani with mist and a southerli wind and cover with myriad of duck and gees which had not heard of the fall when still such pure lake suffic them even then it had commenc to rise and fall and had clarifi it water and color them of the hue thei now wear and obtain a patent of heaven to be the onli walden pond in the world and distil of celesti dew who know in how mani unrememb nation literatur thi ha been the castalian fountain or what nymph presid over it in the golden ag it is a gem of the first water which concord wear in her coronet yet perchanc the first who came to thi well have left some trace of their footstep i have been surpris to detect encircl the pond even where a thick wood ha just been cut down on the shore a narrow shelflik path in the steep hillsid altern rise and fall approach and reced from the water edg as old probabl as the race of man here worn by the feet of aborigin hunter and still from time to time unwittingli trodden by the present occup of the land thi is particularli distinct to on stand on the middl of the pond in winter just after a light snow ha fallen appear as a clear undul white line unobscur by weed and twig and veri obviou a quarter of a mile off in mani place where in summer it is hardli distinguish close at hand the snow reprint it as it were in clear white type altorelievo the ornament ground of villa which will on dai be built here mai still preserv some trace of thi the pond rise and fall but whether regularli or not and within what period nobodi know though as usual mani pretend to know it is commonli higher in the winter and lower in the summer though not correspond to the gener wet and dryness i can rememb when it wa a foot or two lower and also when it wa at least five feet higher than when i live by it there is a narrow sandbar run into it with veri deep water on on side on which i help boil a kettl of chowder some six rod from the main shore about the year which it ha not been possibl to do for twentyf year and on the other hand my friend us to listen with incredul when i told them that a few year later i wa accustom to fish from a boat in a seclud cove in the wood fifteen rod from the onli shore thei knew which place wa long sinc convert into a meadow but the pond ha risen steadili for two year and now in the summer of is just five feet higher than when i live there or as high as it wa thirti year ago and fish goe on again in the meadow thi make a differ of level at the outsid of six or seven feet and yet the water shed by the surround hill is insignific in amount and thi overflow must be refer to caus which affect the deep spring thi same summer the pond ha begun to fall again it is remark that thi fluctuat whether period or not appear thu to requir mani year for it accomplish i have observ on rise and a part of two fall and i expect that a dozen or fifteen year henc the water will again be as low as i have ever known it flint pond a mile eastward allow for the disturb occas by it inlet and outlet and the smaller intermedi pond also sympath with walden and recent attain their greatest height at the same time with the latter the same is true as far as my observ goe of white pond thi rise and fall of walden at long interv serv thi us at least the water stand at thi great height for a year or more though it make it difficult to walk round it kill the shrub and tree which have sprung up about it edg sinc the last risepitch pine birch alder aspen and othersand fall again leav an unobstruct shore for unlik mani pond and all water which ar subject to a daili tide it shore is cleanest when the water is lowest on the side of the pond next my hous a row of pitch pine fifteen feet high ha been kill and tip over as if by a lever and thu a stop put to their encroach and their size indic how mani year have elaps sinc the last rise to thi height by thi fluctuat the pond assert it titl to a shore and thu the shore is shorn and the tree cannot hold it by right of possess these ar the lip of the lake on which no beard grow it lick it chap from time to time when the water is at it height the alder willow and mapl send forth a mass of fibrou red root sever feet long from all side of their stem in the water and to the height of three or four feet from the ground in the effort to maintain themselv and i have known the high blueberri bush about the shore which commonli produc no fruit bear an abund crop under these circumst some have been puzzl to tell how the shore becam so regularli pave my townsmen have all heard the traditionth oldest peopl tell me that thei heard it in their youththat ancient the indian were hold a powwow upon a hill here which rose as high into the heaven as the pond now sink deep into the earth and thei us much profan as the stori goe though thi vice is on of which the indian were never guilti and while thei were thu engag the hill shook and suddenli sank and onli on old squaw name walden escap and from her the pond wa name it ha been conjectur that when the hill shook these stone roll down it side and becam the present shore it is veri certain at ani rate that onc there wa no pond here and now there is on and thi indian fabl doe not in ani respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom i have mention who rememb so well when he first came here with hi diviningrod saw a thin vapor rise from the sward and the hazel point steadili downward and he conclud to dig a well here as for the stone mani still think that thei ar hardli to be account for by the action of the wave on these hill but i observ that the surround hill ar remark full of the same kind of stone so that thei have been oblig to pile them up in wall on both side of the railroad cut nearest the pond and moreov there ar most stone where the shore is most abrupt so that unfortun it is no longer a mysteri to me i detect the paver if the name wa not deriv from that of some english localitysaffron walden for instanceon might suppos that it wa call origin walledin pond the pond wa my well readi dug for four month in the year it water is as cold as it is pure at all time and i think that it is then as good as ani if not the best in the town in the winter all water which is expos to the air is colder than spring and well which ar protect from it the temperatur of the pond water which had stood in the room where i sat from five oclock in the afternoon till noon the next dai the sixth of march the thermomet have been up to or some of the time ow partli to the sun on the roof wa or on degre colder than the water of on of the coldest well in the villag just drawn the temperatur of the boil spring the same dai wa or the warmest of ani water tri though it is the coldest that i know of in summer when besid shallow and stagnant surfac water is not mingl with it moreov in summer walden never becom so warm as most water which is expos to the sun on account of it depth in the warmest weather i usual place a pail in my cellar where it becam cool in the night and remain so dure the dai though i also resort to a spring in the neighborhood it wa as good when a week old as the dai it wa dip and had no tast of the pump whoever camp for a week in summer by the shore of a pond need onli buri a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of hi camp to be independ of the luxuri of ic there have been caught in walden pickerel on weigh seven poundsto sai noth of anoth which carri off a reel with great veloc which the fisherman safe set down at eight pound becaus he did not see himperch and pout some of each weigh over two pound shiner chivin or roach leuciscu pulchellu a veri few bream and a coupl of eel on weigh four poundsi am thu particular becaus the weight of a fish is commonli it onli titl to fame and these ar the onli eel i have heard of herealso i have a faint recollect of a littl fish some five inch long with silveri side and a greenish back somewhat dacelik in it charact which i mention here chiefli to link my fact to fabl nevertheless thi pond is not veri fertil in fish it pickerel though not abund ar it chief boast i have seen at on time ly on the ic pickerel of at least three differ kind a long and shallow on steelcolor most like those caught in the river a bright golden kind with greenish reflect and remark deep which is the most common here and anoth goldencolor and shape like the last but pepper on the side with small dark brown or black spot intermix with a few faint bloodr on veri much like a trout the specif name reticulatu would not appli to thi it should be guttatu rather these ar all veri firm fish and weigh more than their size promis the shiner pout and perch also and inde all the fish which inhabit thi pond ar much cleaner handsom and firmerflesh than those in the river and most other pond as the water is purer and thei can easili be distinguish from them probabl mani ichthyologist would make new varieti of some of them there ar also a clean race of frog and tortois and a few mussel in it muskrat and mink leav their trace about it and occasion a travel mudturtl visit it sometim when i push off my boat in the morn i disturb a great mudturtl which had secret himself under the boat in the night duck and gees frequent it in the spring and fall the whitebelli swallow hirundo bicolor skim over it and the peetweet totanu maculariu teeter along it stoni shore all summer i have sometim disturb a fish hawk sit on a white pine over the water but i doubt if it is ever profan by the wind of a gull like fair haven at most it toler on annual loon these ar all the anim of consequ which frequent it now you mai see from a boat in calm weather near the sandi eastern shore where the water is eight or ten feet deep and also in some other part of the pond some circular heap half a dozen feet in diamet by a foot in height consist of small stone less than a hen egg in size where all around is bare sand at first you wonder if the indian could have form them on the ic for ani purpos and so when the ic melt thei sank to the bottom but thei ar too regular and some of them plainli too fresh for that thei ar similar to those found in river but as there ar no sucker nor lamprei here i know not by what fish thei could be made perhap thei ar the nest of the chivin these lend a pleas mysteri to the bottom the shore is irregular enough not to be monoton i have in my mind ey the western indent with deep bai the bolder northern and the beautifulli scallop southern shore where success cape overlap each other and suggest unexplor cove between the forest ha never so good a set nor is so distinctli beauti as when seen from the middl of a small lake amid hill which rise from the water edg for the water in which it is reflect not onli make the best foreground in such a case but with it wind shore the most natur and agreeabl boundari to it there is no raw nor imperfect in it edg there as where the ax ha clear a part or a cultiv field abut on it the tree have ampl room to expand on the water side and each send forth it most vigor branch in that direct there natur ha woven a natur selvag and the ey rise by just gradat from the low shrub of the shore to the highest tree there ar few trace of man hand to be seen the water lave the shore as it did a thousand year ago a lake is the landscap most beauti and express featur it is earth ey look into which the behold measur the depth of hi own natur the fluviatil tree next the shore ar the slender eyelash which fring it and the wood hill and cliff around ar it overhang brow stand on the smooth sandi beach at the east end of the pond in a calm septemb afternoon when a slight haze make the opposit shorelin indistinct i have seen whenc came the express the glassi surfac of a lake when you invert your head it look like a thread of finest gossam stretch across the vallei and gleam against the distant pine wood separ on stratum of the atmospher from anoth you would think that you could walk dry under it to the opposit hill and that the swallow which skim over might perch on it inde thei sometim dive below thi line as it were by mistak and ar undeceiv as you look over the pond westward you ar oblig to emploi both your hand to defend your ey against the reflect as well as the true sun for thei ar equal bright and if between the two you survei it surfac critic it is liter as smooth as glass except where the skater insect at equal interv scatter over it whole extent by their motion in the sun produc the finest imagin sparkl on it or perchanc a duck plume itself or as i have said a swallow skim so low as to touch it it mai be that in the distanc a fish describ an arc of three or four feet in the air and there is on bright flash where it emerg and anoth where it strike the water sometim the whole silveri arc is reveal or here and there perhap is a thistledown float on it surfac which the fish dart at and so dimpl it again it is like molten glass cool but not congeal and the few mote in it ar pure and beauti like the imperfect in glass you mai often detect a yet smoother and darker water separ from the rest as if by an invis cobweb boom of the water nymph rest on it from a hilltop you can see a fish leap in almost ani part for not a pickerel or shiner pick an insect from thi smooth surfac but it manifestli disturb the equilibrium of the whole lake it is wonder with what elabor thi simpl fact is advertisedthi piscin murder will outand from my distant perch i distinguish the circl undul when thei ar half a dozen rod in diamet you can even detect a waterbug gyrinu ceaselessli progress over the smooth surfac a quarter of a mile off for thei furrow the water slightli make a conspicu rippl bound by two diverg line but the skater glide over it without rippl it percept when the surfac is consider agit there ar no skater nor waterbug on it but appar in calm dai thei leav their haven and adventur glide forth from the shore by short impuls till thei complet cover it it is a sooth employ on on of those fine dai in the fall when all the warmth of the sun is fulli appreci to sit on a stump on such a height as thi overlook the pond and studi the dimpl circl which ar incessantli inscrib on it otherwis invis surfac amid the reflect ski and tree over thi great expans there is no disturb but it is thu at onc gentli smooth awai and assuag as when a vase of water is jar the trembl circl seek the shore and all is smooth again not a fish can leap or an insect fall on the pond but it is thu report in circl dimpl in line of beauti as it were the constant well up of it fountain the gentl puls of it life the heav of it breast the thrill of joi and thrill of pain ar undistinguish how peac the phenomena of the lake again the work of man shine as in the spring ay everi leaf and twig and stone and cobweb sparkl now at midafternoon as when cover with dew in a spring morn everi motion of an oar or an insect produc a flash of light and if an oar fall how sweet the echo in such a dai in septemb or octob walden is a perfect forest mirror set round with stone as preciou to my ey as if fewer or rarer noth so fair so pure and at the same time so larg as a lake perchanc li on the surfac of the earth sky water it need no fenc nation come and go without defil it it is a mirror which no stone can crack whose quicksilv will never wear off whose gild natur continu repair no storm no dust can dim it surfac ever fresha mirror in which all impur present to it sink swept and dust by the sun hazi brushthi the light dustclothwhich retain no breath that is breath on it but send it own to float as cloud high abov it surfac and be reflect in it bosom still a field of water betrai the spirit that is in the air it is continu receiv new life and motion from abov it is intermedi in it natur between land and sky on land onli the grass and tree wave but the water itself is rippl by the wind i see where the breez dash across it by the streak or flake of light it is remark that we can look down on it surfac we shall perhap look down thu on the surfac of air at length and mark where a still subtler spirit sweep over it the skater and waterbug final disappear in the latter part of octob when the sever frost have come and then and in novemb usual in a calm dai there is absolut noth to rippl the surfac on novemb afternoon in the calm at the end of a rainstorm of sever dai durat when the sky wa still complet overcast and the air wa full of mist i observ that the pond wa remark smooth so that it wa difficult to distinguish it surfac though it no longer reflect the bright tint of octob but the sombr novemb color of the surround hill though i pass over it as gentli as possibl the slight undul produc by my boat extend almost as far as i could see and gave a rib appear to the reflect but as i wa look over the surfac i saw here and there at a distanc a faint glimmer as if some skater insect which had escap the frost might be collect there or perchanc the surfac be so smooth betrai where a spring well up from the bottom paddl gentli to on of these place i wa surpris to find myself surround by myriad of small perch about five inch long of a rich bronz color in the green water sport there and constantli rise to the surfac and dimpl it sometim leav bubbl on it in such transpar and seemingli bottomless water reflect the cloud i seem to be float through the air as in a balloon and their swim impress me as a kind of flight or hover as if thei were a compact flock of bird pass just beneath my level on the right or left their fin like sail set all around them there were mani such school in the pond appar improv the short season befor winter would draw an ici shutter over their broad skylight sometim give to the surfac an appear as if a slight breez struck it or a few raindrop fell there when i approach carelessli and alarm them thei made a sudden splash and rippl with their tail as if on had struck the water with a brushi bough and instantli took refug in the depth at length the wind rose the mist increas and the wave began to run and the perch leap much higher than befor half out of water a hundr black point three inch long at onc abov the surfac even as late as the fifth of decemb on year i saw some dimpl on the surfac and think it wa go to rain hard immedi the air be full of mist i made hast to take my place at the oar and row homeward alreadi the rain seem rapidli increas though i felt none on my cheek and i anticip a thorough soak but suddenli the dimpl ceas for thei were produc by the perch which the nois of my oar had sear into the depth and i saw their school dimli disappear so i spent a dry afternoon after all an old man who us to frequent thi pond nearli sixti year ago when it wa dark with surround forest tell me that in those dai he sometim saw it all aliv with duck and other waterfowl and that there were mani eagl about it he came here afish and us an old log cano which he found on the shore it wa made of two white pine log dug out and pin togeth and wa cut off squar at the end it wa veri clumsi but last a great mani year befor it becam waterlog and perhap sank to the bottom he did not know whose it wa it belong to the pond he us to make a cabl for hi anchor of strip of hickori bark ti togeth an old man a potter who live by the pond befor the revolut told him onc that there wa an iron chest at the bottom and that he had seen it sometim it would come float up to the shore but when you went toward it it would go back into deep water and disappear i wa pleas to hear of the old log cano which took the place of an indian on of the same materi but more grace construct which perchanc had first been a tree on the bank and then as it were fell into the water to float there for a gener the most proper vessel for the lake i rememb that when i first look into these depth there were mani larg trunk to be seen indistinctli ly on the bottom which had either been blown over formerli or left on the ic at the last cut when wood wa cheaper but now thei have mostli disappear when i first paddl a boat on walden it wa complet surround by thick and lofti pine and oak wood and in some of it cove grapevin had run over the tree next the water and form bower under which a boat could pass the hill which form it shore ar so steep and the wood on them were then so high that as you look down from the west end it had the appear of an amphitheatr for some land of sylvan spectacl i have spent mani an hour when i wa younger float over it surfac as the zephyr will have paddl my boat to the middl and ly on my back across the seat in a summer forenoon dream awak until i wa arous by the boat touch the sand and i aros to see what shore my fate had impel me to dai when idl wa the most attract and product industri mani a forenoon have i stolen awai prefer to spend thu the most valu part of the dai for i wa rich if not in monei in sunni hour and summer dai and spent them lavishli nor do i regret that i did not wast more of them in the workshop or the teacher desk but sinc i left those shore the woodchopp have still further laid them wast and now for mani a year there will be no more rambl through the aisl of the wood with occasion vista through which you see the water my muse mai be excus if she is silent henceforth how can you expect the bird to sing when their grove ar cut down now the trunk of tree on the bottom and the old log cano and the dark surround wood ar gone and the villag who scarc know where it li instead of go to the pond to bath or drink ar think to bring it water which should be as sacr as the gang at least to the villag in a pipe to wash their dish withto earn their walden by the turn of a cock or draw of a plug that devilish iron hors whose earrend neigh is heard throughout the town ha muddi the boil spring with hi foot and he it is that ha brows off all the wood on walden shore that trojan hors with a thousand men in hi belli introduc by mercenari greek where is the countri champion the moor of moor hill to meet him at the deep cut and thrust an aveng lanc between the rib of the bloat pest nevertheless of all the charact i have known perhap walden wear best and best preserv it puriti mani men have been liken to it but few deserv that honor though the woodchopp have laid bare first thi shore and then that and the irish have built their sti by it and the railroad ha infring on it border and the icemen have skim it onc it is itself unchang the same water which my youth ey fell on all the chang is in me it ha not acquir on perman wrinkl after all it rippl it is perenni young and i mai stand and see a swallow dip appar to pick an insect from it surfac as of yore it struck me again tonight as if i had not seen it almost daili for more than twenti yearswhi here is walden the same woodland lake that i discov so mani year ago where a forest wa cut down last winter anoth is spring up by it shore as lustili as ever the same thought is well up to it surfac that wa then it is the same liquid joi and happi to itself and it maker ay and it mai be to me it is the work of a brave man sure in whom there wa no guil he round thi water with hi hand deepen and clarifi it in hi thought and in hi will bequeath it to concord i see by it face that it is visit by the same reflect and i can almost sai walden is it you it is no dream of mine to ornament a line i cannot come nearer to god and heaven than i live to walden even i am

rememb the life of marin i went achestnut there in the fall on windi dai when the nut were drop into the water and were wash to my feet and on dai as i crept along it sedgi shore the fresh sprai blow

portion of our natur life though it wa alreadi half spent when i start by the wai there came up a shower which compel me to stand half an hour under a pine pile bough over my head and wear my handkerchief for a shed and when at length i had made on cast over the pickerelwe stand up to my middl in water i found myself suddenli in the shadow of a cloud and the thunder began to rumbl with such emphasi that i could do no more than listen to it the god must be proud thought i with such fork flash to rout a poor unarm fisherman so i made hast for shelter to the nearest hut which stood half a mile from ani road but so much the nearer to the pond and had long been uninhabit and here a poet build in the complet year for behold a trivial cabin that to destruct steer so the muse fabl

did not have to work to get them again as i did not work hard i did not have to eat hard and it cost me but a trifl for my food but as he began with tea and coffe and butter and milk and beef he had to work hard to pai for them and when he had work hard he had to eat hard again to repair the wast of hi systemand so it wa as broad as it wa long inde it wa broader than it wa long for he wa discont

of venison which i might devour and no morsel could have been too savag for me the wildest scene had becom unaccount familiar i found in myself and still find an instinct toward a higher or as it is name spiritu life as do most men and anoth toward a primit rank and savag on and i rever them both i love the wild not less than the good the wild and adventur that ar in fish still recommend it to me i like sometim to take rank hold on life and spend my dai more as the anim do perhap i have ow to thi employ and to hunt when quit young my closest acquaint with natur thei earli introduc us to and

the prairi is natur a hunter on the head water of the missouri and columbia a trapper and at the fall of st mari a fisherman he who is onli a travel learn thing at secondhand and by the halv and is poor author we ar most interest when scienc report what those men alreadi know practic or instinct for that alon is a true human or account of human experi thei mistak who assert that the yanke ha few amus becaus he ha not so mani public holidai and men and boi do not plai so mani game as thei do in england for here the more primit but solitari amus of hunt fish and the like have not yet given place to the former almost everi new england boi among my contemporari shoulder a fowlingpiec between the ag of ten and fourteen and hi hunt and fish ground were not limit like the preserv of an english nobleman but were more boundless even than those of a savag no wonder then that he did not often stai to plai on the common but alreadi a chang is take place ow not to an increas human but to an increas scarciti of game for perhap the hunter is the greatest friend of the anim hunt not except the human societi moreov when at the pond i wish sometim to add fish to my fare for varieti i have actual fish from the same kind of necess that the first fisher did whatev human i might conjur up against it wa all factiti and concern my philosophi more than my feel i speak of fish onli now for i had long felt differ about fowl and sold my gun befor i went to the wood not that i am less human than other but i did not perceiv that my feel were much affect i did not piti the fish nor the worm thi wa habit as for fowl dure the last year that i carri a gun my excus wa that i wa studi ornitholog and sought onli new or rare bird but i confess that i am now inclin to think that there is a finer wai of studi ornitholog than thi it requir so much closer attent to the habit of the bird that if for that reason onli i have been will to omit the gun yet notwithstand the object on the score of human i am compel to doubt if equal valuabl sport ar ever substitut for these and when some of my friend have ask me anxious about their boi whether thei should let them hunt i have answer yesrememb that it wa on of the best part of my educationmak them hunter though sportsmen onli at first if possibl mighti hunter at last so that thei shall not find game larg enough for them in thi or ani veget wildernesshunt as well as fisher of men thu far i am of the opinion of chaucer nun who yave not of the text a pull hen that saith that hunter ben not holi men there is a period in the histori of the individu as of the race when the hunter ar the best men as the algonquin call them we cannot but piti the boi who ha never fire a gun he is no more human while hi educ ha been sadli neglect thi wa my answer with respect to those youth who were bent on thi pursuit trust that thei would soon outgrow it no human be past the thoughtless ag of boyhood will wantonli murder ani creatur which hold it life by the same tenur that he doe the hare in it extrem cri like a child i warn you mother that my sympathi do not alwai make the usual philanthrop distinct such is oftenest the young man introduct to the forest and the most origin part of himself he goe thither at first as a hunter and fisher until at last if he ha the seed of a better life in him he distinguish hi proper object as a poet or naturalist it mai be and leav the gun and fishpol behind the mass of men ar still and alwai young in thi respect in some countri a hunt parson is no uncommon sight such a on might make a good shepherd dog but is far from be the good shepherd i have been surpris to consid that the onli obviou employ except woodchop icecut or the like busi which ever to my knowledg detain at walden pond for a whole halfdai ani of my fellowcitizen whether father or children of the town with just on except wa fish commonli thei did not think that thei were lucki or well paid for their time unless thei got a long string of fish though thei had the opportun of see the pond all the while thei might go there a thousand time befor the sediment of fish would sink to the bottom and leav their purpos pure but no doubt such a clarifi process would be go on all the while the governor and hi council faintli rememb the pond for thei went afish there when thei were boi but now thei ar too old and dignifi to go afish and so thei know it no more forev yet even thei expect to go to heaven at last if the legislatur regard it it is chiefli to regul the number of hook to be us there but thei know noth about the hook of hook with which to angl for the pond itself impal the legislatur for a bait thu even in civil commun the embryo man pass through the hunter stage of develop i have found repeatedli of late year that i cannot fish without fall a littl in selfrespect i have tri it again and again i have skill at it and like mani of my fellow a certain instinct for it which reviv from time to time but alwai when i have done i feel that it would have been better if i had not fish i think that i do not mistak it is a faint intim yet so ar the first streak of morn there is unquestion thi instinct in me which belong to the lower order of creation yet with everi year i am less a fisherman though without more human or even wisdom at present i am no fisherman at all but i see that if i were to live in a wilder i should again be tempt to becom a fisher and hunter in earnest besid there is someth essenti unclean about thi diet and all flesh and i began to see where housework commenc and whenc the endeavor which cost so much to wear a tidi and respect appear each dai to keep the hous sweet and free from all ill odor and sight have been my own butcher and scullion and cook as well as the gentleman for whom the dish were serv up i can speak from an unusu complet experi the practic object to anim food in my case wa it unclean and besid when i had caught and clean and cook and eaten my fish thei seem not to have fed me essenti it wa insignific and unnecessari and cost more than it came to a littl bread or a few potato would have done as well with less troubl and filth like mani of my contemporari i had rare for mani year us anim food or tea or coffe etc not so much becaus of ani ill effect which i had trace to them as becaus thei were not agreeabl to my imagin the repugn to anim food is not the effect of experi but is an instinct it appear more beauti to live low and fare hard in mani respect and though i never did so i went far enough to pleas my imagin i believ that everi man who ha ever been earnest to preserv hi higher or poetic faculti in the best condit ha been particularli inclin to abstain from anim food and from much food of ani kind it is a signific fact state by entomologistsi find it in kirbi and spencethat some insect in their perfect state though furnish with organ of feed make no us of them and thei lai it down as a gener rule that almost all insect in thi state eat much less than in that of larv the voraci caterpillar when transform into a butterfli and the glutton maggot when becom a fly content themselv with a drop or two of honei or some other sweet liquid the abdomen under the wing of the butterfli still repres the larva thi is the tidbit which tempt hi insectivor fate the gross feeder is a man in the larva state and there ar whole nation in that condit nation without fanci or imagin whose vast abdomen betrai them it is hard to provid and cook so simpl and clean a diet as will not offend the imagin but thi i think is to be fed when we feed the bodi thei should both sit down at the same tabl yet perhap thi mai be done the fruit eaten temper need not make us asham of our appetit nor interrupt the worthiest pursuit but put an extra condiment into your dish and it will poison you it is not worth the while to live by rich cookeri most men would feel shame if caught prepar with their own hand precis such a dinner whether of anim or veget food as is everi dai prepar for them by other yet till thi is otherwis we ar not civil and if gentlemen and ladi ar not true men and women thi certainli suggest what chang is to be made it mai be vain to ask why the imagin will not be reconcil to flesh and fat i am satisfi that it is not is it not a reproach that man is a carnivor anim true he can and doe live in a great measur by prei on other anim but thi is a miser waya ani on who will go to snare rabbit or slaughter lamb mai learnand he will be regard as a benefactor of hi race who shall teach man to confin himself to a more innoc and wholesom diet whatev my own practic mai be i have no doubt that it is a part of the destini of the human race in it gradual improv to leav off eat anim as sure as the savag tribe have left off eat each other when thei came in contact with the more civil if on listen to the faintest but constant suggest of hi geniu which ar certainli true he see not to what extrem or even insan it mai lead him and yet that wai as he grow more resolut and faith hi road li the faintest assur object which on healthi man feel will at length prevail over the argument and custom of mankind no man ever follow hi geniu till it misl him though the result were bodili weak yet perhap no on can sai that the consequ were to be regret for these were a life in conform to higher principl if the dai and

behind where my hous is built and probabl still heard their whinner at night commonli i rest an hour or two in the shade at noon after plant and at my lunch and read a littl by a spring which wa the sourc of a swamp and of a brook ooz from under brister hill half a mile from my field the approach to thi wa through a success of descend grassi hollow full of young pitch pine into a larger wood about the swamp there in a veri seclud and shade spot under a spread white pine there wa yet a clean firm sward to sit on i had dug out the spring and made a well of clear grai water where i could dip up a pail without roil it and thither i went for thi purpos almost everi dai in midsumm when the pond wa warmest thither too the woodcock led her brood to probe the mud for worm fly but a foot abov them down the bank while thei ran in a troop beneath but at last spy me she would leav her young and circl round and round me nearer and nearer till within four or five feet pretend broken wing and leg to attract my attent and get off her young who would alreadi have taken up their march with faint wiri peep singl file through the swamp as she direct or i heard the peep of the young when i could not see the parent bird there too the turtl dove sat over the spring or flutter from bough to bough of the soft white pine over my head or the red squirrel cours down the nearest bough wa particularli familiar and inquisit you onli need sit still long enough in some attract spot in the wood that all it inhabit mai exhibit themselv to you by turn i wa wit to event of a less peac charact on dai when i went out to my woodpil or rather my pile of stump i observ two larg ant the on red the other much larger nearli half an inch long and black fierc contend with on anoth have onc got hold thei never let go but struggl and wrestl and roll on the chip incessantli look farther i wa surpris to find that the chip were cover with such combat that it wa not a duellum but a bellum a war between two race of ant the red alwai pit against the black and frequent two red on to on black the legion of these myrmidon cover all the hill and vale in my woodyard and the ground wa alreadi strewn with the dead and dy both red and black it wa the onli battl which i have ever wit the onli battlefield i ever trod while the battl wa rage internecin war the red republican on the on hand and the black imperialist on the other on everi side thei were engag in deadli combat yet without ani nois that i could hear and human soldier never fought so resolut i watch a coupl that were fast lock in each other embrac in a littl sunni vallei amid the chip now at noondai prepar to fight till the sun went down or life went out the smaller red champion had fasten himself like a vice to hi adversari front and through all the tumbl on that field never for an instant ceas to gnaw at on of hi feeler near the root have alreadi caus the other to go by the board while the stronger black on dash him from side to side and as i saw on look nearer had alreadi divest him of sever of hi member thei fought with more pertinac than bulldog neither manifest the least disposit to retreat it wa evid that their battlecri wa conquer or die in the meanwhil there came along a singl red ant on the hillsid of thi vallei evid full of excit who either had despatch hi foe or had not yet taken part in the battl probabl the latter for he had lost none of hi limb whose mother had charg him to return with hi shield or upon it or perchanc he wa some achil who had nourish hi wrath apart and had now come to aveng or rescu hi patroclu he saw thi unequ combat from afarfor the black were nearli twice the size of the redh drew near with rapid pace till he stood on hi guard within half an inch of the combat then watch hi opportun he sprang upon the black warrior and commenc hi oper near the root of hi right fore leg leav the foe to select among hi own member and so there were three unit for life as if a new kind of attract had been invent which put all other lock and cement to shame i should not have wonder by thi time to find that thei had their respect music band station on some emin chip and plai their nation air the while to excit the slow and cheer the dy combat i wa myself excit somewhat even as if thei had been men the more you think of it the less the differ and certainli there is not the fight record in concord histori at least if in the histori of america that will bear a moment comparison with thi whether for the number engag in it or for the patriot and heroism displai for number and for carnag it wa an austerlitz or dresden concord fight two kill on the patriot side and luther blanchard wound why here everi ant wa a buttrickfir for god sake fireand thousand share the fate of davi and hosmer there wa not on hirel there i have no doubt that it wa a principl thei fought for as much as our ancestor and not to avoid a threepenni tax on their tea and the result of thi battl will be as import and memor to those whom it concern as those of the battl of bunker hill at least i took up the chip on which the three i have particularli describ were struggl carri it into my hous and place it under a tumbler on my windowsil in order to see the issu hold a microscop to the firstment red ant i saw that though he wa assidu gnaw at the near fore leg of hi enemi have sever hi remain feeler hi own breast wa all torn awai expos what vital he had there to the jaw of the black warrior whose breastplat wa appar too thick for him to pierc and the dark carbuncl of the suffer ey shone with feroc such as war onli could excit thei struggl half an hour longer under the tumbler and when i look again the black soldier had sever the head of hi foe from their bodi and the still live head were hang on either side of him like ghastli trophi at hi saddlebow still appar as firmli fasten as ever and he wa endeavor with feebl struggl be without feeler and with onli the remnant of a leg and i know not how mani other wound to divest himself of them which at length after half an hour more he accomplish i rais the glass and he went off over the windowsil in that crippl state whether he final surviv that combat and spent the remaind of hi dai in some hotel de invalid i do not know but i thought that hi industri would not be worth much thereaft i never learn which parti wa victori nor the caus of the war but i felt for the rest of that dai as if i had had my feel excit and harrow by wit the struggl the feroc and carnag of a human battl befor my door kirbi and spenc tell us that the battl of ant have long been celebr and the date of them record though thei sai that huber is the onli modern author who appear to have wit them nea sylviu sai thei after give a veri circumstanti account of on

behind hi guid bark like a canin bull toward some small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutini then canter off bend the bush with hi weight imagin that he is on the track of some strai member of the jerbilla famili onc i wa surpris to see a cat walk along the stoni shore of the pond for thei rare wander so far from home the surpris wa mutual nevertheless the most domest cat which ha lain on a rug all her dai appear quit at home in the wood and by her sly and stealthi behavior prove herself more nativ there than the regular inhabit onc when berri i met with a cat with young kitten in the wood quit wild and thei all like their mother had their back up and were fierc spit at me a few year befor i live in the wood there wa what wa call a wing cat in on of the farmhous in lincoln nearest the pond mr gilian baker when i call to see her in june she wa gone ahunt in the wood as wa her wont i am not sure whether it wa a male or femal and so us the more common pronoun but her mistress told me that she came into the neighborhood a littl more than a year befor in april and wa final taken into their hous that she wa of a dark brownishgrai color with a white spot on her throat and white feet and had a larg bushi tail like a fox that in the winter the fur grew thick and flat out along her side form stripe ten or twelv inch long by two and a half wide and under her chin like a muff the upper side loos the under mat like felt and in the spring these appendag drop off thei gave me a pair of her wing which i keep still there is no appear of a membran about them some thought it wa part fly squirrel or some other wild anim which is not imposs for accord to naturalist prolif hybrid have been produc by the union of the marten and domest cat thi would have been the right kind of cat for me to keep if i had kept ani for why should not a poet cat be wing as well as hi hors in the fall the loon colymbu glaciali came as usual to moult and bath in the pond make the wood ring with hi wild laughter befor i had risen at rumor of hi arriv all the milldam sportsmen ar on the alert in gig and on foot two by two and three by three with patent rifl and conic ball and spyglass thei come rustl through the wood like autumn leav at least ten men to on loon some station themselv on thi side of the pond some on that for the poor bird cannot be omnipres if he dive here he must come up there but now the kind octob wind rise rustl the leav and rippl the surfac of the water so that no loon can be heard or seen though hi foe sweep the pond with spyglass and make the wood resound with their discharg the wave gener rise and dash angrili take side with all waterfowl and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and unfinish job but thei were too often success when i went to get a pail of water earli in the morn i frequent saw thi state bird sail out of my cove within a few rod if i endeavor to overtak him in a boat in order to see how he would manoeuvr he would dive and be complet lost so that i did not discov him again sometim till the latter part of the dai but i wa more than a match for him on the surfac he commonli went off in a rain as i wa paddl along the north shore on veri calm octob afternoon for such dai especi thei settl on to the lake like the milkwe down have look in vain over the pond for a loon suddenli on sail out from the shore toward the middl a few rod in front of me set up hi wild laugh and betrai himself i pursu with a paddl and he dive but when he came up i wa nearer than befor he dive again but i miscalcul the direct he would take and we were fifti rod apart when he came to the surfac thi time for i had help to widen the interv and again he laugh long and loud and with more reason than befor he manoeuvr so cunningli that i could not get within half a dozen rod of him each time when he came to the surfac turn hi head thi wai and that he cooli survei the water and the land and appar chose hi cours so that he might come up where there wa the widest expans of water and at the greatest distanc from the boat it wa surpris how quickli he made up hi mind and put hi resolv into execut he led me at onc to the widest part of the pond and could not be driven from it while he wa think on thing in hi brain i wa endeavor to divin hi thought in mine it wa a pretti game plai on the smooth surfac of the pond a man against a loon suddenli your adversari checker disappear beneath the board and the problem is to place your nearest to where hi will appear again sometim he would come up unexpectedli on the opposit side of me have appar pass directli under the boat so longwind wa he and so unweari that when he had swum farthest he would immedi plung again nevertheless and then no wit could divin where in the deep pond beneath the smooth surfac he might be speed hi wai like a fish for he had time and abil to visit the bottom of the pond in it deepest part it is said that loon have been caught in the new york lake eighti feet beneath the surfac with hook set for troutthough walden is deeper than that how surpris must the fish be to see thi ungainli visitor from anoth sphere speed hi wai amid their school yet he appear to know hi cours as sure under water as on the surfac and swam much faster there onc or twice i saw a rippl where he approach the surfac just put hi head out to reconnoitr and instantli dive again i found that it wa as well for me to rest on my oar and wait hi reappear as to endeavor to calcul where he would rise for again and again when i wa strain my ey over the surfac on wai i would suddenli be startl by hi unearthli laugh behind me but why after displai so much cun did he invari betrai himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh did not hi white breast enough betrai him he wa inde a silli loon i thought i could commonli hear the splash of the water when he came up and so also detect him but after an hour he seem as fresh as ever dive as willingli and swam yet farther than at first it wa surpris to see how seren he sail off with unruffl breast when he came to the surfac do all the work with hi web feet beneath hi usual note wa thi demoniac laughter yet somewhat like that of a waterfowl but occasion when he had balk me most successfulli and come up a long wai off he utter a longdrawn unearthli howl probabl more like that of a wolf than ani bird as when a beast put hi muzzl to the ground and deliber howl thi wa hi looningperhap the wildest sound that is ever heard here make the wood ring far and wide i conclud that he laugh in deris of my effort confid of hi own resourc though the sky wa by thi time overcast the pond wa so smooth that i could see where he broke the surfac when i did not hear him hi white breast the still of the air and the smooth of the water were all against him at length have come up fifti rod off he utter on of those prolong howl as if call on the god of loon to aid him and immedi there came a wind from the east and rippl the surfac and fill the whole air with misti rain and i wa impress as if it were the prayer of the loon answer and hi god wa angri with me and so i left him disappear far awai on the tumultu surfac for hour in fall dai i watch the duck cunningli tack and veer and hold the middl of the pond far from the sportsman trick which thei will have less need to practis in louisiana bayou when compel to rise thei would sometim circl round and round and over the pond at a consider height from which thei could easili see to other pond and the river like black mote in the sky and when i thought thei had gone off thither long sinc thei would settl down by a slant flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which wa left free but what besid safeti thei got by sail in the middl of walden i do not know unless thei love it water for the same reason that i do housewarm in octob i went agrap to the river meadow and load myself with cluster more preciou for their beauti and fragranc than for food there too i admir though i did not gather the cranberri small waxen gem pendant of the meadow grass pearli and red which the farmer pluck with an ugli rake leav the smooth meadow in a snarl heedlessli measur them by the bushel and the dollar onli and sell the spoil of the mead to boston and new york destin to be jam to satisfi the tast of lover of natur there so butcher rake the tongu of bison out of the prairi grass regardless of the torn and droop plant the barberri brilliant fruit wa likewis food for my ey mere but i collect a small store of wild appl for coddl which the proprietor and travel had overlook when chestnut were ripe i laid up half a bushel for winter it wa veri excit at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut wood of lincolnthei now sleep their long sleep under the railroadwith a bag on my shoulder and a stick to open bur with in my hand for i did not alwai wait for the frost amid the rustl of leav and the loud reproof of the red squirrel and the jai whose halfconsum nut i sometim stole for the bur which thei had select were sure to contain sound on occasion i climb and shook the tree thei grew also behind my hous and on larg tree which almost overshadow it wa when in flower a bouquet which scent the whole neighborhood but the squirrel and the jai got most of it fruit the last come in flock earli in the morn and pick the nut out of the bur

more and the tender and luxuri english grain will probabl disappear befor a myriad of foe and without the care of man the crow mai carri back even the last seed of corn to the great cornfield of the

mai be repres on our work of art alreadi by the first of septemb i had seen two or three small mapl turn scarlet across the pond beneath where the white stem of three aspen diverg at the point of a

felt compliment by their regard my hous as a desir shelter thei never molest me serious though thei bed with me and thei gradual disappear into what crevic i do not know avoid winter and unspeak cold like the wasp befor i final went into winter quarter in novemb i us to resort to the northeast side of walden which the sun reflect from the pitch pine wood and the stoni shore made the firesid of the pond it is so much pleasant and wholesom to be warm by the sun while you can be than by an artifici fire i thu warm myself by the still glow ember which the summer like a depart hunter had left when i came to build my chimnei i studi masonri my brick be secondhand on requir to be clean with a trowel so that i learn more than usual of the qualiti of brick and trowel the mortar on them wa fifti year

mani blow with a trowel to clean an old wiseacr of them mani of the villag of mesopotamia ar built of secondhand brick of a veri good qualiti obtain from the ruin of babylon and the cement on them is older and probabl harder still howev that mai be i wa struck by the peculiar tough of the steel which bore so mani violent blow without be worn out as my brick had been in a chimnei befor though i did not read the name of nebuchadnezzar on them i pick out as mani fireplac brick as i could find to save work and wast and i fill the space between the brick about the fireplac with stone from the pond shore and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place i linger most about the fireplac as the most vital part of the hous inde i work so deliber that though i commenc at the ground in the morn a cours of brick rais a few inch abov the floor serv for my pillow at night yet i did not get a stiff neck for it that i rememb my stiff neck is of older date i took a poet to board for a

began to us it for warmth as well as shelter i had got a coupl of old firedog to keep the wood from the hearth and it did me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimnei which i had built and i poke the fire with more right and more satisfact than usual my dwell wa small and i could hardli entertain an echo in it but it seem larger for be a singl apart and remot from neighbor all the

have describ if i were go their wai but back out of a modern palac will be all that i shall desir to learn if ever i am caught in on it would seem as if the veri languag of our parlor would lose all it nerv and degener into palav wholli our live pass at such remot from it symbol and it metaphor and trope ar necessarili so far fetch through slide and dumbwait as it were in other word the parlor is so far from the kitchen and workshop the dinner even is onli the parabl of a dinner commonli as if onli the savag dwelt near enough to natur and truth to borrow a trope from them how can the scholar who dwell awai in the north west territori or the isl of man tell what is parliamentari in the kitchen howev onli on or two of my guest were ever bold enough to stai and eat a hastypud with me but when thei saw that crisi approach thei beat a hasti retreat rather as if it would shake the hous to it foundat nevertheless it stood through a great mani hastypud i did not plaster till it wa freez weather i brought over some whiter and cleaner sand for thi purpos from the opposit shore of the pond in a boat a sort of convey which would have tempt me to go much farther if necessari my hous had in the meanwhil been shingl down to the ground on everi side in lath i wa pleas to be abl to send home each nail with a singl blow of the hammer and it wa my ambit to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatli and rapidli i rememb the stori of a conceit fellow who in fine cloth wa wont to loung about the villag onc give advic to workmen ventur on dai to substitut deed for word he turn up hi cuff seiz a plaster board and have load hi trowel without mishap with a complac look toward the lath overhead made a bold gestur thitherward and straightwai to hi complet discomfitur receiv the whole content in hi ruffl bosom i admir anew the economi and conveni of plaster which so effectu shut out the cold and take a handsom finish and i learn the variou casualti to which the plaster is liabl i wa surpris to see how thirsti the brick were which drank up all the moistur in my plaster befor i had smooth it and how mani pail of water it take to christen a new hearth i had the previou winter made a small quantiti of lime by burn the shell of the unio fluviatili which our river afford for the sake of the experi so that i knew where my materi came from i might have got good limeston within a mile or two and burn it myself if i had care to do so the pond had in the meanwhil skim over in the shadiest and shallowest cove some dai or even week befor the gener freez the first ic is especi interest and perfect be hard dark and transpar and afford the best opportun that ever offer for examin the bottom where it is shallow for you can lie at your length on ic onli an inch thick like a skater insect on the surfac of the water and studi the bottom at your leisur onli two or three inch distant like a pictur behind a glass and the water is necessarili alwai smooth then there ar mani furrow in the sand where some creatur ha travel about and doubl on it track and for wreck it is strewn with the case of caddisworm made of minut grain of white quartz perhap these have creas it for you find some of their case in the furrow though thei ar deep and broad for them to make but the ic itself is the object of most interest though you must improv the earliest opportun to studi it if you examin it close the morn after it freez you find that the greater part of the bubbl which at first appear to be within it ar against it under surfac and that more ar continu rise from the bottom while the ic is as yet compar solid and dark that is you see the water through it these bubbl ar from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diamet veri clear and beauti and you see your face reflect in them through the ic there mai be thirti or forti of them to a squar inch there ar also alreadi within the ic narrow oblong perpendicular bubbl about half an inch long sharp cone with the apex upward or often if the ic is quit fresh minut spheric bubbl on directli abov anoth like a string of bead but these within the ic ar not so numer nor obviou as those beneath i sometim us to cast on stone to try the strength of the ic and those which broke through carri in air with them which form veri larg and conspicu white bubbl beneath on dai when i came to the same place fortyeight hour afterward i found that those larg bubbl were still perfect though an inch more of ic had form as i could see distinctli by the seam in the edg of a cake but as the last two dai had been veri warm like an indian summer the ic wa not now transpar show the dark green color of the water and the bottom but opaqu and whitish or grai and though twice as thick wa hardli stronger than befor for the air bubbl had greatli expand under thi heat and run togeth and lost their regular thei were no longer on directli over anoth but often like silveri coin pour from a bag on overlap anoth or in thin flake as if occupi slight cleavag the beauti of the ic wa gone and it wa too late to studi the bottom be curiou to know what posit my great bubbl occupi with regard to the new ic i broke out a cake contain a middl size on and turn it bottom upward the new ic had form around and under the bubbl so that it wa includ between the two ic it wa wholli in the lower ic but close against the upper and wa flattish or perhap slightli lenticular with a round edg a quarter of an inch deep by four inch in diamet and i wa surpris to find that directli under the bubbl the ic wa melt with great regular in the form of a saucer revers to the height of five eighth of an inch in the middl leav a thin partit there between the water and the bubbl hardli an eighth of an inch thick and in mani place the small bubbl in thi partit had burst out downward and probabl there wa no ic at all under the largest bubbl which were a foot in diamet i infer that the infinit number of minut bubbl which i had first seen against the under surfac of the ic were now frozen in likewis and that each in it degre had oper like a burningglass on the ic beneath to melt and rot it these ar the littl airgun which contribut to make the ic crack and whoop at length the winter set in good earnest just as i had finish plaster and the wind began to howl around the hous as if it had not had permiss to do so till then night after night the gees came lumber in the dark with a clangor and a whistl of wing even after the ground wa cover with snow some to alight in walden and some fly low over the wood toward fair haven bound for mexico sever time when return from the villag at ten or eleven oclock at night i heard the tread of a flock of gees or els duck on the dry leav in the wood by a pondhol behind my dwell where thei had

wai behind came an old hound and her three pup in full pursuit hunt on their own account and disappear again in the wood late in the afternoon as he wa rest in the thick wood south of walden he heard the voic of the hound far over toward fair haven still pursu the fox and on thei came their hound cry which made all the wood ring sound nearer and nearer now from well meadow now from the baker farm for a long time he stood still and listen to their music so sweet to a hunter ear when suddenli the fox appear thread the solemn aisl with an easi cours pace whose sound wa conceal by a sympathet rustl of the leav swift and still keep the round leav hi pursuer far behind and leap upon a rock amid the wood he sat erect and listen with hi back to the hunter for a moment compass restrain the

transmit to the soul the wonder and vari spectacl of thi univers the night veil without doubt a part of thi gloriou creation but dai come to reveal to us thi great work which extend from earth even into the plain of the ether then to my morn work first i take an ax and pail and go in search of water if that be not a dream after a cold and snowi night it need a diviningrod to find it everi winter the liquid and trembl surfac of the pond which wa so sensit to everi breath and reflect everi light and shadow becom solid to the depth of a foot or a foot and a half so that it will support the heaviest team and perchanc the snow cover it to an equal depth and it is not to be distinguish from ani level field like the marmot in the surround hill it close it eyelid and becom dormant for three month or more stand on the snowcov plain as if in a pastur amid the hill i cut my wai first through a foot of snow and then a foot of ic and open a window under my feet where kneel to drink i look down into the quiet parlor of the fish pervad by a soften light as through a window of ground glass with it bright sand floor the same as in summer there a perenni waveless seren reign as in the amber twilight sky correspond to the cool and even tempera of the inhabit heaven is under our feet as well as over our head earli in the morn while all thing ar crisp with frost men come with fishingreel and slender lunch and let down their fine line through the snowi field to take pickerel and perch wild men who instinct follow other fashion and trust other author than their townsmen and by their go and come stitch town togeth in part where els thei would be rip thei sit and eat their luncheon in stout fearnaught on the dry oak leav on the shore as wise in natur lore as the citizen is in artifici thei never consult with book and know and can tell much less than thei have done the thing which thei practic ar said not yet to be known here is on fish for pickerel with grown perch for bait you look into hi pail with wonder as into a summer pond as if he kept summer lock up at home or knew where she had retreat how prai did he get these in midwint oh he got worm out of rotten log sinc the ground froze and so he caught them hi life itself pass deeper in natur than the studi of the naturalist penetr himself a subject for the naturalist the latter rais the moss and bark gentli with hi knife in search of insect the former lai open log to their core with hi ax and moss and bark fly far and wide he get hi live by bark tree such a man ha some right to fish and i love to see natur carri out in him the perch swallow the grubworm the pickerel swallow the perch and the fisherman swallow the pickerel and so all the chink in the scale of be ar fill when i stroll around the pond in misti weather i wa sometim amus by the primit mode which some ruder fisherman had adopt he would perhap have place alder branch over the narrow hole in the ic which were four or five rod apart and an equal distanc from the shore and have fasten the end of the line to a stick to prevent it be pull through have pass the slack line over a twig of the alder a foot or more abov the ic and ti a dry oak leaf to it which be pull down would show when he had a bite these alder loom through the mist at regular interv as you walk half wai round the pond ah the pickerel of walden when i see them ly on the ic or in the well which the fisherman cut in the ic make a littl hole to admit the water i am alwai surpris by their rare beauti as if thei were fabul fish thei ar so foreign to the street even to the wood foreign as arabia to our concord life thei possess a quit dazzl and transcend beauti which separ them by a wide interv from the cadaver cod and haddock whose fame is trumpet in our street thei ar not green like the pine nor grai like the stone nor blue like the sky but thei have to my ey if possibl yet rarer color like flower and preciou stone as if thei were the pearl the anim nuclei or crystal of the walden water thei of cours ar walden all over and all through ar themselv small walden in the anim kingdom waldens it is surpris that thei ar caught herethat in thi deep and capaci spring far beneath the rattl team and chais and tinkl sleigh that travel the walden road thi great gold and emerald fish swim i never chanc to see it kind in ani market it would be the cynosur of all ey there easili with a few convuls quirk thei give up their wateri ghost like a mortal translat befor hi time to the thin air of heaven as i wa desir to recov the long lost bottom of walden pond i survei it carefulli befor the ic broke up earli in with compass and chain and sound line there have been mani stori told about the bottom or rather no bottom of thi pond which certainli had no foundat for themselv it is remark how long men will believ in the bottomless of a pond without take the troubl to sound it i have visit two such bottomless pond in on walk in thi neighborhood mani have believ that walden reach quit through to the other side of the globe some who have lain flat on the ic for a long time look down through the illus medium perchanc with wateri ey into the bargain and driven to hasti conclus by the fear of catch cold in their breast have seen vast hole into which a load of hai might be driven if there were anybodi to drive it the undoubt sourc of the styx and entranc to the infern region from these part other have gone down from the villag with a fiftysix and a wagon load of inch rope but yet have fail to find ani bottom for while the fiftysix wa rest by the wai thei were pai out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truli immeasur capac for marvel but i can assur my reader that walden ha a reason tight bottom at a not unreason though at an unusu depth i fathom it easili with a codlin and a stone weigh about a pound and a half and could tell accur when the stone left the bottom by have to pull so much harder befor the water got underneath to help me the greatest depth wa exactli on hundr and two feet to which mai be ad the five feet which it ha risen sinc make on hundr and seven thi is a remark depth for so small an area yet not an inch of it can be spare by the imagin what if all pond were shallow would it not react on the mind of men i am thank that thi pond wa made deep and pure for a symbol while men believ in the infinit some pond will be thought to be bottomless a factoryown hear what depth i had found thought that it could not be true for judg from hi acquaint with dam sand would not lie at so steep an angl but the deepest pond ar not so deep in proport to their area as most suppos and if drain would not leav veri remark vallei thei ar not like cup between the hill for thi on which is so unusu deep for it area appear in a vertic section through it centr not deeper than a shallow plate most pond empti would leav a meadow no more hollow than we frequent see william gilpin who is so admir in all that relat to landscap and usual so correct stand at the head of loch fyne in scotland which he describ as a bai of salt water sixti or seventi fathom deep four mile in breadth and about fifti mile long surround by mountain observ if we could have seen it immedi after the diluvian crash or whatev convuls of natur occas it befor the water gush in what a horrid chasm must it have appear so high as heav the tumid hill so low down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep capaci bed of water but if us the shortest diamet of loch fyne we appli these proport to walden which as we have seen appear alreadi in a vertic section onli like a shallow plate it will appear four time as shallow so much for the increas horror of the chasm of loch fyne when empti no doubt mani a smile vallei with it stretch cornfield occupi exactli such a horrid chasm from which the water have reced though it requir the insight and the far sight of the geologist to convinc the unsuspect inhabit of thi fact often an inquisit ey mai detect the shore of a primit lake in the low horizon hill and no subsequ elev of the plain have been necessari to conceal their histori but it is easiest as thei who work on the highwai know to find the hollow by the puddl after a shower the amount of it is the imagin give it the least licens dive deeper and soar higher than natur goe so probabl the depth of the ocean will be found to be veri inconsider compar with it breadth as i sound through the ic i could determin the shape of the bottom with greater accuraci than is possibl in survei harbor which do not freez over and i wa surpris at it gener regular in the deepest part there ar sever acr more level than almost ani field which is expos to the sun wind and plow in on instanc on a line arbitrarili chosen the depth did not vari more than on foot in thirti rod and gener near the middl i could calcul the variat for each on hundr feet in ani direct beforehand within three or four inch some ar accustom to speak of deep and danger hole even in quiet sandi pond like thi but the effect of water under these circumst is to level all inequ the regular of the bottom and it conform to the shore and the rang of the neighbor hill were so perfect that a distant promontori betrai itself in the sound quit across the pond and it direct could be determin by observ the opposit shore cape becom bar and plain shoal and vallei and gorg deep water and channel when i had map the pond by the scale of ten rod to an inch and put down the sound more than a hundr in all i observ thi remark coincid have notic that the number indic the greatest depth wa appar in the centr of the map i laid a rule on the map lengthwis and then breadthwis and found to my surpris that the line of greatest length intersect the line of greatest breadth exactli at the point of greatest depth notwithstand that the middl is so nearli level the outlin of the pond far from regular and the extrem length and breadth were got by measur into the cove and i said to myself who know but thi hint would conduct to the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddl is not thi the rule also for the height of mountain regard as the opposit of vallei we know that a hill is not highest at it narrowest part of five cove three or all which had been sound were observ to have a bar quit across their mouth and deeper water within so that the bai tend to be an expans of water within the land not onli horizont but vertic and to form a basin or independ pond the direct of the two cape show the cours of the bar everi harbor on the seacoast also ha it bar at it entranc in proport as the mouth of the cove wa wider compar with it length the water over the bar wa deeper compar with that in the basin given then the length and breadth of the cove and the charact of the surround shore and you have almost element enough to make out a formula for all case in order to see how nearli i could guess with thi experi at the deepest point in a pond by observ the outlin of a surfac and the charact of it shore alon i made a plan of white pond which contain about fortyon acr and like thi ha no island in it nor ani visibl inlet or outlet and as the line of greatest breadth fell veri near the line of least breadth where two opposit cape approach each other and two opposit bai reced i ventur to mark a point a short distanc from the latter line but still on the line of greatest length as the deepest the deepest part wa found to be within on hundr feet of thi still farther in the direct to which i had inclin and wa onli on foot deeper name sixti feet of cours a stream run through or an island in the pond would make the problem much more complic if we knew all the law of natur we should need onli on fact or the descript of on actual phenomenon to infer all the particular result at that point now we know onli a few law and our result is vitiat not of cours by ani confus or irregular in natur but by our ignor of essenti element in the calcul our notion of law and harmoni ar commonli confin to those instanc which we detect but the harmoni which result from a far greater number of seemingli conflict but realli concur law which we have not detect is still more wonder the particular law ar as our point of view as to the travel a mountain outlin vari with everi step and it ha an infinit number of profil though absolut but on form even when cleft or bore through it is not comprehend in it entir what i have observ of the pond is no less true in ethic it is the law of averag such a rule of the two diamet not onli guid us toward the sun in the system and the heart in man but draw line through the length and breadth of the aggreg of a man particular daili behavior and wave of life into hi cove and inlet and where thei intersect will be the height or depth of hi charact perhap we need onli to know how hi shore trend and hi adjac countri or circumst to infer hi depth and conceal bottom if he is surround by mountain circumst an achillean shore whose peak overshadow and ar reflect in hi bosom thei suggest a correspond depth in him but a low and smooth shore prove him shallow on that side in our bodi a bold project brow fall off to and indic a correspond depth of thought also there is a bar across the entranc of our everi cove or particular inclin each is our harbor for a season in which we ar detain and partial landlock these inclin ar not whimsic usual but their form size and direct ar determin by the promontori of the shore the ancient ax of elev when thi bar is gradual increas by storm tide or current or there is a subsid of the water so that it reach to the surfac that which wa at first but an inclin in the shore in which a thought wa harbor becom an individu lake cut off from the ocean wherein the thought secur it own conditionschang perhap from salt to fresh becom a sweet sea dead sea or a marsh at the advent of each individu into thi life mai we not suppos that such a bar ha risen to the surfac somewher it is true we ar such poor navig that our thought for the most part stand off and on upon a harborless coast ar convers onli with the bight of the bai of poesi or steer for the public port of entri and go into the dry dock of scienc where thei mere refit for thi world and no natur current concur to individu them as for the inlet or outlet of walden i have not discov ani but rain and snow and evapor though perhap with a thermomet and a line such place mai be found for where the water flow into the pond it will probabl be coldest in summer and warmest in winter when the icemen were at work here in the cake sent to the shore were on dai reject by those who were stack them up there not be thick enough to lie side by side with the rest and the cutter thu discov that the ic over a small space wa two or three inch thinner than elsewher which made them think that there wa an inlet there thei also show me in anoth place what thei thought wa a leachhol through which the pond leak out under a hill into a neighbor meadow push me out on a cake of ic to see it it wa a small caviti under ten feet of water but i think that i can warrant the pond not to need solder till thei find a wors leak than that on ha suggest that if such a leachhol should be found it connect with the meadow if ani exist might be prove by convei some color powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole and then put a strainer over the spring in the meadow which would catch some of the particl carri through by the current while i wa survei the ic which wa sixteen inch thick undul under a slight wind like water it is well known that a level cannot be us on ic at on rod from the shore it greatest fluctuat when observ by mean of a level on land direct toward a graduat staff on the ic wa three quarter of an inch though the ic appear firmli attach to the shore it wa probabl greater in the middl who know but if our instrument were delic enough we might detect an undul in the crust of the earth when two leg of my level were on the shore and the third on the ic and the sight were direct over the latter a rise or fall of the ic of an almost infinitesim amount made a differ of sever feet on a tree across the pond when i began to cut hole for sound there were three or four inch of water on the ic under a deep snow which had sunk it thu far but the water began immedi to run into these hole and continu to run for two dai in deep stream which wore awai the ic on everi side and contribut essenti if not mainli to dry the surfac of the pond for as the water ran in it rais and float the ic thi wa somewhat like cut a hole in the bottom of a ship to let the water out when such hole freez and a rain succe and final a new freez form a fresh smooth ic over all it is beautifulli mottl intern by dark figur shape somewhat like a spider web what you mai call ic rosett produc by the channel worn by the water flow from all side to a centr sometim also when the ic wa cover with shallow puddl i saw a doubl shadow of myself on stand on the head of the other on on the ic the other on the tree or hillsid while yet it is cold januari and snow and ic ar thick and solid the prudent landlord come from the villag to get ic to cool hi summer drink impress even pathet wise to forese the heat and thirst of juli now in januarywear a thick coat and mitten when so mani thing ar not provid for it mai be that he lai up no treasur in thi world which will cool hi summer drink in the next he cut and saw the solid pond unroof the hous of fish and cart off their veri element and air held fast by chain and stake like cord wood through the favor winter air to wintri cellar to underli the summer there it look like solidifi azur as far off it is drawn through the street these icecutt ar a merri race full of jest and sport and when i went among them thei were wont to invit me to saw pitfashion with them i stand underneath in the winter of there came a hundr men of hyperborean extract swoop down on to our pond on morn with mani carload of ungainlylook farm toolssl plow drillbarrow turfkniv spade saw rake and each man wa arm with a doublepoint pikestaff such as is not describ in the newengland farmer or the cultiv i did not know whether thei had come to sow a crop of winter rye or some other kind of grain recent introduc from iceland as i saw no manur i judg that thei meant to skim the land as i had done think the soil wa deep and had lain fallow long enough thei said that a gentleman farmer who wa behind the scene want to doubl hi monei which as i understood amount to half a million alreadi but in order to cover each on of hi dollar with anoth he took off the onli coat ay the skin itself of walden pond in the midst of a hard winter thei went to work at onc plow barrow roll furrow in admir order as if thei were bent on make thi a model farm but when i wa look sharp to see what kind of seed thei drop into the furrow a gang of fellow by my side suddenli began to hook up the virgin mould itself with a peculiar jerk clean down to the sand or rather the waterfor it wa a veri springi soilinde all the terra firma there wasand haul it awai on sled and then i guess that thei must be cut peat in a bog so thei came and went everi dai with a peculiar shriek from the locomot from and to some point of the polar region as it seem to me like a flock of arctic snowbird but sometim squaw walden had her reveng and a hire man walk behind hi team slip through a crack in the ground down toward tartaru and he who wa so brave befor suddenli becam but the ninth part of a man almost gave up hi anim heat and wa glad to take refug in my hous and acknowledg that there wa some virtu in a stove or sometim the frozen soil took a piec of steel out of a plowshar or a plow got set in the furrow and had to be cut out to speak liter a hundr irishmen with yanke overs came from cambridg everi dai to get out the ic thei divid it into cake by method too well known to requir descript and these be sled to the shore were rapidli haul off on to an ic platform and rais by grappl iron and block and tackl work by hors on to a stack as sure as so mani barrel of flour and there place evenli side by side and row upon row as if thei form the solid base of an obelisk design to pierc the cloud thei told me that in a good dai thei could get out a thousand ton which wa the yield of about on acr deep rut and cradlehol were worn in the ic as on terra firma by the passag of the sled over the same track and the hors invari at their oat out of cake of ic hollow out like bucket thei stack up the cake thu in the open air in a pile thirtyf feet high on on side and six or seven rod squar put hai between the outsid layer to exclud the air for when the wind though never so cold find a passag through it will wear larg caviti leav slight support or stud onli here and there and final toppl it down at first it look like a vast blue fort or valhalla but when thei began to tuck the coars meadow hai into the crevic and thi becam cover with rime and icicl it look like a vener mossgrown and hoari ruin built of azuretint marbl the abod of winter that old man we see in the almanachi shanti as if he had a design to estiv with us thei calcul that not twentyf per cent of thi would reach it destin and that two or three per cent would be wast in the car howev a still greater part of thi heap had a differ destini from what wa intend for either becaus the ic wa found not to keep so well as wa expect contain more air than usual or for some other reason it never got to market thi heap made in the winter of and estim to contain ten thousand ton wa final cover with hai and board and though it wa unroof the follow juli and a part of it carri off the rest remain expos to the sun it stood over that summer and the next winter and wa not quit melt till septemb thu the pond recov the greater part like the water the walden ic seen near at hand ha a green tint but at a distanc is beautifulli blue and you can easili tell it from the white ic of the river or the mere greenish ic of some pond a quarter of a mile off sometim on of those great cake slip from the iceman sled into the villag street and li there for a week like a great emerald an object of interest to all passer i have notic that a portion of walden which in the state of water wa green will often when frozen appear from the same point of view blue so the hollow about thi pond will sometim in the winter be fill with a greenish water somewhat like it own but the next dai will have frozen blue perhap the blue color of water and ic is due to the light and air thei contain and the most transpar is the bluest ic is an interest subject for contempl thei told me that thei had some in the icehous at fresh pond five year old which wa as good as ever why is it that a bucket of water soon becom putrid but frozen remain sweet forev it is commonli said that thi is the differ between the affect and the intellect thu for sixteen dai i saw from my window a hundr men at work like busi husbandmen with team and hors and appar all the implement of farm such a pictur as we see on the first page of the almanac and as often as i look out i wa remind of the fabl of the lark and the reaper or the parabl of the sower and the like and now thei ar all gone and in thirti dai more probabl i shall look from the same window on the pure seagreen walden water there reflect the cloud and the tree and send up it evapor in solitud and no trace will appear that a man ha ever stood there perhap i shall hear a solitari loon laugh as he dive and plume himself or shall see a lone fisher in hi boat like a float leaf behold hi form reflect in the wave where late a hundr men secur labor thu it appear that the swelter inhabit of charleston and new orlean of madra and bombai and calcutta drink at my well in the morn i bath my intellect in the stupend and cosmogon philosophi of the bhagvatgeeta sinc whose composit year of the god have elaps and in comparison with which our modern world and it literatur seem puni and trivial and i doubt if that philosophi is not to be refer to a previou state of exist so remot is it sublim from our concept i lai down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the bramin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sit in hi templ on the gang read the veda or dwell at the root of a tree with hi crust and water jug i meet hi servant come to draw water for hi master and our bucket as it were grate togeth in the same well the pure walden water is mingl with the sacr water of the gang with favor wind it is waft past the site of the fabul island of atlanti and the hesperid make the periplu of hanno and float by ternat and tidor and the mouth of the persian gulf melt in the tropic gale of the indian sea and is land in port of which alexand onli heard the name spring the open of larg tract by the icecutt commonli caus a pond to break up earlier for the water agit by the wind even in cold weather wear awai the surround ic but such wa not the effect on walden that year for she had soon got a thick new garment to take the place of the old thi pond never break up so soon as the other in thi neighborhood on account both of it greater depth and it have no stream pass through it to melt or wear awai the ic i never knew it to open in the cours of a winter not except that of which gave the pond so sever a trial it commonli open about the first of april a week or ten dai later than flint pond and fair haven begin to melt on the north side and in the shallow part where it began to freez it indic better than ani water hereabout the absolut progress of the season be least affect by transient chang of temperatur a sever cold of a few dai durat in march mai veri much retard the open of the former pond while the temperatur of walden increas almost uninterruptedli a thermomet thrust into the middl of walden on the th of march stood at or freez point near the shore at in the middl of flint pond the same dai at at a dozen rod from the shore in shallow water under ic a foot thick at thi differ of three and a half degre between the temperatur of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond and the fact that a great proport of it is compar shallow show why it should break up so much sooner than walden the ic in the shallowest part wa at thi time sever inch thinner than in the middl in midwint the middl had been the warmest and the ic thinnest there so also everi on who ha wade about the shore of the pond in summer must have perceiv how much warmer the water is close to the shore where onli three or four inch deep than a littl distanc out and on the surfac where it is deep than near the bottom in spring the sun not onli exert an influenc through the increas temperatur of the air and earth but it heat pass through ic a foot or more thick and is reflect from the bottom in shallow water and so also warm the water and melt the under side of the ic at the same time that it is melt it more directli abov make it uneven and caus the air bubbl which it contain to extend themselv upward and downward until it is complet honeycomb and at last disappear suddenli in a singl spring rain ic ha it grain as well as wood and when a cake begin to rot or comb that is assum the appear of honeycomb whatev mai be it posit the air cell ar at right angl with what wa the water surfac where there is a rock or a log rise near to the surfac the ic over it is much thinner and is frequent quit dissolv by thi reflect heat and i have been told that in the experi at cambridg to freez water in a shallow wooden pond though the cold air circul underneath and so had access to both side the reflect of the sun from the bottom more than counterbalanc thi advantag when a warm rain in the middl of the winter melt off the snowic from walden and leav a hard dark or transpar ic on the middl there will be a strip of rotten though thicker white ic a rod or more wide about the shore creat by thi reflect heat also as i have said the bubbl themselv within the ic oper as burningglass to melt the ic beneath the phenomena of the year take place everi dai in a pond on a small scale everi morn gener speak the shallow water is be warm more rapidli than the deep though it mai not be made so warm after all and everi even it is be cool more rapidli until the morn the dai is an epitom of the year the night is the winter the morn and even ar the spring and fall and the noon is the summer the crack and boom of the ic indic a chang of temperatur on pleasant morn after a cold night februari th have gone to flint pond to spend the dai i notic with surpris that when i struck the ic with the head of my ax it resound like a gong for mani rod around or as if i had struck on a tight drumhead the pond began to boom about an hour after sunris when it felt the influenc of the sun rai slant upon it from over the hill it stretch itself and yawn like a wake man with a gradual increas tumult which wa kept up three or four hour it took a short siesta at noon and boom onc more toward night as the sun wa withdraw hi influenc in the right stage of the weather a pond fire it even gun with great regular but in the middl of the dai be full of crack and the air also be less elast it had complet lost it reson and probabl fish and muskrat could not then have been stun by a blow on it the fishermen sai that the thunder of the pond scare the fish and prevent their bite the pond doe not thunder everi even and i cannot tell sure when to expect it thunder but though i mai perceiv no differ in the weather it doe who would have suspect so larg and cold and thickskin a thing to be so sensit yet it ha it law to which it thunder obedi when it should as sure as the bud expand in the spring the earth is all aliv and cover with papilla the largest pond is as sensit to atmospher chang as the globul of mercuri in it tube on attract in come to the wood to live wa that i should have leisur and opportun to see the spring come in the ic in the pond at length begin to be honeycomb and i can set my heel in it as i walk fog and rain and warmer sun ar gradual melt the snow the dai have grown sensibl longer and i see how i shall get through the winter without ad to my woodpil for larg fire ar no longer necessari i am on the alert for the first sign of spring to hear the chanc note of some arriv bird or the stripe squirrel chirp for hi store must be now nearli exhaust or see the woodchuck ventur out of hi winter quarter on the th of march after i had heard the bluebird song sparrow and redw the ic wa still nearli a foot thick as the weather grew warmer it wa not sensibl worn awai by the water nor broken up and float off as in river but though it wa complet melt for half a rod in width about the shore the middl wa mere honeycomb and satur with water so that you could put your foot through it when six inch thick but by the next dai even perhap after a warm rain follow by fog it would have wholli disappear all gone off with the fog spirit awai on year i went across the middl onli five dai befor it disappear entir in walden wa first complet open on the st of april in the th of march in the th of april in the th of march in the th of april in the d of march in about the th of april everi incid connect with the break up of the river and pond and the settl of the weather is particularli interest to us who live in a climat of so great extrem when the warmer dai come thei who dwell near the river hear the ic crack at night with a startl whoop as loud as artilleri as if it ici fetter were rent from end to end and within a few dai see it rapidli go out so the allig come out of the mud with quak of the earth on old man who ha been a close observ of natur and seem as thoroughli wise in regard to all her oper as if she had been put upon the stock when he wa a boi and he had help to lai her keelwho ha come to hi growth and can hardli acquir more of natur lore if he should live to the ag of methuselahtold meand i wa surpris to hear him express wonder at ani of natur oper for i thought that there were no secret between themthat on spring dai he took hi gun and boat and thought that he would have a littl sport with the duck there wa ic still on the meadow but it wa all gone out of the river and he drop down without obstruct from sudburi where he live to fair haven pond which he found unexpectedli cover for the most part with a firm field of ic it wa a warm dai and he wa surpris to see so great a bodi of ic remain not see ani duck he hid hi boat on the north or back side of an island in the pond and then conceal himself in the bush on the south side to await them the ic wa melt for three or four rod from the shore and there wa a smooth and warm sheet of water with a muddi bottom such as the duck love within and he thought it like that some would be along pretti soon after he had lain still there about an hour he heard a low and seemingli veri distant sound but singularli grand and impress unlik anyth he had ever heard gradual swell and increas as if it would have a univers and memor end a sullen rush and roar which seem to him all at onc like the sound of a vast bodi of fowl come in to settl there and seiz hi gun he start up in hast and excit but he found to hi surpris that the whole bodi of the ic had start while he lai there and drift in to the shore and the sound he had heard wa made by it edg grate on the shoreat first gentli nibbl and crumbl off but at length heav up and scatter it wreck along the island to a consider height befor it came to a standstil at length the sun rai have attain the right angl and warm wind blow up mist and rain and melt the snowbank and the sun dispers the mist smile on a checker landscap of russet and white smoke with incens through which the travel pick hi wai from islet to islet cheer by the music of a thousand tinkl rill and rivulet whose vein ar fill with the blood of

sand of everi degre of fine and of variou rich color commonli mix with a littl clai when the frost come out in the spring and even in a thaw dai in the winter the sand begin to flow down the slope like lava sometim burst out through the snow and overflow it where no sand wa to be seen befor innumer littl stream overlap and interlac on with anoth exhibit a sort of hybrid product which obei half wai the law of current and half wai that of veget as it flow it take the form of sappi leav or vine make heap of pulpi sprai a foot or more in depth and resembl as you look down on them the lacini lobe and imbric thallus of some lichen or you ar remind of coral of leopard paw or bird feet of brain or lung or bowel and excrement of all kind it is a truli grotesqu veget whose form and color we

cut impress me as if it were a cave with it stalactit laid open to the light the variou shade of the sand ar singularli rich and agreeabl embrac the differ iron color brown grai yellowish and reddish when the flow mass reach the drain at the foot of the bank it spread out flatter into strand the separ stream lose their semicylindr form and gradual becom more flat and broad run togeth as thei ar more moist till thei form an almost flat sand still various and beautifulli shade but in which you can trace the origin form of veget till at length in the water itself thei ar convert into bank like those form off the mouth of river and the form of veget ar lost in the rippl mark on the bottom the whole bank which is from twenti to forti feet high is sometim overlaid with a mass of thi kind of foliag or sandi ruptur for a quarter of a mile on on or both side the produc of on spring dai what make thi sand foliag remark is it spring into exist thu suddenli when i see on the on side the inert

which thei will have govern is at best but an expedi but most govern ar usual and all govern ar sometim inexpedi the object which have been brought against a stand armi and thei ar mani and weighti and deserv to prevail mai also at last be brought against a stand govern the stand armi is onli an arm of the stand govern the govern itself which is onli the mode which the peopl have chosen to execut their will is equal liabl to be abus and pervert befor the peopl can act through it wit the present mexican war the work of compar a few individu us the stand govern as their tool for in the outset the peopl would not have consent to thi measur thi american governmentwhat is it but a tradit though a recent on endeavor to transmit itself unimpair to poster but each instant lose some of it integr it ha not the vital and forc of a singl live man for a singl man can bend it to hi will it is a sort of wooden gun to the peopl themselv but it is not the less necessari for thi for the peopl must have some complic machineri or other and hear it din to satisfi that idea of govern which thei have govern show thu how successfulli men can be impos on even impos on themselv for their own advantag it is excel we must all allow yet thi govern never of itself further ani enterpris but by the alacr with which it got out of it wai it doe not keep the countri free it doe not settl the west it doe not educ the charact inher in the american peopl ha done all that ha been accomplish and it would have done somewhat more if the govern had not sometim got in it wai for govern is an expedi by which men would fain succe in let on anoth alon and as ha been said when it is most expedi the govern ar most let alon by it trade and commerc if thei were not made of india rubber would never manag to bounc over the obstacl which legisl ar continu put in their wai and if on were to judg these men wholli by the effect of their action and not partli by their intent thei would deserv to be class and punish with those mischiev person who put obstruct on the railroad but to speak practic and as a citizen unlik those who call themselv nogovern men i ask for not at onc no govern but at onc a better govern let everi man make known what kind of govern would command hi respect and that will be on step toward obtain it after all the practic reason why when the power is onc in the hand of the peopl a major ar permit and for a long period continu to rule is not becaus thei ar most like to be in the right nor becaus thi seem fairest to the minor but becaus thei ar physic the strongest but a govern in which the major rule in all case cannot be base on justic even as far as men understand it can there not be a govern in which major do not virtual decid right and wrong but consciencein which major decid onli those question to which the rule of expedi is applic must the citizen ever for a moment or in the least degre resign hi conscienc to the legisl why ha everi man a conscienc then i think that we should be men first and subject afterward it is not desir to cultiv a respect for the law so much as for the right the onli oblig which i have a right to assum is to do at ani time what i think right it is truli enough said that a corpor ha no conscienc but a corpor of conscienti men is a corpor with a conscienc law never made men a whit more just and by mean of their respect for it even the welldispos ar daili made the agent of injustic a common and natur result of an undu respect for law is that you mai see a file of soldier colonel captain corpor privat powdermonkei and all march in admir order over hill and dale to the war against their will ay against their common sens and conscienc which make it veri steep march inde and produc a palpit of the heart thei have no

instrument to ani sovereign state throughout the world he who give himself entir to hi fellowmen appear to them useless and selfish but he who give himself partial to them is pronounc a benefactor and philanthropist how doe it becom a man to behav toward thi american govern todai i answer that he cannot without disgrac be associ with it i cannot for an instant recogn that polit organ as my govern which is the slave govern also all men recogn the right of revolut that is the right to refus allegi to and to resist the govern when it tyranni or it ineffici ar great and unendur but almost all sai that such is not the case now but such wa the case thei think in the revolut of if on were to tell me that thi wa a bad govern becaus it tax certain foreign commod brought to it port it is most probabl that i should not make an ado about it for i can do without them all machin have their friction and possibl thi doe enough good to counterbal the evil at ani rate it is a great evil to make a stir about it but when the friction come to have it machin and oppress and robberi ar organ i sai let us not have such a machin ani longer in other word when a sixth of the popul of a nation which ha undertaken to be the refug of liberti ar slave and a whole countri is unjustli overrun and conquer by a foreign armi and subject to militari law i think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolution what make thi duti the more urgent is the fact that the countri so overrun is not our own but our is the invad armi palei a common author with mani on moral question in hi chapter on the duti of submiss to civil govern resolv all civil oblig into expedi and he proce to sai that so long as the interest of the whole societi requir it that is so long as the establish govern cannot be

of the quantiti of the danger and grievanc on the on side and of the probabl and expens of redress it on the other of thi he sai everi man shall judg for himself but palei appear never to have contempl those case to which the rule of expedi doe not appli in which a peopl as well as an individu must do justic cost what it mai if i have unjustli wrest a plank from a drown man i must restor it to him though i drown myself thi accord to palei would be inconveni but he that would save hi life in such a case shall lose it thi peopl must ceas to hold slave and to make war on mexico though it cost them their exist as a peopl in their practic nation agre with palei but doe ani on think that massachusett doe exactli what is right at the present crisi a drab of state a clothosilv slut to have her train born up and her soul trail in the dirt practic speak the oppon to a reform in massachusett ar not a hundr thousand politician at the south but a hundr thousand merchant and farmer here who ar more interest in commerc and agricultur than thei ar in human and ar not prepar to do justic to the slave and to mexico cost what it mai i quarrel not with faroff foe but with those who near at home cooper with and do the bid of those far awai and without whom the latter would be harmless we ar accustom to sai that the mass of men ar unprepar but improv is slow becaus the few ar not materi wiser or better than the mani it is not so import that mani should be as good as you as that there be some absolut good somewher for that will leaven the whole lump there ar thousand who ar in opinion oppos to slaveri and to the war who yet in effect do noth to put an end to them who esteem themselv children of washington and franklin sit down with their hand in their pocket and sai that thei know

vital concern that that right should prevail i am will to leav it to the major it oblig therefor never exce that of expedi even vote for the right is do noth for it it is onli express to men feebli your desir that it should prevail a wise man will not leav the right to the merci of chanc nor wish it to prevail through the power of the major there is but littl virtu in the action of mass of men when the major shall at length vote for the abolit of slaveri it will be becaus thei ar indiffer to slaveri or becaus there is but littl slaveri left to be abolish by their vote thei will then be the onli slave onli hi vote can hasten the abolit of slaveri who assert hi own freedom by hi vote i hear of a convent to be held at baltimor or elsewher for the select of a candid for the presid made up

persuad the major to alter them thei think that if thei should resist the remedi would be wors than the evil but it is the fault of the govern itself that the remedi is wors than the evil it make it wors why is it not more apt to anticip and provid for reform why doe it not cherish it wise minor why doe it cry and resist befor it is hurt why doe it not encourag it citizen to be on the alert to point out it fault and do better than it would have them why doe it alwai crucifi christ and excommun copernicu and luther and pronounc washington and franklin rebel on would think that a deliber and practic denial of it author wa the onli offenc never contempl by govern els why ha it not assign it definit it suitabl and proportion penalti if a man who ha no properti refus but onc to earn nine shill for the state he is put in prison for a period unlimit by ani law that i know and determin onli by the discret of those who place him there but if he should steal nineti time nine shill from the

if the injustic ha a spring or a pullei or a rope or a crank exclus for itself then perhap you mai consid whether the remedi will not be wors than the evil but if it is of such a natur that it requir you to be the agent of injustic to anoth then i sai break the law let your life be a counter friction to stop the machin what i have to do is to see at ani rate that i do not lend myself to the wrong which i condemn as for adopt the wai which the state ha provid for remedi the evil i know not of such wai thei take too much time and a man life will be gone i have other affair to attend to i came into thi world not chiefli to make thi a good place to live in but to live in it be it good or bad a man ha not everyth to do but someth and becaus he cannot do everyth it is not necessari that he should do someth wrong it is not my busi to be petit the governor or the legislatur ani more than it is their to petit me and if thei should not hear my petit what should i do then but in thi case the state ha provid no wai it veri constitut is the evil thi mai seem to be harsh and stubborn and unconciliatori but it is to treat with the utmost kind and consider the onli spirit that can appreci or deserv it so is ani chang for the better like birth and death which convuls the bodi i do not hesit to sai that those who call themselv abolitionist should at onc effectu withdraw their support both in person and properti from the govern of massachusett and not wait till thei constitut a major of on befor thei suffer the right to prevail through them i think that it is enough if thei have god on their side without wait for that other on moreov ani man more right than hi neighbor constitut a major of on alreadi i meet thi american govern or it repres the state govern directli and face to face onc a yearno morein the person of it taxgather thi is the onli mode in which a man situat as i am necessarili meet it and it then sai distinctli recogn me and the simplest the most effectu and in the present postur of affair the indispensablest mode of treat with it on thi head of express your littl satisfact with and love for it is to deni it then my civil neighbor the taxgather is the veri man i have to deal withfor it is after all with men and not with parchment that i quarreland he ha voluntarili chosen to be an agent of the govern how shall he ever know well what he is and doe as an offic of the govern or as a man until he is oblig to consid whether he shall treat me hi neighbor for whom he ha respect as a neighbor and welldispos man or as a maniac and disturb of the peac and see if he can get over thi obstruct to hi neighborli without a ruder and more impetu thought or speech correspond with hi action i know thi well that if on thousand if on hundr if ten men whom i could nameif ten honest men onlyai if on honest man in thi state of massachusett ceas to hold slave were actual to withdraw from thi copartnership and be lock up in the counti jail therefor it would be the abolit of slaveri in america for it matter not how small the begin mai seem to be what is onc well done is done forev but we love better to talk about it that we sai is our mission reform keep mani score of newspap in it servic but not on man if my esteem neighbor the state ambassador who will devot hi dai to the settlement of the question of human right in the council chamber instead of be threaten with

be the ground of a quarrel with herth legislatur would not wholli waiv the subject the follow winter under a govern which imprison ani unjustli the true place for a just man is also a prison the proper place todai the onli place which massachusett ha provid for her freer and less despond spirit is in her prison to be put out and lock out of the state by her own act as thei have alreadi put themselv out by their principl it is there that the fugit slave and the mexican prison on parol and the indian come to plead the wrong of hi race should find them on that separ but more free and honor ground where the state place those who ar not with her but against herth onli hous in a slave state in which a free man can abid with honor if ani think that their influenc would be lost there and their voic no longer afflict the ear of the state that thei would not be as an enemi within it wall thei do not know by how much truth is stronger than error nor how much more eloqu and effect he can combat injustic who ha experienc a littl in hi own person cast your whole vote not a strip of paper mere but your whole influenc a minor is powerless while it conform to the major it is not even a minor then but it is irresist when it clog by it whole weight if the altern is to keep all just men in prison or give up war and slaveri the state will not hesit which to choos if a thousand men were not to pai their taxbil thi year that would not be a violent and bloodi measur as it would be to pai them and enabl the state to commit violenc and shed innoc blood thi is in fact the definit of a peaceabl revolut if ani such is possibl if the taxgather or ani other public offic ask me as on ha done but what shall i do my answer is if you realli wish to do anyth resign your offic when the subject ha refus allegi and the offic ha resign hi offic then the revolut is accomplish but even suppos blood should flow is there not a sort of blood shed when the conscienc is wound through thi wound a man real manhood and immort flow out and he bleed to an everlast death i see thi blood flow now i have contempl the imprison of the offend rather than the seizur of hi goodsthough both will serv the same purposebecaus thei who assert the purest right and consequ ar most danger to a corrupt state commonli have not spent much time in accumul properti to such the state render compar small servic and a slight tax is wont to appear exorbit particularli if thei ar oblig to earn it by special labor with their hand if there were on who live wholli without the us of monei the state itself would hesit to demand it of him but the rich mannot to make ani invidi comparisoni alwai sold to the institut which make him rich absolut speak the more monei the less virtu for monei come between a man and hi object and obtain them for him and it wa certainli no great virtu to obtain it it put to rest mani question which he would otherwis be tax to answer while the onli new question which it put is the hard but superflu on how to spend it thu hi moral ground is taken from under hi feet the opportun of live ar diminish in proport as what ar call the mean ar increas the best thing a man can do for hi cultur when he is rich is to endeavor to carri out those scheme which he entertain when he wa poor christ answer the herodian accord to their condit show me the tributemonei said heand on took a penni out of hi pocketif you us monei which ha the imag of c sar on it and which he ha made current and valuabl that is if you ar men of the state and gladli enjoi the advantag of c sar govern then pai him back some of hi own when he demand it render therefor to c sar that which is c sar and to god those thing which ar godsleav them no wiser than befor as to which wa which for thei did not wish to know when i convers with the freest of my neighbor i perceiv that whatev thei mai sai about the magnitud and serious of the question and their regard for the public tranquil the long and the short of the matter is that thei cannot spare the protect of the exist govern and thei dread the consequ to their properti and famili of disobedi to it for my own part i should not like to think that i ever reli on the protect of the state but if i deni the author of the state when it present it taxbil it will soon take and wast all my properti and so harass me and my children without end thi is hard thi make it imposs for a man to live honestli and at the same time comfort in outward respect it will not be worth the while to accumul properti that would be sure to go again you must hire or squat somewher and rais but a small crop and eat that soon you must live within yourself and depend upon yourself alwai tuck up and readi for a start and not have mani affair a man mai grow rich in turkei even if he will be in all respect a good subject of the turkish govern confuciu said if a state is govern by the principl of reason poverti and miseri ar subject of shame if a state is not govern by the principl of reason rich and honor ar the subject of shame no until i want the protect of massachusett to be extend to me in some distant southern port where my liberti is endang or until i am bent sole on build up an estat at home by peac enterpris i can afford to refus allegi to massachusett and her right to my properti and life it cost me less in everi sens to incur the penalti of disobedi to the state than it would to obei i should feel as if i were worth less in that case some year ago the state met me in behalf of the church and command me to pai a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose preach my father attend but never i myself pai it said or be lock up in the jail i declin to pai but unfortun anoth man saw fit to pai it i did not see why the schoolmast should be tax to support the priest and not the priest the schoolmast for i wa not the state schoolmast but i support myself by voluntari subscript i did not see why the lyceum should not present it taxbil and have the state to back it demand as well as the church howev at the request of the selectmen i condescend to make some such statement as thi in writingknow all men by these present that i henri thoreau do not wish to be regard as a member of ani incorpor societi which i have not join thi i gave to the town clerk and he ha it the state have thu learn that i did not wish to be regard as a member of that church ha never made a like demand on me sinc though it said that it must adher to it origin presumpt that time if i had known how to name them i should then have sign off in detail from all the societi which i never sign on to but i did not know where to find a complet list i have paid no polltax for six year i wa put into a jail onc on thi account for on night and as i stood consid the wall of solid stone two or three feet thick the door of wood and iron a foot thick and the iron grate which strain the light i could not help be struck with the foolish of that institut which treat me as if i were mere flesh and blood and bone to be lock up i wonder that it should have conclud at length that thi wa the best us it could put me to and had never thought to avail itself of my servic in some wai i saw that if there wa a wall of stone between me and my townsmen there wa a still more difficult on to climb or break through befor thei could get to be as free as i wa i did not for a moment feel confin and the wall seem a great wast of stone and mortar i felt as if i alon of all my townsmen had paid my tax thei plainli did not know how to treat me but behav like person who ar underbr in everi threat and in everi compliment there wa a blunder for thei thought that my chief desir wa to stand the other side of that stone wall i could not but smile to see how industri thei lock the door on my medit which follow them out again without let or hindranc and thei were realli all that wa danger as thei could not reach me thei had resolv to punish my bodi just as boi if thei cannot come at some person against whom thei have a spite will abus hi dog i saw that the state wa halfwit that it wa timid as a lone woman with her silver spoon and that it did not know it friend from it foe and i lost all my remain respect for it and piti it thu the state never intention confront a man sens intellectu or moral but onli hi bodi hi sens it is not arm with superior wit or honesti but with superior physic strength i wa not born to be forc i will breath after my own fashion let us see who is the strongest what forc ha a multitud thei onli can forc me who obei a higher law than i thei forc me to becom like themselv i do not hear of men be forc to have thi wai or that by mass of men what sort of life were that to live when i meet a govern which sai to me your monei or your life why should i be in hast to give it my monei it mai be in a great strait and not know what to do i cannot help that it must help itself do as i do it is not worth the while to snivel about it i am not respons for the success work of the machineri of societi i am not the son of the engin i perceiv that when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side the on doe not remain inert to make wai for the other but both obei their own law and spring and grow and flourish as best thei can till on perchanc overshadow and destroi the other if a plant cannot live accord to it natur it di and so a man the night in prison wa novel and interest enough the prison in their shirtsleev were enjoi a chat and the even air in the doorwai when i enter but the jailer said come boi it is time to lock up and so thei dispers and i heard the sound of their step return into the hollow apart my roommat wa introduc to me by the jailer as a firstrat fellow and a clever man when the door wa lock he show me where to hang my hat and how he manag matter there the room were whitewash onc a month and thi on at least wa the whitest most simpli furnish and probabl the neatest apart in the town he natur want to know where i came from and what brought me there and when i had told him i ask him in my turn how he came there presum him to be an honest man of cours and as the world goe i believ he wa why said he thei accus me of burn a barn but i never did it as near as i could discov he had probabl gone to bed in a barn when drunk and smoke hi pipe there and so a barn wa burnt he had the reput of be a clever man had been there some three month wait for hi trial to come on and would have to wait as much longer but he wa quit domest and content sinc he got hi board for noth and thought that he wa well treat he occupi on window and i the other and i saw that if on stai there long hi princip busi would be to look out the window i had soon read all the tract that were left there and examin where former prison had broken out and where a grate had been saw off and heard the histori of the variou occup of that room for i found that even here there wa a histori and a gossip which never circul beyond the wall of the jail probabl thi is the onli hous in the town where vers ar compos which ar afterward print in a circular form but not publish i wa shown quit a long list of vers which were compos by some young men who had been detect in an attempt to escap who aveng themselv by sing them i pump my fellowprison as dry as i could for fear i should never see him again but at length he show me which wa my bed and left me to blow out the lamp it wa like travel into a far countri such as i had never expect to behold to lie there for on night it seem to me that i never had heard the townclock strike befor nor the even sound of the villag for we slept with the window open which were insid the grate it wa to see my nativ villag in the light of the middl ag and our concord wa turn into a rhine stream and vision of knight and castl pass befor me thei were the voic of old burgher that i heard in the street i wa an involuntari spectat and auditor of whatev wa done and said in the kitchen of the adjac villageinna wholli new and rare experi to me it wa a closer view of my nativ town i wa fairli insid of it i never had seen it institut befor thi is on of it peculiar institut for it is a shire town i began to comprehend what it inhabit were about in the morn our breakfast were put through the hole in the door in small oblongsquar tin pan made to fit and hold a pint of chocol with brown bread and an iron spoon when thei call for the vessel again i wa green enough to return what bread i had left but my comrad seiz it and said that i should lai that up for lunch or dinner soon after he wa let out to work at hai in a neighbor field whither he went everi dai and would not be back till noon so he bade me gooddai sai that he doubt if he should see me again when i came out of prisonfor some on interf and paid that taxi did not perceiv that great chang had taken place on the common such as he observ who went in a youth and emerg a totter and grayhead man and yet a chang had to my ey come over the sceneth town and state and countrygreat than ani that mere time could effect i saw yet more distinctli the state in which i live i saw to what extent the peopl among whom i live could be trust as good neighbor and friend that their friendship wa for summer weather onli that thei did not greatli propos to do right that thei were a distinct race from me by their prejudic and superstit as the chinamen and malai ar that in their sacrific to human thei ran no risk not even to their properti that after all thei were not so nobl but thei treat the thief as he had treat them and hope by a certain outward observ and a few prayer and by walk in a particular straight though useless path from time to time to save their soul thi mai be to judg my neighbor harshli for i believ that mani of them ar not awar that thei have such an institut as the jail in their villag it wa formerli the custom in our villag when a poor debtor came out of jail for hi acquaint to salut him look through their finger which were cross to repres the grate of a jail window how do ye do my neighbor did not thu salut me but first look at me and then at on anoth as if i had return from a long journei i wa put into jail as i wa go to the shoemak to get a shoe which wa mend when i wa let out the next morn i proceed to finish my errand and have put on my mend shoe join a huckleberri parti who were impati to put themselv under my conduct and in half an hourfor the hors wa soon tackledwa in the midst of a huckleberri field on on of our highest hill two mile off and then the state wa nowher to be seen thi is the whole histori of my prison i have never declin pai the highwai tax becaus i am as desir of be a good neighbor as i am of be a bad subject and as for support school i am do my part to educ my fellowcountrymen now it is for no particular item in the taxbil that i refus to pai it i simpli wish to refus allegi to the state to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectu i do not care to trace the cours of my dollar if i could till it bui a man or a musket to shoot on withth dollar is innocentbut i am concern to trace the effect of my allegi in fact i quietli declar war with the state after my fashion though i will still make what us and get what advantag of her i can as is usual in such case if other pai the tax which is demand of me from a sympathi with the state thei do but what thei have alreadi done in their own case or rather thei abet injustic to a greater extent than the state requir if thei pai the tax from a mistaken interest in the individu tax to save hi properti or prevent hi go to jail it is becaus thei have not consid wise how far thei let their privat feel interfer with the public good thi then is my posit at present but on cannot be too much on hi guard in such a case lest hi action be bias by obstinaci or an undu regard for the opinion of men let him see that he doe onli what belong to himself and to the hour i think sometim why thi peopl mean well thei ar onli ignor thei would do better if thei knew how why give your neighbor thi pain to treat you as thei ar not inclin to but i think again thi is no reason why i should do as thei do or permit other to suffer much greater pain of a differ kind again i sometim sai to myself when mani million of men without heat without illwil without person feel of ani kind demand of you a few shill onli without the possibl such is their constitut of retract or alter their present demand and without the possibl on your side of appeal to ani other million why expos yourself to thi overwhelm brute forc you do not resist cold and hunger the wind and the wave thu obstin you quietli submit to a thousand similar necess you do not put your head into the fire but just in proport as i regard thi as not wholli a brute forc but partli a human forc and consid that i have relat to those million as to so mani million of men and not of mere brute or inanim thing i see that appeal is possibl first and instantan from them to the maker of them and secondli from them to themselv but if i put my head deliber into the fire there is no appeal to fire or to the maker of fire and i have onli myself to blame if i could convinc myself that i have ani right to be satisfi with men as thei ar and to treat them accordingli and not accord in some respect to my requisit and expect of what thei and i ought to be then like a good mussulman and fatalist i should endeavor to be satisfi with thing as thei ar and sai it is the will of god and abov all there is thi differ between resist thi and a pure brute or natur forc that i can resist thi with some effect but i cannot expect like orpheu to chang the natur of the rock and tree and beast i do not wish to quarrel with ani man or nation i do not wish to split hair to make fine distinct or set myself up as better than my neighbor i seek rather i mai sai even an excus for conform to the law of the land i am but too readi to conform to them inde i have reason to suspect myself on thi head and each year as the taxgather come round i find myself dispos to review the act and posit of the gener and state govern and the spirit of the peopl to discov a pretext for conform we must affect our countri as our parent and if at ani time we alien our love or industri from do it honor we must respect effect and teach the soul matter of conscienc and religion and not desir of rule or benefit i believ that the state will soon be abl to take all my work of thi sort out of my hand and then i shall be no better a patriot than my fellowcountrymen seen from a lower point of view the constitut with all it fault is veri good the law and the court ar veri respect even thi state and thi american govern ar in mani respect veri admir and rare thing to be thank for such as a great mani have describ them but seen from a point of view a littl higher thei ar what i have describ them seen from a higher still and the highest who shall sai what thei ar or that thei ar worth look at or think of at all howev the govern doe not concern me much and i shall bestow the fewest possibl thought on it it is not mani moment that i live under a govern even in thi world if a man is thoughtfre fancyfre imaginationfre that which is not never for a long time appear to be to him unwis ruler or reform cannot fatal interrupt him i know that most men think differ from myself but those whose live ar by profess devot to the studi of these or kindr subject content me as littl as ani statesmen and legisl stand so complet within the institut never distinctli and nakedli behold it thei speak of move societi but have no restingplac without it thei mai be men of a certain experi and discrimin and have no doubt invent ingeni and even us system for which we sincer thank them but all their wit and us lie within certain not veri wide limit thei ar wont to forget that the world is not govern by polici and expedi webster never goe behind govern and so cannot speak with author about it hi word ar wisdom to those legisl who contempl no essenti reform in the exist govern but for thinker and those who legisl for all time he never onc glanc at the subject i know of those whose seren and wise specul on thi theme would soon reveal the limit of hi mind rang and hospit yet compar with the cheap profess of most reform and the still cheaper wisdom and eloqu of politician in gener hi ar almost the onli sensibl and valuabl word and we thank heaven for him compar he is alwai strong origin and abov all practic still hi qualiti is not wisdom but prudenc the lawyer truth is not truth but consist or a consist expedi truth is alwai in harmoni with herself and is not concern chiefli to reveal the justic that mai consist with wrongdo he well deserv to be call as he ha been call the defend of the constitut there ar realli no blow to be given by him but defens on he is not a leader but a follow hi leader ar the men of i have never made an effort he sai and never propos to make an effort i have never countenanc an effort and never mean to counten an effort to disturb the arrang as origin made by which the variou state came into the union still think of the sanction

have noth whatev to do with it thei have never receiv ani encourag from me and thei never will thei who know of no purer sourc of truth who have trace up it stream no higher stand and wise stand by the bibl and the constitut and drink at it there with rever and humil but thei who behold where it come trickl into thi lake or that pool gird up their loin onc more and continu their pilgrimag toward it fountainhead no man with a geniu for legisl ha appear in america thei ar rare in the histori of the world there ar orat politician and eloqu men by the thousand but the speaker ha not yet open hi mouth to speak who is capabl of settl the muchvex question of the dai we love eloqu for it own sake and not for ani truth which it mai utter or ani heroism it mai inspir our legisl have not yet learn the compar valu of freetrad and of freedom of union and of rectitud to a nation thei have no geniu or talent for compar humbl question of taxat and financ commerc and manufactur and agricultur if we were left sole to the wordi wit of legisl in congress for our guidanc uncorrect by the season experi and the effectu complaint of the peopl america would not long retain her rank among the nation for eighteen hundr year though perchanc i have no right to sai it the new testament ha been written yet where is the legisl who ha wisdom and practic talent enough to avail himself of the light which it shed on the scienc of legisl the author of govern even such as i am will to submit tofor i will cheerfulli obei those who know and can do better than i and in mani thing even those who neither know nor can do so welli still an impur on to be strictli just it must have the sanction and consent of the govern it can have no pure right over my person and properti but what i conced to it the progress from an absolut to a limit monarchi from a limit monarchi to a democraci is a progress toward a true respect for the individu even the chines philosoph wa wise enough to regard the individu as the basi of the empir is a democraci such as we know it the last improv possibl in govern is it not possibl to take a step further toward recogn and organ the right of man there will never be a realli free and enlighten state until the state come to recogn the individu as a higher and independ power from which all it own power and author ar deriv and treat him accordingli i pleas myself with imagin a state at least which can afford to be just to all men and to treat the individu with respect as a neighbor which even would not think it inconsist with it own repos if a few were to live aloof from it not meddl with it nor embrac by it who fulfil all the duti of neighbor and fellowmen a state which bore thi kind of fruit and suffer it to drop off as fast as it ripen would prepar the wai for a
