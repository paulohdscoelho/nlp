it up there under an oak that wa by the sanctuari of the lord and joshua said unto all the peopl behold thi stone shall be a wit unto us for it hath heard all the word of the lord which he spake unto us it shall be therefor a wit unto you lest ye deni your god so joshua let the peopl depart everi man unto hi inherit and it came to pass after these thing that joshua the son of nun the servant of

eleazar the son of aaron di and thei buri him in a hill that pertain to phineha hi son which wa given him in mount ephraim the book of judg now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children of israel ask the lord sai who shall go up for us against the canaanit first to fight against them and the lord said judah shall go up behold i have deliv the land into hi hand and judah said unto simeon hi brother come up with me into my lot that we mai fight against the canaanit and i likewis will go with thee into thy lot so simeon went with him and judah went up and the lord deliv the canaanit and the perizzit into their hand and thei slew of them in bezek ten thousand men and thei found adonibezek in bezek and thei fought against him and thei slew the canaanit and the perizzit but adonibezek fled and thei pursu after him and caught him and cut off hi thumb and hi great toe and adonibezek said threescor and ten king have their thumb and their great toe cut off gather their meat under my tabl as i have done so god hath requit me and thei brought him to jerusalem and there he di now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edg

went up out of the citi of palm tree with the children of judah into the wilder of judah which lieth in the south of arad and thei went and dwelt among the peopl and judah went with simeon hi brother and thei slew the canaanit that inhabit zephath and utterli destroi it and the name of the citi wa call hormah also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the coast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof and the lord wa with judah and he drave out the inhabit of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabit of the vallei becaus thei had chariot of iron and thei gave hebron

thi dai neither did manasseh drive out the inhabit of bethshean and her town nor taanach and her town nor the inhabit of dor and her town nor the inhabit of ibleam and her town nor the inhabit of megiddo and her town but the canaanit would dwell in that land and it came to pass when israel wa strong that thei put the canaanit to tribut and did not utterli drive them out neither did ephraim drive out the canaanit that dwelt in gezer but the canaanit dwelt in gezer among them neither did zebulun drive out the inhabit of kitron nor the inhabit of nahalol but the canaanit dwelt among them and becam tributari neither did asher drive out the inhabit of accho nor the inhabit of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor of aphik nor of rehob but the asherit dwelt among the

vallei but the amorit would dwell in mount here in aijalon and in shaalbim yet the hand of the hous of joseph prevail so that thei becam tributari and the coast of the amorit wa from the go up to akrabbim from the rock and upward and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and said i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land which i sware unto your father and i said i will never break my coven with you and ye shall make no leagu with the inhabit of thi land ye shall throw down their altar but ye have not obei my voic why have ye done thi wherefor i also said i will not drive them out from befor you but thei shall be as thorn in your side and their god shall be a snare unto you and it came to pass when the angel of the lord spake these word unto all

israel went everi man unto hi inherit to possess the land and the peopl serv the lord all the dai of joshua and all the dai of the elder that outliv joshua who had seen all the great work of the lord that he did for israel and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord di be an hundr and ten year old and thei buri him in the border of hi inherit in timnathher in the mount of ephraim on the

ar in the land of gilead and jair di and wa buri in camon and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and serv baalim and ashtaroth and the god of syria and the god of zidon and the god of moab and the god of the children of ammon and the god of the philistin and forsook the lord and serv not him and the anger of the lord wa hot against israel and he sold them into the hand of the philistin and into the hand of the children of ammon and that year thei vex and oppress the children of israel eighteen year all the children of israel that were on the other side jordan in the land of the amorit which is in gilead moreov the children of ammon pass over jordan to fight also against judah and against benjamin and against the hous of ephraim so that israel wa sore distress and the children of israel cri unto the lord sai we have sin against thee both becaus we have forsaken our god and also serv baalim and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliv you from the egyptian and from the amorit from the children of ammon and from the philistin the zidonian also and the amalekit and the maonit did oppress you and ye cri to me and i deliv you out of their hand yet ye have forsaken me and serv other god wherefor i will deliv you no more go and cry unto the god which ye have chosen let them deliv you in the time of your tribul and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sin do thou unto us whatsoev seemeth good unto thee deliv us onli we prai thee thi dai and thei put awai the strang god from among them and serv the lord and hi soul wa griev for the miseri of israel then the children of ammon were gather togeth and encamp in gilead and the children of israel assembl themselv togeth and encamp in mizpeh and the peopl and princ of gilead said on to anoth what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon he shall be head over all the inhabit of gilead now jephthah the gileadit wa a mighti man of valour and he wa the son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah and gilead wife bare him son and hi wife son grew up and thei thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in our father hous for thou art the son of a strang woman then jephthah fled from hi brethren and dwelt in the land of tob and there were gather vain men to jephthah and went out with him and it came to pass in process of time that the children of ammon made war against israel and it wa so that when the children of ammon made war against israel the elder of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob and thei said unto jephthah come and be our captain that we mai fight with the children of ammon and jephthah said unto the elder of gilead did not ye hate me and expel me out of my father hous and why ar ye come unto me now when ye ar in distress and the elder of gilead said unto jephthah therefor we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over all the inhabit of gilead and jephthah said unto the elder of gilead if ye bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliv them befor me shall i be your head and the elder of gilead said unto jephthah the lord be wit between us if we do not so accord to thy word then jephthah went with the elder of gilead and the peopl made him head and captain over them and jephthah utter all hi word befor the lord in mizpeh and jephthah sent messeng unto the king of the children of ammon sai what hast thou to do with me that thou art come against me to fight in my land and the king of the children of ammon answer unto the messeng of jephthah becaus israel took awai my land when thei came up out of egypt from arnon even unto jabbok and unto jordan now therefor restor those land again peaceabl and jephthah sent messeng again unto the king of the children of ammon and said unto him thu saith jephthah israel took not awai the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon but when israel came up from egypt and walk through the wilder unto the red sea and came to kadesh then israel sent messeng unto the king of edom sai let me i prai thee pass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto and in like manner thei sent unto the king of moab but he would not consent and israel abod in kadesh then thei went along through the wilder and compass the land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab and pitch on the other side of arnon but came not within the border of moab for arnon wa the border of moab and israel sent messeng unto sihon king of the amorit the king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we prai thee through thy land into my place but sihon trust not israel to pass through hi coast but sihon gather all hi peopl togeth and pitch in jahaz and fought against israel and the lord god of israel deliv sihon and all hi peopl into the hand of israel and thei smote them so israel possess all the land of the amorit the inhabit of that countri and thei possess all the coast of the amorit from arnon even unto jabbok and from the wilder even unto jordan so now the lord god of israel hath dispossess the amorit from befor hi peopl israel and shouldest thou possess it wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess so whomsoev the lord our god shall drive out from befor us them will we possess and now art thou ani thing better than balak the son of zippor king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight against them while israel dwelt in heshbon and her town and in aroer and her town and in all the citi that be along by the coast of arnon three hundr year why therefor did ye not recov them within that time wherefor i have not sin against thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judg be judg thi dai between the children of israel and the children of ammon howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearken not unto the word of jephthah which he sent him then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he pass over gilead and manasseh and pass over mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he pass over unto the children of ammon and jephthah vow a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt without fail deliv the children of ammon into mine hand then it shall be that whatsoev cometh forth of the door of my hous to meet me when i return in peac from the children of ammon shall sure be the lord and i will offer it up for a burnt offer so jephthah pass over unto the children of ammon to fight against them and the lord deliv them into hi hand and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith even twenti citi and unto the plain of the vineyard with a veri great slaughter thu the children of ammon were subdu befor the children of israel and jephthah came to mizpeh unto hi hous and behold hi daughter came out to meet him with timbrel and with danc and she wa hi onli child besid her he had neither son nor daughter and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent hi cloth and said ala my daughter thou hast brought me veri low and thou art on of them that troubl me for i have open my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back and she said unto him my father if thou hast open thy mouth unto the lord do to me accord to that which hath proceed out of thy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeanc for thee of thine enemi even of the children of ammon and she said unto her father let thi thing be done for me let me alon two month that i mai go up and down upon the mountain and bewail my virgin i and my fellow and he said go and he sent her awai for two month and she went with her companion and bewail her virgin upon the mountain and it came to pass at the end of two month that she return unto her father who did with her accord to hi vow which he had vow and she knew no man and it wa a custom in israel that the daughter of israel went yearli to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadit four dai in a year and the men of ephraim gather themselv togeth and went northward and said unto jephthah wherefor passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with thee we will burn thine hous upon thee with fire and jephthah said unto them i and my peopl were at great strife with the children of ammon and when i call you ye deliv me not out of their hand and when i saw that ye deliv me not i put my life in my hand and pass over against the children of ammon and the lord deliv them into my hand wherefor then ar ye come up unto me thi dai to fight against me then jephthah gather togeth all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead smote ephraim becaus thei said ye gileadit ar fugit of ephraim among the ephraimit and among the manassit and the gileadit took the passag of jordan befor the ephraimit and it wa so that when those ephraimit which were escap said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimit if he said nai then said thei unto him sai now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounc it right then thei took him and slew him at the passag of jordan and there fell at that time of the ephraimit forti and two thousand and jephthah judg israel six year then di jephthah the gileadit and wa buri in on of the citi of gilead and after him ibzan of bethlehem judg israel and he had thirti son and thirti daughter whom he sent abroad and took in thirti daughter from abroad for hi son and he judg israel seven year then di ibzan and wa buri at bethlehem and after him elon a zebulonit judg israel and he judg israel ten year and elon the zebulonit di and wa buri in aijalon in the countri of zebulun and after him abdon the son of hillel a pirathonit judg israel and he had forti son and thirti nephew that rode on threescor and ten ass colt and he judg israel eight year and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonit di and wa buri in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the mount of the amalekit and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord deliv them into the hand of the philistin forti year and there wa a certain man of zorah of the famili of the danit whose name wa manoah and hi wife wa barren and bare not and the angel of the lord appear unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art

thei had a file for the mattock and for the coulter and for the fork and for the ax and to sharpen the goad so it came to pass in the dai of battl that there wa neither sword nor spear found in the hand of ani of the peopl that were with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan hi son wa there found and the garrison of the philistin went out to the passag of michmash now it came to pass upon a dai that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare hi armour come and let us go over to the philistin garrison that is on the other side but he told not hi father and saul tarri in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegran tree which is in migron and the peopl that were with him were about six hundr men and ahiah the son of ahitub ichabod brother the son of phineha

sharp rock on the on side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the on wa bozez and the name of the other seneh the forefront of the on wa situat northward over against michmash and the other southward over against gibeah and jonathan said to the young man that bare hi armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcis it mai be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by mani or by few and hi armourbear said unto him do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold i am with thee accord to thy heart then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discov ourselv unto them if thei sai thu unto us tarri until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them but if thei sai thu come up unto us then we will go up for the lord hath deliv them into our hand and thi shall be a sign unto us and both of them discov themselv unto the garrison of the philistin and the philistin said behold the hebrew come forth out of the hole where thei had hid themselv and the men of the garrison answer jonathan and hi armourbear and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing and jonathan said unto hi armourbear come up after me for the lord hath deliv them into the hand of israel and jonathan climb up upon hi hand and upon hi feet and hi armourbear after him and thei fell befor jonathan and hi armourbear slew after him and that first slaughter which jonathan and hi armourbear made wa about twenti men within as it were an half acr of land which a yoke of oxen

father charg the peopl with the oath wherefor he put forth the end of the rod that wa in hi hand and dip it in an honeycomb and put hi hand to hi mouth and hi ey were enlighten then answer on of the peopl and said thy father straitli charg the peopl with an oath sai curs be the man that eateth ani food thi dai and the peopl were faint then said jonathan my father hath troubl the land see i prai

made a coven with the hous of david sai let the lord even requir it at the hand of david enemi and jonathan caus david to swear again becaus he love him for he love him as he love hi own soul then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou shalt be miss becaus thy seat will be empti and when thou hast stai three dai then thou shalt go down quickli and come to the place where thou

will perform the request of hi handmaid for the king will hear to deliv hi handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroi me and my son togeth out of the inherit of god then thine handmaid

joab said to dai thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath fulfil the request of hi servant so joab aros and went to geshur and brought absalom to

top of the hous and absalom went in unto hi father concubin in the sight of all israel and the counsel of ahithophel which he counsel in those dai wa as if a man had enquir at the oracl of god so wa all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom moreov ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choos out twelv thousand men and i will aris and pursu after david thi night and i will come upon him while he is weari and weak hand and will make him afraid and all the peopl that ar with him shall flee and i will smite the king onli and i will bring back all the peopl unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all return so all the peopl shall be in peac and the sai pleas absalom well and all the elder of israel then said absalom call now hushai the archit also and let us hear likewis what he saith and when hushai wa come to absalom absalom spake unto him sai ahithophel hath spoken after thi manner shall we do after hi sai if not speak thou and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at thi time for said hushai thou knowest thy father and hi men that thei be mighti men and thei be chafe in their mind as a bear rob of her whelp in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodg with the peopl behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoev heareth it will sai there is a slaughter among the peopl that follow absalom and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterli melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighti man and thei which be with him ar valiant men therefor i counsel that all israel be gener gather unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitud and that thou go to battl in thine own person so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that ar with him there shall not be left so much as on moreov if he be gotten into a citi then shall all israel bring rope to that citi and we will draw it into the river until there be not on small stone found there and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archit is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the lord had appoint to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priest thu and thu did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elder of israel and thu and thu have i counsel now therefor send quickli and tell david sai lodg not thi night in the plain of the wilder but speedili pass over lest the king be swallow up and all the peopl that ar with him now jonathan and ahimaaz stai by enrogel for thei might not be seen to come into the citi and a wench went and told them and thei went and told king david nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but thei went both of them awai quickli and came to a man hous in bahurim which had a well in hi court whither thei went down and the woman took and spread a cover over the well mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing wa not known and when absalom servant came to the woman to the hous thei said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them thei be gone over the brook of water and when thei had sought and could not find them thei return to jerusalem and it came to pass after thei were depart that thei came up out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david aris and pass quickli over the water for thu hath ahithophel counsel against you then david aros and all the peopl that were with him and thei pass over jordan by the morn light there lack not on of them that wa not gone over jordan and when ahithophel saw that hi counsel wa not follow he saddl hi ass and aros and gat him home to hi hous to hi citi and put hi household in order and hang himself and di and wa buri in the sepulchr of hi father then david came to mahanaim and absalom pass over jordan he and all the men of israel with him and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab which amasa wa a man son whose name wa ithra an israelit that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab mother so israel and absalom pitch in the land of gilead and it came to pass when david wa come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadit of rogelim brought bed and bason and earthen vessel and wheat and barlei and flour and parch corn and bean and lentil and parch puls and honei and butter and sheep and chees of kine for david and for the peopl that were with him to eat for thei said the peopl is hungri and weari and thirsti in the wilder and david number the peopl that were with him and set captain of thousand and captain of hundr over them and david sent forth a third part of the peopl under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joab brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittit and the king said unto the peopl i will sure go forth with you myself also but the peopl answer thou shalt not go forth for if we flee awai thei will not care for us neither if half of us die will thei care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefor now it is better that thou succour us out of the citi and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and the king stood by the gate side and all the peopl came out by hundr and by thousand and the king command joab and abishai and ittai sai deal gentli for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the peopl heard when the king gave all the captain charg concern absalom so the peopl went out into the field against israel and the battl wa in the wood of ephraim where the peopl of israel were slain befor the servant of david and there wa there a great slaughter that dai of twenti thousand men for the battl wa there scatter over the face of all the countri and the wood devour more peopl that dai than the sword devour and absalom met the servant of david and absalom rode upon a mule and the mule went under the thick bough of a great oak and hi head caught hold of the oak and he wa taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that wa under him went awai and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hang in an oak and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have given thee ten shekel of silver and a girdl and the man said unto joab though i should receiv a thousand shekel of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand against the king son for in our hear the king charg thee and abishai and ittai sai bewar that none touch the young man absalom otherwis i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me then said joab i mai not tarri thu with thee and he took three dart in hi hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he wa yet aliv in the midst of the oak and ten young men that bare joab armour compass about and smote absalom and slew him and joab blew the trumpet and the peopl return from pursu after israel for joab held back the peopl and thei took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a veri great heap of stone upon him and all israel fled everi on to hi tent now absalom in hi lifetim had taken and rear up for himself a pillar which is in the king dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembr and he call the pillar after hi

ahab spake unto naboth sai give me thy vineyard that i mai have it for a garden of herb becaus it is near unto my hous and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in monei and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inherit of my father unto thee and ahab came into hi hous heavi and displeas becaus of the word which naboth the jezreelit had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inherit of my father and he laid him down upon hi bed and turn awai hi face and would eat no bread but jezebel hi wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread and he said unto her becaus i spake unto naboth the jezreelit and said unto him give me thy vineyard for monei or els if it pleas thee i will give thee anoth vineyard for it and he answer i will not give thee my vineyard and jezebel hi wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel aris and eat bread and let thine heart be merri i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelit so she wrote letter in ahab name and seal them with hi seal and sent the letter unto the elder and

the sight of the lord behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take awai thy poster and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will make thine hous like the hous of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the hous of baasha the son of ahijah for the provoc wherewith thou hast provok me to anger and made israel to sin and of jezebel also spake the lord sai the dog shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel him that dieth of ahab in the citi the dog shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the air eat but there wa none like unto ahab which did sell himself to work wicked in the sight of the lord whom jezebel hi wife stir up and he did veri abomin in follow idol accord to all thing as did the amorit whom the

deliv it into the hand of the king and the king said unto him how mani time shall i adjur thee that thou tell me noth but that which is true in the name of the lord and he said i saw all israel scatter upon the hill as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return everi man to hi hous in peac and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would prophesi no good concern me but evil and he said hear thou therefor the word of the lord i saw the lord sit on hi throne and all the host of heaven stand by him on hi right hand and

jeroboam the son of nebat and solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel forti year and solomon slept with hi father and he wa buri in the citi of david hi father and rehoboam hi son reign in hi stead and rehoboam went to shechem for to shechem were all israel come to make him king and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who wa in egypt whither he fled from the presenc of solomon the

word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god sai speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin sai thu saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight

and jerusalem for jeroboam and hi son had cast them off from execut the priest offic unto the lord and he ordain him priest for the high place and for the devil and for the calv which he had made and after them out of all the tribe of israel such as set their heart to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrific unto the lord god of their father so thei strengthen the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three year for three year thei walk in the wai of david and solomon and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jess which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which bare him abijah and attai and ziza and

benjamin unto everi fenc citi and he gave them victual in abund and he desir mani wive and it came to pass when rehoboam had establish the kingdom and had strengthen himself he forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem becaus thei had transgress against the lord with twelv hundr chariot and threescor thousand horsemen and the peopl were without number that came with him out of egypt the lubim the sukkiim and the ethiopian and he took the fenc citi which pertain to judah and came to jerusalem then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princ of judah that were gather togeth to jerusalem becaus of shishak and said unto them thu saith the lord ye have forsaken me and therefor have i also left you in the hand of shishak whereupon the princ of israel and the king humbl themselv and thei said the lord is righteou and when the lord saw that thei humbl themselv the word of the lord came to shemaiah sai thei have humbl themselv therefor i will not destroi them but i will grant them some deliver and my wrath shall not be pour out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak nevertheless thei shall be hi servant that thei mai know my servic and the servic of the kingdom of the countri so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took awai the treasur of

and when he humbl himself the wrath of the lord turn from him that he would not destroi him altogeth and also in judah thing went well so king rehoboam strengthen himself in jerusalem and reign for rehoboam wa on and forti year old when he began to reign and he reign seventeen year in jerusalem the citi which the lord had chosen out of all the tribe of israel to put hi name there and hi mother name wa naamah an ammonitess and he did evil becaus he prepar not hi heart to seek the lord now the act of rehoboam first and last ar thei not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concern genealog and there were war between rehoboam and jeroboam continu and rehoboam slept with hi father and wa buri in the citi of david and abijah hi son reign in hi stead now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah he reign three year in jerusalem hi mother name also wa michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there wa war between abijah and jeroboam and abijah set the battl in arrai with an armi of valiant men of war even four hundr thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the battl in arrai against him with eight hundr thousand chosen men be mighti men of valour and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to hi son by a coven of salt yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david is risen up and hath rebel against hi lord and there ar gather unto him vain men the children of belial and have strengthen themselv against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam wa young and tenderheart and could not withstand them and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the son of david and ye be a great multitud and there ar with your golden calv which jeroboam made you for god have ye not cast out the priest of the lord the son of aaron and the levit and have made you priest after the manner of the nation of other land so that whosoev cometh to consecr himself with a young bullock and seven ram the same mai be a priest of them that ar no god but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him and the priest which minist unto the lord ar the son of aaron and the levit wait upon their busi and thei burn unto the lord everi morn and everi even burnt sacrific and sweet incens the shewbread also set thei in order upon the pure tabl and the candlestick of gold with the lamp thereof to burn everi even for we keep the charg of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him and behold god himself is with us for our captain and hi priest with sound trumpet to cry alarm against you o children of israel fight ye not against the lord god of your father for ye shall not prosper but jeroboam caus an ambush to come about behind them so thei were befor judah and the ambush wa behind them and when judah look back behold the battl wa befor and behind and thei cri unto the lord and the priest sound with the trumpet then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shout it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel befor abijah and judah and the children of israel fled befor judah and god deliv them into their hand and abijah and hi peopl slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundr thousand chosen men thu the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevail becaus thei reli upon the lord god of their father and abijah pursu after jeroboam and took citi from him bethel with the town thereof and jeshanah with the town thereof and ephraim with the town thereof neither did jeroboam recov strength again in the dai of abijah and the lord struck him and he di but abijah wax mighti and marri fourteen wive and begat twenti and two son and sixteen daughter and the rest of the act of abijah and hi wai and hi sai ar written in the stori of the prophet iddo so abijah slept with hi father and thei buri him in the citi of david and asa hi son reign in hi stead in hi dai the land wa quiet ten year and asa did that which wa good and right in the ey of the lord hi god for he took awai the altar of the strang god and the high place and brake down the imag and cut down the grove and command judah to seek the lord god of their father and to do the law and the command also he took awai out of all the citi of judah the high place and the imag and the kingdom wa quiet befor him and he built fenc citi in judah for the land had rest and he had no war in those year becaus the lord had given him rest therefor he said unto judah let us build these citi and make about them wall and tower gate and bar while the land is yet befor us becaus we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he hath given us rest on everi side so thei built and prosper and asa had an armi of men that bare target and spear out of judah three hundr thousand and out of benjamin that bare shield and drew bow two hundr and fourscor thousand all these were mighti men of valour and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand and three hundr chariot and came unto mareshah then asa went out against him and thei set the battl in arrai in the vallei of zephathah at mareshah and asa cri unto the lord hi god and said lord it is noth with thee to help whether with mani or with them that have no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against thi multitud o lord thou art our god let no man prevail against thee so the lord smote the ethiopian befor asa and befor judah and the ethiopian fled and asa and the peopl that were with him pursu them unto gerar and the ethiopian were overthrown that thei could not recov themselv for thei were destroi befor the lord and befor hi host and thei carri awai veri much spoil and thei smote all the citi round about gerar for the fear of the lord came upon them and thei spoil all the citi for there wa exceed much spoil in them thei smote also the tent of cattl and carri awai sheep and camel in abund and return to jerusalem and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of od and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsak him he will forsak you now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and without a teach priest and without law but when thei in their troubl did turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he wa found of them and in those time there wa no peac to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vexat were upon all the inhabit of the countri and nation wa destroi of nation and citi of citi for god did vex them with all advers be ye strong therefor and let not your hand be weak for your work shall be reward and when asa heard these word and the propheci of od the prophet he took courag and put awai the abomin idol out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the citi which he had taken from mount ephraim and renew the altar of the lord that wa befor the porch of the lord and he gather all judah and benjamin and the stranger with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for thei fell to him out of israel in abund when thei saw that the lord hi god wa with him so thei gather themselv togeth at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa and thei offer unto the lord the same time of the spoil which thei had brought seven hundr oxen and seven thousand sheep and thei enter into a coven to seek the lord god of their father with all their heart and with all their soul that whosoev would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman and thei sware unto the lord with a loud voic and with shout and with trumpet and with cornet and all judah rejoic at the oath for thei had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desir and he wa found of them and the lord gave them rest round about and also concern maachah the mother of asa the king he remov her from be queen becaus she had made an idol in a grove and asa cut down her idol and stamp it and burnt it at the brook kidron but the high place were not taken awai out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa wa perfect all hi dai and he brought into the hous of god the thing that hi father had dedic and that he himself had dedic silver and gold and vessel and there wa no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasur of the hous of the lord and of the king hous and sent to benhadad king of syria that dwelt at damascu sai there is a leagu between me and thee as there wa between my father and thy father behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy leagu with baasha king of israel that he mai depart from me and benhadad hearken unto king asa and sent the captain of hi armi against the citi of israel and thei smote ijon and dan and abelmaim and all the store citi of naphtali and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off build of ramah and let hi work ceas then asa the king took all judah and thei carri awai the stone of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha wa build and he built therewith geba and mizpah and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him becaus thou hast reli on the king of syria and not reli on the lord thy god therefor is the host of the king of syria escap out of thine hand were not the ethiopian and the lubim a huge host with veri mani chariot and horsemen yet becaus thou didst reli on the lord he deliv them into thine hand for the ey of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishli therefor from henceforth thou shalt have war then asa wa wroth with the seer and put him in a prison hous for he wa in a rage with him becaus of

son of imla and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on hi throne cloth in their robe and thei sat in a void place at the enter in of the gate of samaria and all the prophet prophesi befor them and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horn of iron and said thu saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until thei be consum and all the prophet prophesi so sai go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliv it into the hand of the king and the messeng that went to call micaiah spake to him sai behold the word of the prophet declar good to

the son of asaph came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congreg and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabit of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thu saith the lord unto you be not

out against them for the lord will be with you and jehoshaphat bow hi head with hi face to the ground and all judah and the inhabit of jerusalem fell befor the lord worship the lord and the levit of the children of the kohathit and of the children of the korhit stood up to prais the lord god of israel with a loud voic on high and thei rose earli in the morn and went forth into the wilder of tekoa and as thei went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabit of jerusalem believ in the lord your god so shall ye be establish believ hi prophet so shall ye prosper and when he had consult with the peopl he appoint singer unto the lord and that should prais the beauti of holi as thei went out befor the armi and to sai prais the lord for hi merci endureth for ever and when thei began to sing and to prais the lord set ambush against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and thei were smitten for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabit of mount seir utterli to slai and destroi them and when thei had made an end of the inhabit of seir everi on help to destroi anoth and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilder thei look unto the multitud and behold thei were dead bodi fallen to the earth and none escap and when jehoshaphat and hi peopl came to take awai the spoil of them thei found among them in abund both rich with the dead bodi and preciou jewel which thei strip off for themselv more than thei could carri awai and thei were three dai in gather of the spoil it wa so much and on the fourth dai thei assembl themselv in the vallei of berachah for there thei bless the lord therefor the name of the same place wa call the vallei of berachah unto thi dai then thei return everi man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joi for the lord had made them to rejoic over their enemi and thei came to jerusalem with psalteri and harp and trumpet unto the hous of the lord and the fear of god wa on all the kingdom of those countri when thei had heard that the lord fought against the enemi of israel so the realm of jehoshaphat wa quiet for hi god gave him rest round about and jehoshaphat reign over judah he wa thirti and five year old when he began to reign and he reign twenti and five year in jerusalem and hi mother name wa azubah the daughter of shilhi and he walk in the wai of asa hi father and depart not from it do that which wa right in the sight of the lord howbeit the high place were not taken awai for as yet the peopl had not prepar their heart unto the god of their father now the rest of the act of jehoshaphat first and last behold thei ar written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is mention in the book of the king of israel and after thi did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel who did veri wickedli and he join himself with him to make ship to go to tarshish and thei made the ship in eziongab then eliez the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesi against jehoshaphat sai becaus thou hast join thyself with ahaziah the lord hath broken thy work and the ship were broken that thei were not abl to go to tarshish now jehoshaphat slept with hi father and wa buri with hi father in the citi of david and jehoram hi son reign in hi stead and he had brethren the son of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these were the son of jehoshaphat king of israel and their father gave them great gift of silver and of gold and of preciou thing with fenc citi in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram becaus he wa the firstborn now when jehoram wa risen up to the kingdom of hi father he strengthen himself and slew all hi brethren with the sword and diver also of the princ of israel jehoram wa thirti and two year old when he began to reign and he reign eight year in jerusalem and he walk in the wai of the king of israel like as did the hous of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought that which wa evil in the ey of the lord howbeit the lord would not destroi the hous of david becaus of the coven that he had made with david and as he promis to give a light to him and to hi son for ever in hi dai the edomit revolt from under the dominion of judah and made themselv a king then jehoram went forth with hi princ and all hi chariot with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomit which compass him in and the captain of the chariot so the edomit revolt from under the hand of judah unto thi dai the same time also did libnah revolt from under hi hand becaus he had forsaken the lord god of hi father moreov he made high place in the mountain of judah and caus the inhabit of jerusalem to commit fornic and compel judah thereto and there came a write to him from elijah the prophet sai thu saith the lord god of david thy father becaus thou hast not walk in the wai of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the wai of asa king of judah but hast walk in the wai of the king of israel and hast made judah and the inhabit of jerusalem to go a whore like to the whoredom of the hous of ahab and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father hous which were better than thyself behold with a great plagu will the lord smite thy peopl and thy children and thy wive and all thy good and thou shalt have great sick by diseas of thy bowel until thy bowel fall out by reason of the sick dai by dai moreov the lord stir up against jehoram the spirit of the philistin and of the arabian that were near the ethiopian and thei came up into judah and brake into it and carri awai all the substanc that wa found in the king hous and hi son also and hi wive so that there wa never a son left him save jehoahaz the youngest of hi son and after all thi the lord smote him in hi bowel with an incur diseas and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of two year hi bowel fell out by reason of hi

be desir howbeit thei buri him in the citi of david but not in the sepulchr of the king and the inhabit of jerusalem made ahaziah hi youngest son king in hi stead for the band of men that came with the arabian to the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reign forti and two year old wa ahaziah when he began to reign and he reign on year in jerusalem hi mother name also wa athaliah the daughter of omri he also walk in the wai of the hous of ahab for hi mother wa hi counsellor to do wickedli wherefor he did evil in the sight of the lord like the hous of ahab for thei were hi counsellor after the death of hi father to hi destruct he walk also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrian smote joram and he return to be heal in jezreel becaus of the wound which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel becaus he wa sick and the destruct of ahaziah wa of god by come to joram for when he wa come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord had anoint to cut off the hous of ahab and it came to pass that when jehu wa execut judgment upon the hous of ahab and found the princ of judah and the son of the brethren of ahaziah that minist to ahaziah he slew them and he sought ahaziah and thei caught him for he wa hid in samaria and brought him to jehu and when thei had slain him thei buri him becaus said thei he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all hi heart so the hous of ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son wa dead she aros and destroi all the seed royal of the hous of judah but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king son that were slain and put him and hi nurs in a bedchamb so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she wa the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not and he wa with them hid in the hous of god six year and athaliah reign over the land and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthen himself and took the captain of hundr azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of ob and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into coven with him and thei went about in judah and gather the levit out of all the citi of judah and the chief of the father of israel and thei came to jerusalem and all the congreg made a coven with the king in the hous of god and he said unto them behold the king son shall reign as the lord

cometh into the hous he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out so the levit and all judah did accord to all thing that jehoiada the priest had command and took everi man hi men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismiss not the cours moreov jehoiada the priest deliv to the captain of hundr spear and buckler and shield that had been king david which were in the hous of god and he set all the peopl everi man have hi weapon in hi hand from the right side of the templ to the left side of the templ along by the altar and the templ by the king round about then thei brought out the king son and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimoni and made him king and jehoiada and hi son anoint him and said god save the king now when athaliah heard the nois of the peopl run and prais the king she came to the peopl into the hous of the lord and she look and behold the king stood at hi pillar at the enter in and the princ and the trumpet by the king and all the peopl of the land rejoic and sound with trumpet also the singer with instrument of musick and such as taught to sing

had distribut in the hous of the lord to offer the burnt offer of the lord as it is written in the law of mose with rejoic and with sing as it wa ordain by david and he set the porter at the gate of the hous of the lord that none which wa unclean in ani thing should enter in and he took the captain of hundr and the nobl and the governor of the peopl and all the peopl of the land and brought down the king from the hous of the lord and thei came through the high gate into the king hous and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom and all the peopl of the land rejoic and the citi wa quiet after that thei had slain athaliah with the sword joash wa seven year old when he began to reign and he reign forti year in jerusalem hi mother name also wa zibiah of beersheba and joash did that which wa right in the sight of the lord all the dai of jehoiada the priest and jehoiada took for him two wive and he begat son and daughter and it came to pass after thi that joash wa mind to repair the hous of the lord and he gather togeth the priest and the levit and said to them go out unto the citi of judah and gather of all israel monei to repair the hous of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter howbeit the levit hasten it not and the king call for jehoiada the chief and said unto him why hast thou not requir of the levit to bring in out of judah and out of

vessel for the hous of the lord even vessel to minist and to offer withal and spoon and vessel of gold and silver and thei offer burnt offer in the hous of the lord continu all the dai of jehoiada but jehoiada wax old and wa full of dai when he di an hundr and thirti year old wa he when he di and thei buri him in the citi of david among the king becaus he had done good in israel both toward god and

and idol and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for thi their trespass yet he sent prophet to them to bring them again unto the lord and thei testifi against them but thei would not give ear and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest which stood abov the peopl and said unto them thu saith god why transgress ye the command of the lord that ye cannot prosper becaus ye have forsaken the lord he hath also forsaken you and thei conspir against him and stone him with stone at the command of the king in the court of the hous of the lord thu joash the king rememb not the

make thee fall befor the enemi for god hath power to help and to cast down and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundr talent which i have given to the armi of israel and the man of god answer the lord is abl to give thee much more than thi then amaziah separ them to wit the armi that wa come to him out of ephraim to go home again wherefor their anger wa greatli kindl

of the armi which amaziah sent back that thei should not go with him to battl fell upon the citi of judah from samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and took much spoil now it came to pass after that amaziah wa come from the slaughter of the edomit that he brought the god of the children of seir and set them up to be hi god and bow down himself befor them and burn incens unto them wherefor the anger of the lord wa kindl against amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou sought after the god of the peopl which could not deliv their own peopl out of thine hand and it came to pass as he talk with him that the king said unto him art thou made of the king counsel forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbar and said i know that god hath determin to destroi thee becaus thou hast done thi and hast not hearken unto my counsel then amaziah king of judah took advic and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel sai come let us see on anoth in the face and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah sai the thistl that wa in lebanon sent to the cedar that wa in lebanon sai give thy

there among all the god of those nation that my father utterli destroi that could deliv hi peopl out of mine hand that your god should be abl to deliv you out of mine hand now therefor let not hezekiah deceiv you nor persuad you on thi manner neither yet believ him for no god of ani nation or kingdom wa abl to deliv hi peopl out of mine hand and out of the hand of my father how much less shall your god deliv you out of mine hand and hi servant spake yet more against the lord god and against hi servant hezekiah he wrote also letter to rail on the lord god of israel and to speak against him sai as the god of the nation of other land have not deliv their peopl out of mine hand so shall not the god of hezekiah deliv hi peopl out of mine hand then thei cri with a loud voic in the jew speech unto the peopl of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to troubl them that thei might take the citi and thei spake against the god of jerusalem as against the god of the peopl of the earth which were the work of the hand of man and for thi caus hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz prai and cri to heaven and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighti men of valour and the leader and captain in the camp of the king of assyria so he return with shame of face to hi own land and when he wa come into the hous of hi god thei that came forth of hi own bowel slew him there with the sword thu the lord save hezekiah and the inhabit of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all other and guid them on everi

and prai unto the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign but hezekiah render not again accord to the benefit done unto him for hi heart wa lift up therefor there wa wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem notwithstand hezekiah humbl himself for the pride of hi heart both he and the inhabit of jerusalem so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the dai of hezekiah and hezekiah had exceed much rich and honour and he made himself treasuri for silver and for gold and for preciou stone and for spice and for shield and for all manner of pleasant jewel storehous also for the increas of corn and wine and oil and stall for all manner of beast and cote for flock moreov he provid him citi and possess of flock and herd in abund for god had given him substanc veri much thi same hezekiah also stop the upper watercours of gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the citi of david and hezekiah prosper in all hi work howbeit in the busi of the ambassador of the princ of babylon who sent unto him to enquir of the wonder that wa done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that wa in hi heart now the rest of the act of hezekiah and hi good behold thei ar written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the king of judah and israel and hezekiah slept with hi father and thei buri him in the chiefest of the sepulchr of the son of david and all judah and the inhabit of jerusalem did him honour at hi death and manasseh hi son reign in hi stead manasseh wa twelv year old when he began to reign and he reign fifti and five year in jerusalem but did that which wa evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abomin of the heathen whom the lord had cast out befor the children of israel for he built again the high place which hezekiah hi father had broken down and he rear up altar for baalim and made grove and worship all the host of heaven and serv them also he built altar in the hous of the lord whereof the lord had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever and he built altar for all the host of heaven in the two court of the hous of the lord and he caus hi children to pass through the fire in the vallei of the son of hinnom also he observ time and us enchant and us witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with wizard he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provok him to anger and he set a carv imag the idol which he had made in the hous of god of which god had said to david and to solomon hi son in thi hous and in jerusalem which i have chosen befor all the tribe of israel will i put my name for ever neither will i ani more remov the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appoint for your father so that thei will take heed to do all that i have command them accord to the whole law and the statut and the ordin by the hand of mose so manasseh made judah and the inhabit of jerusalem to err and to do wors than the heathen whom the lord had destroi befor the children of israel and the lord spake to manasseh and to hi peopl but thei would not hearken wherefor the lord brought upon them the captain of the host of the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorn and bound him with fetter and carri him to babylon and when he wa in afflict he besought the lord hi god and humbl himself greatli befor the god of hi father and prai unto him and he wa intreat of him and heard hi supplic and brought him again to jerusalem into hi kingdom then manasseh knew that the lord he wa god now after thi he built a wall without the citi of david on the west side of gihon in the vallei even to the enter in at the fish gate and compass about ophel and rais it up a veri great height and put captain of war in all the fenc citi of judah and he took awai the strang god and the idol out of the hous of the lord and all the altar that he had built in the mount of the hous of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the citi and he repair the altar of the lord and sacrif thereon peac offer and thank offer and command judah to serv the lord god of israel nevertheless the peopl did sacrific still in the high place yet unto the lord their god onli now the rest of the act of manasseh and hi prayer unto hi god and the word of the seer that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel behold thei ar written in the book of the king of israel hi prayer also and how god wa intreat of him and all hi sin and hi trespass and the place wherein he built high place and set up grove and graven imag befor he wa humbl behold thei ar written among the sai of the seer so manasseh slept with hi father and thei buri him in hi own hous and amon hi son reign in hi stead amon wa two and twenti year old when he began to reign and reign two year in jerusalem but he did that which wa evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh hi father for amon sacrif unto all the carv imag which manasseh hi father had made and serv them and humbl not himself befor the lord as manasseh hi father had humbl himself but amon trespass more and more and hi servant conspir against him and slew him in hi own hous but the peopl of the land slew all them that had conspir against king amon and the peopl of the land made josiah hi son king in hi stead josiah wa eight year old when he began to reign and he reign in jerusalem on and thirti year and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord and walk in the wai of david hi father and declin neither to the right hand nor to the left for in the eighth year of hi reign while he wa yet young he began to seek after the god of david hi father and in the twelfth year he began to purg judah and jerusalem from the high place and the grove and the carv imag and the molten imag and thei brake down the altar of baalim in hi presenc and the imag that were on high abov them he cut down and the grove and the carv imag and the molten imag he brake in piec and made dust of them and strow it upon the grave of them that had sacrif unto them and he burnt the bone of the priest upon their altar and cleans judah and jerusalem and so did he in the citi of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali with their mattock round about and when he had broken down the altar and the grove and had beaten the graven imag into powder and cut down all the idol throughout all the land of israel he return to jerusalem now in the eighteenth year of hi reign when he had purg the land and the hous he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the citi and joah the son of joahaz the record to repair the hous of the lord hi god and when thei came to hilkiah the high priest thei deliv the monei that wa brought into the hous of god which the levit that kept the door had gather of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and thei return to jerusalem and thei put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the hous of the lord and thei gave it to the workmen that wrought in the hous of the lord to repair and amend the hous even to the artific and builder gave thei it to bui hewn stone and timber for coupl and to floor the hous which the king of judah had destroi and the men did the work faithfulli and the overs of them were jahath and obadiah the levit of the son of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the son of the kohathit to set it forward and other of the levit all that could skill of instrument of musick also thei were over the bearer of burden and were overs of all that wrought the work in ani manner of servic and of the levit there were scribe and offic and porter and when thei brought out the monei that wa brought into the hous of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by mose and hilkiah answer and said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the hous of the lord and hilkiah deliv the book to shaphan and shaphan carri the book to the king and brought the king word back again sai all that wa commit to thy servant thei do it and thei have gather togeth the monei that wa found in the hous of the lord and have deliv it into the hand of the overs and to the hand of the workmen then shaphan the scribe told the king sai hilkiah the priest hath given me a book and shaphan read it befor the king and it came to pass when the king had heard the word of the law that he rent hi cloth and the king command hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a servant of the king sai go enquir of the lord for me and for them that ar left in israel and in judah concern the word of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is pour out upon us becaus our father have not kept the word of the lord to do after all that is written in thi book and hilkiah and thei that the king had appoint went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of

in ten dai store of all sort of wine yet for all thi requir not i the bread of the governor becaus the bondag wa heavi upon thi peopl think upon me my god for good accord to all that i have done for thi peopl now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the arabian and the rest of our enemi heard that i had build the wall and that there wa no breach left therein though at that time i had not set up the door upon the gate that sanballat and geshem sent unto me sai come let us meet togeth in some on of the villag in the plain of ono but thei thought to do me mischief and i sent messeng unto them sai i am do a great work so that i cannot come down why should the work ceas whilst i leav it and come down to you yet thei sent unto me four time after thi sort and i answer them after the same manner then sent sanballat hi servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in hi hand wherein wa written it is report among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the jew think to rebel for which caus thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king accord to these word and thou hast also appoint prophet to preach of thee at jerusalem sai there is a king in judah and now shall it be report to the king accord to these word come now therefor and let us take counsel togeth then i sent unto him sai there ar no such thing done as thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart for thei all made us afraid sai their hand shall be weaken from the work that it be not done now therefor o god strengthen my hand afterward i came unto the hous of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel who wa shut up and he said let us meet togeth in the hous of god within the templ and let us shut the door of the templ for thei will come to slai thee yea in the night will thei come to slai thee and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there that be as i am would go into the templ to save hi life i will not go in and lo i perceiv that god had not sent him but that he pronounc thi propheci against me for tobiah and sanballat had hire him therefor wa he hire that i should be afraid and do so and sin and that thei might have

hand for hi ey ar upon the wai of man and he seeth all hi go there is no dark nor shadow of death where the worker of iniqu mai hide themselv for he will not lai upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with god he shall break in piec mighti men without number and set other in their stead therefor he knoweth their work and he overturneth them in the night so that thei ar destroi he striketh them as wick men in the open sight of other becaus thei turn back from him and would not consid ani of hi wai so that thei caus the cry of the poor to come unto him and he heareth the cry of the afflict when he giveth quiet who then can make troubl and when he hideth hi face who then can behold him whether it be done against a nation or against a man onli that the hypocrit reign not lest the peopl be ensnar sure it is meet to be said unto god i have born chastis i will not offend ani more that which i see not teach thou me if i have done iniqu i will do no more should it be accord to thy mind he will recompens it whether thou refus or whether thou choos and not i therefor speak what thou knowest let men of understand tell me and let a wise man hearken unto me job

what profit shall i have if i be cleans from my sin i will answer thee and thy companion with thee look unto the heaven and see and behold the cloud which ar higher than thou if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy transgress be multipli what doest thou unto him if thou be righteou what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine hand thy wicked mai hurt a man as thou art and thy righteous mai profit the son of man by reason of the multitud of oppress thei make the oppress to cry thei cry out by reason of the arm of the mighti but none saith where is god my maker who

instruct yet a littl sleep a littl slumber a littl fold of the hand to sleep so shall thy poverti come as on that travelleth and thy want as an arm man these ar also proverb of solomon which the men of hezekiah king of judah copi out it is the glori of god to conceal a thing but the honour of king is to search out a matter the heaven for height and the earth for depth and the heart of king is unsearch take awai the dross from the silver and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer take awai the wick from befor the king and hi throne shall be establish in righteous put not forth

whom thine ey have seen go not forth hastili to strive lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame debat thy caus with thy neighbour himself and discov not a secret to anoth lest he that heareth it put thee to shame and thine infami turn not awai a word fitli spoken is like appl of gold in pictur of silver as an ear of gold and an ornament of fine

fals gift is like cloud and wind without rain by long forbear is a princ persuad and a soft tongu breaketh the bone hast thou found honei eat so much as is suffici for thee lest thou be fill therewith and vomit it withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour hous lest he be weari of thee and so hate thee a man that beareth fals wit against hi neighbour is a maul and a sword and a sharp arrow confid in an unfaith man in time of troubl is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint as he that taketh awai a garment in cold weather and as vinegar upon nitr so is he that singeth song to an heavi heart if thine enemi be hungri give him bread to eat and if he be thirsti give him water to drink for thou shalt heap coal of fire upon hi head and the lord shall reward thee the north wind driveth awai rain so doth an angri counten a backbit tongu it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a brawl woman and in a wide hous as cold water to a thirsti soul so is good new from a far countri a righteou man fall down befor the wick is as a troubl fountain and a corrupt spring it is not good to eat much honei so for men to search their own glori is not glori he that hath no rule over hi own spirit is like a citi that is broken down and without wall as snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honour is not seemli for a fool as the bird by wander as the swallow by fly so the curs causeless shall not come a whip for the hors a bridl for the ass and a rod for the fool back answer not a fool accord to hi folli lest thou also be like unto him answer a fool accord to hi folli lest he be wise in hi own conceit he that sendeth a messag by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet and drinketh damag the leg of the lame ar not equal so is a parabl in the mouth of fool as he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth honour to a fool as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parabl in the mouth of fool the great god that form all thing both rewardeth the fool and rewardeth transgressor as a dog returneth to hi vomit so a fool returneth to hi folli seest thou a man wise in hi own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of him the sloth man saith there is a lion in the wai a lion is in the street as the door turneth upon hi hing so doth the sloth upon hi bed the sloth hideth hi hand in hi bosom it grieveth him to bring it again to hi mouth the sluggard is wiser in hi own conceit than seven men that can render a reason he that passeth by and meddleth with strife belong not to him is like on that taketh a dog by the ear as a mad man who casteth firebrand arrow and death so is the man that deceiveth hi neighbour and saith am not i in sport where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no talebear the strife ceaseth as coal ar to burn coal and wood to fire so is a contenti man to kindl strife the word of a talebear ar as wound and thei go down into the innermost part of the belli burn lip and a wick heart ar like a potsherd cover with silver dross he that hateth dissembleth with hi lip and layeth up deceit within him when he speaketh fair believ him not for there ar seven abomin in hi heart whose hatr is cover by deceit hi wicked shall be shew befor the whole congreg whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a stone it will return upon him a ly tongu hateth those that ar afflict by it and a flatter mouth worketh ruin boast not thyself of to morrow for thou knowest not what a dai mai bring forth let anoth man prais thee and not thine own mouth a stranger and not thine own lip a stone is heavi and the sand weighti but a fool wrath is heavier than them both wrath is cruel and anger is outrag but who is abl to stand befor envi open rebuk is better than secret love faith ar the wound of a friend but the kiss of an enemi ar deceit the full soul loatheth an honeycomb but to the hungri soul everi bitter thing is sweet as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that wandereth from hi place ointment and perfum rejoic the heart so doth the sweet of a man friend by hearti counsel thine own friend and thy father friend forsak not neither go into thy brother hous in the dai of thy calam for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off my son be wise and make my heart glad that i mai answer him that reproacheth me a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simpl pass on and ar punish take hi garment that is sureti for a stranger and take a pledg of him for a strang woman he that blesseth hi friend with a loud voic rise earli in the morn it shall be count a curs to him a continu drop in a veri raini dai and a contenti woman ar alik whosoev hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of hi right hand which bewrayeth itself iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the counten of hi friend whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof so he that waiteth on hi master shall be honour as in water face answereth to face so the heart of man to man hell and destruct ar never full so the ey of man ar never satisfi as the fine pot for silver and the furnac for gold so is a man to hi prais though thou shouldest brai a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestl yet will not hi foolish depart from him be thou dilig to know the state of thy flock and look well to thy herd for rich ar not for ever and doth the crown endur to everi gener the hai appeareth and the tender grass sheweth itself and herb of the mountain ar gather the lamb ar for thy cloth and the goat ar the price of the field and thou shalt have goat milk enough for thy food for the food of thy household and for the mainten for thy maiden the wick flee when no man pursueth but the righteou ar bold as a lion for the transgress of a land mani ar the princ thereof but by a man of understand and knowledg the state thereof shall be prolong a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweep rain which leaveth no food thei that forsak the law prais the wick but such as keep the law contend with them evil men understand not judgment but thei that seek the lord understand all thing better is the poor that walketh in hi upright than he that is pervers in hi wai though he be rich whoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companion of riotou men shameth hi father he that by usuri and unjust gain increaseth hi substanc he shall gather it for him that will piti the poor he that turneth awai hi ear from hear the law even hi prayer shall be abomin whoso causeth the righteou to go astrai in an evil wai he shall fall himself into hi own pit but the upright shall have good thing in possess the rich man is wise in hi own conceit but the poor that hath understand searcheth him out when righteou men do rejoic there is great glori but when the wick rise a man is hidden he that covereth hi sin shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have merci happi is the man that feareth alwai but he that hardeneth hi heart shall fall into mischief as a roar lion and a rang bear so is a wick ruler over the poor peopl the princ that wanteth understand is also a great oppressor but he that hateth covet shall prolong hi dai a man that doeth violenc to the blood of ani person shall flee to the pit let no man stai him whoso walketh uprightli shall be save but he that is pervers in hi wai shall fall at onc he that tilleth hi land shall have plenti of bread but he that followeth after vain person shall have poverti enough a faith man shall abound with bless but he that maketh hast to be rich shall not be innoc to have respect of person is not good for for a piec of bread that man will transgress he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil ey and considereth not that poverti shall come upon him he that rebuketh a man afterward shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongu whoso robbeth hi father or hi mother and saith it is no transgress the same is the companion of a destroy he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife but he that putteth hi trust in the lord shall be made fat he that trusteth in hi own heart is a fool but whoso walketh wise he shall be deliv he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth hi ey shall have mani a curs when the wick rise men hide themselv but when thei perish the righteou increas he that be often reprov hardeneth hi neck shall suddenli be destroi and that without remedi when the righteou ar in author the peopl rejoic but when the wick beareth rule the peopl mourn whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth hi father but he that keepeth compani with harlot spendeth hi substanc the king by judgment establisheth the land but he that receiveth gift overthroweth it a man that flattereth hi neighbour spreadeth a net for hi feet in the transgress of an evil man there is a snare but the righteou doth sing and rejoic the righteou considereth the caus of the poor but the wick regardeth not to know it scorn men bring a citi into a snare but wise men turn awai wrath if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage or laugh there is no rest the bloodthirsti hate the upright but the just seek hi soul a fool uttereth all hi mind but a wise man keepeth it in till afterward if a ruler hearken to li all hi servant ar wick the poor and the deceit man meet togeth the lord lighteneth both their ey the king that faithfulli judgeth the poor hi throne shall be establish for ever the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth hi mother to shame when the wick ar multipli transgress increaseth but the righteou shall see their fall correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soul where there is no vision the peopl perish but he that keepeth the law happi is he a servant will not be correct by word for though he understand he will not answer seest thou a man that is hasti in hi word there is more hope of a fool than of him he that delic bringeth up hi servant from a child shall have him becom hi son at the length an angri man stirreth up strife and a furiou man aboundeth in transgress a man pride shall bring him low but honour shall uphold the humbl in spirit whoso is partner with a thief hateth hi own soul he heareth curs and bewrayeth it not the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso putteth hi trust in the lord shall be safe mani seek the ruler favour but everi man judgment cometh from the lord an unjust man is an abomin to the just and he that is upright in the wai is abomin to the wick the word of agur the son of jakeh even the propheci

vaniti saith the preacher vaniti of vaniti all is vaniti what profit hath a man of all hi labour which he taketh under the sun on gener passeth awai and anoth gener cometh but the earth abideth for ever the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to hi place where he aros the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it whirleth about continu and the wind returneth again accord to hi circuit all the river run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whenc the river come thither thei return again all thing ar full of labour man cannot utter it the ey is not satisfi with see nor the ear fill with hear the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there ani thing whereof it mai be said see thi is new it hath been alreadi of old time which wa befor us there is no remembr of former thing neither shall there be ani remembr of thing that ar to come with those that shall come after i the preacher wa king over israel in jerusalem and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concern all thing that ar done under heaven thi sore travail hath god given to the son of man to be exercis therewith i have seen all the work that ar done under the sun and behold all is vaniti and vexat of spirit that which is crook cannot be made straight and that which is want cannot be number i commun with mine own heart sai lo i am come to great estat and have gotten more wisdom than all thei that have been befor me in jerusalem yea my heart had great experi of wisdom and knowledg and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know mad and folli i perceiv that thi also is vexat of spirit for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledg increaseth sorrow i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefor enjoi pleasur and behold thi also is vaniti i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it i sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquaint mine heart with wisdom and to lai hold on folli till i might see what wa that good for the son of men which thei should do under the heaven all the dai of their life i made me great work i build me hous i plant me vineyard i made me garden and orchard and i plant tree in them of all kind of fruit i made me pool of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth tree i got me servant and maiden and had servant born in my hous also i had great possess of great and small cattl abov all that were in jerusalem befor me i gather me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasur of king and of the provinc i gat me men singer and women singer and the delight of the son of men as music instrument and that of all sort so i wa great and increas more than all that were befor me in jerusalem also my wisdom remain with me and whatsoev mine ey desir i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from ani joi for my heart rejoic in all my labour and thi wa my portion of all my labour then i look on all the work that my hand had wrought and on the labour that i had labour to do and behold all wa vaniti and vexat of spirit and there wa no profit under the sun and i turn myself to behold wisdom and mad and folli for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath been alreadi done then i saw that wisdom excelleth folli as far as light excelleth dark the wise man ey ar in hi head but the fool walketh in dark and i myself perceiv also that on event happeneth to them all then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me and why wa i then more wise then i said in my heart that thi also is vaniti for there is no remembr of the wise more than of the fool for ever see that which now is in the dai to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man as the fool therefor i hate life becaus the work that is wrought under the sun is grievou unto me for all is vaniti and vexat of spirit yea i hate all my labour which i had taken under the sun becaus i should leav it unto the man that shall be after me and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have labour and wherein i have shew myself wise under the sun thi is also vaniti therefor i went about to caus my heart to despair of all the labour which i took under the sun for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledg and in equiti yet to a man that hath not labour therein shall he leav it for hi portion thi also is vaniti and a great evil for what hath man of all hi labour and of the vexat of hi heart wherein he hath labour under the sun for all hi dai ar sorrow and hi travail grief yea hi heart taketh not rest in the night thi is also vaniti there is noth better for a man than that he should eat and drink and that he should make hi soul enjoi good in hi labour thi also i saw that it wa from the hand of god for who can eat or who els can hasten hereunto more than i for god giveth to a man that is good in hi sight wisdom and knowledg and joi but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up that he mai give to him that is good befor god thi also is vaniti and vexat of spirit to everi thing there is a season and a time to everi purpos under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is plant a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to danc a time to cast awai stone and a time to gather stone togeth a time to embrac and a time to refrain from embrac a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast awai a time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silenc and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peac what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth i have seen the travail which god hath given to the son of men to be exercis in it he hath made everi thing beauti in hi time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the begin to the end i know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoic and to do good in hi life and also that everi man should eat and drink and enjoi the good of all hi labour it is the gift of god i know that whatsoev god doeth it shall be for ever noth can be put to it nor ani thing taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear befor him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath alreadi been and god requireth that which is past and moreov i saw under the sun the place of judgment that wicked wa there and the place of righteous that iniqu wa there i said in mine heart god shall judg the righteou and the wick for there is a time there for everi purpos and for everi work i said in mine heart concern the estat of the son of men that god might manifest them and that thei might see that thei themselv ar beast for that which befalleth the son of men befalleth beast even on thing befalleth them as the on dieth so dieth the other yea thei have all on breath so that a man hath no preemin abov a beast for all is vaniti all go unto on place all ar of the dust and all turn to dust again who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth wherefor i perceiv that there is noth better than that a man should rejoic in hi own work for that is hi portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him so i return and consid all the oppress that ar done under the sun and behold the tear of such as were oppress and thei had no comfort and on the side of their oppressor there wa power but thei had no comfort wherefor i prais the dead which ar alreadi dead more than the live which ar yet aliv yea better is he than both thei which hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun again i consid all travail and everi right work that for thi a man is envi of hi neighbour thi is also vaniti and vexat of spirit the fool foldeth hi hand togeth and eateth hi own flesh better is an hand with quiet than both the hand full with travail and vexat of spirit then i return and i saw vaniti under the sun there is on alon and there is not a second yea he hath neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all hi labour neither is hi ey satisfi with rich neither saith he for whom do i labour and bereav my soul of good thi is also vaniti yea it is a sore travail two ar better than on becaus thei have a good reward for their labour for if thei fall the on will lift up hi fellow but woe to him that is alon when he falleth for he hath not anoth to help him up again if two lie togeth then thei have heat but how can on be warm alon and if on prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickli broken better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonish for out of prison he cometh to reign wherea also he that is born in hi kingdom becometh poor i consid all the live which walk under the sun with the second child that shall stand up in hi stead there is no end of all the peopl even of all that have been befor them thei also that come after shall not rejoic in him sure thi also is vaniti and vexat of spirit keep thy foot when thou goest to the hous of god and be more readi to hear than to give the sacrific of fool for thei consid not that thei do evil be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasti to utter ani thing befor god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefor let thy word be few for a dream cometh through the multitud of busi and a fool voic is known by multitud of word when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pai it for he hath no pleasur in fool pai that which thou hast vow better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pai suffer not thy mouth to caus thy flesh to sin neither sai thou befor the angel that it wa an error wherefor should god be angri at thy voic and destroi the work of thine hand for in the multitud of dream and mani word there ar also diver vaniti but fear thou god if thou seest the oppress of the poor and violent pervert of judgment and justic in a provinc marvel not at the matter for he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than thei moreov the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is serv by the field he that loveth silver shall not be satisfi with silver nor he that loveth abund with increas thi is also vaniti when good increas thei ar increas that eat them and what good is there to the owner thereof save the behold of them with their ey the sleep of a labour man is sweet whether he eat littl or much but the abund of the rich will not suffer him to sleep there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun name rich kept for the owner thereof to their hurt but those rich perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son and there is noth in hi hand as he came forth of hi mother womb nake shall he return to go as he came and shall take noth of hi labour which he mai carri awai in hi hand and thi also is a sore evil that in all point as he came so shall he go and what profit hath he that hath labour for the wind all hi dai also he eateth in dark and he hath much sorrow and wrath with hi sick behold that which i have seen it is good and come for on to eat and to drink and to enjoi the good of all hi labour that he taketh under the sun all the dai of hi life which god giveth him for it is hi portion everi man also to whom god hath given rich and wealth and hath given him power to eat thereof and to take hi portion and to rejoic in hi labour thi is the gift of god for he shall not much rememb the dai of hi life becaus god answereth him in the joi of hi heart there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is common among men a man to whom god hath given rich wealth and honour so that he wanteth noth for hi soul of all that he desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger eateth it thi is vaniti and it is an evil diseas if a man beget an hundr children and live mani year so that the dai of hi year be mani and hi soul be not fill with good and also that he have no burial i sai that an untim birth is better than he for he cometh in with vaniti and departeth in dark and hi name shall be cover with dark moreov he hath not seen the sun nor known ani thing thi hath more rest than the other yea though he live a thousand year twice told yet hath he seen no good do not all go to on place all the labour of man is for hi mouth and yet the appetit is not fill for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor that knoweth to walk befor the live better is the sight of the ey than the wander of the desir thi is also vaniti and vexat of spirit that which hath been is name alreadi and it is known that it is man neither mai he contend with him that is mightier than he see there be mani thing that increas vaniti what is man the better for who knoweth what is good for man in thi life all the dai of hi vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun a good name is better than preciou ointment and the dai of death than the dai of on birth it is better to go to the hous of mourn than to go to the hous of feast for that is the end of all men and the live will lai it to hi heart sorrow is better than laughter for by the sad of the counten the heart is made better the heart of the wise is in the hous of mourn but the heart of fool is in the hous of mirth it is better to hear the rebuk of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fool for as the crackl of thorn under a pot so is the laughter of the fool thi also is vaniti sure oppress maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the heart better is the end of a thing than the begin thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit be not hasti in thy spirit to be angri for anger resteth in the bosom of fool sai not thou what is the caus that the former dai were better than these for thou dost not enquir wise concern thi wisdom is good with an inherit and by it there is profit to them that see the sun for wisdom is a defenc and monei is a defenc but the excel of knowledg is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it consid the work of god for who can make that straight which he hath made crook in the dai of prosper be joy but in the dai of advers consid god also hath set the on over against the other to the end that man should find noth after him all thing have i seen in the dai of my vaniti there is a just man that perisheth in hi righteous and there is a wick man that prolongeth hi life in hi wicked be not righteou over much neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou destroi thyself be not over much wick neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die befor thy time it is good that thou shouldest take hold of thi yea also from thi withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighti men which ar in the citi for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not also take no heed unto all word that ar spoken lest thou hear thy servant curs thee for oftentim also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewis hast curs other all thi have i prove by wisdom i said i will be wise but it wa far from me that which is far off and exceed deep who can find it out i appli mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of thing and to know the wicked of folli even of foolish and mad and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snare and net and her hand as band whoso pleaseth god shall escap from her but the sinner shall be taken by her behold thi have i found saith the preacher count on by on to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but i find not on man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found lo thi onli have i found that god hath made man upright but thei have sought out mani invent who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpret of a thing a man wisdom maketh hi face to shine and the bold of hi face shall be chang i counsel thee to keep the king command and that in regard of the oath of god be not hasti to go out of hi sight stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoev pleaseth him where the word of a king is there is power and who mai sai unto him what doest thou whoso keepeth the command shall feel no evil thing and a wise man heart discerneth both time and judgment becaus to everi purpos there is time and judgment therefor the miseri of man is great upon him for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when it shall be there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the dai of death and there is no discharg in that war neither shall wicked deliv those that ar given to it all thi have i seen and appli my heart unto everi work that is done under the sun there is a time wherein on man ruleth over anoth to hi own hurt and so i saw the wick buri who had come and gone from the place of the holi and thei were forgotten in the citi where thei had so done thi is also vaniti becaus sentenc against an evil work is not execut speedili therefor the heart of the son of men is fulli set in them to do evil though a sinner do evil an hundr time and hi dai be prolong yet sure i know that it shall be well with them that fear god which fear befor him but it shall not be well with the wick neither shall he prolong hi dai which ar as a shadow becaus he feareth not befor god there is a vaniti which is done upon the earth that there be just men unto whom it happeneth accord to the work of the wick again there be wick men to whom it happeneth accord to the work of the righteou i said that thi also is vaniti then i commend mirth becaus a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merri for that shall abid with him of hi labour the dai of hi life which god giveth him under the sun when i appli mine heart to know wisdom and to see the busi that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither dai nor night seeth sleep with hi ey then i beheld all the work of god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun becaus though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be abl to find it for all thi i consid in my heart even to declar all thi that the righteou and the wise and their work ar in the hand of god no man knoweth either love or hatr by all that is befor them all thing come alik to all there is on event to the righteou and to the wick to the good and to the clean and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the good so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath thi is an evil among all thing that ar done under the sun that there is on event unto all yea also the heart of the son of men is full of evil and mad is in their heart while thei live and after that thei go to the dead for to him that is join to all the live there is hope for a live dog is better than a dead lion for the live know that thei shall die but the dead know not ani thing neither have thei ani more a reward for the memori of them is forgotten also their love and their hatr and their envi is now perish neither have thei ani more a portion for ever in ani thing that is done under the sun go thy wai eat thy bread with joi and drink thy wine with a merri heart for god now accepteth thy work let thy garment be alwai white and let thy head lack no ointment live joyfulli with the wife whom thou lovest all the dai of the life of thy vaniti which he hath given thee under the sun all the dai of thy vaniti for that is thy portion in thi life and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun whatsoev thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor devic nor knowledg nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest i return and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battl to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet rich to men of understand nor yet favour to men of skill but time and chanc happeneth to them all for man also knoweth not hi time as the fish that ar taken in an evil net and as the bird that ar caught in the snare so ar the son of men snare in an evil time when it falleth suddenli upon them thi wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seem great unto me there wa a littl citi and few men within it and there came a great king against it and besieg it and built great bulwark against it now there wa found in it a poor wise man and he by hi wisdom deliv the citi yet no man rememb that same poor man then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor man wisdom is despis and hi word ar not heard the word of wise men ar heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fool wisdom is better than weapon of war but on sinner destroyeth much good dead fli caus the ointment of the apothecari to send forth a stink savour so doth a littl folli him that is in reput for wisdom and honour a wise man heart is at hi right hand but a fool heart at hi left yea also when he that is a fool walketh by the wai hi wisdom faileth him and he saith to everi on that he is a fool if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leav not thy place for yield pacifieth great offenc there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as an error which proceedeth from the ruler folli is set in great digniti and the rich sit in low place i have seen servant upon hors and princ walk as servant upon the earth he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an hedg a serpent shall bite him whoso removeth stone shall be hurt therewith and he that cleaveth wood shall be endang therebi if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edg then must he put to more strength but wisdom is profit to direct sure the serpent will bite without enchant and a babbler is no better the word of a wise man mouth ar graciou but the lip of a fool will swallow up himself the begin of the word of hi mouth is foolish and the end of hi talk is mischiev mad a fool also is full of word a man cannot tell what shall be and what shall be after him who can tell him the labour of the foolish wearieth everi on of them becaus he knoweth not how to go to the citi woe to thee o land when thy king is a child and thy princ eat in the morn bless art thou o land when thy king is the son of nobl and thy princ eat in due season for strength and not for drunken by much sloth the build decayeth and through idl of the hand the hous droppeth through a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merri but monei answereth all thing curs not the king no not in thy thought and curs not the rich in thy bedchamb for a bird of the air shall carri the voic and that which hath wing shall tell the matter cast thy bread upon the water for thou shalt find it after mani dai give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth if the cloud be full of rain thei empti themselv upon the earth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the cloud shall not reap as thou knowest not what is the wai of the spirit nor how the bone do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the work of god who maketh all in the morn sow thy seed and in the even withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either thi or that or whether thei both shall be alik good truli the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the ey to behold the sun but if a man live mani year and rejoic in them all yet let him rememb the dai of dark for thei shall be mani all that cometh is vaniti rejoic o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the dai of thy youth and walk in the wai of thine heart and in the sight of thine ey but know thou that for all these thing god will bring thee into judgment therefor remov sorrow from thy heart and put awai evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth ar vaniti rememb now thy creator in the dai of thy youth while the evil dai come not nor the year draw nigh when thou shalt sai i have no pleasur in them while the sun or the light or the moon or the star be not darken nor the cloud return after the rain in the dai when the keeper of the hous shall trembl and the strong men shall bow themselv and the grinder ceas becaus thei ar few and those that look out of the window be darken and the door shall be shut in the street when the sound of the grind is low and he shall rise up at the voic of the bird and all the daughter of musick shall be brought low also when thei shall be afraid of that which is high and fear shall be in the wai and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopp shall be a burden and desir shall fail becaus man goeth to hi long home and the mourner go about the street or ever the silver cord be loos or the golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern then shall the dust return to the earth as it wa and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it vaniti of vaniti saith the preacher all is vaniti and moreov becaus the preacher wa wise he still taught the peopl knowledg yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in order mani proverb the preacher sought to find out accept word and that which wa written wa upright even word of truth the word of the wise ar as goad and as nail fasten by the master of assembl which ar given from on shepherd and further by these my son be admonish of make mani book there is no end and much studi is a weari of the flesh let us hear the conclus of the whole matter fear god and keep hi command for thi is the whole duti of man for god shall bring everi work into judgment with everi secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil the song of solomon the song of song which is solomon let him kiss me with the kiss of hi mouth for thy love is better than wine becaus of the savour of thy good ointment thy name is as ointment pour forth therefor do the virgin

take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the word that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nation from the dai i spake unto thee from the dai of josiah even unto thi dai it mai be that the hous of judah will hear all the evil which i purpos to do unto them that thei mai return everi man from hi evil wai that i mai forgiv their iniqu and their sin

dai and also thou shalt read them in the ear of all judah that come out of their citi it mai be thei will present their supplic befor the lord and will return everi on from hi evil wai for great is the anger and the furi that the lord hath pronounc against thi peopl and baruch the son of neriah did accord to all that jeremiah the prophet command him read in the book the word of the lord in the

take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king had burn the roll and the word which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah sai take thee again anoth roll and write in it all the former word that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burn and thou shalt sai to jehoiakim king of judah thu

fire and there were ad besid unto them mani like word and king zedekiah the son of josiah reign instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah but neither he nor hi servant nor the peopl of the land did hearken unto the word of the lord which he spake by the prophet jeremiah and zedekiah the king sent jehuc the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah sai prai now unto the lord our god for us now jeremiah came in and went out among the peopl for thei had not put him into prison then pharaoh armi wa come forth out of egypt and when the chaldean that besieg jerusalem heard tide of them thei depart from jerusalem then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah sai thu saith

the chaldean shall come again and fight against thi citi and take it and burn it with fire thu saith the lord deceiv not yourselv sai the chaldean shall sure depart from us for thei shall not depart for though ye had smitten the whole armi of the chaldean that fight against you and there remain but wound men among them yet should thei rise up everi man in hi tent and burn thi citi with fire and it came to pass that when the armi of the chaldean wa broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh armi then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin to separ himself thenc in the midst of the peopl and when he wa in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward wa there whose name wa irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet sai thou fallest awai to the chaldean then said jeremiah it is fals i fall not awai to the chaldean but he hearken not to him so irijah took jeremiah and brought him to the princ wherefor the princ were wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the hous of jonathan the scribe for thei had made that the prison when jeremiah wa enter into the dungeon and into the cabin and jeremiah had remain there mani dai then zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king ask him secretli in hi hous and said is there ani word from the lord and jeremiah said there is for said he thou shalt be deliv into the hand of the king of babylon moreov jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offend against thee or against thy servant or against thi peopl that ye have put me in prison where ar now your prophet which prophesi unto you sai the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against thi land therefor hear now i prai thee o my lord the king let my supplic i prai thee be accept befor thee that thou caus me not to return to the hous of jonathan the scribe lest i die there then zedekiah the king command that thei should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison and that thei should give him daili a piec of bread out of the baker street until all the bread in the citi were spent thu jeremiah remain in the court of the prison then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah heard the word that jeremiah had spoken unto all the peopl sai thu saith the lord he that remaineth in thi citi shall die by the sword by the famin and by the pestil but he that goeth forth to the chaldean shall live for he shall have hi life for a prei and shall live thu saith the lord thi citi shall sure be

that remain in thi citi and the hand of all the peopl in speak such word unto them for thi man seeketh not the welfar of thi peopl but the hurt then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do ani thing against you then took thei jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech that wa in the court of the prison and thei let down jeremiah with cord and in the dungeon there wa no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire now when ebedmelech the ethiopian on of the eunuch which wa in the king hous heard that thei had put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sit in the gate of benjamin ebedmelech went forth out of the king hous and spake to the king sai my lord the king these men have done evil in all that thei have

zedekiah if i declar it unto thee wilt thou not sure put me to death and if i give thee counsel wilt thou not hearken unto me so zedekiah the king sware secretli unto jeremiah sai as the lord liveth that made us thi soul i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thu saith the lord the god of host the god of israel if thou wilt assuredli go forth unto the king of babylon princ then thy soul shall live and thi citi shall not be burn with fire and thou shalt live and thine hous but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon princ then shall thi citi be given into the hand of the chaldean and thei shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escap out of their hand and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jew that ar fallen to the chaldean lest thei deliv me into their hand and thei mock me but jeremiah said thei shall not deliv thee obei i beseech thee the voic of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live but if thou refus to go forth thi is the word that the lord hath shew me and behold all the women that ar left in the king

back so thei shall bring out all thy wive and thy children to the chaldean and thou shalt not escap out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt caus thi citi to be burn with fire then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these word and thou shalt not die but if the princ hear that i have talk with thee and thei come unto thee and sai unto thee declar unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death also what the king said unto thee then thou shalt sai unto them i present my supplic befor the king that he would not caus me to return to jonathan hous to die there then came all the princ unto jeremiah and ask him and he told them accord to all these word that the king had command so thei left off speak with him for the matter wa not perceiv so jeremiah abod in the court of the prison until the dai that jerusalem wa taken and he wa there when jerusalem wa taken in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all hi armi against jerusalem and thei besieg it and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the ninth dai of the month the citi wa broken up and all the princ of the king of babylon came in and sat in the middl gate even nergalsharez samgarnebo sarsechim rabsari nergalsharez rabmag with all the residu of the princ of the king of babylon and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw them and all the men of war then thei fled and went forth out of the citi by night by the wai of the

brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him then the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah in riblah befor hi ey also the king of babylon slew all the nobl of judah moreov he put out zedekiah ey and bound him with chain to carri him to babylon and the chaldean burn the king hous and the hous of the peopl with fire and brake down the wall of jerusalem then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carri awai captiv into babylon the remnant of the peopl that remain in the citi and those that fell awai that fell to him with the rest of the peopl that remain but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the peopl which had noth in the land of judah and gave them vineyard and field at the same time now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charg concern jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sai take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall sai unto thee so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban rabsari and nergalsharez rabmag and all the king of babylon princ even thei sent and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison and commit him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carri him home so he dwelt among the peopl now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he wa shut up in the court of the prison sai go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian sai thu saith the lord of host the god of israel behold i will bring my word upon thi citi for evil and not for good and thei shall be accomplish in that dai befor thee but i will deliv thee in that dai saith the lord and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid for i will sure deliv thee and thou

captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when he had taken him be bound in chain among all that were carri awai captiv of jerusalem and judah which were carri awai captiv unto babylon and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him the lord thy god hath pronounc thi evil upon thi place now the lord hath brought it and done accord as he hath said becaus ye have sin against the lord and have not obei hi voic therefor thi thing is come upon you and now behold i loos thee thi dai from the chain which were upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land is befor thee whither it seemeth good and conveni for thee to go thither go now while he wa not yet gone back he said go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the citi of judah and dwell with him among the peopl or go wheresoev it seemeth conveni unto thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victual and a reward and let him go then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and dwelt with him among the peopl that were left in the land now when all the captain of the forc which were in the field even thei and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had commit unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of them that were not carri awai captiv to babylon then thei came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the son of ephai the netophathit and jezaniah the son of a maachathit thei and their men

me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serv the chaldean which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer fruit and oil and put them in your vessel and dwell in your citi that ye have taken likewis when all the jew that were in moab and among the ammonit and in edom and that were in all the countri heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan even all the jew return out of all place whither thei were driven and came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gather wine and summer fruit veri much moreov johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the forc that were in the field came to gedaliah to mizpah and said unto him dost thou certainli know that baali the king of the ammonit hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slai thee but gedaliah the son of ahikam believ them not then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretli sai let me go i prai thee and i will slai ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefor should he slai thee that all the jew which ar gather unto thee should be scatter and the remnant in judah perish but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do thi thing for thou speakest fals of ishmael now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princ of the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there thei did eat bread togeth in mizpah then aros ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land ishmael also slew all the jew that were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldean that were found there and the men of war and it came to pass the second dai after he had slain gedaliah and no man knew it that there came certain from shechem from shiloh and from samaria even fourscor men have their beard shaven and their cloth rent and have cut themselv with offer and incens in their hand to bring them to the hous of the lord and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them weep all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam and it wa so when thei came into the midst of the citi that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with him but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slai us not for we have treasur in the field of wheat and of barlei and of oil and of honei so he forbar and slew them not among their brethren now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodi of the men whom he had slain becaus of gedaliah wa it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah fill it with them that were slain then ishmael carri awai captiv all the residu of the peopl that were in mizpah even the king daughter and all the peopl that remain in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had commit to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of nethaniah carri them awai captiv and depart to go over to the ammonit but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the forc that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done then thei took all the men and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great water that ar in gibeon now it came to pass that when all the peopl which were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the forc that were with him then thei were glad so all the peopl that ishmael had carri awai captiv from mizpah cast about and return and went unto johanan the son of kareah but ishmael the son of nethaniah escap from johanan with eight men and went to the ammonit then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the forc that were with him all the remnant of the peopl whom he had recov from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighti men of war and the women and the children and the eunuch whom he had brought again from gibeon and thei depart and dwelt in the habit of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt becaus of the chaldean for thei were afraid of them becaus ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land then all the captain of the forc and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the peopl from the least even unto the greatest came near and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplic be accept befor thee and prai for us unto the lord thy god even for all thi remnant for we ar left but a few of mani as thine ey do behold us that the lord thy god mai shew us the wai wherein we mai walk and the thing that we mai do then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you behold i will prai unto the lord your god accord to your word and it shall come to pass that whatsoev thing the lord shall answer you i will declar it unto you i will keep noth back from you then thei said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faith wit between us if we do not even accord to all thing for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to us whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obei the voic of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it mai be well with us when we obei the voic of the lord our god and it came to pass after ten dai that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah then call he johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the forc which were with him and all the peopl from the least even to the greatest and said unto them thu saith the lord the god of israel

which is in heaven give good thing to them that ask him therefor all thing whatsoev ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for thi is the law and the prophet enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the wai that leadeth to destruct and mani there be which go in thereat becaus strait is the gate and narrow is the wai which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it bewar of fals prophet which come to you in sheep cloth but inwardli thei ar raven wolv ye shall know them by their fruit do men gather grape of thorn or fig of thistl even so everi good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit everi tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefor by their fruit ye shall know them not everi on that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven mani will sai to me in that dai lord lord have we not prophesi in thy name and in thy name have cast out devil and in thy name done mani wonder work and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniqu therefor whosoev heareth these sai of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built hi hous upon a rock and the rain descend and the flood came and the wind blew and beat upon that hous and it fell not for it wa found upon a rock and everi on that heareth these sai of mine and doeth them not shall be liken unto a foolish man which built hi hous upon the sand and the rain descend and the flood came and the wind blew and beat upon that hous and it fell and great wa the fall of it and it came to pass when jesu had end these sai the peopl were astonish at hi doctrin for he taught them as on have author and not as the scribe when he wa come down from the mountain great multitud follow him and behold there came a leper and worship him sai lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and jesu put forth hi hand and touch him sai i will be thou clean and immedi hi leprosi wa cleans and jesu saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy wai shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that mose command for a testimoni unto them and when jesu wa enter into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseech him and sai lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsi grievous torment and jesu saith unto him i will come and heal him the centurion answer and said lord i am not worthi that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word onli and my servant shall be heal for i am a man under author have soldier under me and i sai to thi man go and he goeth and to anoth come and he cometh and to my servant do thi and he doeth it when jesu heard it he marvel and said to them that follow verili i sai unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel and i sai unto you that mani shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer dark there shall be weep and gnash of teeth and jesu said unto the centurion go thy wai and as thou hast believ so be it done unto thee and hi servant wa heal in the selfsam hour and when jesu wa come into peter hous he saw hi wife mother laid and sick of a fever and he touch her hand and the fever left her and she aros and minist unto them when the even wa come thei brought unto him mani that were possess with devil and he cast out the spirit with hi word and heal all that were sick that it might be fulfil which wa spoken by esaia the prophet sai himself took our infirm and bare our sick now when jesu saw great multitud about him he gave command to depart unto the other side and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee whithersoev thou goest and jesu saith unto him the fox have hole and the bird of the air have nest but the son of man hath not where to lai hi head and anoth of hi discipl said unto him lord suffer me first to go and buri my father but jesu said unto him follow me and let the dead buri their dead and when he wa enter into a ship hi discipl follow him and behold there aros a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship wa cover with the wave but he wa asleep and hi discipl came to him and awok him sai lord save us we perish and he saith unto them why ar ye fear o ye of littl faith then he aros and rebuk the wind and the sea and there wa a great calm but the men marvel sai what manner of man is thi that even the wind and the sea obei him and when he wa come to the other side into the countri of the gergesen there met him two possess with devil come out of the tomb exceed fierc so that no man might pass by that wai and behold thei cri out sai what have we to do with thee jesu thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us befor the time and there wa a good wai off from them an herd of mani swine feed so the devil besought him sai if thou cast us out suffer us to go awai into the herd of swine and he said unto them go and when thei were come out thei went into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violent down a steep place into the sea and perish in the water and thei that kept them fled and went their wai into the citi and told everi thing and what wa befallen to the possess of the devil and behold the whole citi came out to meet jesu and when thei saw him thei besought him that he would depart out of their coast and he enter into a ship and pass over and came into hi own citi and behold thei brought to him a man sick of the palsi ly on a bed and jesu see their faith said unto the sick of the palsi son be of good cheer thy sin be forgiven thee and behold certain of the scribe said within themselv thi man blasphemeth and jesu know their thought said wherefor think ye evil in your heart for whether is easier to sai thy sin be forgiven thee or to sai aris and walk but that ye mai know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgiv sin then saith he to the sick of the palsi aris take up thy bed and go unto thine hous and he aros and depart to hi hous but when the multitud saw it thei marvel and glorifi god which had given such power unto men and as jesu pass forth from thenc he saw a man name matthew sit at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he aros and follow him and it came to pass as jesu sat at meat in the hous behold mani publican and sinner came and sat down with him and hi discipl and when the pharise saw it thei said unto hi discipl why eateth your master with publican and sinner but when jesu heard that he said unto them thei that be whole need not a physician but thei that ar sick but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have merci and not sacrific for i am not come to call the righteou but sinner to repent then came to him the discipl of john sai why do we and the pharise fast oft but thy discipl fast not and jesu said unto them can the children of the bridechamb mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the dai will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall thei fast no man putteth a piec of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made wors neither do men put new wine into old bottl els the bottl break and the wine runneth out and the bottl perish but thei put new wine into new bottl and both ar preserv while he spake these thing unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worship him sai my daughter is even now dead but come and lai thy hand upon her and she shall live and jesu aros and follow him and so did hi discipl and behold a woman which wa diseas with an issu of blood twelv year came behind him and touch the hem of hi garment for she said within herself if i mai but touch hi garment i shall be whole but jesu turn him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman wa made whole from that hour and when jesu came into the ruler hous and saw the minstrel and the peopl make a nois he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and thei laugh him to scorn but when the peopl were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid aros and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land and when jesu depart thenc two blind men follow him cry and sai thou son of david have merci on us and when he wa come into the hous the blind men came to him and jesu saith unto them believ ye that i am abl to do thi thei said unto him yea lord then touch he their ey sai accord to your faith be it unto you and their ey were open and jesu straitli charg them sai see that no man know it but thei when thei were depart spread abroad hi fame in all that countri as thei went out behold thei brought to him a dumb man possess with a devil and when the devil wa cast out the dumb spake and the multitud marvel sai it wa never so seen in israel but the pharise said he casteth out devil through the princ of the devil and jesu went about all the citi and villag teach in their synagogu and preach the gospel of the kingdom and heal everi sick and everi diseas among the peopl but when he saw the multitud he wa move with compass on them becaus thei faint and were scatter abroad as sheep have no shepherd then saith he unto hi discipl the harvest truli is plenteou but the labour ar few prai ye therefor the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labour into hi harvest and when he had call unto him hi twelv discipl he gave them power against unclean spirit to cast them out and to heal all manner of sick and all manner of diseas now the name of the twelv apostl ar these the first simon who is call peter and andrew hi brother jame the son of zebede and john hi brother philip and bartholomew thoma and matthew the publican jame the son of alphaeu and lebbaeu whose surnam wa thaddaeu simon the canaanit and juda iscariot who also betrai him these twelv jesu sent forth and command them sai go not into the wai of the gentil and into ani citi of the samaritan enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the hous of israel and as ye go preach sai the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick cleans the leper rais the dead cast out devil freeli ye have receiv freeli give provid neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purs nor scrip for your journei neither two coat neither shoe nor yet stave for the workman is worthi of hi meat and into whatsoev citi or town ye shall enter enquir who in it is worthi and there abid till ye go thenc and when ye come into an hous salut it and if the hous be worthi let your peac come upon it but if it be not worthi let your peac return to you and whosoev shall not receiv you nor hear your word when ye depart out of that hous or citi shake off the dust of your feet verili i sai unto you it shall be more toler for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the dai of judgment than for that citi behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolv be ye therefor wise as serpent and harmless as dove but bewar of men for thei will deliv you up to the council and thei will scourg you in their synagogu and ye shall be brought befor governor and king for my sake for a testimoni against them and the gentil but when thei deliv you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you and the brother shall deliv up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise up against their parent and caus them to be put to death and ye shall be hate of all men for my name sake but he that endureth to the end shall be save but when thei persecut you in thi citi flee ye into anoth for verili i sai unto you ye shall not have gone over the citi of israel till the son of man be come the discipl is not abov hi master nor the servant abov hi lord it is enough for the discipl that he be as hi master and the servant as hi lord if thei have call the master of the hous beelzebub how much more shall thei call them of hi household fear them not therefor for there is noth cover that shall not be reveal and hid that shall not be known what i tell you in dark that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetop and fear not them which kill the bodi but ar not abl to kill the soul but rather fear him which is abl to destroi both soul and bodi in hell ar not two sparrow sold for a farth and on of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the veri hair of your head ar all number fear ye not therefor ye ar of more valu than mani sparrow whosoev therefor shall confess me befor men him will i confess also befor my father which is in heaven but whosoev shall deni me befor men him will i also deni befor my father which is in heaven think not that i am come to send peac on earth i came not to send peac but a sword for i am come to set a man at varianc against hi father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law and a man foe shall be thei of hi own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthi of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthi of me and he that taketh not hi cross and followeth after me is not worthi of me he that findeth hi life shall lose it and he that loseth hi life for my sake shall find it he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receiv a prophet reward and he that receiveth a righteou man in the name of a righteou man shall receiv a righteou man reward and whosoev shall give to drink unto on of these littl on a cup of cold water onli in the name of a discipl verili i sai unto you he shall in no wise lose hi reward and it came to pass when jesu had made an end of command hi twelv discipl he depart thenc to teach and to preach in their citi now when john had heard in the prison the work of christ he sent two of hi discipl and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for anoth jesu answer and said unto them go and shew john again those thing which ye do hear and see the blind receiv their sight and the lame walk the leper ar cleans and the deaf hear the dead ar rais up and the poor have the gospel preach to them and bless is he whosoev shall not be offend in me and as thei depart jesu began to sai unto the multitud concern john what went ye out into the wilder to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out for to see a man cloth in soft raiment behold thei that wear soft cloth ar in king hous but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i sai unto you and more than a prophet for thi is he of whom it is written behold i send my messeng befor thy face which shall prepar thy wai befor thee verili i sai unto you among them that ar born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstand he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the dai of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violenc and the violent take it by forc for all the prophet and the law prophesi until john and if ye will receiv it thi is elia which wa for to come he that hath ear to hear let him hear but whereunto shall i liken thi gener it is like unto children sit in the market and call unto their fellow and sai we have pipe unto you and ye have not danc we have mourn unto you and ye have not lament for john came neither eat nor drink and thei sai he hath a devil the son of man came eat and drink and thei sai behold a man glutton and a winebibb a friend of publican and sinner but wisdom is justifi of her children then began he to upbraid the citi wherein most of hi mighti work were done becaus thei repent not woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighti work which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon thei would have repent long ago in sackcloth and ash but i sai unto you it shall be more toler for tyre and sidon at the dai of judgment than for you and thou capernaum which art exalt unto heaven shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighti work which have been done in thee had been done in sodom it would have remain until thi dai but i sai unto you that it shall be more toler for the land of sodom in the dai of judgment than for thee at that time jesu answer and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth becaus thou hast hid these thing from the wise and prudent and hast reveal them unto babe even so father for so it seem good in thy sight all thing ar deliv unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth ani man the father save the son and he to whomsoev the son will reveal him come unto me all ye that labour and ar heavi laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowli in heart and ye shall find rest unto your soul for my yoke is easi and my burden is light at that time jesu went on the sabbath dai through the corn and hi discipl were an hungr and began to pluck the ear of corn and to eat but when the pharise saw it thei said unto him behold thy discipl do that which is not law to do upon the sabbath dai but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he wa an hungr and thei that were with him how he enter into the hous of god and did eat the shewbread which wa not law for him to eat neither for them which were with him but onli for the priest or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath dai the priest in the templ profan the sabbath and ar blameless but i sai unto you that in thi place is on greater than the templ but if ye had known what thi meaneth i will have merci and not sacrific ye would not have condemn the guiltless for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath dai and when he wa depart thenc he went into their synagogu and behold there wa a man which had hi hand wither and thei ask him sai is it law to heal on the sabbath dai that thei might accus him and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that shall have on sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath dai will he not lai hold on it and lift it out how much then is a man better than a sheep wherefor it is law to do well on the sabbath dai then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretch it forth and it wa restor whole like as the other then the pharise went out and held a council against him how thei might destroi him but when jesu knew it he withdrew himself from thenc and great multitud follow him and he heal them all and charg them that thei should not make him known that it might be fulfil which wa spoken by esaia the prophet sai behold my servant whom i have chosen my belov in whom my soul is well pleas i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew judgment to the gentil he shall not strive nor cry neither shall ani man hear hi voic in the street a bruis reed shall he not break and smoke flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victori and in hi name shall the gentil trust then wa brought unto him on possess with a devil blind and dumb and he heal him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw and all the peopl were amaz and said is not thi the son of david but when the pharise heard it thei said thi fellow doth not cast out devil but by beelzebub the princ of the devil and jesu knew their thought and said unto them everi kingdom divid against itself is brought to desol and everi citi or hous divid against itself shall not stand and if satan cast out satan he is divid against himself how shall then hi kingdom stand and if i by beelzebub cast out devil by whom do your children cast them out therefor thei shall be your judg but if i cast out devil by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you or els how can on enter into a strong man hous and spoil hi good except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil hi hous he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad wherefor i sai unto you all manner of sin and blasphemi shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemi against the holi ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoev speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoev speaketh against the holi ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in thi world neither in the world to come either make the tree good and hi fruit good or els make the tree corrupt and hi fruit corrupt for the tree is known by hi fruit o gener of viper how can ye be evil speak good thing for out of the abund of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasur of the heart bringeth forth good thing and an evil man out of the evil treasur bringeth forth evil thing but i sai unto you that everi idl word that men shall speak thei shall give account thereof in the dai of judgment for by thy word thou shalt be justifi and by thy word thou shalt be condemn then certain of the scribe and of the pharise answer sai master we would see a sign from thee but he answer and said unto them an evil and adulter gener seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jona for as jona wa three dai and three night in the whale belli so shall the son of man be three dai and three night in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with thi gener and shall condemn it becaus thei repent at the preach of jona and behold a greater than jona is here the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with thi gener and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry place seek rest and findeth none then he saith i will return into my hous from whenc i came out and when he is come he findeth it empti swept and garnish then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirit more wick than himself and thei enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is wors than the first even so shall it be also unto thi wick gener while he yet talk to the peopl behold hi mother and hi brethren stood without desir to speak with him then on said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desir to speak with thee but he answer and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who ar my brethren and he stretch forth hi hand toward hi discipl and said behold my mother and my brethren for whosoev shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother the same dai went jesu out of the hous and sat by the sea side and great multitud were gather togeth unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitud stood on the shore and he spake mani thing unto them in parabl sai behold a sower went forth to sow and when he sow some seed fell by the wai side and the fowl came and devour them up some fell upon stoni place where thei had not much earth and forthwith thei sprung up becaus thei had no deep of earth and when the sun wa up thei were scorch and becaus thei had no root thei wither awai and some fell among thorn and the thorn sprung up and choke them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold who hath ear to hear let him hear and the discipl came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parabl he answer and said unto them becaus it is given unto you to know the mysteri of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoev hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abund but whosoev hath not from him shall be taken awai even that he hath therefor speak i to them in parabl becaus thei see see not and hear thei hear not neither do thei understand and in them is fulfil the propheci of esaia which saith by hear ye shall hear and shall not understand and see ye shall see and shall not perceiv for thi peopl heart is wax gross and their ear ar dull of hear and their ey thei have close lest at ani time thei should see with their ey and hear with their ear and should understand with their heart and should be convert and i should heal them but bless ar your ey for thei see and your ear for thei hear for verili i sai unto you that mani prophet and righteou men have desir to see those thing which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those thing which ye hear and have not heard them hear ye therefor the parabl of the sower when ani on heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wick on and catcheth awai that which wa sown in hi heart thi is he which receiv seed by the wai side but he that receiv the seed into stoni place the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joi receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribul or persecut ariseth becaus of the word by and by he is offend he also that receiv seed among the thorn is he that heareth the word and the care of thi world and the deceit of rich choke the word and he becometh unfruit but he that receiv seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixti some thirti anoth parabl put he forth unto them sai the kingdom of heaven is liken unto a man which sow good seed in hi field but while men slept hi enemi came and sow tare among the wheat and went hi wai but when the blade wa sprung up and brought forth fruit then appear the tare also so the servant of the household came and said unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whenc then hath it tare he said unto them an enemi hath done thi the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nai lest while ye gather up the tare ye root up also the wheat with them let both grow togeth until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will sai to the reaper gather ye togeth first the tare and bind them in bundl to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn anoth parabl put he forth unto them sai the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sow in hi field which inde is the least of all seed but when it is grown it is the greatest among herb and becometh a tree so that the bird of the air come and lodg in the branch thereof anoth parabl spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measur of meal till the whole wa leaven all these thing spake jesu unto the multitud in parabl and without a parabl spake he not unto them that it might be fulfil which wa spoken by the prophet sai i will open my mouth in parabl i will utter thing which have been kept secret from the foundat of the world then jesu sent the multitud awai and went into the hous and hi discipl came unto him sai declar unto us the parabl of the tare of the field he answer and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed ar the children of the kingdom but the tare ar the children of the wick on the enemi that sow them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reaper ar the angel as therefor the tare ar gather and burn in the fire so shall it be in the end of thi world the son of man shall send forth hi angel and thei shall gather out of hi kingdom all thing that offend and them which do iniqu and shall cast them into a furnac of fire there shall be wail and gnash of teeth then shall the righteou shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ear to hear let him hear again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasur hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joi thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seek goodli pearl who when he had found on pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that wa cast into the sea and gather of everi kind which when it wa full thei drew to shore and sat down and gather the good into vessel but cast the bad awai so shall it be at the end of the world the angel shall come forth and sever the wick from among the just and shall cast them into the furnac of fire there shall be wail and gnash of teeth jesu saith unto them have ye understood all these thing thei sai unto him yea lord then said he unto them therefor everi scribe which is instruct unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an household which bringeth forth out of hi treasur thing new and old and it came to pass that when jesu had finish these parabl he depart thenc and when he wa come into hi own countri he taught them in their synagogu insomuch that thei were astonish and said whenc hath thi man thi wisdom and these mighti work is not thi the carpent son is not hi mother call mari and hi brethren jame and jose and simon and juda and hi sister ar thei not all with us whenc then hath thi man all these thing and thei were offend in him but jesu said unto them a prophet is not without honour save in hi own countri and in hi own hous and he did not mani mighti work there becaus of their unbelief at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesu and said unto hi servant thi is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefor mighti work do shew forth themselv in him for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodia sake hi brother philip wife for john said unto him it is not law for thee to have her and when he would have put him to death he fear the multitud becaus thei count him as a prophet but when herod birthdai wa kept the daughter of herodia danc befor them and pleas herod whereupon he promis with an oath to give her whatsoev she would ask and she be befor instruct of her mother said give me here john baptist head in a charger and the king wa sorri nevertheless for the oath sake and them which sat with him at meat he command it to be given her and he sent and behead john in the prison and hi head wa brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother and hi discipl came and took up the bodi and buri it and went and told jesu when jesu heard of it he depart thenc by ship into a desert place apart and when the peopl had heard thereof thei follow him on foot out of the citi and jesu went forth and saw a great multitud and wa move with compass toward them and he heal their sick and when it wa even hi discipl came to him sai thi is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitud awai that thei mai go into the villag and bui themselv victual but jesu said unto them thei need not depart give ye them to eat and thei sai unto him we have here but five loav and two fish he said bring them hither to me and he command the multitud to sit down on the grass and took the five loav and the two fish and look up to heaven he bless and brake and gave the loav to hi discipl and the discipl to the multitud and thei did all eat and were fill and thei took up of the fragment that remain twelv basket full and thei that had eaten were about five thousand men besid women and children and straightwai jesu constrain hi discipl to get into a ship and to go befor him unto the other side while he sent the multitud awai and when he had sent the multitud awai he went up into a mountain apart to prai and when the even wa come he wa there alon but the ship wa now in the midst of the sea toss with wave for the wind wa contrari and in the fourth watch of the night jesu went unto them walk on the sea and when the discipl saw him walk on the sea thei were troubl sai it is a spirit and thei cri out for fear but straightwai jesu spake unto them sai be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and peter answer him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter wa come down out of the ship he walk on the water to go to jesu but when he saw the wind boister he wa afraid and begin to sink he cri sai lord save me and immedi jesu stretch forth hi hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of littl faith wherefor didst thou doubt and when thei were come into the ship the wind ceas then thei that were in the ship came and worship him sai of a truth thou art the son of god and when thei were gone over thei came into the land of gennesaret and when the men of that place had knowledg of him thei sent out into all that countri round about and brought unto him all that were diseas and besought him that thei might onli touch the hem of hi garment and as mani as touch were made perfectli whole then came to jesu scribe and pharise which were of jerusalem sai why do thy discipl transgress the tradit of the elder for thei wash not their hand when thei eat bread but he answer and said unto them why do ye also transgress the command of god by your tradit for god command sai honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye sai whosoev shall sai to hi father or hi mother it is a gift by whatsoev thou mightest be profit by me and honour not hi father or hi mother he shall be free thu have ye made the command of god of none effect by your tradit ye hypocrit well did esaia prophesi of you sai thi peopl draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lip but their heart is far from me but in vain thei do worship me teach for doctrin the command of men and he call the multitud and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth thi defileth a man then came hi discipl and said unto him knowest thou that the pharise were offend after thei heard thi sai but he answer and said everi plant which my heavenli father hath not plant shall be root up let them alon thei be blind leader of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch then answer peter and said unto him declar unto us thi parabl and jesu said ar ye also yet without understand do not ye yet understand that whatsoev entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belli and is cast out into the draught but those thing which proce out of the mouth come forth from the heart and thei defil the man for out of the heart proce evil thought murder adulteri fornic theft fals wit blasphemi these ar the thing which defil a man but to eat with unwashen hand defileth not a man then jesu went thenc and depart into the coast of tyre and sidon and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cri unto him sai have merci on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievous vex with a devil but he answer her not a word and hi discipl came and besought him sai send her awai for she crieth after us but he answer and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the hous of israel then came she and worship him sai lord help me but he answer and said it is not meet to take the children bread and to cast it to dog and she said truth lord yet the dog eat of the crumb which fall from their master tabl then jesu answer and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter wa made whole from that veri hour and jesu depart from thenc and came nigh unto the sea of galile and went up into a mountain and sat down there and great multitud came unto him have with them those that were lame blind dumb maim and mani other and cast them down at jesu feet and he heal them insomuch that the multitud wonder when thei saw the dumb to speak the maim to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and thei glorifi the god of israel then jesu call hi discipl unto him and said i have compass on the multitud becaus thei continu with me now three dai and have noth to eat and i will not send them awai fast lest thei faint in the wai and hi discipl sai unto him whenc should we have so much bread in the wilder as to fill so great a multitud and jesu saith unto them how mani loav have ye and thei said seven and a few littl fish and he command the multitud to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loav and the fish and gave thank and brake them and gave to hi discipl and the discipl to the multitud and thei did all eat and were fill and thei took up of the broken meat that wa left seven basket full and thei that did eat were four thousand men besid women and children and he sent awai the multitud and took ship and came into the coast of magdala the pharise also with the sadduce came and tempt desir him that he would shew them a sign from heaven he answer and said unto them when it is even ye sai it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morn it will be foul weather to dai for the sky is red and lower o ye hypocrit ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the sign of the time a wick and adulter gener seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jona and he left them and depart and when hi discipl were come to the other side thei had forgotten to take bread then jesu said unto them take heed and bewar of the leaven of the pharise and of the sadduce and thei reason among themselv sai it is becaus we have taken no bread which when jesu perceiv he said unto them o ye of littl faith why reason ye among yourselv becaus ye have brought no bread do ye not yet understand neither rememb the five loav of the five thousand and how mani basket ye took up neither the seven loav of the four thousand and how mani basket ye took up how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concern bread that ye should bewar of the leaven of the pharise and of the sadduce then understood thei how that he bade them not bewar of the leaven of bread but of the doctrin of the pharise and of the sadduce when jesu came into the coast of caesarea philippi he ask hi discipl sai whom do men sai that i the son of man am and thei said some sai that thou art john the baptist some elia and other jeremia or on of the prophet he saith unto them but whom sai ye that i am and simon peter answer and said thou art the christ the son of the live god and jesu answer and said unto him bless art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not reveal it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i sai also unto thee that thou art peter and upon thi rock i will build my church and the gate of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the kei of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoev thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoev thou shalt loos on earth shall be loos in heaven then charg he hi discipl that thei should tell no man that he wa jesu the christ from that time forth began jesu to shew unto hi discipl how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer mani thing of the elder and chief priest and scribe and be kill and be rais again the third dai then peter took him and began to rebuk him sai be it far from thee lord thi shall not be unto thee but he turn and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offenc unto me for thou savourest not the thing that be of god but those that be of men then said jesu unto hi discipl if ani man will come after me let him deni himself and take up hi cross and follow me for whosoev will save hi life shall lose it and whosoev will lose hi life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profit if he shall gain the whole world and lose hi own soul or what shall a man give in exchang for hi soul for the son of man shall come in the glori of hi father with hi angel and then he shall reward everi man accord to hi work verili i sai unto you there be some stand here which shall not tast of death till thei see the son of man come in hi kingdom and after six dai jesu taketh peter jame and john hi brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and wa transfigur befor them and hi face did shine as the sun and hi raiment wa white as the light and behold there appear unto them mose and elia talk with him then answer peter and said unto jesu lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacl on for thee and on for mose and on for elia while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadow them and behold a voic out of the cloud which said thi is my belov son in whom i am well pleas hear ye him and when the discipl heard it thei fell on their face and were sore afraid and jesu came and touch them and said aris and be not afraid and when thei had lift up their ey thei saw no man save jesu onli and as thei came down from the mountain jesu charg them sai tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and hi discipl ask him sai why then sai the scribe that elia must first come and jesu answer and said unto them elia truli shall first come and restor all thing but i sai unto you that elia is come alreadi and thei knew him not but have done unto him whatsoev thei list likewis shall also the son of man suffer of them then the discipl understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist and when thei were come to the multitud there came to him a certain man kneel down to him and sai lord have merci on my son for he is lunatick and sore vex for ofttim he falleth into the fire and oft into the water and i brought him to thy discipl and thei could not cure him then jesu answer and said o faithless and pervers gener how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me and jesu rebuk the devil and he depart out of him and the child wa cure from that veri hour then came the discipl to jesu apart and said why could not we cast him out and jesu said unto them becaus of your unbelief for verili i sai unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall sai unto thi mountain remov henc to yonder place and it shall remov and noth shall be imposs unto you howbeit thi kind goeth not out but by prayer and fast and while thei abod in galile jesu said unto them the son of man shall be betrai into the hand of men and thei shall kill him and the third dai he shall be rais again and thei were exceed sorri and when thei were come to capernaum thei that receiv tribut monei came to peter and said doth not your master pai tribut he saith ye and when he wa come into the hous jesu prevent him sai what thinkest thou simon of whom do the king of the earth take custom or tribut of their own children or of stranger peter saith unto him of stranger jesu saith unto him then ar the children free notwithstand lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast open hi mouth thou shalt find a piec of monei that take and give unto them for me and thee at the same time came the discipl unto jesu sai who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesu call a littl child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verili i sai unto you except ye be convert and becom as littl children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoev therefor shall humbl himself as thi littl child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receiv on such littl child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend on of these littl on which believ in me it were better for him that a millston were hang about hi neck and that he were drown in the depth of the sea woe unto the world becaus of offenc for it must need be that offenc come but woe to that man by whom the offenc cometh wherefor if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maim rather than have two hand or two feet to be cast into everlast fire and if thine ey offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with on ey rather than have two ey to be cast into hell fire take heed that ye despis not on of these littl on for i sai unto you that in heaven their angel do alwai behold the face of my father which is in heaven for the son of man is come to save that which wa lost how think ye if a man have an hundr sheep and on of them be gone astrai doth he not leav the nineti and nine and goeth into the mountain and seeketh that which is gone astrai and if so be that he find it verili i sai unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the nineti and nine which went not astrai even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that on of these littl on should perish moreov if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him hi fault between thee and him alon if he shall hear thee thou hast gain thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee on or two more that in the mouth of two or three wit everi word mai be establish and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican verili i sai unto you whatsoev ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoev ye shall loos on earth shall be loos in heaven again i sai unto you that if two of you shall agre on earth as touch ani thing that thei shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three ar gather togeth in my name there am i in the midst of them then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgiv him till seven time jesu saith unto him i sai not unto thee until seven time but until seventi time seven therefor is the kingdom of heaven liken unto a certain king which would take account of hi servant and when he had begun to reckon on wa brought unto him which ow him ten thousand talent but forasmuch as he had not to pai hi lord command him to be sold and hi wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefor fell down and worship him sai lord have patienc with me and i will pai thee all then the lord of that servant wa move with compass and loos him and forgav him the debt but the same servant went out and found on of hi fellowserv which ow him an hundr penc and he laid hand on him and took him by the throat sai pai me that thou owest and hi fellowserv fell down at hi feet and besought him sai have patienc with me and i will pai thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pai the debt so when hi fellowserv saw what wa done thei were veri sorri and came and told unto their lord all that wa done then hi lord after that he had call him said unto him o thou wick servant i forgav thee all that debt becaus thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compass on thy fellowserv even as i had piti on thee and hi lord wa wroth and deliv him to the tormentor till he should pai all that wa due unto him so likewis shall my heavenli father do also unto you if ye from your heart forgiv not everi on hi brother their trespass and it came to pass that when jesu had finish these sai he depart from galile and came into the coast of judaea beyond jordan and great multitud follow him and he heal them there the pharise also came unto him tempt him and sai unto him is it law for a man to put awai hi wife for everi caus and he answer and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the begin made them male and femal and said for thi caus shall a man leav father and mother and shall cleav to hi wife and thei twain shall be on flesh wherefor thei ar no more twain but on flesh what therefor god hath join togeth let not man put asund thei sai unto him why did mose then command to give a write of divorc and to put her awai he saith unto them mose becaus of the hard of your heart suffer you to put awai your wive but from the begin it wa not so and i sai unto you whosoev shall put awai hi wife except it be for fornic and shall marri anoth committeth adulteri and whoso marrieth her which is put awai doth commit adulteri hi discipl sai unto him if the case of the man be so with hi wife it is not good to marri but he said unto them all men cannot receiv thi sai save thei to whom it is given for there ar some eunuch which were so born from their mother womb and there ar some eunuch which were made eunuch of men and there be eunuch which have made themselv eunuch for the kingdom of heaven sake he that is abl to receiv it let him receiv it then were there brought unto him littl children that he should put hi hand on them and prai and the discipl rebuk them but jesu said suffer littl children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid hi hand on them and depart thenc and behold on came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i mai have etern life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but on that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the command he saith unto him which jesu said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adulteri thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear fals wit honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself the young man saith unto him all these thing have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet jesu said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasur in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that sai he went awai sorrow for he had great possess then said jesu unto hi discipl verili i sai unto you that a rich man shall hardli enter into the kingdom of heaven and again i sai unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the ey of a needl than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god when hi discipl heard it thei were exceedingli amaz sai who then can be save but jesu beheld them and said unto them with men thi is imposs but with god all thing ar possibl then answer peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and follow thee what shall we have therefor and jesu said unto them verili i sai unto you that ye which have follow me in the regener when the son of man shall sit in the throne of hi glori ye also shall sit upon twelv throne judg the twelv tribe of israel and everi on that hath forsaken hous or brethren or sister or father or mother or wife or children or land for my name sake shall receiv an hundredfold and shall inherit everlast life but mani that ar first shall be last and the last shall be first for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an household which went out earli in the morn to hire labour into hi vineyard and when he had agre with the labour for a penni a dai he sent them into hi vineyard and he went out about the third hour and saw other stand idl in the marketplac and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoev is right i will give you and thei went their wai again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewis and about the eleventh hour he went out and found other stand idl and saith unto them why stand ye here all the dai idl thei sai unto him becaus no man hath hire us he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoev is right that shall ye receiv so when even wa come the lord of the vineyard saith unto hi steward call the labour and give them their hire begin from the last unto the first and when thei came that were hire about the eleventh hour thei receiv everi man a penni but when the first came thei suppos that thei should have receiv more and thei likewis receiv everi man a penni and when thei had receiv it thei murmur against the goodman of the hous sai these last have wrought but on hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have born the burden and heat of the dai but he answer on of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agre with me for a penni take that thine is and go thy wai i will give unto thi last even as unto thee is it not law for me to do what i will with mine own is thine ey evil becaus i am good so the last shall be first and the first last for mani be call but few chosen and jesu go up to jerusalem took the twelv discipl apart in the wai and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrai unto the chief priest and unto the scribe and thei shall condemn him to death and shall deliv him to the gentil to mock and to scourg and to crucifi him and the third dai he shall rise again then came to him the mother of zebede children with her son worship him and desir a certain thing of him and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant that these my two son mai sit the on on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom but jesu answer and said ye know not what ye ask ar ye abl to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptiz with the baptism that i am baptiz with thei sai unto him we ar abl and he saith unto them ye shall drink inde of my cup and be baptiz with the baptism that i am baptiz with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepar of my father and when the ten heard it thei were move with indign against the two brethren but jesu call them unto him and said ye know that the princ of the gentil exercis dominion over them and thei that ar great exercis author upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoev will be great among you let him be your minist and whosoev will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be minist unto but to minist and to give hi life a ransom for mani and as thei depart from jericho a great multitud follow him and behold two blind men sit by the wai side when thei heard that jesu pass by cri out sai have merci on us o lord thou son of david and the multitud rebuk them becaus thei should hold their peac but thei cri the more sai have merci on us o lord thou son of david and jesu stood still and call them and said what will ye that i shall do unto you thei sai unto him lord that our ey mai be open so jesu had compass on them and touch their ey and immedi their ey receiv sight and thei follow him and when thei drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphag unto the mount of oliv then sent jesu two discipl sai unto them go into the villag over against you and straightwai ye shall find an ass ti and a colt with her loos them and bring them unto me and if ani man sai ought unto you ye shall sai the lord hath need of them and straightwai he will send them all thi wa done that it might be fulfil which wa spoken by the prophet sai tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sit upon an ass and a colt the foal of an ass and the discipl went and did as jesu command them and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their cloth and thei set him thereon and a veri great multitud spread their garment in the wai other cut down branch from the tree and straw them in the wai and the multitud that went befor and that follow cri sai hosanna to the son of david bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he wa come into jerusalem all the citi wa move sai who is thi and the multitud said thi is jesu the prophet of nazareth of galile and jesu went into the templ of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the templ and overthrew the tabl of the moneychang and the seat of them that sold dove and said unto them it is written my hous shall be call the hous of prayer but ye have made it a den of thiev and the blind and the lame came to him in the templ and he heal them and when the chief priest and scribe saw the wonder thing that he did and the children cry in the templ and sai hosanna to the son of david thei were sore displeas and said unto him hearest thou what these sai and jesu saith unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babe and suckl thou hast perfect prais and he left them and went out of the citi into bethani and he lodg there now in the morn as he return into the citi he hunger and when he saw a fig tree in the wai he came to it and found noth thereon but leav onli and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever and present the fig tree wither awai and when the discipl saw it thei marvel sai how soon is the fig tree wither awai jesu answer and said unto them verili i sai unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not onli do thi which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall sai unto thi mountain be thou remov and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all thing whatsoev ye shall ask in prayer believ ye shall receiv and when he wa come into the templ the chief priest and the elder of the peopl came unto him as he wa teach and said by what author doest thou these thing and who gave thee thi author and jesu answer and said unto them i also will ask you on thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you by what author i do these thing the baptism of john whenc wa it from heaven or of men and thei reason with themselv sai if we shall sai from heaven he will sai unto us why did ye not then believ him but if we shall sai of men we fear the peopl for all hold john as a prophet and thei answer jesu and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell i you by what author i do these thing but what think ye a certain man had two son and he came to the first and said son go work to dai in my vineyard he answer and said i will not but afterward he repent and went and he came to the second and said likewis and he answer and said i go sir and went not whether of them twain did the will of hi father thei sai unto him the first jesu saith unto them verili i sai unto you that the publican and the harlot go into the kingdom of god befor you for john came unto you in the wai of righteous and ye believ him not but the publican and the harlot believ him and ye when ye had seen it repent not afterward that ye might believ him hear anoth parabl there wa a certain household which plant a vineyard and hedg it round about and dig a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far countri and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent hi servant to the husbandmen that thei might receiv the fruit of it and the husbandmen took hi servant and beat on and kill anoth and stone anoth again he sent other servant more than the first and thei did unto them likewis but last of all he sent unto them hi son sai thei will rever my son but when the husbandmen saw the son thei said among themselv thi is the heir come let us kill him and let us seiz on hi inherit and thei caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him when the lord therefor of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen thei sai unto him he will miser destroi those wick men and will let out hi vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruit in their season jesu saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptur the stone which the builder reject the same is becom the head of the corner thi is the lord do and it is marvel in our ey therefor sai i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bring forth the fruit thereof and whosoev shall fall on thi stone shall be broken but on whomsoev it shall fall it will grind him to powder and when the chief priest and pharise had heard hi parabl thei perceiv that he spake of them but when thei sought to lai hand on him thei fear the multitud becaus thei took him for a prophet and jesu answer and spake unto them again by parabl and said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriag for hi son and sent forth hi servant to call them that were bidden to the wed and thei would not come again he sent forth other servant sai tell them which ar bidden behold i have prepar my dinner my oxen and my fatl ar kill and all thing ar readi come unto the marriag but thei made light of it and went their wai on to hi farm anoth to hi merchandis and the remnant took hi servant and entreat them spitefulli and slew them but when the king heard thereof he wa wroth and he sent forth hi armi and destroi those murder and burn up their citi then saith he to hi servant the wed is readi but thei which were bidden were not worthi go ye therefor into the highwai and as mani as ye shall find bid to the marriag so those servant went out into the highwai and gather togeth all as mani as thei found both bad and good and the wed wa furnish with guest and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there a man which had not on a wed garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not have a wed garment and he wa speechless then said the king to the servant bind him hand and foot and take him awai and cast him into outer dark there shall be weep and gnash of teeth for mani ar call but few ar chosen then went the pharise and took counsel how thei might entangl him in hi talk and thei sent out unto him their discipl with the herodian sai master we know that thou art true and teachest the wai of god in truth neither carest thou for ani man for thou regardest not the person of men tell us therefor what thinkest thou is it law to give tribut unto caesar or not but jesu perceiv their wicked and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrit shew me the tribut monei and thei brought unto him a penni and he saith unto them whose is thi imag and superscript thei sai unto him caesar then saith he unto them render therefor unto caesar the thing which ar caesar and unto god the thing that ar god when thei had heard these word thei marvel and left him and went their wai the same dai came to him the sadduce which sai that there is no resurrect and ask him sai master mose said if a man die have no children hi brother shall marri hi wife and rais up seed unto hi brother now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had marri a wife deceas and have no issu left hi wife unto hi brother likewis the second also and the third unto the seventh and last of all the woman di also therefor in the resurrect whose wife shall she be of the seven for thei all had her jesu answer and said unto them ye do err not know the scriptur nor the power of god for in the resurrect thei neither marri nor ar given in marriag but ar as the angel of god in heaven but as touch the resurrect of the dead have ye not read that which wa spoken unto you by god sai i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the live and when the multitud heard thi thei were astonish at hi doctrin but when the pharise had heard that he had put the sadduce to silenc thei were gather togeth then on of them which wa a lawyer ask him a question tempt him and sai master which is the great command in the law jesu said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind thi is the first and great command and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself on these two command hang all the law and the prophet while the pharise were gather togeth jesu ask them sai what think ye of christ whose son is he thei sai unto him the son of david he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord sai the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemi thy footstool if david then call him lord how is he hi son and no man wa abl to answer him a word neither durst ani man from that dai forth ask him ani more question then spake jesu to the multitud and to hi discipl sai the scribe and the pharise sit in mose seat all therefor whatsoev thei bid you observ that observ and do but do not ye after their work for thei sai and do not for thei bind heavi burden and grievou to be born and lai them on men shoulder but thei themselv will not move them with on of their finger but all their work thei do for to be seen of men thei make broad their phylacteri and enlarg the border of their garment and love the uppermost room at feast and the chief seat in the synagogu and greet in the market and to be call of men rabbi rabbi but be not ye call rabbi for on is your master even christ and all ye ar brethren and call no man your

of four and when thei could not come nigh unto him for the press thei uncov the roof where he wa and when thei had broken it up thei let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsi lai when jesu saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsi son thy sin be forgiven thee but there wa certain of the scribe sit there and reason in their heart why doth thi man thu speak blasphemi who can forgiv sin but god onli and immedi when jesu perceiv in hi spirit that thei so reason within themselv he said unto them why reason ye these thing in your heart whether is it easier to sai to the sick of the palsi thy sin be forgiven thee or to sai aris and take up thy bed and walk but that ye mai know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgiv sin he saith to the sick of the palsi i sai unto thee aris and take up thy bed and go thy wai into thine hous and immedi he aros took up the bed and went forth befor them all insomuch that thei were all amaz and glorifi god sai we never saw it on thi fashion and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitud resort unto him and he taught them and as he pass by he saw levi the son of alphaeu sit at the receipt of custom and said unto him follow me and he aros and follow him and it came to pass that as jesu sat at meat in hi hous mani publican and sinner sat also togeth with jesu and hi discipl for there were mani and thei follow him and when the scribe and pharise saw him eat with publican and sinner thei said unto hi discipl how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publican and sinner when jesu heard it he saith unto them thei that ar whole have no need of the physician but thei that ar sick i came not to call the righteou but sinner to repent and the discipl of john and of the pharise us to fast and thei come and sai unto him why do the discipl of john and of the pharise fast but thy discipl fast not and jesu said unto them can the children of the bridechamb fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as thei have the bridegroom with them thei cannot fast but the dai will come when the bridegroom shall be taken awai from them and then shall thei fast in those dai no man also seweth a piec of new cloth on an old garment els the new piec that fill it up taketh awai from the old and the rent is made wors and no man putteth new wine into old bottl els the new wine doth burst the bottl and the wine is spill and the bottl will be mar but new wine must be put into new bottl and it came to pass that he went through the corn field on the sabbath dai and hi discipl began as thei went to pluck the ear of corn and the pharise said unto him behold why do thei on the sabbath dai that which is not law and he said unto them have ye never read what david did when he had need and wa an hungr he and thei that were with him how he went into the hous of god in the dai of abiathar the high priest and did eat the shewbread which is not law to eat but for the priest and gave also to them which were with him and he said unto them the sabbath wa made for man and not man for the sabbath therefor the son of man is lord also of the sabbath and he enter again into the synagogu and there wa a man there which had a wither hand and thei watch him whether he would heal him on the sabbath dai that thei might accus him and he saith unto the man which had the wither hand stand forth and he saith unto them is it law to do good on the sabbath dai or to do evil to save life or to kill but thei held their peac and when he had look round about on them with anger be griev for the hard of their heart he saith unto the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretch it out and hi hand wa restor whole as the other and the pharise went forth and straightwai took counsel with the herodian against him how thei might destroi him but jesu withdrew himself with hi discipl to the sea and a great multitud from galile follow him and from judaea and from jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan and thei about tyre and sidon a great multitud when thei had heard what great thing he did came unto him and he spake to hi discipl that a small ship should wait on him becaus of the multitud lest thei should throng him for he had heal mani insomuch that thei press upon him for to touch him as mani as had plagu and unclean spirit when thei saw him fell down befor him and cri sai thou art the son of god and he straitli charg them that thei should not make him known and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and thei came unto him and he ordain twelv that thei should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and to have power to heal sick and to cast out devil and simon he surnam peter and jame the son of zebede and john the brother of jame and he surnam them boanerg which is the son of thunder and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thoma and jame the son of alphaeu and thaddaeu and simon the canaanit and juda iscariot which also betrai him and thei went into an hous and the multitud cometh togeth again so that thei could not so much as eat bread and when hi friend heard of it thei went out to lai hold on him for thei said he is besid himself and the scribe which came down from jerusalem said he hath beelzebub and by the princ of the devil casteth he out devil and he call them unto him and said unto them in parabl how can satan cast out satan and if a kingdom be divid against itself that kingdom cannot stand and if a hous be divid against itself that hous cannot stand and if satan rise up against himself and be divid he cannot stand but hath an end no man can enter into a strong man hous and spoil hi good except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil hi hous verili i sai unto you all sin shall be forgiven unto the son of men and blasphemi wherewith soever thei shall blasphem but he that shall blasphem against the holi ghost hath never forgiv but is in danger of etern damnat becaus thei said he hath an unclean spirit there came then hi brethren and hi mother and stand without sent unto him call him and the multitud sat about him and thei said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee and he answer them sai who is my mother or my brethren and he look round about on them which sat about him and said behold my mother and my brethren for whosoev shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother and he began again to teach by the sea side and there wa gather unto him a great multitud so that he enter into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitud wa by the sea on the land and he taught them mani thing by parabl and said unto them in hi doctrin hearken behold there went out a sower to sow and it came to pass as he sow some fell by the wai side and the fowl of the air came and devour it up and some fell on stoni ground where it had not much earth and immedi it sprang up becaus it had no depth of earth but when the sun wa up it wa scorch and becaus it had no root it wither awai and some fell among thorn and the thorn grew up and choke it and it yield no fruit and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increas and brought forth some thirti and some sixti and some an hundr and he said unto them he that hath ear to hear let him hear and when he wa alon thei that were about him with the twelv ask of him the parabl and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteri of the kingdom of god but unto them that ar without all these thing ar done in parabl that see thei mai see and not perceiv and hear thei mai hear and not understand lest at ani time thei should be convert and their sin should be forgiven them and he said unto them know ye not thi parabl and how then will ye know all parabl the sower soweth the word and these ar thei by the wai side where the word is sown but when thei have heard satan cometh immedi and taketh awai the word that wa sown in their heart and these ar thei likewis which ar sown on stoni ground who when thei have heard the word immedi receiv it with glad and have no root in themselv and so endur but for a time afterward when afflict or persecut ariseth for the word sake immedi thei ar offend and these ar thei which ar sown among thorn such as hear the word and the care of thi world and the deceit of rich and the lust of other thing enter in choke the word and it becometh unfruit and these ar thei which ar sown on good ground such as hear the word and receiv it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixti and some an hundr and he said unto them is a candl brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick for there is noth hid which shall not be manifest neither wa ani thing kept secret but that it should come abroad if ani man have ear to hear let him hear and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measur ye mete it shall be measur to you and unto you that hear shall more be given for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hath and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and dai and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immedi he putteth in the sickl becaus the harvest is come and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with what comparison shall we compar it it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seed that be in the earth but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herb and shooteth out great branch so that the fowl of the air mai lodg under the shadow of it and with mani such parabl spake he the word unto them as thei were abl to hear it but without a parabl spake he not unto them and when thei were alon he expound all thing to hi discipl and the same dai when the even wa come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when thei had sent awai the multitud thei took him even as he wa in the ship and there were also with him other littl ship and there aros a great storm of wind and the wave beat into the ship so that it wa now full and he wa in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and thei awak him and sai unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he aros and rebuk the wind and said unto the sea peac be still and the wind ceas and there wa a great calm and he said unto them why ar ye so fear how is it that ye have no faith and thei fear exceedingli and said on to anoth what manner of man is thi that even the wind and the sea obei him and thei came over unto the other side of the sea into the countri of the gadaren and when he wa come out of the ship immedi there met him out of the tomb a man with an unclean spirit who had hi dwell among the tomb and no man could bind him no not with chain becaus that he had been often bound with fetter and chain and the chain had been pluck asund by him and the fetter broken in piec neither could ani man tame him and alwai night and dai he wa in the mountain and in the tomb cry and cut himself with stone but when he saw jesu afar off he ran and worship him and cri with a loud voic and said what have i to do with thee jesu thou son of the most high god i adjur thee by god that thou torment me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he ask him what is thy name and he answer sai my name is legion for we ar mani and he besought him much that he would not send them awai out of the countri now there wa there nigh unto the mountain a great herd of swine feed and all the devil besought him sai send us into the swine that we mai enter into them and forthwith jesu gave them leav and the unclean spirit went out and enter into the swine and the herd ran violent down a steep place into the sea thei were about two thousand and were choke in the sea and thei that fed the swine fled and told it in the citi and in the countri and thei went out to see what it wa that wa done and thei come to jesu and see him that wa possess with the devil and had the legion sit and cloth and in hi right mind and thei were afraid and thei that saw it told them how it befel to him that wa possess with the devil and also concern the swine and thei began to prai him to depart out of their coast and when he wa come into the ship he that had been possess with the devil prai him that he might be with him howbeit jesu suffer him not but saith unto him go home to thy friend and tell them how great thing the lord hath done for thee and hath had compass on thee and he depart and began to publish in decapoli how great thing jesu had done for him and all men did marvel and when jesu wa pass over again by ship unto the other side much peopl gather unto him and he wa nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh on of the ruler of the synagogu jairu by name and when he saw him he fell at hi feet and besought him greatli sai my littl daughter lieth at the point of death i prai thee come and lai thy hand on her that she mai be heal and she shall live and jesu went with him and much peopl follow him and throng him and a certain woman which had an issu of blood twelv year and had suffer mani thing of mani physician and had spent all that she had and wa noth better but rather grew wors when she had heard of jesu came in the press behind and touch hi garment for she said if i mai touch but hi cloth i shall be whole and straightwai the fountain of her blood wa dri up and she felt in her bodi that she wa heal of that plagu and jesu immedi know in himself that virtu had gone out of him turn him about in the press and said who touch my cloth and hi discipl said unto him thou seest the multitud throng thee and sayest thou who touch me and he look round about to see her that had done thi thing but the woman fear and trembl know what wa done in her came and fell down befor him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peac and be whole of thy plagu while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogu hous certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the master ani further as soon as jesu heard the word that wa spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogu be not afraid onli believ and he suffer no man to follow him save peter and jame and john the brother of jame and he cometh to the hous of the ruler of the synagogu and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wail greatli and when he wa come in he saith unto them why make ye thi ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth and thei laugh him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entereth in where the damsel wa ly and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha cumi which is be interpret damsel i sai unto thee aris and straightwai the damsel aros and walk for she wa of the ag of twelv year and thei were astonish with a great astonish and he charg them straitli that no man should know it and command that someth should be given her to eat and he went out from thenc and came into hi own countri and hi discipl follow him and when the sabbath dai wa come he began to teach in the synagogu and mani hear him were astonish sai from whenc hath thi man these thing and what wisdom is thi which is given unto him that even such mighti work ar wrought by hi hand is not thi the carpent the son of mari the brother of jame and jose and of juda and simon and ar not hi sister here with us and thei were offend at him but jesu said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in hi own countri and among hi own kin and in hi own hous and he could there do no mighti work save that he laid hi hand upon a few sick folk and heal them and he marvel becaus of their unbelief and he went round about the villag teach and he call unto him the twelv and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirit and command them that thei should take noth for their journei save a staff onli no scrip no bread no monei in their purs but be shod with sandal and not put on two coat and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into an hous there abid till ye depart from that place and whosoev shall not receiv you nor hear you when ye depart thenc shake off the dust under your feet for a testimoni against them verili i sai unto you it shall be more toler for sodom and gomorrha in the dai of judgment than for that citi and thei went out and preach that men should repent and thei cast out mani devil and anoint with oil mani that were sick and heal them and king herod heard of him for hi name wa spread abroad and he said that john the baptist wa risen from the dead and therefor mighti work do shew forth themselv in him other said that it is elia and other said that it is a prophet or as on of the prophet but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i behead he is risen from the dead for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodia sake hi brother philip wife for he had marri her for john had said unto herod it is not law for thee to have thy brother wife therefor herodia had a quarrel against him and would have kill him but she could not for herod fear john know that he wa a just man and an holi and observ him and when he heard him he did mani thing and heard him gladli and when a conveni dai wa come that herod on hi birthdai made a supper to hi lord high captain and chief estat of galile and when the daughter of the said herodia came in and danc and pleas herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoev thou wilt and i will give it thee and he sware unto her whatsoev thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask and she said the head of john the baptist and she came in straightwai with hast unto the king and ask sai i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist and the king wa exceed sorri yet for hi oath sake and for their sake which sat with him he would not reject her and immedi the king sent an execution and command hi head to be brought and he went and behead him in the prison and brought hi head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother and when hi discipl heard of it thei came and took up hi corps and laid it in a tomb and the apostl gather themselv togeth unto jesu and told him all thing both what thei had done and what thei had taught and he said unto them come ye yourselv apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were mani come and go and thei had no leisur so much as to eat and thei depart into a desert place by ship privat and the peopl saw them depart and mani knew him and ran afoot thither out of all citi and outwent them and came togeth unto him and jesu when he came out saw much peopl and wa move with compass toward them becaus thei were as sheep not have a shepherd and he began to teach them mani thing and when the dai wa now far spent hi discipl came unto him and said thi is a desert place and now the time is far pass send them awai that thei mai go into the countri round about and into the villag and bui themselv bread for thei have noth to eat he answer and said unto them give ye them to eat and thei sai unto him shall we go and bui two hundr pennyworth of bread and give them to eat he saith unto them how mani loav have ye go and see and when thei knew thei sai five and two fish and he command them to make all sit down by compani upon the green grass and thei sat down in rank by hundr and by fifti and when he had taken the five loav and the two fish he look up to heaven and bless and brake the loav and gave them to hi discipl to set befor them and the two fish divid he among them all and thei did all eat and were fill and thei took up twelv basket full of the fragment and of the fish and thei that did eat of the loav were about five thousand men and straightwai he constrain hi discipl to get into the ship and to go to the other side befor unto bethsaida while he sent awai the peopl and when he had sent them awai he depart into a mountain to prai and when even wa come the ship wa in the midst of the sea and he alon on the land and he saw them toil in row for the wind wa contrari unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walk upon the sea and would have pass by them but when thei saw him walk upon the sea thei suppos it had been a spirit and cri out for thei all saw him and were troubl and immedi he talk with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceas and thei were sore amaz in themselv beyond measur and wonder for thei consid not the miracl of the loav for their heart wa harden and when thei had pass over thei came into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore and when thei were come out of the ship straightwai thei knew him and ran through that whole region round about and began to carri about in bed those that were sick where thei heard he wa and whithersoev he enter into villag or citi or countri thei laid the sick in the street and besought him that thei might touch if it were but the border of hi garment and as mani as touch him were made whole then came togeth unto him the pharise and certain of the scribe which came from jerusalem and when thei saw some of hi discipl eat bread with defil that is to

eat not and mani other thing there be which thei have receiv to hold as the wash of cup and pot brasen vessel and of tabl then the pharise and scribe ask him why walk not thy discipl accord to the tradit of the elder but eat bread with unwashen hand he answer and said unto them well hath esaia prophesi of you hypocrit as it is written thi peopl honoureth me with their lip but their heart is far from me howbeit in vain do thei worship me teach for doctrin the command of men for lai asid the command of god ye hold the tradit of men as the wash of pot and cup and mani other such like thing ye do and he said unto them full well ye reject the command of god that ye mai keep your own tradit for mose said honour thy father and thy mother and whoso curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye sai if a man shall sai to hi father or mother it is corban that is to sai a gift by whatsoev thou mightest be profit by me he shall be free and ye suffer him no more to do ought for hi father or hi mother make the word of god of none effect through your tradit which ye have deliv and mani such like thing do ye and when he had call all the peopl unto him he said unto them hearken unto me everi on of you and understand there is noth from without a man that enter into him can defil him but the thing which come out of him those ar thei that defil the man if ani man have ear to hear let him hear and when he wa enter into the hous from the peopl hi discipl ask him concern the parabl and he saith unto them ar ye so without understand also do ye not perceiv that whatsoev thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defil him becaus it entereth not into hi heart but into the belli and goeth out into the draught purg all meat and he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man for from within out of the heart of men proce evil thought adulteri fornic murder theft covet wicked deceit lascivi an evil ey blasphemi pride foolish all these evil thing come from within and defil the man and from thenc he aros and went into the border of tyre and sidon and enter into an hous and would have no man know it but he could not be hid for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at hi feet the woman wa a greek a syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but jesu said unto her let the children first be fill for it is not meet to take the children bread and to cast it unto the dog and she answer and said unto him ye lord yet the dog under the tabl eat of

thei beseech him to put hi hand upon him and he took him asid from the multitud and put hi finger into hi ear and he spit and touch hi tongu and look up to heaven he sigh and saith unto him ephphatha that is be open and straightwai hi ear were open and the string of hi tongu wa loos and he spake plain and he charg them that thei should tell no man but the more he charg them so much the more a great deal thei publish it and were beyond measur astonish sai he hath done all thing well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak in those dai the multitud be veri great and have noth to eat jesu call hi discipl unto him and saith unto them i have compass on the multitud becaus thei have now been with me three dai and have noth to eat and if i send them awai fast to their own hous thei will faint by the wai for diver of them came from far and hi discipl answer him from whenc can a man satisfi these men with bread here in the wilder and he ask them how mani loav have ye and thei said seven and he command the peopl to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loav and gave thank and brake and gave to hi discipl to set befor them and thei did set them befor the peopl and thei had a few small fish and he bless and command to set them also befor them so thei did eat and were fill and thei took up of the broken meat that wa left seven basket and thei that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them awai and straightwai he enter into a ship with hi discipl and came into the part of dalmanutha and the pharise came forth and began to question with him seek of him a sign from heaven tempt him and he sigh deepli in hi spirit and saith why doth thi gener seek after a sign verili i sai unto you there shall no sign be given unto thi gener and he left them and enter into the ship again depart to the other side now the discipl had forgotten to take bread neither had thei in the ship with them more than on loaf and he charg them sai take heed bewar of the leaven of the pharise and of the leaven of herod and thei reason among themselv sai it is becaus we have no bread and when jesu knew it he saith unto them why reason ye becaus ye have no bread perceiv ye not yet neither understand have ye your heart yet harden have ey see ye not and have ear hear ye not and do ye not rememb when i brake the five loav among five thousand how mani basket full of fragment took ye up thei sai unto him twelv and when the seven among four thousand how mani basket full of fragment took ye up and thei said seven and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand and he cometh to bethsaida and thei bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on hi ey and put hi hand upon him he ask him if he saw ought and he look up and said i see men as tree walk after that he put hi hand again upon hi ey and made him look up and he wa restor and saw everi man clearli and he sent him awai to hi hous sai neither go into the town nor tell it to ani in the town and jesu went out and hi discipl into the town of caesarea philippi and by the wai he ask hi discipl sai unto them whom do men sai that i am and thei answer john the baptist but some sai elia and other on of the prophet and he saith unto them but whom sai ye that i am and peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ and he charg them that thei should tell no man of him and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer mani thing and be reject of the elder and of the chief priest and scribe and be kill and after three dai rise again and he spake that sai openli and peter took him and began to rebuk him but when he had turn about and look on hi discipl he rebuk peter sai get thee behind me satan for thou savourest not the thing that be of god but the thing that be of men and when he had call the peopl unto him with hi discipl also he said unto them whosoev will come after me let him deni himself and take up hi cross and follow me for whosoev will save hi life shall lose it but whosoev shall lose hi life for my sake and the gospel the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose hi own soul or what shall a man give in exchang for hi soul whosoev therefor shall be asham of me and of my word in thi adulter and sin gener of him also shall the son of man be asham when he cometh in the glori of hi father with the holi angel and he said unto them verili i sai unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not tast of death till thei have seen the kingdom of god come with power and after six dai jesu taketh with him peter and jame and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselv and he wa transfigur befor them and hi raiment becam shine exceed white as snow so as no fuller on earth can white them and there appear unto them elia with mose and thei were talk with jesu and peter answer and said to jesu master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacl on for thee and on for mose and on for elia for he wist not what to sai for thei were sore afraid and there wa a cloud that overshadow them and a voic came out of the cloud sai thi is my belov son hear him and suddenli when thei had look round about thei saw no man ani more save jesu onli with themselv and as thei came down from the mountain he charg them that thei should tell no man what thing thei had seen till the son of man were risen from the dead and thei kept that sai with themselv question on with anoth what the rise from the dead should mean and thei ask him sai why sai the scribe that elia must first come and he answer and told them elia verili cometh first and restoreth all thing and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer mani thing and be set at nought but i sai unto you that elia is inde come and thei have done unto him whatsoev thei list as it is written of him and when he came to hi discipl he saw a great multitud about them and the scribe question with them and straightwai all the peopl when thei beheld him were greatli amaz and run to him salut him and he ask the scribe what question ye with them and on of the multitud answer and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoev he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with hi teeth and pineth awai and i spake to thy discipl that thei should cast him out and thei could not he answereth him and saith o faithless gener how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me and thei brought him unto him and when he saw him straightwai the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallow foam and he ask hi father how long is it ago sinc thi came unto him and he said of a child and ofttim it hath cast him into the fire and into the water to destroi him but if thou canst do ani thing have compass on us and help us jesu said unto him if thou canst believ all thing ar possibl to him that believeth and straightwai the father of the child cri out and said with tear lord i believ help thou mine unbelief when jesu saw that the peopl came run togeth he rebuk the foul spirit sai unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charg thee come out of him and enter no more into him and the spirit cri and rent him sore and came out of him and he wa as on dead insomuch that mani said he is dead but jesu took him by the hand and lift him up and he aros and when he wa come into the hous hi discipl ask him privat why could not we cast him out and he said unto them thi kind can come forth by noth but by prayer and fast and thei depart thenc and pass through galile and he would not that ani man should know it for he taught hi discipl and said unto them the son of man is deliv into the hand of men and thei shall kill him and after that he is kill he shall rise the third dai but thei understood not that sai and were afraid to ask him and he came to capernaum and be in the hous he ask them what wa it that ye disput among yourselv by the wai but thei held their peac for by the wai thei had disput among themselv who should be the greatest and he sat down and call the twelv and saith unto them if ani man desir to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in hi arm he said unto them whosoev shall receiv on of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoev shall receiv me receiveth not me but him that sent me and john answer him sai master we saw on cast out devil in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him becaus he followeth not us but jesu said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracl in my name that can lightli speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part for whosoev shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name becaus ye belong to christ verili i sai unto you he shall not lose hi reward and whosoev shall offend on of these littl on that believ in me it is better for him that a millston were hang about hi neck and he were cast into the sea and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maim than have two hand to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quench where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quench and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than have two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quench where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quench and if thine ey offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with on ey than have two ey to be cast into hell fire where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quench for everi on shall be salt with fire and everi sacrific shall be salt with salt salt is good but if the salt have lost hi salt wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselv and have peac on with anoth and he aros from thenc and cometh into the coast of judaea by the farther side of jordan and the peopl resort unto him again and as he wa wont he taught them again and the pharise came to him and ask him is it law for a man to put awai hi wife tempt him and he answer and said unto them what did mose command you and thei said mose suffer to write a bill of divorc and to put her awai and jesu answer and said unto them for the hard of your heart he wrote you thi precept but from the begin of the creation god made them male and femal for thi caus shall a man leav hi father and mother and cleav to hi wife and thei twain shall be on flesh so then thei ar no more twain but on flesh what therefor god hath join togeth let not man put asund and in the hous hi discipl ask him again of the same matter and he saith unto them whosoev shall put awai hi wife and marri anoth committeth adulteri against her and if a woman shall put awai her husband and be marri to anoth she committeth adulteri and thei brought young children to him that he should touch them and hi discipl rebuk those that brought them but when jesu saw it he wa much displeas and said unto them suffer the littl children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god verili i sai unto you whosoev shall not receiv the kingdom of god as a littl child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in hi arm put hi hand upon them and bless them and when he wa gone forth into the wai there came on run and kneel to him and ask him good master what shall i do that i mai inherit etern life and jesu said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but on that is god thou knowest the command do not commit adulteri do not kill do not steal do not bear fals wit defraud not honour thy father and mother and he answer and said unto him master all these have i observ from my youth then jesu behold him love him and said unto him on thing thou lackest go thy wai sell whatsoev thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasur in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he wa sad at that sai and went awai griev for he had great possess and jesu look round about and saith unto hi discipl how hardli shall thei that have rich enter into the kingdom of god and the discipl were astonish at hi word but jesu answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in rich to enter into the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through the ey of a needl than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and thei were astonish out of measur sai among themselv who then can be save and jesu look upon them saith with men it is imposs but not with god for with god all thing ar possibl then peter began to sai unto him lo we have left all and have follow thee and jesu answer and said verili i sai unto you there is no man that hath left hous or brethren or sister or father or mother or wife or children or land for my sake and the gospel but he shall receiv an hundredfold now in thi time hous and brethren and sister and mother and children and land with persecut and in the world to come etern life but mani that ar first shall be last and the last first and thei were in the wai go up to jerusalem and jesu went befor them and thei were amaz and as thei follow thei were afraid and he took again the twelv and began to tell them what thing should happen unto him sai behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be deliv unto the chief priest and unto the scribe and thei shall condemn him to death and shall deliv him to the gentil and thei shall mock him and shall scourg him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third dai he shall rise again and jame and john the son of zebede come unto him sai master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoev we shall desir and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you thei said unto him grant unto us that we mai sit on on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glori but jesu said unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptiz with the baptism that i am baptiz with and thei said unto him we can and jesu said unto them ye shall inde drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptiz withal shall ye be baptiz but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepar and when the ten heard it thei began to be much displeas with jame and john but jesu call them to him and saith unto them ye know that thei which ar account to rule over the gentil exercis lordship over them and their great on exercis author upon them but so shall it not be among you but whosoev will be great among you shall be your minist and whosoev of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of man came not to be minist unto but to minist and to give hi life a ransom for mani and thei came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with hi discipl and a great number of peopl blind bartimaeu the son of timaeu sat by the highwai side beg and when he heard that it wa jesu of nazareth he began to cry out and sai jesu thou son of david have merci on me and mani charg him that he should hold hi peac but he cri the more a great deal thou son of david have merci on me and jesu stood still and command him to be call and thei call the blind man sai unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he cast awai hi garment rose and came to jesu and jesu answer and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receiv my sight and jesu said unto him go thy wai thy faith hath made thee whole and immedi he receiv hi sight and follow jesu in the wai and when thei came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphag and bethani at the mount of oliv he sendeth forth two of hi discipl and saith unto them go your wai into the villag over against you and as soon as ye be enter into it ye shall find a colt ti whereon never man sat loos him and bring him and if ani man sai unto you why do ye thi sai ye that the lord hath need of him and straightwai he will send him hither and thei went their wai and found the colt ti by the door without in a place where two wai met and thei loos him and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loos the colt and thei said unto them even as jesu had command and thei let them go and thei brought the colt to jesu and cast their garment on him and he sat upon him and mani spread their garment in the wai and other cut down branch off the tree and straw them in the wai and thei that went befor and thei that follow cri sai hosanna bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord bless be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and jesu enter into jerusalem and into the templ and when he had look round about upon all thing and now the eventid wa come he went out unto bethani with the twelv and on the morrow when thei were come from bethani he wa hungri and see a fig tree afar off have leav he came if hapli he might find ani thing thereon and when he came to it he found noth but leav for the time of fig wa not yet and jesu answer and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereaft for ever and hi discipl heard it and thei come to jerusalem and jesu went into the templ and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the templ and overthrew the tabl of the moneychang and the seat of them that sold dove and would not suffer that ani man should carri ani vessel through the templ and he taught sai unto them is it not written my hous shall be call of all nation the hous of prayer but ye have made it a den of thiev and the scribe and chief priest heard it and sought how thei might destroi him for thei fear him becaus all the peopl wa astonish at hi doctrin and when even wa come he went out of the citi and in the morn as thei pass by thei saw the fig tree dri up from the root and peter call to remembr saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is wither awai and jesu answer saith unto them have faith in god for verili i sai unto you that whosoev shall sai unto thi mountain be thou remov and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in hi heart but shall believ that those thing which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoev he saith therefor i sai unto you what thing soever ye desir when ye prai believ that ye receiv them and ye shall have them and when ye stand prai forgiv if ye have ought against ani that your father also which is in heaven mai forgiv you your trespass but if ye do not forgiv neither will your father which is in heaven forgiv your trespass and thei come again to jerusalem and as he wa walk in the templ there come to him the chief priest and the scribe and the elder and sai unto him by what author doest thou these thing and who gave thee thi author to do these thing and jesu answer and said unto them i will also ask of you on question and answer me and i will tell you by what author i do these thing the baptism of john wa it from heaven or of men answer me and thei reason with themselv sai if we shall sai from heaven he will sai why then did ye not believ him but if we shall sai of men thei fear the peopl for all men count john that he wa a prophet inde and thei answer and said unto jesu we cannot tell and jesu answer saith unto them neither do i tell you by what author i do these thing and he began to speak unto them by parabl a certain man plant a vineyard and set an hedg about it and dig a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far countri and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receiv from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard and thei caught him and beat him and sent him awai empti and again he sent unto them anoth servant and at him thei cast stone and wound him in the head and sent him awai shamefulli handl and again he sent anoth and him thei kill and mani other beat some and kill some have yet therefor on son hi wellbelov he sent him also last unto them sai thei will rever my son but those husbandmen said among themselv thi is the heir come let us kill him and the inherit shall be our and thei took him and kill him and cast him out of the vineyard what shall therefor the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroi the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto other and have ye not read thi scriptur the stone which the builder reject is becom the head of the corner thi wa the lord do and it is marvel in our ey and thei sought to lai hold on him but fear the peopl for thei knew that he had spoken the parabl against them and thei left him and went their wai and thei send unto him certain of the pharise and of the herodian to catch him in hi word and when thei were come thei sai unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the wai of god in truth is it law to give tribut to caesar or not shall we give or shall we not give but he know their hypocrisi said unto them why tempt ye me bring me a penni that i mai see it and thei brought it and he saith unto them whose is thi imag and superscript and thei said unto him caesar and jesu answer said unto them render to caesar the thing that ar caesar and to god the thing that ar god and thei marvel at him then come unto him the sadduce which sai there is no resurrect and thei ask him sai master mose wrote unto us if a man brother die and leav hi wife behind him and leav no children that hi brother should take hi wife and rais up seed unto hi brother now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dy left no seed and the second took her and di neither left he ani seed and the third likewis and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman di also in the resurrect therefor when thei shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife and jesu answer said unto them do ye not therefor err becaus ye know not the scriptur neither the power of god for when thei shall rise from the dead thei neither marri nor ar given in marriag but ar as the angel which ar in heaven and as touch the dead that thei rise have ye not read in the book of mose how in the bush god spake unto him sai i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but the god of the live ye therefor do greatli err and on of the scribe came and have heard them reason togeth and perceiv that he had answer them well ask him which is the first command of all and jesu answer him the first of all the command is hear o israel the lord our god is on lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength thi is the first command and the second is like name thi thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself there is none other command greater than these and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is on god and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understand and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love hi neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offer and sacrific and when jesu saw that he answer discreetli he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that durst ask him ani question and jesu answer and said while he taught in the templ how sai the scribe that christ is the son of david for david himself said by the holi ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemi thy footstool david therefor himself calleth him lord and whenc is he then hi son and the common peopl heard him gladli and he said unto them in hi doctrin bewar of the scribe which love to go in long cloth and love salut in the marketplac and the chief seat in the synagogu and the uppermost room at feast which devour widow hous and for a pretenc make long prayer these shall receiv greater damnat and jesu sat over against the treasuri and beheld how the peopl cast monei into the treasuri and mani that were rich cast in much and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mite which make a farth and he call unto him hi discipl and saith unto them verili i sai unto you that thi poor widow hath cast more in than all thei which have cast into the treasuri for all thei did cast in of their abund but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her live and as he went out of the templ on of hi discipl saith unto him master see what manner of stone and what build ar here and jesu answer said unto him seest thou these great build there shall not be left on stone upon anoth that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the mount of oliv over against the templ peter and jame and john and andrew ask him privat tell us when shall these thing be and what shall be the sign when all these thing shall be fulfil and jesu answer them began to sai take heed lest ani man deceiv you for mani shall come in my name sai i am christ and shall deceiv mani and when ye shall hear of war and rumour of war be ye not troubl for such thing must need be but the end shall not be yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquak in diver place and there shall be famin and troubl these ar the begin of sorrow but take heed to yourselv for thei shall deliv you up to council and in the synagogu ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought befor ruler and king for my sake for a testimoni against them and the gospel must first be publish among all nation but when thei shall lead you and deliv you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premedit but whatsoev shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holi ghost now the brother shall betrai the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against their parent and shall caus them to be put to death and ye shall be hate of all men for my name sake but he that shall endur unto the end the same shall be save but when ye shall see the abomin of desol spoken of by daniel the prophet stand where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountain and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the hous neither enter therein to take ani thing out of hi hous and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up hi garment but woe to them that ar with child and to them that give suck in those dai and prai ye that your flight be not in the winter for in those dai shall be afflict such as wa not from the begin of the creation which god creat unto thi time neither shall be and except that the lord had shorten those dai no flesh should be save but for the elect sake whom he hath chosen he hath shorten the dai and then if ani man shall sai to you lo here is christ or lo he is there believ him not for fals christ and fals prophet shall rise and shall shew sign and wonder to seduc if it were possibl even the elect but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all thing but in those dai after that tribul the sun shall be darken and the moon shall not give her light and the star of heaven shall fall and the power that ar in heaven shall be shaken and then shall thei see the son of man come in the cloud with great power and glori and then shall he send hi angel and shall gather togeth hi elect from the four wind from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven now learn a parabl of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leav ye know that summer is near so ye in like manner when ye shall see these thing come to pass know that it is nigh even at the door verili i sai unto you that thi gener shall not pass till all these thing be done heaven and earth shall pass awai but my word shall not pass awai but of that dai and that hour knoweth no man no not the angel which ar in heaven neither the son but the father take ye heed watch and prai for ye know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man take a far journei who left hi hous and gave author to hi servant and to everi man hi work and command the porter to watch watch ye therefor for ye know not when the master of the hous cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrow or in the morn lest come suddenli he find you sleep and what i sai unto you i sai unto all watch after two dai wa the feast of the passov and of unleaven bread and the chief priest and the scribe sought how thei might take him by craft and put him to death but thei said not on the feast dai lest there be an uproar of the peopl and be in bethani in the hous of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman have an alabast box of ointment of spikenard veri preciou and she brake the box and pour it on hi head and there were some that had indign within themselv and said why wa thi wast of the ointment made for it might have been sold for more than three hundr penc and have been given to the poor and thei murmur against her and jesu said let her alon why troubl ye her she hath wrought a good work on me for ye have the poor with you alwai and whensoev ye will ye mai do them good but me ye have not alwai she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my bodi to the buri verili i sai unto you wheresoev thi gospel shall be preach throughout the whole world thi also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memori of her and juda iscariot on of the twelv went unto the chief priest to betrai him unto them and when thei heard it thei were glad and promis to give him monei and he sought how he might conveni betrai him and the first dai of unleaven bread when thei kill the passov hi discipl said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepar that thou mayest eat the passov and he sendeth forth two of hi discipl and saith unto them go ye into the citi and there shall meet you a man bear a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoev he shall go in sai ye to the goodman of the hous the master saith where is the guestchamb where i shall eat the passov with my discipl and he will shew you a larg upper room furnish and prepar there make readi for us and hi discipl went forth and came into the citi and found as he had said unto them and thei made readi the passov and in the even he cometh with the twelv and as thei sat and did eat jesu said verili i sai unto you on of you which eateth with me shall betrai me and thei began to be sorrow and to sai unto him on by on is it i and anoth said is it i and he answer and said unto them it is on of the twelv that dippeth with me in the dish the son of man inde goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrai good were it for that man if he had never been born and as thei did eat jesu took bread and bless and brake it and gave to them and said take eat thi is my bodi and he took the cup and when he had given thank he gave it to them and thei all drank of it and he said unto them thi is my blood of the new testament which is shed for mani verili i sai unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that dai that i drink it new in the kingdom of god and when thei had sung an hymn thei went out into the mount of oliv and jesu saith unto them all ye shall be offend becaus of me thi night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scatter but after that i am risen i will go befor you into galile but peter said unto him although all shall be offend yet will not i and jesu saith unto him verili i sai unto thee that thi dai even in thi night befor the cock crow twice thou shalt deni me thrice but he spake the more vehement if i should die with thee i will not deni thee in ani wise likewis also said thei all and thei came to a place which wa name gethseman and he saith to hi discipl sit ye here while i shall prai and he taketh with him peter and jame and john and began to be sore amaz and to be veri heavi and saith unto them my soul is exceed sorrow unto death tarri ye here and watch and he went forward a littl and fell on the ground and prai that if it were possibl the hour might pass from him and he said abba father all thing ar possibl unto thee take awai thi cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt and he cometh and findeth them sleep and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch on hour watch ye and prai lest ye enter into temptat the spirit truli is readi but the flesh is weak and again he went awai and prai and spake the same word and when he return he found them asleep again for their ey were heavi neither wist thei what to answer him and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrai into the hand of sinner rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand and immedi while he yet spake cometh juda on of the twelv and with him a great multitud with sword and stave from the chief priest and the scribe and the elder and he that betrai him had given them a token sai whomsoev i shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him awai safe and as soon as he wa come he goeth straightwai to him and saith master master and kiss him and thei laid their hand on him and took him and on of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off hi ear and jesu answer and said unto them ar ye come out as against a thief with sword and with stave to take me i wa daili with you in the templ teach and ye took me not but the scriptur must be fulfil and thei all forsook him and fled and there follow him a certain young man have a linen cloth cast about hi nake bodi and the young men laid hold on him and he left the linen cloth and fled from them nake and thei led jesu awai to the high priest and with him were assembl all the chief priest and the elder and the scribe and peter follow him afar off even into the palac of the high priest and he sat with the servant and warm himself at the fire and the chief priest and all the council sought for wit against jesu to put him to death and found none for mani bare fals wit against him but their wit agre not togeth and there aros certain and bare fals wit against him sai we heard him sai i will destroi thi templ that is made with hand and within three dai i will build anoth made without hand but neither so did their wit agre togeth and the high priest stood up in the midst and ask jesu sai answerest thou noth what is it which these wit against thee but he held hi peac and answer noth again the high priest ask him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the bless and jesu said i am and ye shall see the son of man sit on the right hand of power and come in the cloud of heaven then the high priest rent hi cloth and saith what need we ani further wit ye have heard the blasphemi what think ye and thei all condemn him to be guilti of death and some began to spit on him and to cover hi face and to buffet him and to sai unto him prophesi and the servant did strike him with the palm of their hand and as peter wa beneath in the palac there cometh on of the maid of the high priest and when she saw peter warm himself she look upon him and said and thou also wast with jesu of nazareth but he deni sai i know not neither understand i what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew and a maid saw him again and began to sai to them that stood by thi is on of them and he deni it again and a littl after thei that stood by said again to peter sure thou art on of them for thou art a galilaean and thy speech agreeth thereto but he began to curs and to swear sai i know not thi man of whom ye speak and the second time the cock crew and peter call to mind the word that jesu said unto him befor the cock crow twice thou shalt deni me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept and straightwai in the morn the chief priest held a consult with the elder and scribe and the whole council and bound jesu and carri him awai and deliv him to pilat and pilat ask him art thou the king of the jew and he answer said unto them thou sayest it and the chief priest accus him of mani thing but he

the bridechamb fast while the bridegroom is with them but the dai will come when the bridegroom shall be taken awai from them and then shall thei fast in those dai and he spake also a parabl unto them no man putteth a piec of a new garment upon an old if otherwis then both the new maketh a rent and the piec that wa taken out of the new agreeth not with the old and no man putteth new wine into old bottl els the new wine will burst the bottl and be spill and the bottl shall perish but new wine must be put into new bottl and both ar preserv no man also have drunk old wine straightwai desireth new for he saith the old is better and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the corn field and hi discipl pluck the ear of corn and did eat rub them in their hand and certain of the pharise said unto them why do ye that which is not law to do on the sabbath dai and jesu answer them said have ye not read so much as thi what david did when himself wa an hungr and thei which were with him how he went into the hous of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not law to eat but for the priest alon and he said

scribe and pharise watch him whether he would heal on the sabbath dai that thei might find an accus against him but he knew their thought and said to the man which had the wither hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he aros and stood forth then said jesu unto them i will ask you on thing is it law on the sabbath dai to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroi it and look round about upon them all he said unto the man stretch forth thy hand and he did so and hi hand wa restor whole as the other and thei were fill with mad and commun on with anoth what thei might do to jesu and it came to pass in those dai that he went out into a mountain to prai and continu all night in prayer to god and when it wa dai he call unto him hi discipl and of them he chose twelv whom also he name apostl simon whom he also name peter and andrew hi brother jame and john philip and bartholomew matthew and thoma jame the son of alphaeu and simon call zelot and juda the brother of jame and

dear unto him wa sick and readi to die and when he heard of jesu he sent unto him the elder of the jew beseech him that he would come and heal hi servant and when thei came to jesu thei besought him instantli sai that he wa worthi for whom he should do thi for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogu then jesu went with them and when he wa now not far from the hous the centurion sent friend to him sai unto him lord troubl not thyself for i am not worthi that thou shouldest enter under my roof wherefor neither thought i myself worthi to come unto thee but sai in a word and my servant shall be heal for i also am a man set under author have under me soldier and i sai unto on go and he goeth and to anoth come and he cometh and to my servant do thi and he doeth it when jesu heard these thing he marvel at him and turn him about and said unto the peopl that follow him i sai unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel and thei that were sent return to the hous found the servant whole that had been sick and it came to pass the dai after that he went into a citi call nain and mani of hi discipl went with him and much peopl now when he came nigh to the gate of the citi behold there wa a dead man carri out the onli son of hi mother and she wa a widow and much peopl of the citi wa with her and when the lord saw her he had compass on her and said unto her weep not and he came and touch the bier and thei that bare him stood still and he said young man i sai unto thee aris and he that wa dead sat up and began to speak and he deliv him to hi mother and there came a fear on all and thei glorifi god sai that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visit hi peopl and thi rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and throughout all the region round about and the discipl of john shew him of all these thing and john call unto him two of hi discipl sent them to jesu sai art thou he that should come or look we for anoth when the men were come unto him thei said john baptist hath sent us unto thee sai art thou he that should come or look we for anoth and in that same hour he cure mani of their infirm and plagu and of evil spirit

deaf hear the dead ar rais to the poor the gospel is preach and bless is he whosoev shall not be offend in me and when the messeng of john were depart he began to speak unto the peopl concern john what went ye out into the wilder for to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out for to see a man cloth in soft raiment behold thei which ar gorgeous apparel and live delic ar in king court but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i sai unto you and much more than a prophet thi is he of whom it is written behold i send my messeng befor thy face which shall prepar thy wai befor thee for i sai unto you among those that ar born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he and all the peopl that heard him and the publican justifi god be baptiz with the baptism of john but the pharise and lawyer reject the counsel of god against themselv be not baptiz of him and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of thi gener and to what ar thei like thei ar like unto children sit in the marketplac and call on to anoth and sai we have pipe unto you and ye have not danc we have mourn to you and ye have not wept for john the baptist came neither eat bread nor drink wine and ye sai he hath a devil the son of man is come eat and drink and ye sai behold a glutton man and a winebibb a friend of publican and sinner but wisdom is justifi of all her children and on of the pharise desir him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharise hous and sat down to meat and behold a woman in the citi which wa a sinner when she knew that jesu sat at meat in the pharise hous brought an alabast box of ointment and stood at hi feet behind him weep and began to wash hi feet with tear and did wipe them with the hair of her head and kiss hi feet and anoint them with the ointment now when the pharise which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself sai thi man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman thi is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and jesu answer said unto him simon i have somewhat to sai unto thee and he saith master sai on there wa a certain creditor which had two debtor the on ow five hundr penc and the other fifti and when thei had noth to pai he frankli forgav them both tell me therefor which of them will love him most simon answer and said i suppos that he to whom he forgav most and he said unto him thou hast rightli judg and he turn to the woman and said unto simon seest thou thi woman i enter into thine hous thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath wash my feet with tear and wipe them with the hair of her head thou gavest me no kiss but thi woman sinc the time i came in hath not ceas to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but thi woman hath anoint my feet with ointment wherefor i sai unto thee her sin which ar mani ar forgiven for she love much but to whom littl is forgiven the same loveth littl and he said unto her thy sin ar forgiven and thei that sat at meat with him began to sai within themselv who is thi that forgiveth sin also and he said to the woman thy faith hath save thee go in peac and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout everi citi and villag preach and shew the glad tide of the kingdom of god and the twelv were with him and certain women which had been heal of evil spirit and infirm mari call magdalen out of whom went seven devil and joanna the wife of chuza herod steward and susanna and mani other which minist unto him of their substanc and when much peopl were gather togeth and were come to him out of everi citi he spake by a parabl a sower went out to sow hi seed and as he sow some fell by the wai side and it wa trodden down and the fowl of the air devour it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it wa sprung up it wither awai becaus it lack moistur and some fell among thorn and the thorn sprang up with it and choke it and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold and when he had said these thing he cri he that hath ear to hear let him hear and hi discipl ask him sai what might thi parabl be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteri of the kingdom of god but to other in parabl that see thei might not see and hear thei might not understand now the parabl is thi the seed is the word of god those by the wai side ar thei that hear then cometh the devil and taketh awai the word out of their heart lest thei should believ and be save thei on the rock ar thei which when thei hear receiv the word with joi and these have no root which for a while believ and in time of temptat fall awai and that which fell among thorn ar thei which when thei have heard go forth and ar choke with care and rich and pleasur of thi life and bring no fruit to perfect but that on the good ground ar thei which in an honest and good heart have heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patienc no man when he hath light a candl covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that thei which enter in mai see the light for noth is secret that shall not be made manifest neither ani thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad take heed therefor how ye hear for whosoev hath to him shall be given and whosoev hath not from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have then came to him hi mother and hi brethren and could not come at him for the press and it wa told him by certain which said thy mother and thy brethren stand without desir to see thee and he answer and said unto them my mother and my brethren ar these which hear the word of god and do it now it came to pass on a certain dai that he went into a ship with hi discipl and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and thei launch forth but as thei sail he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and thei were fill with water and were in jeopardi and thei came to him and awok him sai master master we perish then he aros and rebuk the wind and the rage of the water and thei ceas and there wa a calm and he said unto them where is your faith and thei be afraid wonder sai on to anoth what manner of man is thi for he commandeth even the wind and water and thei obei him and thei arriv at the countri of the gadaren which is over against galile and when he went forth to land there met him out of the citi a certain man which had devil long time and ware no cloth neither abod in ani hous but in the tomb when he saw jesu he cri out and fell down befor him and with a loud voic said what have i to do with thee jesu thou son of god most high i beseech thee torment me not for he had command the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftentim it had caught him and he wa kept bound with chain and in fetter and he brake the band and wa driven of the devil into the wilder and jesu ask him sai what is thy name and he said legion becaus mani devil were enter into him and thei besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep and there wa there an herd of mani swine feed on the mountain and thei besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffer them then went the devil out of the man and enter into the swine and the herd ran violent down a steep place into the lake and were choke when thei that fed them saw what wa done thei fled and went and told it in the citi and in the countri then thei went out to see what wa done and came to jesu and found the man out of whom the devil were depart sit at the feet of jesu cloth and in hi right mind and thei were afraid thei also which saw it told them by what mean he that wa possess of the devil wa heal then the whole multitud of the countri of the gadaren round about besought him to depart from them for thei were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and return back again now the man out of whom the devil were depart besought him that he might be with him but jesu sent him awai sai return to thine own hous and shew how great thing god hath done unto thee and he went hi wai and publish throughout the whole citi how great thing jesu had done unto him and it came to pass that when jesu wa return the peopl gladli receiv him for thei were all wait for him and behold there came a man name jairu and he wa a ruler of the synagogu and he fell down at jesu feet and besought him that he would come into hi hous for he had on onli daughter about twelv year of ag and she lai a dy but as he went the peopl throng him and a woman have an issu of blood twelv year which had spent all her live upon physician neither could be heal of ani came behind him and touch the border of hi garment and immedi her issu of blood stanch and jesu said who touch me when all deni peter and thei that were with him said master the multitud throng thee and press thee and sayest thou who touch me and jesu said somebodi hath touch me for i perceiv that virtu is gone out of me and when the woman saw that she wa not hid she came trembl and fall down befor him she declar unto him befor all the peopl for what caus she had touch him and how she wa heal immedi and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peac while he yet spake there cometh on from the ruler of the synagogu hous sai to him thy daughter is dead troubl not the master but when jesu heard it he answer him sai fear not believ onli and she shall be made whole and when he came into the hous he suffer no man to go in save peter and jame and john and the father and the mother of the maiden and all wept and bewail her but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth and thei laugh him to scorn know that she wa dead and he put them all out and took her by the hand and call sai maid aris and her spirit came again and she aros straightwai and he command to give her meat and her parent were astonish but he charg them that thei should tell no man what wa done then he call hi twelv discipl togeth and gave them power and author over all devil and to cure diseas and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick and he said unto them take noth for your journei neither stave nor scrip neither bread neither monei neither have two coat apiec and whatsoev hous ye enter into there abid and thenc depart and whosoev will not receiv you when ye go out of that citi shake off the veri dust from your feet for a testimoni against them and thei depart and went through the town preach the gospel and heal everi where now herod the tetrarch heard of all that wa done by him and he wa perplex becaus that it wa said of some that john wa risen from the dead and of some that elia had appear and of other that on of the old prophet wa risen again and herod said john have i behead but who is thi of whom i hear such thing and he desir to see him and the apostl when thei were return told him all that thei had done and he took them and went asid privat into a desert place belong to the citi call bethsaida and the peopl when thei knew it follow him and he receiv them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and heal them that had need of heal and when the dai began to wear awai then came the twelv and said unto him send the multitud awai that thei mai go into the town and countri round about and lodg and get victual for we ar here in a desert place but he said unto them give ye them to eat and thei said we have no more but five loav and two fish except we should go and bui meat for all thi peopl for thei were about five thousand men and he said to hi discipl make them sit down by fifti in a compani and thei did so and made them all sit down then he took the five loav and the two fish and look up to heaven he bless them and brake and gave to the discipl to set befor the multitud and thei did eat and were all fill and there wa taken up of fragment that remain to them twelv basket and it came to pass as he wa alon prai hi discipl were with him and he ask them sai whom sai the peopl that i am thei answer said john the baptist but some sai elia and other sai that on of the old prophet is risen again he said unto them but whom sai ye that i am peter answer said the christ of god and he straitli charg them and command them to tell no man that thing sai the son of man must suffer mani thing and be reject of the elder and chief priest and scribe and be slain and be rais the third dai and he said to them all if ani man will come after me let him deni himself and take up hi cross daili and follow me for whosoev will save hi life shall lose it but whosoev will lose hi life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantag if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast awai for whosoev shall be asham of me and of my word of him shall the son of man be asham when he shall come in hi own glori and in hi father and of the holi angel but i tell you of a truth there be some stand here which shall not tast of death till thei see the kingdom of god and it came to pass about an eight dai after these sai he took peter and john and jame and went up into a mountain to prai and as he prai the fashion of hi counten wa alter and hi raiment wa white and glister and behold there talk with him two men which were mose and elia who appear in glori and spake of hi deceas which he should accomplish at jerusalem but peter and thei that were with him were heavi with sleep and when thei were awak thei saw hi glori and the two men that stood with him and it came to pass as thei depart from him peter said unto jesu master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacl on for thee and on for mose and on for elia not know what he said while he thu spake there came a cloud and overshadow them and thei fear as thei enter into the cloud and there came a voic out of the cloud sai thi is my belov son hear him and when the voic wa past jesu wa found alon and thei kept it close and told no man in those dai ani of those thing which thei had seen and it came to pass that on the next dai when thei were come down from the hill much peopl met him and behold a man of the compani cri out sai master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine onli child and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenli crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruis him hardli departeth from him and i besought thy discipl to cast him out and thei could not and jesu answer said o faithless and pervers gener how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither and as he wa yet a come the devil threw him down and tare him and jesu rebuk the unclean spirit and heal the child and deliv him again to hi father and thei were all amaz at the mighti power of god but while thei wonder everi on at all thing which jesu did he said unto hi discipl let these sai sink down into your ear for the son of man shall be deliv into the hand of men but thei understood not thi sai and it wa hid from them that thei perceiv it not and thei fear to ask him of that sai then there aros a reason among them which of them should be greatest and jesu perceiv the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said unto them whosoev shall receiv thi child in my name receiveth me and whosoev shall receiv me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great and john answer and said master we saw on cast out devil in thy name and we forbad him becaus he followeth not with us and jesu said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us and it came to pass when the time wa come that he should be receiv up he stedfastli set hi face to go to jerusalem and sent messeng befor hi face and thei went and enter into a villag of the samaritan to make readi for him and thei did not receiv him becaus hi face wa as though he would go to jerusalem and when hi discipl jame and john saw thi thei said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consum them even as elia did but he turn and rebuk them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye ar of for the son of man is not come to destroi men live but to save them and thei went to anoth villag and it came to pass that as thei went in the wai a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoev thou goest and jesu said unto him fox have hole and bird of the air have nest but the son of man hath not where to lai hi head and he said unto anoth follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and buri my father jesu said unto him let the dead buri their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god and anoth also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewel which ar at home at my hous and jesu said unto him no man have put hi hand to the plough and look back is fit for the kingdom of god after these thing the lord appoint other seventi also and sent them two and two befor hi face into everi citi and place whither he himself would come therefor said he unto them the harvest truli is great but the labour ar few prai ye therefor the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labour into hi harvest go your wai behold i send you forth as lamb among wolv carri neither purs nor scrip nor shoe and salut no man by the wai and into whatsoev hous ye enter first sai peac be to thi hous and if the son of peac be there your peac shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again and in the same hous remain eat and drink such thing as thei give for the labour is worthi of hi hire go not from hous to hous and into whatsoev citi ye enter and thei receiv you eat such thing as ar set befor you and heal the sick that ar therein and sai unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you but into whatsoev citi ye enter and thei receiv you not go your wai out into the street of the same and sai even the veri dust of your citi which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstand be ye sure of thi that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you but i sai unto you that it shall be more toler in that dai for sodom than for that citi woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighti work had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in you thei had a great while ago repent sit in sackcloth and ash but it shall be more toler for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you and thou capernaum which art exalt to heaven shalt be thrust down to hell he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me and the seventi return again with joi sai lord even the devil ar subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightn fall from heaven behold i give unto you power to tread on serpent and scorpion and over all the power of the enemi and noth shall by ani mean hurt you notwithstand in thi rejoic not that the spirit ar subject unto you but rather rejoic becaus your name ar written in heaven in that hour jesu rejoic in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these thing from the wise and prudent and hast reveal them unto babe even so father for so it seem good in thy sight all thing ar deliv to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turn him unto hi discipl and said privat bless ar the ey which see the thing that ye see for i tell you that mani prophet and king have desir to see those thing which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those thing which ye hear and have not heard them and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempt him sai master what shall i do to inherit etern life he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou and he answer said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself and he said unto him thou hast answer right thi do and thou shalt live but he will to justifi himself said unto jesu and who is my neighbour and jesu answer said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thiev which strip him of hi raiment and wound him and depart leav him half dead and by chanc there came down a certain priest that wai and when he saw him he pass by on the other side and likewis a levit when he wa at the place came and look on him and pass by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journei came where he wa and when he saw him he had compass on him and went to him and bound up hi wound pour in oil and wine and set him on hi own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he depart he took out two penc and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoev thou spendest more when i come again i will repai thee which now of these three thinkest thou wa neighbour unto him that fell among the thiev and he said he that shew merci on him then said jesu unto him go and do thou likewis now it came to pass as thei went that he enter into a certain villag and a certain woman name martha receiv him into her hous and she had a sister call mari which also sat at jesu feet and heard hi word but martha wa cumber about much serv and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serv alon bid her therefor that she help me and jesu answer and said unto her martha martha thou art care and troubl about mani thing but on thing is need and mari hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken awai from her and it came to pass that as he wa prai in a certain place when he ceas on of hi discipl said unto him lord teach us to prai as john also taught hi discipl and he said unto them when ye prai sai our father which art in heaven hallow be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth give us dai by dai our daili bread and forgiv us our sin for we also forgiv everi on that is indebt to us and lead us not into temptat but deliv us from evil and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and sai unto him friend lend me three loav for a friend of mine in hi journei is come to me and i have noth to set befor him and he from within shall answer and sai troubl me not the door is now shut and my children ar with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee i sai unto you though he will not rise and give him becaus he is hi friend yet becaus of hi importun he will rise and give him as mani as he needeth and i sai unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everi on that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open if a son shall ask bread of ani of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if ye then be evil know how to give good gift unto your children how much more shall your heavenli father give the holi spirit to them that ask him and he wa cast out a devil and it wa dumb and it came to pass when the devil wa gone out the dumb spake and the peopl wonder but some of them said he casteth out devil through beelzebub the chief of the devil and other tempt him sought of him a sign from heaven but he know their thought said unto them everi kingdom divid against itself is brought to desol and a hous divid against a hous falleth if satan also be divid against himself how shall hi kingdom stand becaus ye sai that i cast out devil through beelzebub and if i by beelzebub cast out devil by whom do your son cast them out therefor shall thei be your judg but if i with the finger of god cast out devil no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you when a strong man arm keepeth hi palac hi good ar in peac but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcom him he taketh from him all hi armour wherein he trust and divideth hi spoil he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry place seek rest and find none he saith i will return unto my hous whenc i came out and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnish then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirit more wick than himself and thei enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is wors than the first and it came to pass as he spake these thing a certain woman of the compani lift up her voic and said unto him bless is the womb that bare thee and the pap which thou hast suck but he said yea rather bless ar thei that hear the word of god and keep it and when the peopl were gather thick togeth he began to sai thi is an evil gener thei seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of jona the prophet for as jona wa a sign unto the ninevit so shall also the son of man be to thi gener the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of thi gener and condemn them for she came from the utmost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here the men of ninev shall rise up in the judgment with thi gener and shall condemn it for thei repent at the preach of jona and behold a greater than jona is here no man when he hath light a candl putteth it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that thei which come in mai see the light the light of the bodi is the ey therefor when thine ey is singl thy whole bodi also is full of light but when thine ey is evil thy bodi also is full of dark take heed therefor that the light which is in thee be not dark if thy whole bodi therefor be full of light have no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shine of a candl doth give thee light and as he spake a certain pharise besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat and when the pharise saw it he marvel that he had not first wash befor dinner and the lord said unto him now do ye pharise make clean the outsid of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of raven and wicked ye fool did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also but rather give alm of such thing as ye have and behold all thing ar clean unto you but woe unto you pharise for ye tith mint and rue and all manner of herb and pass over judgment and the love of god these ought ye to have done and not to leav the other undon woe unto you pharise for ye love the uppermost seat in the synagogu and greet in the market woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrit for ye ar as grave which appear not and the men that walk over them ar not awar of them then answer on of the lawyer and said unto him master thu sai thou reproachest us also and he said woe unto you also ye lawyer for ye lade men with burden grievou to be born and ye yourselv touch not the burden with on of your finger woe unto you for ye build the sepulchr of the prophet and your father kill them truli ye bear wit that ye allow the deed of your father for thei inde kill them and ye build their sepulchr therefor also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophet and apostl and some of them thei shall slai and persecut that the blood of all the prophet which wa shed from the foundat of the world mai be requir of thi gener from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharia which perish between the altar and the templ verili i sai unto you it shall be requir of thi gener woe unto you lawyer for ye have taken awai the kei of knowledg ye enter not in yourselv and them that were enter in ye hinder and as he said these thing unto them the scribe and the pharise began to urg him vehement and to provok him to speak of mani thing lai wait for him and seek to catch someth out of hi mouth that thei might accus him in the mean time when there were gather togeth an innumer multitud of peopl insomuch that thei trode on upon anoth he began to sai unto hi discipl first of all bewar ye of the leaven of the pharise which is hypocrisi for there is noth cover that shall not be reveal neither hid that shall not be known therefor whatsoev ye have spoken in dark shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closet shall be proclaim upon the housetop and i sai unto you my friend be not afraid of them that kill the bodi and after that have no more that thei can do but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath kill hath power to cast into hell yea i sai unto you fear him ar not five sparrow sold for two farth and not on of them is forgotten befor god but even the veri hair of your head ar all number fear not therefor ye ar of more valu than mani sparrow also i sai unto you whosoev shall confess me befor men him shall the son of man also confess befor the angel of god but he that denieth me befor men shall be deni befor the angel of god and whosoev shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holi ghost it shall not be forgiven and when thei bring you unto the synagogu and unto magistr and power take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall sai for the holi ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to sai and on of the compani said unto him master speak to my brother that he divid the inherit with me and he said unto him man who made me a judg or a divid over you and he said unto them take heed and bewar of covet for a man life consisteth not in the abund of the thing which he possesseth and he spake a parabl unto them sai the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifulli and he thought within himself sai what shall i do becaus i have no room where to bestow my fruit and he said thi will i do i will pull down my barn and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruit and my good and i will sai to my soul soul thou hast much good laid up for mani year take thine eas eat drink and be merri but god said unto him thou fool thi night thy soul shall be requir of thee then whose shall those thing be which thou hast provid so is he that layeth up treasur for himself and is not rich toward god and he said unto hi discipl therefor i sai unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the bodi what ye shall put on the life is more than meat and the bodi is more than raiment consid the raven for thei neither sow nor reap which neither have storehous nor barn and god feedeth them how much more ar ye better than the fowl and which of you with take thought can add to hi statur on cubit if ye then be not abl to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the rest consid the lili how thei grow thei toil not thei spin not and yet i sai unto you that solomon in

and slew them think ye that thei were sinner abov all men that dwelt in jerusalem i tell you nai but except ye repent ye shall all likewis perish he spake also thi parabl a certain man had a fig tree plant in hi vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none then said he unto the dresser of hi vineyard behold these three year i come seek fruit on thi fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground and he answer said unto him lord let it alon thi year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down and he wa teach in on of the synagogu on the sabbath and behold there wa a woman which had a spirit of infirm eighteen year and wa bow togeth and could in no wise lift up herself and when jesu saw her he call her to him and said unto her woman thou art loos from thine infirm and he laid hi hand on her and immedi she wa made straight and glorifi god and the ruler of the synagogu answer with indign becaus that jesu had heal on the sabbath dai and said unto the peopl there ar six dai in which men ought to work in them therefor come and be heal and not on the sabbath dai the lord then answer him and said thou hypocrit doth not each on of you on the sabbath loos hi ox or hi ass from the stall and lead him awai to water and ought not thi woman be a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen year be loos from thi bond on the sabbath dai and when he had said these thing all hi adversari were asham and all the peopl rejoic for all the gloriou thing that were done by him then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall i resembl it it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into hi garden and it grew and wax a great tree and the fowl of the air lodg in the branch of it and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measur of meal till the whole wa leaven and he went through the citi and villag teach and journei toward jerusalem then said on unto him lord ar there few that be save and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for mani i sai unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be abl when onc the master of the hous is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door sai lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and sai unto you i know you not whenc ye ar then shall ye begin to sai we have eaten and drunk in thy presenc and thou hast taught in our street but he shall sai i tell you i know you not whenc ye ar depart from me all ye worker of iniqu there shall be weep and gnash of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophet in the kingdom of god and you yourselv thrust out and thei shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god and behold there ar last which shall be first and there ar first which shall be last the same dai there came certain of the pharise sai unto him get thee out and depart henc for herod will kill thee and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devil and i do cure to dai and to morrow and the third dai i shall be perfect nevertheless i must walk to dai and to morrow and the dai follow for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophet and stonest them that ar sent unto thee how often would i have gather thy children togeth as a hen doth gather her brood under her wing and ye would not behold your hous is left unto you desol and verili i sai unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall sai bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord and it came to pass as he went into the hous of on of the chief pharise to eat bread on the sabbath dai that thei watch him and behold there wa a certain man befor him which had the dropsi and jesu answer spake unto the lawyer and pharise sai is it law to heal on the sabbath dai and thei held their peac and he took him and heal him and let him go and answer them sai which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightwai pull him out on the sabbath dai and thei could not answer him again to these thing and he put forth a parabl to those which were bidden when he mark how thei chose out the chief room sai unto them when thou art bidden of ani man to a wed sit not down in the highest room lest a more honour man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade thee and him come and sai to thee give thi man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that bade thee cometh he mai sai unto thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presenc of them that sit at meat with thee for whosoev exalteth himself shall be abas and he that humbleth himself shall be exalt then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friend nor thy brethren neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbour lest thei also bid thee again and a recomp be made thee but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maim the lame the blind and thou shalt be bless for thei cannot recompens thee for thou shalt be recompens at the resurrect of the just and when on of them that sat at meat with him heard these thing he said unto him bless is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade mani and sent hi servant at supper time to sai to them that were bidden come for all thing ar now readi and thei all with on consent began to make excus the first said unto him i have bought a piec of ground and i must need go and see it i prai thee have me excus and anoth said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i prai thee have me excus and anoth said i have marri a wife and therefor i cannot come so that servant came and shew hi lord these thing then the master of the hous be angri said to hi servant go out quickli into the street and lane of the citi and bring in hither the poor and the maim and the halt and the blind and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast command and yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highwai and hedg and compel them to come in that my hous mai be fill for i sai unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall tast of my supper and there went great multitud with him and he turn and said unto them if ani man come to me and hate not hi father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sister yea and hi own life also he cannot be my discipl and whosoev doth not bear hi cross and come after me cannot be my discipl for which of you intend to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have suffici to finish it lest hapli after he hath laid the foundat and is not abl to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him sai thi man began to build and wa not abl to finish or what king go to make war against anoth king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be abl with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenti thousand or els while the other is yet a great wai off he sendeth an ambassag and desireth condit of peac so likewis whosoev he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my discipl salt is good but if the salt have lost hi savour wherewith shall it be season it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghil but men cast it out he that hath ear to hear let him hear then drew near unto him all the publican and sinner for to hear him and the pharise and scribe murmur sai thi man receiveth sinner and eateth with them and he spake thi parabl unto them sai what man of you have an hundr sheep if he lose on of them doth not leav the nineti and nine in the wilder and go after that which is lost until he find it and when he hath found it he layeth it on hi shoulder rejoic and when he cometh home he calleth togeth hi friend and neighbour sai unto them rejoic with me for i have found my sheep which wa lost i sai unto you that likewis joi shall be in heaven over on sinner that repenteth more than over nineti and nine just person which need no repent either what woman have ten piec of silver if she lose on piec doth not light a candl and sweep the hous and seek dilig till she find it and when she hath found it she calleth her friend and her neighbour togeth sai rejoic with me for i have found the piec which i had lost likewis i sai unto you there is joi in the presenc of the angel of god over on sinner that repenteth and he said a certain man had two son and the younger of them said to hi father father give me the portion of good that falleth to me and he divid unto them hi live and not mani dai after the younger son gather all togeth and took hi journei into a far countri and there wast hi substanc with riotou live and when he had spent all there aros a mighti famin in that land and he began to be in want and he went and join himself to a citizen of that countri and he sent him into hi field to feed swine and he would fain have fill hi belli with the husk that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how mani hire servant of my father have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger i will aris and go to my father and will sai unto him father i have sin against heaven and befor thee and am no more worthi to be call thy son make me as on of thy hire servant and he aros and came to hi father but when he wa yet a great wai off hi father saw him and had compass and ran and fell on hi neck and kiss him and the son said unto him father i have sin against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthi to be call thy son but the father said to hi servant bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on hi hand and shoe on hi feet and bring hither the fat calf and kill it and let us eat and be merri for thi my son wa dead and is aliv again he wa lost and is found and thei began to be merri now hi elder son wa in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the hous he heard musick and danc and he call on of the servant and ask what these thing meant and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath kill the fat calf becaus he hath receiv him safe and sound and he wa angri and would not go in therefor came hi father out and intreat him and he answer said to hi father lo these mani year do i serv thee neither transgress i at ani time thy command and yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merri with my friend but as soon as thi thy son wa come which hath devour thy live with harlot thou hast kill for him the fat calf and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine it wa meet that we should make merri and be glad for thi thy brother wa dead and is aliv again and wa lost and is found and he said also unto hi discipl there wa a certain rich man which had a steward and the same wa accus unto him that he had wast hi good and he call him and said unto him how is it that i hear thi of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my lord taketh awai from me the stewardship i cannot dig to beg i am asham i am resolv what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship thei mai receiv me into their hous so he call everi on of hi lord debtor unto him and said unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord and he said an hundr measur of oil and he said unto him take thy bill and sit down quickli and write fifti then said he to anoth and how much owest thou and he said an hundr measur of wheat and he said unto him take thy bill and write fourscor and the lord commend the unjust steward becaus he had done wise for the children of thi world ar in their gener wiser than the children of light and i sai unto you make to yourselv friend of the mammon of unright that when ye fail thei mai receiv you into everlast habit he that is faith in that which is least is faith also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much if therefor ye have not been faith in the unright mammon who will commit to your trust the true rich and if ye have not been faith in that which is anoth man who shall give you that which is your own no servant can serv two master for either he will hate the on and love the other or els he will hold to the on and despis the other ye cannot serv god and mammon and the pharise also who were covet heard all these thing and thei derid him and he said unto them ye ar thei which justifi yourselv befor men but god knoweth your heart for that which is highli esteem among men is abomin in the sight of god the law and the prophet were until john sinc that time the kingdom of god is preach and everi man presseth into it and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than on tittl of the law to fail whosoev putteth awai hi wife and marrieth anoth committeth adulteri and whosoev marrieth her that is put awai from her husband committeth adulteri there wa a certain rich man which wa cloth in purpl and fine linen and fare sumptuous everi dai and there wa a certain beggar name lazaru which wa laid at hi gate full of sore and desir to be fed with the crumb which fell from the rich man tabl moreov the dog came and lick hi sore and it came to pass that the beggar di and wa carri by the angel into abraham bosom the rich man also di and wa buri and in hell he lift up hi ey be in torment and seeth abraham afar off and lazaru in hi bosom and he cri and said father abraham have merci on me and send lazaru that he mai dip the tip of hi finger in water and cool my tongu for i am torment in thi flame but abraham said son rememb that thou in thy lifetim receivedst thy good thing and likewis lazaru evil thing but now he is comfort and thou art torment and besid all thi between us and you there is a great gulf fix so that thei which would pass from henc to you cannot neither can thei pass to us that would come from thenc then he said i prai thee therefor father that thou wouldest send him to my father hous for i have five brethren that he mai testifi unto them lest thei also come into thi place of torment abraham saith unto him thei have mose and the prophet let them hear them and he said nai father abraham but if on went unto them from the dead thei will repent and he said unto him if thei hear not mose and the prophet neither will thei be persuad though on rose from the dead then said he unto the discipl it is imposs but that offenc will come but woe unto him through whom thei come it were better for him that a millston were hang about hi neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend on of these littl on take heed to yourselv if thy brother trespass against thee rebuk him and if he repent forgiv him and if he trespass against thee seven time in a dai and seven time in a dai turn again to thee sai i repent thou shalt forgiv him and the apostl said unto the lord increas our faith and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might sai unto thi sycamin tree be thou pluck up by the root and be thou plant in the sea and it should obei you but which of you have a servant plow or feed cattl will sai unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat and will not rather sai unto him make readi wherewith i mai sup and gird thyself and serv me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink doth he thank that servant becaus he did the thing that were command him i trow not so likewis ye when ye shall have done all those thing which ar command you sai we ar unprofit servant we have done that which wa our duti to do and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he pass through the midst of samaria and galile and as he enter into a certain villag there met him ten men that were leper which stood afar off and thei lift up their voic and said jesu master have merci on us and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselv unto the priest and it came to pass that as thei went thei were cleans and on of them when he saw that he wa heal turn back and with a loud voic glorifi god and fell down on hi face at hi feet give him thank and he wa a samaritan and jesu answer said were there not ten cleans but where ar the nine there ar not found that return to give glori to god save thi stranger and he said unto him aris go thy wai thy faith hath made thee whole and when he wa demand of the pharise when the kingdom of god should come he answer them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observ neither shall thei sai lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you and he said unto the discipl the dai will come when ye shall desir to see on of the dai of the son of man and ye shall not see it and thei shall sai to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightn that lighteneth out of the on part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in hi dai but first must he suffer mani thing and be reject of thi gener and as it wa in the dai of noe so shall it be also in the dai of the son of man thei did eat thei drank thei marri wive thei were given in marriag until the dai that noe enter into the ark and the flood came and destroi them all likewis also as it wa in the dai of lot thei did eat thei drank thei bought thei sold thei plant thei build but the same dai that lot went out of sodom it rain fire and brimston from heaven and destroi them all even thu shall it be in the dai when the son of man is reveal in that dai he which shall be upon the housetop and hi stuff in the hous let him not come down to take it awai and he that is in the field let him likewis not return back rememb lot wife whosoev shall seek to save hi life shall lose it and whosoev shall lose hi life shall preserv it i tell you in that night there shall be two men in on bed the on shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grind togeth the on shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the on shall be taken and the other left and thei answer and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoev the bodi is thither will the eagl be gather togeth and he spake a parabl unto them to thi end that men ought alwai to prai and not to faint sai there wa in a citi a judg which fear not god neither regard man and there wa a widow in that citi and she came unto him sai aveng me of mine adversari and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet becaus thi widow troubleth me i will aveng her lest by her continu come she weari me and the lord said hear what the unjust judg saith and shall not god aveng hi own elect which cry dai and night unto him though he bear long with them i tell you that he will aveng them speedili nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and he spake thi parabl unto certain which trust in themselv that thei were righteou and despis other two men went up into the templ to prai the on a pharise and the other a publican the pharise stood and prai thu with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men ar extortion unjust adulter or even as thi publican i fast twice in the week i give tith of all that i possess and the publican stand afar off would not lift up so much as hi ey unto heaven but smote upon hi breast sai god be merci to me a sinner i tell you thi man went down to hi hous justifi rather than the other for everi on that exalteth himself shall be abas and he that humbleth himself shall be exalt and thei brought unto him also infant that he would touch them but when hi discipl saw it thei rebuk them but jesu call them unto him and said suffer littl children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god verili i sai unto you whosoev shall not receiv the kingdom of god as a littl child shall in no wise enter therein and a certain ruler ask him sai good master what shall i do to inherit etern life and jesu said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save on that is god thou knowest the command do not commit adulteri do not kill do not steal do not bear fals wit honour thy father and thy mother and he said all these have i kept from my youth up now when jesu heard these thing he said unto him yet lackest thou on thing sell all that thou hast and distribut unto the poor and thou shalt have treasur in heaven and come follow me and when he heard thi he wa veri sorrow for he wa veri rich and when jesu saw that he wa veri sorrow he said how hardli shall thei that have rich enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to go through a needl ey than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and thei that heard it said who then can be save and he said the thing which ar imposs with men ar possibl with god then peter said lo we have left all and follow thee and he said unto them verili i sai unto you there is no man that hath left hous or parent or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of god sake who shall not receiv manifold more in thi present time and in the world to come life everlast then he took unto him the twelv and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all thing that ar written by the prophet concern the son of man shall be accomplish for he shall be deliv unto the gentil and shall be mock and spitefulli entreat and spit on and thei shall scourg him and put him to death and the third dai he shall rise again and thei understood none of these thing and thi sai wa hid from them neither knew thei the thing which were spoken and it came to pass that as he wa come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the wai side beg and hear the multitud pass by he ask what it meant and thei told him that jesu of nazareth passeth by and he cri sai jesu thou son of david have merci on me and thei which went befor rebuk him that he should hold hi peac but he cri so much the more thou son of david have merci on me and jesu stood and command him to be brought unto him and when he wa come near he ask him sai what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i mai receiv my sight and jesu said unto him receiv thy sight thy faith hath save thee and immedi he receiv hi sight and follow him glorifi god and all the peopl when thei saw it gave prais unto god and jesu enter and pass through jericho and behold there wa a man name zacchaeu which wa the chief among the publican and he wa rich and he sought to see jesu who he wa and could not for the press becaus he wa littl of statur and he ran befor and climb up into a sycomor tree to see him for he wa to pass that wai and when jesu came to the place he look up and saw him and said unto him zacchaeu make hast and come down for to dai i must abid at thy hous and he made hast and came down and receiv him joyfulli and when thei saw it thei all murmur sai that he wa gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner and zacchaeu stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my good i give to the poor and if i have taken ani thing from ani man by fals accus i restor him fourfold and jesu said unto him thi dai is salvat come to thi hous forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which wa lost and as thei heard these thing he ad and spake a parabl becaus he wa nigh to jerusalem and becaus thei thought that the kingdom of god should immedi appear he said therefor a certain nobleman went into a far countri to receiv for himself a kingdom and to return and he call hi ten servant and deliv them ten pound and said unto them occupi till i come but hi citizen hate him and sent a messag after him sai we will not have thi man to reign over us and it came to pass that when he wa return have receiv the kingdom then he command these servant to be call unto him to whom he had given the monei that he might know how much everi man had gain by trade then came the first sai lord thy pound hath gain ten pound and he said unto him well thou good servant becaus thou hast been faith in a veri littl have thou author over ten citi and the second came sai lord thy pound hath gain five pound and he said likewis to him be thou also over five citi and anoth came sai lord behold here is thy pound which i have kept laid up in a napkin for i fear thee becaus thou art an auster man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judg thee thou wick servant thou knewest that i wa an auster man take up that i laid not down and reap that i did not sow wherefor then gavest not thou my monei into the bank that at my come i might have requir mine own with usuri and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pound and thei said unto him lord he hath ten pound for i sai unto you that unto everi on which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken awai from him but those mine enemi which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slai them befor me and when he had thu spoken he went befor ascend up to jerusalem and it came to pass when he wa come nigh to bethphag and bethani at the mount call the mount of oliv he sent two of hi discipl sai go ye into the villag over against you in the which at your enter ye shall find a colt ti whereon yet never man sat loos him and bring him hither and if ani man ask you why do ye loos him thu shall ye sai unto him becaus the lord hath need of him and thei that were sent went their wai and found even as he had said unto them and as thei were loos the colt the owner thereof said unto them why loos ye the colt and thei said the lord hath need of him and thei brought him to jesu and thei cast their garment upon the colt and thei set jesu thereon and as he went thei spread their cloth in the wai and when he wa come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of oliv the whole multitud of the discipl began to rejoic and prais god with a loud voic for all the mighti work that thei had seen sai bless be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peac in heaven and glori in the highest and some of the pharise from among the multitud said unto him master rebuk thy discipl and he answer and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peac the stone would immedi cry out and when he wa come near he beheld the citi and wept over it sai if thou hadst known even thou at least in thi thy dai the thing which belong unto thy peac but now thei ar hid from thine ey for the dai shall come upon thee that thine enemi shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on everi side and shall lai thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and thei shall not leav in thee on stone upon anoth becaus thou knewest not the time of thy visit and he went into the templ and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought sai unto them it is written my hous is the hous of prayer but ye have made it a den of thiev and he taught daili in the templ but the chief priest and the scribe and the chief of the peopl sought to destroi him and could not find what thei might do for all the peopl were veri attent to hear him and it came to pass that on on of those dai as he taught the peopl in the templ and preach the gospel the chief priest and the scribe came upon him with the elder and spake unto him sai tell us by what author doest thou these thing or who is he that gave thee thi author and he answer and said unto them i will also ask you on thing and answer me the baptism of john wa it from heaven or of men and thei reason with themselv sai if we shall sai from heaven he will sai why then believ ye him not but and if we sai of men all the peopl will stone us for thei be persuad that john wa a prophet and thei answer that thei could not tell whenc it wa and jesu said unto them neither tell i you by what author i do these thing then began he to speak to the peopl thi parabl a certain man plant a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a far countri for a long time and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that thei should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him awai empti and again he sent anoth servant and thei beat him also and entreat him shamefulli and sent him awai empti and again he sent a third and thei wound him also and cast him out then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will send my belov son it mai be thei will rever him when thei see him but when the husbandmen saw him thei reason among themselv sai thi is the heir come let us kill him that the inherit mai be our so thei cast him out of the vineyard and kill him what therefor shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them he shall come and destroi these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to other and when thei heard it thei said god forbid and he beheld them and said what is thi then that is written the stone which the builder reject the same is becom the head of the corner whosoev shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoev it shall fall it will grind him to powder and the chief

and there wa a dark over all the earth until the ninth hour and the sun wa darken and the veil of the templ wa rent in the midst and when jesu had cri with a loud voic he said father into thy hand i commend my spirit and have said thu he gave up the ghost now when the centurion saw what wa done he glorifi god sai certainli thi wa a righteou man and all the peopl that came togeth to that sight behold the thing which were done smote their breast and return and all hi acquaint and the women that follow him from galile stood afar off behold these thing and behold there wa a man name joseph a

and bow down their face to the earth thei said unto them why seek ye the live among the dead he is not here but is risen rememb how he spake unto you when he wa yet in galile sai the son of man must be deliv into the hand of sin men and be crucifi and the third dai rise again and thei rememb hi word and return from the sepulchr and told all these thing unto the eleven and to all the rest it wa mari magdalen and joanna and mari the mother of jame and other women that were with them which told these thing unto the apostl and their word seem to them as idl tale and thei believ them not then aros peter and ran unto the sepulchr and stoop down he beheld the linen cloth laid by themselv and depart wonder in himself at that which wa come to pass and behold two of them went that same dai to a villag call emmau which wa from jerusalem about threescor furlong and thei talk togeth of all these thing which had happen and it came to pass that while thei commun togeth and reason jesu himself drew near and went with them but their ey were holden that thei should not know him and he said unto them what manner of commun ar these that ye have on to anoth as ye walk and ar sad and the on of them whose name wa cleopa answer said unto him art thou onli a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the thing which ar come to pass there in these dai and he said unto them what thing and thei said unto him concern jesu of nazareth which wa a prophet mighti in deed and word befor god and all the peopl and how the chief priest and our ruler deliv him to be condemn to death and have crucifi him but we trust that it had been he which should have redeem israel and besid all thi to dai is the third dai sinc these thing were done yea and certain women also of our compani made us astonish which were earli at the sepulchr and when thei found not hi bodi thei came sai that thei had also seen a vision of angel which said that he wa aliv and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchr and found it even so as the women had said but him thei saw not then he said unto them o fool and slow of heart to believ all that the prophet have spoken ought not christ to have suffer these thing and to enter into hi glori and begin at mose and all the prophet he expound unto them in all the scriptur the thing concern himself and thei drew nigh unto the villag whither thei went and he made as though he would have gone further but thei constrain him sai abid with us for it is toward even and the dai is far spent and he went in to tarri with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and bless it and brake and gave to them and their ey were open and thei knew him and he vanish out of their sight and thei said on to anoth did not our heart burn within us while he talk with us by the wai and while he open to us the scriptur and thei rose up the same hour and return to jerusalem and found the eleven gather togeth and them that were with them sai the lord is risen inde and hath appear to simon and thei told what thing were done in the wai and how he wa known of them in break of bread and as thei thu spake jesu himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peac be unto you but thei were terrifi and affright and suppos that thei had seen a spirit and he said unto them why ar ye troubl and why do thought aris in your heart behold my

which i spake unto you while i wa yet with you that all thing must be fulfil which were written in the law of mose and in the prophet and in the psalm concern me then open he their understand that thei might understand the scriptur and said unto them thu it is written and thu it behov christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third dai and that repent and remiss of sin should be preach in hi name among all nation begin at jerusalem and ye ar wit of these thing and behold i send the promis of my father upon you but tarri ye in the citi of jerusalem until ye be endu with power from on

comprehend it not there wa a man sent from god whose name wa john the same came for a wit to bear wit of the light that all men through him might believ he wa not that light but wa sent to bear wit of that light that wa the true light which lighteth everi man that cometh into the world he wa in the world and the world wa made by him and the world knew him not he came unto hi own and hi own receiv him not but as mani as receiv him to them gave he power to becom the son of god even to them that believ on hi name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word wa made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld hi glori the glori as of the onli begotten of the father full of grace and truth john bare wit of him and cri sai thi wa he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is prefer befor me for he wa befor me and of hi ful have all we receiv and grace for grace for the law wa given by mose but grace and truth came by jesu christ no man hath seen god at ani time the onli begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declar him and thi is the record of john when the jew sent priest and levit from jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confess and deni not but confess i am not the christ and thei ask him what then art thou elia and he saith i am not art thou that prophet and he answer no then said thei unto him who

upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptiz with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descend and remain on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holi ghost and i saw and bare record that thi is the son of god again the next dai after john stood and two of hi discipl and look upon jesu as he walk he saith behold the lamb of god and the two discipl heard him speak and thei follow jesu then jesu turn and saw them follow and saith unto them what seek ye thei said unto him rabbi which is to sai be interpret master where dwellest thou he saith unto

thou shalt be call cepha which is by interpret a stone the dai follow jesu would go forth into galile and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me now philip wa of bethsaida the citi of andrew and peter philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom mose in the law and the prophet did write jesu of nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael said unto him can there ani good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see jesu saw nathanael come to him and saith of him behold an israelit inde in whom is no guil nathanael saith unto him whenc knowest thou me jesu answer and said unto him befor that philip call thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee nathanael answer and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel jesu answer and said unto him becaus i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater thing than these and he saith unto him verili verili i sai unto you hereaft ye shall see heaven open and the angel of god ascend and descend upon the son of man and the third dai there wa a marriag in cana of galile and the mother of jesu wa there and both jesu wa call and hi discipl to the marriag and when thei want wine the mother of jesu saith unto him thei have no wine jesu saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come hi mother saith unto the servant whatsoev he saith unto you do it and there were set there six waterpot of stone after the manner of the purifi of the jew contain two or three firkin apiec jesu saith unto them fill the waterpot with water and thei fill them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and thei bare it when the ruler of the feast had tast the water that wa made wine and knew not whenc it wa but the servant which drew the water knew the governor of the feast call the bridegroom and saith unto him everi man at the begin doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is wors but thou hast kept the good wine until now thi begin of miracl did jesu in cana of galile and manifest forth hi glori and hi discipl believ on him after thi he went down to capernaum he and hi mother and hi brethren and hi discipl and thei continu there not mani dai and the jew passov wa at hand and jesu went up to jerusalem and found in the templ those that sold oxen and sheep and dove and the changer of monei sit and when he had made a scourg of small cord he drove them all out of the templ and the sheep and the oxen and pour out the changer monei and overthrew the tabl and said unto them that sold dove take these thing henc make not my father hous an hous of merchandis and hi discipl rememb that it wa written the zeal of thine hous hath eaten me up then answer the jew and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us see that thou doest these thing jesu answer and said unto them destroi thi templ and in three dai i will rais it up then said the jew forti and six year wa thi templ in build and wilt thou rear it up in three dai but he spake of the templ of hi bodi when therefor he wa risen from the dead hi discipl rememb that he had said thi unto them and thei believ the scriptur and the word which jesu had said now when he wa in jerusalem at the passov in the feast dai mani believ in hi name when thei saw the miracl which he did but jesu did not commit himself unto them becaus he knew all men and need not that ani should testifi of man for he knew what wa in man there wa a man of the pharise name nicodemu a ruler of the jew the same came to jesu by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracl that thou doest except god be with him jesu answer and said unto him verili verili i sai unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemu saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into hi mother womb and be born jesu answer verili verili i sai unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whenc it cometh and whither it goeth so is everi on that is born of the spirit nicodemu answer and said unto him how can these thing be jesu answer and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these thing verili verili i sai unto thee we speak that we do know and testifi that we have seen and ye receiv not our wit if i have told you earthli thing and ye believ not how shall ye believ if i tell you of heavenli thing and no man hath ascend up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as mose lift up the serpent in the wilder even so must the son of man be lift up that whosoev believeth in him should not perish but have etern life for god so love the world that he gave hi onli begotten son that whosoev believeth in him should not perish but have everlast life for god sent not hi son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be save he that believeth on him is not condemn but he that believeth not is condemn alreadi becaus he hath not believ in the name of the onli begotten son of god and thi is the condemn that light is come into the world and men love dark rather than light becaus their deed were evil for everi on that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest hi deed should be reprov but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that hi deed mai be made manifest that thei ar wrought in god after these thing came jesu and hi discipl into the land of judaea and there he tarri with them and baptiz and john also wa baptiz in aenon near to salim becaus there wa much water there and thei came and were baptiz for john wa not yet cast into prison then there aros a question between some of john discipl and the jew about purifi and thei came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that wa with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest wit behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him john answer and said a man can receiv noth except it be given him from heaven ye yourselv bear me wit that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent befor him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatli becaus of the bridegroom voic thi my joi therefor is fulfil he must increas but i must decreas he that cometh from abov is abov all he that is of the earth is earthli and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is abov all and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth hi testimoni he that hath receiv hi testimoni hath set to hi seal that god is true for he whom god hath sent speaketh the word of god for god giveth not the spirit by measur unto him the father loveth the son and hath given all thing into hi hand he that believeth on the son hath everlast life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him when therefor the lord knew how the pharise had heard that jesu made and baptiz more discipl than john though jesu himself baptiz not but hi discipl he left judaea and depart again into galile and he must need go through samaria then cometh he to a citi of samaria which is call sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to hi son joseph now jacob well wa there jesu therefor be weari with hi journei sat thu on the well and it wa about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of samaria to

am a woman of samaria for the jew have no deal with the samaritan jesu answer and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have ask of him and he would have given thee live water the woman saith unto him sir thou hast noth to draw with and the well is deep from whenc then hast thou that live water art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and hi children and hi cattl jesu answer and said unto her whosoev drinketh of thi water shall thirst again but whosoev drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water spring up into everlast life the woman saith unto him sir give me thi water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw jesu saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answer and said i have no husband jesu said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband for thou hast had five husband and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truli the woman saith unto him sir i perceiv that thou art a prophet our father worship in thi mountain and ye sai that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesu saith unto her woman believ me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in thi mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvat is of the jew but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipp shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and thei that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him i know that messia cometh which is call christ when he is come he will tell us all thing jesu saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he and upon thi came hi discipl and marvel that he talk with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her waterpot and went her wai into the citi and saith to the men come see a man which told me all thing that ever i did is not thi the christ then thei went out of the citi and came unto him in the mean while hi discipl prai him sai master eat but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of therefor said the discipl on to anoth hath ani man brought him ought to eat jesu saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish hi work sai not ye there ar yet four month and then cometh harvest behold i sai unto you lift up your ey and look on the field for thei ar white alreadi to harvest and he that reapeth receiveth wage and gathereth fruit unto life etern that both he that soweth and he that reapeth mai rejoic togeth and herein is that sai true on soweth and anoth reapeth i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestow no labour other men labour and ye ar enter into their labour and mani of the samaritan of that citi believ on him for the sai of the woman which testifi he told me all that ever i did so when the samaritan were come unto him thei besought him that he would tarri with them and he abod there two dai and mani more believ becaus of hi own word and said unto the woman now we believ not becaus of thy sai for we have heard him ourselv and know that thi is inde the christ the saviour of the world now after two dai he depart thenc and went into galile for jesu himself testifi that a prophet hath no honour in hi own countri then when he wa come into galile the galilaean receiv him have seen all the thing that he did at jerusalem at the feast for thei also went unto the feast so jesu came again into cana of galile where he made the water wine and there wa a certain nobleman whose son wa sick at capernaum when he heard that jesu wa come out of judaea into galile he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal hi son for he wa at the point of death then said jesu unto him except ye see sign and wonder ye will not believ the nobleman saith unto him sir come down er my child die jesu saith unto him go thy wai thy son liveth and the man believ the word that jesu had spoken unto him and he went hi wai and as he wa now go down hi servant met him and told him sai thy son liveth then enquir he of them the hour when he began to amend and thei said unto him yesterdai at the seventh hour the fever left him so the father knew that it wa at the same hour in the which jesu said unto him thy son liveth and himself believ and hi whole hous thi is again the second miracl that jesu did when he wa come out of judaea into galile after thi there wa a feast of the jew and jesu went up to jerusalem now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is call in the hebrew tongu bethesda have five porch in these lai a great multitud of impot folk of blind halt wither wait for the move of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubl the water whosoev then first after the troubl of the water step in wa made whole of whatsoev diseas he had and a certain man wa there which had an infirm thirti and eight year when jesu saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole the impot man answer him sir i have no man when the water is troubl to put me into the pool but while i am come anoth steppeth down befor me jesu saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immedi the man wa made whole and took up hi bed and walk and on the same dai wa the sabbath the jew therefor said unto him that wa cure it is the sabbath dai it is not law for thee to carri thy bed he answer them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk then ask thei him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that wa heal wist not who it wa for jesu had convei himself awai a multitud be in that place afterward jesu findeth him in the templ and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a wors thing come unto thee the man depart and told the jew that it wa jesu which had made him whole and therefor did the jew persecut jesu and sought to slai him becaus he had done these thing on the sabbath dai but jesu answer them my father worketh hitherto and i work therefor the jew sought the more to kill him becaus he not onli had broken the sabbath but said also that god wa hi father make himself equal with god then answer jesu and said unto them verili verili i sai unto you the son can do noth of himself but what he seeth the father do for what thing soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewis for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all thing that himself doeth and he will shew him greater work than these that ye mai marvel for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but hath commit all judgment unto the son that all men should honour the son even as thei honour the father he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him verili verili i sai unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlast life and shall not come into condemn but is pass from death unto life verili verili i sai unto you the hour is come and now is when the dead shall hear the voic of the son of god and thei that hear shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and hath given him author to execut judgment also becaus he is the son of man marvel not at thi for the hour is come in the which all that ar in the grave shall hear hi voic and shall come forth thei that have done good unto the resurrect of life and thei that have done evil unto the resurrect of damnat i can of mine own self do noth as i hear i judg and my judgment is just becaus i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me if i bear wit of myself my wit is not true there is anoth that beareth wit of me and i know that the wit which he witnesseth of me is true ye sent unto john and he bare wit unto the truth but i receiv not testimoni from man but these thing i sai that ye might be save he wa a burn and a shine light and ye were will for a season to rejoic in hi light but i have greater wit than that of john for the work which the father hath given me to finish the same work that i do bear wit of me that the father hath sent me and the father himself which hath sent me hath born wit of me ye have neither heard hi voic at ani time nor seen hi shape and ye have not hi word abid in you for whom he hath sent him ye believ not search the scriptur for in them ye think ye have etern life and thei ar thei which testifi of me and ye will not come to me that ye might have life i receiv not honour from men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you i am come in my father name and ye receiv me not if anoth shall come in hi own name him ye will receiv how can ye believ which receiv honour on of anoth and seek not the honour that cometh from god onli do not think that i will accus you to the father there is on that accuseth you even mose in whom ye trust for had ye believ mose ye would have believ me for he wrote of me but if ye believ not hi write how shall ye believ my word after these thing jesu went over the sea of galile which is the sea of tiberia and a great multitud follow him becaus thei saw hi miracl which he did on them that were diseas and jesu went up into a mountain and there he sat with hi discipl and the passov a feast of the jew wa nigh when jesu then lift up hi ey and saw a great compani come unto him he saith unto philip whenc shall we bui bread that these mai eat and thi he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do philip answer him two hundr pennyworth of bread is not suffici for them that everi on of them mai take a littl on of hi discipl andrew simon peter brother saith unto him there is a lad here which hath five barlei loav and two small fish but what ar thei among so mani and jesu said make the men sit down now there wa much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand and jesu took the loav and when he had given thank he distribut to the discipl and the discipl to them that were set down and likewis of the fish as much as thei would when thei were fill he said unto hi discipl gather up the fragment that remain that noth be lost therefor thei gather them togeth and fill twelv basket with the fragment of the five barlei loav which remain over and abov unto them that had eaten then those men when thei had seen the miracl that jesu did said thi is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world when jesu therefor perceiv that thei would come and take him by forc to make him a king he depart again into a mountain himself alon and when even wa now come hi discipl went down unto the sea and enter into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum and it wa now dark and jesu wa not come to them and the sea aros by reason of a great wind that blew so when thei had row about five and twenti or thirti furlong thei see jesu walk on the sea and draw nigh unto the ship and thei were afraid but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid then thei willingli receiv him into the ship and immedi the ship wa at the land whither thei went the dai follow when the peopl which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there wa none other boat there save that on whereinto hi discipl were enter and that jesu went not with hi discipl into the boat but that hi discipl were gone awai alon howbeit there came other boat from tiberia nigh unto the place where thei did eat bread after that the lord had given thank when the peopl therefor saw that jesu wa not there neither hi discipl thei also took ship and came to capernaum seek for jesu and when thei had found him on the other side of the sea thei said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither jesu answer them and said verili verili i sai unto you ye seek me not becaus ye saw the miracl but becaus ye did eat of the loav and were fill labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlast life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father seal then said thei unto him what shall we do that we might work the work of god jesu answer and said unto them thi is the work of god that ye believ on him whom he hath sent thei said therefor unto him what sign shewest thou then that we mai see and believ thee what dost thou work our father did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesu said unto them verili verili i sai unto you mose gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said thei unto him lord evermor give us thi bread and jesu said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believ not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and thi is the father will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose noth but should rais it up again at the last dai and thi is the will of him that sent me that everi on which seeth the son and believeth on him mai have everlast life and i will rais him up at the last dai the jew then murmur at him becaus he said i am the bread which came down from heaven and thei said is not thi jesu the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven jesu therefor answer and said unto them murmur not among yourselv no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will rais him up at the last dai it is written in the prophet and thei shall be all taught of god everi man therefor that hath heard and hath learn of the father cometh unto me not that ani man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father verili verili i sai unto you he that believeth on me hath everlast life i am that bread of life your father did eat manna in the wilder and ar dead thi is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man mai eat thereof and not die i am the live bread which came down from heaven if ani man eat of thi bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jew therefor strove among themselv sai how can thi man give us hi flesh to eat then jesu said unto them verili verili i sai unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink hi blood ye have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath etern life and i will rais him up at the last dai for my flesh is meat inde and my blood is drink inde he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the live father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me thi is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father did eat manna and ar dead he that eateth of thi bread shall live for ever these thing said he in the synagogu as he taught in capernaum mani therefor of hi discipl when thei had heard thi said thi is an hard sai who can hear it when jesu knew in himself that hi discipl murmur at it he said unto them doth thi offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he wa befor it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth noth the word that i speak unto you thei ar spirit and thei ar life but there ar some of you that believ not for jesu knew from the begin who thei were that believ not and who should betrai him and he said therefor said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time mani of hi discipl went back and walk no more with him then said jesu unto the twelv will ye also go awai then simon peter answer him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the word of etern life and we believ and ar sure that thou art that christ the son of the live god jesu answer them have not i chosen you twelv and on of you is a devil he spake of juda iscariot the son of simon for he it wa that should betrai him be on of the twelv after these thing jesu walk in galile for he would not walk in jewri becaus the jew sought to kill him now the jew feast of tabernacl wa at hand hi brethren therefor said unto him depart henc and go into judaea that thy discipl also mai see the work that thou doest for there is no man that doeth ani thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openli if thou do these thing shew thyself to the world for neither did hi brethren believ in him then jesu said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alwai readi the world cannot hate you but me it hateth becaus i testifi of it that the work thereof ar evil go ye up unto thi feast i go not up yet unto thi feast for my time is not yet full come when he had said these word unto them he abod still in galile but when hi brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openli but as it were in secret then the jew sought him at the feast and said where is he and there wa much murmur among the peopl concern him for some said he is a good man other said nai but he deceiveth the peopl howbeit no man spake openli of him for fear of the jew now about the midst of the feast jesu went up into the templ and taught and the jew marvel sai how knoweth thi man letter have never learn jesu answer them and said my doctrin is not mine but hi that sent me if ani man will do hi will he shall know of the doctrin whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself he that speaketh of himself seeketh hi own glori but he that seeketh hi glori that sent him the same is true and no unright is in him did not mose give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law why go ye about to kill me the peopl answer and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee jesu answer and said unto them i have done on work and ye all marvel mose therefor gave unto you circumcis not becaus it is of mose but of the father and ye on the sabbath dai circumcis a man if a man on the sabbath dai receiv circumcis that the law of mose should not be broken ar ye angri at me becaus i have made a man everi whit whole on the sabbath dai judg not accord to the appear but judg righteou judgment then said some of them of jerusalem is not thi he whom thei seek to kill but lo he speaketh boldli and thei sai noth unto him do the ruler know inde that thi is the veri christ howbeit we know thi man whenc he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whenc he is then cri jesu in the templ as he taught sai ye both know me and ye know whenc i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me then thei sought to take him but no man laid hand on him becaus hi hour wa not yet come and mani of the peopl believ on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracl than these which thi man hath done the pharise heard that the peopl murmur such thing concern him and the pharise and the chief priest sent offic to take him then said jesu unto them yet a littl while am i with you and then i go unto him that sent me ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come then said the jew among themselv whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go unto the dispers among the gentil and teach the gentil what manner of sai is thi that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come in the last dai that great dai of the feast jesu stood and cri sai if ani man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scriptur hath said out of hi belli shall flow river of live water but thi spake he of the spirit which thei that believ on him should receiv for the holi ghost wa not yet given becaus that jesu wa not yet glorifi mani of the peopl therefor when thei heard thi sai said of a truth thi is the prophet other said thi is the christ but some said shall christ come out of galile hath not the scriptur said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david wa so there wa a divis among the peopl becaus of him and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hand on him then came the offic to the chief priest and pharise and thei said unto them why have ye not brought him the offic answer never man spake like thi man then answer them the pharise ar ye also deceiv have ani of the ruler or of the pharise believ on him but thi peopl who knoweth not the law ar curs nicodemu saith unto them he that came to jesu by night be on of them doth our law judg ani man befor it hear him and know what he doeth thei answer and said unto him art thou also of galile search and look for out of galile ariseth no prophet and everi man went unto hi own hous jesu went unto the mount of oliv and earli in the morn he came again into the templ and all the peopl came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribe and pharise brought unto him a woman taken in adulteri and when thei had set her in the midst thei sai unto him master thi woman wa taken in adulteri in the veri act now mose in the law command us that such should be stone but what sayest thou thi thei said tempt him that thei might have to accus him but jesu stoop down and with hi finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when thei continu ask him he lift up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stoop down and wrote on the ground and thei which heard it be convict by their own conscienc went out on by on begin at the eldest even unto the last and jesu wa left alon and the woman stand in the midst when jesu had lift up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where ar those thine accus hath no man condemn thee she said no man lord and jesu said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more then spake jesu again unto them sai i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in dark but shall have the light of life the pharise therefor said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true jesu answer and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whenc i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whenc i come and whither i go ye judg after the flesh i judg no man and yet if i judg my judgment is true for i am not alon but i and the father that sent me it is also written in your law that the testimoni of two men is true i am on that bear wit of myself and the father that sent me beareth wit of me then said thei unto him where is thy father jesu answer ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also these word spake jesu in the treasuri as he taught in the templ and no man laid hand on him for hi hour wa not yet come then said jesu again unto them i go my wai and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sin whither i go ye cannot come then said the jew will he kill himself becaus he saith whither i go ye cannot come and he said unto them ye ar from beneath i am from abov ye ar of thi world i am not of thi world i said therefor unto you that ye shall die in your sin for if ye believ not that i am he ye shall die in your sin then said thei unto him who art thou and jesu saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the begin i have mani thing to sai and to judg of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those thing which i have heard of him thei understood not that he spake to them of the father then said jesu unto them when ye have lift up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do noth of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these thing and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alon for i do alwai those thing that pleas him as he spake these word mani believ on him then said jesu to those jew which believ on him if ye continu in my word then ar ye my discipl inde and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free thei answer him we be abraham seed and were never in bondag to ani man how sayest thou ye shall be made free jesu answer them verili verili i sai unto you whosoev committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the hous for ever but the son abideth ever if the son therefor shall make you free ye shall be free inde i know that ye ar abraham seed but ye seek to kill me becaus my word hath no place in you i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father thei answer and said unto him abraham is our father jesu saith unto them if ye were abraham children ye would do the work of abraham but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god thi did not abraham ye do the deed of your father then said thei to him we be not born of fornic we have on father even god jesu said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceed forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do ye not understand my speech even becaus ye cannot hear my word ye ar of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he wa a murder from the begin and abod not in the truth becaus there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of hi own for he is a liar and the father of it and becaus i tell you the truth ye believ me not which of you convinceth me of sin and if i sai the truth why do ye not believ me he that is of god heareth god word ye therefor hear them not becaus ye ar not of god then answer the jew and said unto him sai we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil jesu answer i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me and i seek not mine own glori there is on that seeketh and judgeth verili verili i sai unto you if a man keep my sai he shall never see death then said the jew unto him now we know that thou hast a devil abraham is dead and the prophet and thou sayest if a man keep my sai he shall never tast of death art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the prophet ar dead whom makest thou thyself jesu answer if i honour myself my honour is noth it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye sai that he is your god yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should sai i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep hi sai your father abraham rejoic to see my dai and he saw it and wa glad then said the jew unto him thou art not yet fifti year old and hast thou seen abraham jesu said unto them verili verili i sai unto you befor abraham wa i am then took thei up stone to cast at him but jesu hid himself and went out of the templ go through the midst of them and so pass by and as jesu pass by he saw a man which wa blind from hi birth and hi discipl ask him sai master who did sin thi man or hi parent that he wa born blind jesu answer neither hath thi man sin nor hi parent but that the work of god should be made manifest in him i must work the work of him that sent me while it is dai the night cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world when he had thu spoken he spat on the ground and made clai of the spittl and he anoint the ey of the blind man with the clai and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpret sent he went hi wai therefor and wash and came see the neighbour therefor and thei which befor had seen him that he wa blind said is not thi he that sat and beg some said thi is he other said he is like him but he said i am he therefor said thei unto him how were thine ey open he answer and said a man that is call jesu made clai and anoint mine ey and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and wash and i receiv sight then said thei unto him where is he he said i know not thei brought to the pharise him that aforetim wa blind and it wa the sabbath dai when jesu made the clai and open hi ey then again the pharise also ask him how he had receiv hi sight he said unto them he put clai upon mine ey and i wash and do see therefor said some of the pharise thi man is not of god becaus he keepeth not the sabbath dai other said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracl and there wa a divis among them thei sai unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath open thine ey he said he is a prophet but the jew did not believ concern him that he had been blind and receiv hi sight until thei call the parent of him that had receiv hi sight and thei ask them sai is thi your son who ye sai wa born blind how then doth he now see hi parent answer them and said we know that thi is our son and that he wa born blind but by what mean he now seeth we know not or who hath open hi ey we know not he is of ag ask him he shall speak for himself these word spake hi parent becaus thei fear the jew for the jew had agre alreadi that if ani man did confess that he wa christ he should be put out of the synagogu therefor said hi parent he is of ag ask him then again call thei the man that wa blind and said unto him give god the prais we know that thi man is a sinner he answer and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not on thing i know that wherea i wa blind now i see then said thei to him again what did he to thee how open he thine ey he answer them i have told you alreadi and ye did not hear wherefor would ye hear it again will ye also be hi discipl then thei revil him and said thou art hi discipl but we ar mose discipl we know that god spake unto mose as for thi fellow we know not from whenc he is the man answer and said unto them why herein is a marvel thing that ye know not from whenc he is and yet he hath open mine ey now we know that god heareth not sinner but if ani man be a worshipp of god and doeth hi will him he heareth sinc the world began wa it not heard that ani man open the ey of on that wa born blind if thi man were not of god he could do noth thei answer and said unto him thou wast altogeth born in sin and dost thou teach us and thei cast him out jesu heard that thei had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dost thou believ on the son of god he answer and said who is he lord that i might believ on him and jesu said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believ and he worship him and jesu said for judgment i am come into thi world that thei which see not might see and that thei which see might be made blind and some of the pharise which were with him heard these word and said unto him ar we blind also jesu said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye sai we see therefor your sin remaineth verili verili i sai unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other wai the same is a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear hi voic and he calleth hi own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he putteth forth hi own sheep he goeth befor them and the sheep follow him for thei know hi voic and a stranger will thei not follow but will flee from him for thei know not the voic of stranger thi parabl spake jesu unto them but thei understood not what thing thei were which he spake unto them then said jesu unto them again verili verili i sai unto you i am the door of the sheep all that ever came befor me ar thiev and robber but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if ani man enter in he shall be save and shall go in and out and find pastur the thief

sick he abod two dai still in the same place where he wa then after that saith he to hi discipl let us go into judaea again hi discipl sai unto him master the jew of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again jesu answer ar there not twelv hour in the dai if ani man walk in the dai he stumbleth not becaus he seeth the light of thi world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth becaus there is no light in him these thing said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazaru sleepeth but i go that i mai awak him out of sleep then said hi discipl lord if he sleep he shall do well howbeit jesu spake of hi death but thei thought that he had spoken of take of rest in sleep then said jesu unto them plainli lazaru is dead and i am glad for your sake that i wa not there to the intent ye mai believ nevertheless let us go unto him then said thoma which is call didymu unto hi fellowdiscipl let us also go that we mai die with him then when jesu came he found that he had lain in the grave four dai alreadi now bethani wa nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlong off and mani of the jew came to martha and mari to comfort them concern their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesu wa come went and met him but mari sat still in the hous then said martha unto jesu lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not di but i know that even now whatsoev thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee jesu saith unto her thy brother shall rise again martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrect at the last dai jesu said unto her i am the resurrect and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoev liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou thi she saith unto him yea lord i believ that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world and when she had so said she went her wai and call mari her sister secretli sai the master is come and calleth for thee as soon as she heard that she aros quickli and came unto him now jesu wa not yet come into the town but wa in that place where martha met him the jew then which were with her in the hous and comfort her when thei saw mari that she rose up hastili and went out follow her sai she goeth unto the grave to weep there then when mari wa come where jesu wa and saw him she fell down at hi feet sai unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not di when jesu therefor saw her weep and the jew also weep which came with her he groan in the spirit and wa troubl and said where have ye laid him thei said unto him lord come and see jesu wept then said the jew behold how he love him and some of them said could not thi man which open the ey of the blind have caus that even thi man should not have di jesu therefor again groan in himself cometh to the grave it wa a cave and a stone lai upon it jesu said take ye awai the stone martha the sister of him that wa dead saith unto him lord by thi time he stinketh for he hath been dead four dai jesu saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believ thou shouldest see the glori of god then thei took awai the stone from the place where the dead wa laid and jesu lift up hi ey and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me and i knew that thou hearest me alwai but becaus of the peopl which stand by i said it that thei mai believ that thou hast sent me and when he thu had spoken he cri with a loud voic lazaru come forth and he that wa dead came forth bound hand and foot with gravecloth and hi face wa bound about with a napkin jesu saith unto them loos him and let him go then mani of the jew which came to mari and had seen the thing which jesu did believ on him but some of them went their wai to the pharise and told them what thing jesu had done then gather the chief priest and the pharise a council and said what do we for thi man doeth mani miracl if we let him thu alon all men will believ on him and the roman shall come and take awai both our place and nation and on of them name caiapha be the high priest that same year said unto them ye know noth at all nor consid that it is expedi for us that on man should die for the peopl and that the whole nation perish not and thi spake he not of himself but be high priest that year he prophesi that jesu should die for that nation and not for that nation onli but that also he should gather togeth in on the children of god that were scatter abroad then from that dai forth thei took counsel togeth for to put him to death jesu therefor walk no more openli among the jew but went thenc unto a countri near to the wilder into a citi call ephraim and there continu with hi discipl and the jew passov wa nigh at hand and mani went out of the countri up to jerusalem befor the passov to purifi themselv then sought thei for jesu and spake among themselv as thei stood in the templ what think ye that he will not come to the feast now both the chief priest and the pharise had given a command that if ani man knew where he were he should shew it that thei might take him then jesu six dai befor the passov came to bethani where lazaru wa which had been dead whom he rais from the dead there thei made him a supper and martha serv but lazaru wa on of them that sat at the tabl with him then took mari a pound of ointment of spikenard veri costli and anoint the feet of jesu and wipe hi feet with her hair and the hous wa fill with the odour of the ointment then saith on of hi discipl juda iscariot simon son which should betrai him why wa not thi ointment sold for three hundr penc and given to the poor thi he said not that he care for the poor but becaus he wa a thief and had the bag and bare what wa put therein then said jesu let her alon against the dai of my buri hath she kept thi for the poor alwai ye have with you but me ye have not alwai much peopl of the jew therefor knew that he wa there and thei came not for jesu sake onli but that thei might see lazaru also whom he had rais from the dead but the chief priest consult that thei might put lazaru also to death becaus that by reason of him mani of the jew went awai and believ on jesu on the next dai much peopl that were come to the feast when thei heard that jesu wa come to jerusalem took branch of palm tree and went forth to meet him and cri hosanna bless is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord and jesu when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is written fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sit on an asss colt these thing understood not hi discipl at the first but when jesu wa glorifi then rememb thei that these thing were written of him and that thei had done these thing unto him the peopl therefor that wa with him when he call lazaru out of hi grave and rais him from the dead bare record for thi caus the peopl also met him for that thei heard that he had done thi miracl the pharise therefor said among themselv perceiv ye how ye prevail noth behold the world is gone after him and there were certain greek among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefor to philip which wa of bethsaida of galile and desir him sai sir we would see jesu philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesu and jesu answer them sai the hour is come that the son of man should be glorifi verili verili i sai unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alon but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth hi life shall lose it and he that hateth hi life in thi world shall keep it unto life etern if ani man serv me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if ani man serv me him will my father honour now is my soul troubl and what shall i sai father save me from thi hour but for thi caus came i unto thi hour father glorifi thy name then came there a voic from heaven sai i have both glorifi it and will glorifi it again the peopl therefor that stood by and heard it said that it thunder other said an angel spake to him jesu answer and said thi voic came not becaus of me but for your sake now is the judgment of thi world now shall the princ of thi world be cast out and i if i be lift up from the earth will draw all men unto me thi he said signifi what death he should die the peopl answer him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lift up who is thi son of man then jesu said unto them yet a littl while is the light with you walk while ye have the light lest dark come upon you for he that walketh in dark knoweth not whither he goeth while ye have light believ in the light that ye mai be the children of light these thing spake jesu and depart and did hide himself from them but though he had done so mani miracl befor them yet thei believ not on him that the sai of esaia the prophet might be fulfil which he spake lord who hath believ our report and to whom hath the arm of the lord been reveal therefor thei could not believ becaus that esaia said again he hath blind their ey and harden their heart that thei should not see with their ey nor understand with their heart and be convert and i should heal them these thing said esaia when he saw hi glori and spake of him nevertheless among the chief ruler also mani believ on him but becaus of the pharise thei did not confess him lest thei should be put out of the synagogu for thei love the prais of men more than the prais of god jesu cri and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me i am come a light into the world that whosoev believeth on me should not abid in dark and if ani man hear my word and believ not i judg him not for i came not to judg the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my word hath on that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judg him in the last dai for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a command what i should sai and what i should speak and i know that hi command is life everlast whatsoev i speak therefor even as the father said unto me so i speak now befor the feast of the passov when jesu knew that hi hour wa come that he should depart out of thi world unto the father have love hi own which were in the world he love them unto the end and supper be end the devil have now put into the heart of juda iscariot simon son to betrai him jesu know that the father had given all thing into hi hand and that he wa come from god and went to god he riseth from supper and laid asid hi garment and took a towel and gird himself after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the discipl feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he wa gird then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet jesu answer and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereaft peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesu answer him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet onli but also my hand and my head jesu saith to him he that is wash needeth not save to wash hi feet but is clean everi whit and ye ar clean but not all for he knew who should betrai him therefor said he ye ar not all clean so after he had wash their feet and had taken hi garment and wa set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you ye call me master and lord and ye sai well for so i am if i then your lord and master have wash your feet ye also ought to wash on anoth feet for i have given you an exampl that ye should do as i have done to you verili verili i sai unto you the servant is not greater than hi lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these thing happi ar ye if ye do them i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scriptur mai be fulfil he that eateth bread with me hath lift up hi heel against me now i tell you befor it come that when it is come to pass ye mai believ that i am he verili verili i sai unto you he that receiveth whomsoev i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me when jesu had thu said he wa troubl in spirit and testifi and said verili verili i sai unto you that on of you shall betrai me then the discipl look on on anoth doubt of whom he spake now there wa lean on jesu bosom on of hi discipl whom jesu love simon peter therefor beckon to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake he then ly on jesu breast saith unto him lord who is it jesu answer he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dip it and when he had dip the sop he gave it to juda iscariot the son of simon and after the sop satan enter into him then said jesu unto him that thou doest do quickli now no man at the tabl knew for what intent he spake thi unto him for some of them thought becaus juda had the bag that jesu had said unto him bui those thing that we have need of against the feast or that he should give someth to the poor he then have receiv the sop went immedi out and it wa night therefor when he wa gone out jesu said now is the son of man glorifi and god is glorifi in him if god be glorifi in him god shall also glorifi him in himself and shall straightwai glorifi him littl children yet a littl while i am with you ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jew whither i go ye cannot come so now i sai to you a new command i give unto you that ye love on anoth as i have love you that ye also love on anoth by thi shall all men know that ye ar my discipl if ye have love on to anoth simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesu answer him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterward peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i will lai down my life for thy sake jesu answer him wilt thou lai down thy life for my sake verili verili

known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us jesu saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the word that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work believ me that i am in the father and the father in me or els believ me for the veri work sake verili verili i sai unto you he that believeth on me the work that i do shall he do also and greater work than these shall he do becaus i go unto my father and whatsoev ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father mai be glorifi in the son if ye shall ask ani thing in my name i will do it if ye love me keep my command and i will prai the father and he shall give you anoth comfort that he mai abid with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receiv becaus it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will

than hi lord if thei have persecut me thei will also persecut you if thei have kept my sai thei will keep your also but all these thing will thei do unto you for my name sake becaus thei know not him that sent me if i had not come and spoken unto them thei had not had sin but now thei have no cloak for their sin he that hateth me hateth my father also if i had not done among them the work which none other man did thei had not had sin but now have thei both seen and hate both me and my father but thi cometh to pass that the word might be fulfil that is written in their law thei hate me

should not die yet jesu said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarri till i come what is that to thee thi is the discipl which testifieth of these thing and wrote these thing and we know that hi testimoni is true and there ar also mani other thing which jesu did the which if thei should be written everi on i suppos that even the world itself could not contain the book that should be written amen the act of the apostl the former treatis have i made o theophilu of all that jesu began both to do and teach until the dai in which he wa taken up after that he through the holi ghost

first god have rais up hi son jesu sent him to bless you in turn awai everi on of you from hi iniqu and as thei spake unto the peopl the priest and the captain of the templ and the sadduce came upon them be griev that thei taught the peopl and preach through jesu the resurrect from the dead and thei laid hand on them and put them in hold unto the next dai for it wa now eventid howbeit mani of them which heard the word believ and the number of the men wa about five thousand and it came to pass on the morrow that their ruler and elder and scribe and anna the high priest and caiapha and john and alexand and as mani as were of the kindr of the high priest were gather togeth at jerusalem and when thei had set them in the midst thei ask by what power or by what name have ye done thi then peter fill with the holi ghost said unto them ye ruler of the peopl and elder of israel if we thi dai be examin of the good deed done to the impot man by what mean he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the peopl of israel that by the name of jesu christ of nazareth whom ye crucifi whom god rais from the dead even by him doth thi man stand here befor you whole thi is the stone which wa set at nought of you builder which is becom the head of the corner neither is there salvat in ani other for there is none other name under heaven given among men wherebi we must be save now when thei saw the bold of peter and john and perceiv that thei were unlearn and ignor men thei marvel and thei took knowledg of them that thei had been with jesu and behold the man which wa heal stand with them thei could sai noth against it but when thei had command them to go asid out of the council thei confer among themselv sai what shall we do to these men for that inde a notabl miracl hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deni it but that it spread no further among the peopl let us straitli threaten them that thei speak henceforth to no man in thi name and thei call them and command them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesu but peter and john answer and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judg ye for we cannot but speak the thing which we have seen and heard so when thei had further threaten them thei let them go find noth how thei might punish them becaus of the peopl for all men glorifi god for that which wa done for the man wa abov forti year old on whom thi miracl of heal wa shew and be let go thei went to their own compani and report all that the chief priest and elder had said unto them and when thei heard that thei lift up their voic to god with on accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the peopl imagin vain thing the king of the earth stood up and the ruler were gather togeth against the lord and against hi christ for of a truth against thy holi child jesu whom thou hast anoint both herod and pontiu pilat with the gentil and the peopl of israel were gather togeth for to do whatsoev thy hand and thy counsel determin befor to be done and now lord behold their threaten and grant unto thy servant that with all bold thei mai speak thy word by stretch forth thine hand to heal and that sign and wonder mai be done by the name of thy holi child jesu and when thei had prai the place wa shaken where thei were assembl togeth and thei were all fill with the holi ghost and thei spake the word of god with bold and the multitud of them that believ were of on heart and of on soul neither said ani of them that ought of the thing which he possess wa hi own but thei had all thing common and with great power gave the apostl wit of the resurrect of the lord jesu and great grace wa upon them all neither wa there ani among them that lack for as mani as were possessor of land or hous sold them and brought the price of the thing that were sold and laid them down at the apostl feet and distribut wa made unto everi man accord as he had need and jose who by the apostl wa surnam barnaba which is be interpret the son of consol a levit and of the countri of cypru have land sold it and brought the monei and laid it at the apostl feet but a certain man name anania with sapphira hi wife sold a possess and kept back part of the price hi wife also be privi to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostl feet but peter said anania why hath satan fill thine heart to lie to the holi ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land while it remain wa it not thine own and after it wa sold wa it not in thine own power why hast thou conceiv thi thing in thine heart thou hast not li unto men but unto god and anania hear these word fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these thing and the young men aros wound him up and carri him out and buri him and it wa about the space of three hour after when hi wife not know what wa done came in and peter answer unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yea for so much then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agre togeth to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buri thy husband ar at the door and shall carri thee out then fell she down straightwai at hi feet and yield up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carri her forth buri her by her husband and great fear came upon all the church and upon as mani as heard these thing and by the hand of the apostl were mani sign and wonder wrought among the peopl and thei were all with on accord in solomon porch and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the peopl magnifi them and believ were the more ad to the lord multitud both of men and women insomuch that thei brought forth the sick into the street and laid them on bed and couch that at the least the shadow of peter pass by might overshadow some of them there came also a multitud out of the citi round about unto jerusalem bring sick folk and them which were vex with unclean spirit and thei were heal everi on then the high priest rose up and all thei that were with him which is the sect of the sadduce and were fill with indign and laid their hand on the apostl and put them in the common prison but the angel of the lord by night open the prison door and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the templ to the peopl all the word of thi life and when thei heard that thei enter into the templ earli in the morn and taught but the high priest came and thei that were with him and call the council togeth and all the senat of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the offic came and found them not in the prison thei return and told sai the prison truli found we shut with all safeti and the keeper stand without befor the door but when we had open we found no man within now when the high priest and the captain of the templ and the chief priest heard these thing thei doubt of them whereunto thi would grow then came on and told them sai behold the men whom ye put in prison ar stand in the templ and teach the peopl then went the captain with the offic and brought them without violenc for thei fear the peopl lest thei should have been stone and when thei had brought them thei set them befor the council and the high priest ask them sai did not we straitli command you that ye should not teach in thi name and behold ye have fill jerusalem with your doctrin and intend to bring thi man blood upon us then peter and the other apostl answer and said we ought to obei god rather than men the god of our father rais up jesu whom ye slew and hang on a tree him hath god exalt with hi right hand to be a princ and a saviour for to give repent to israel and forgiv of sin and we ar hi wit of these thing and so is also the holi ghost whom god hath given to them that obei him when thei heard that thei were cut to the heart and took counsel to slai them then stood there up on in the council a pharise name gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reput among all the peopl and command to put the apostl forth a littl space and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselv what ye intend to do as touch these men for befor these dai rose up theuda boast himself to be somebodi to whom a number of men about four hundr join themselv who wa slain and all as mani as obei him were scatter and brought to nought after thi man rose up juda of galile in the dai of the tax and drew awai much peopl after him he also perish and all even as mani as obei him were dispers and now i sai unto you refrain from these men and let them alon for if thi counsel or thi work be of men it will come to nought but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest hapli ye be found even to fight against god and to him thei agre and when thei had call the apostl

a work in your dai a work which ye shall in no wise believ though a man declar it unto you and when the jew were gone out of the synagogu the gentil besought that these word might be preach to them the next sabbath now when the congreg wa broken up mani of the jew and religi proselyt follow paul and barnaba who speak to them persuad them to continu in the grace of god and the next sabbath dai came almost the whole citi togeth to hear the word of god but when the jew saw the multitud thei were fill with envi and spake against those thing which were spoken by paul contradict and blasphem then paul and barnaba wax bold and said it wa necessari that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but see ye put it from you and judg yourselv unworthi of everlast life lo we turn to the gentil for so hath the lord command us sai i have set thee to be a light of the gentil that thou shouldest be for salvat unto the end of the earth and when the gentil heard thi thei were glad and glorifi the word of the lord and as mani as were ordain to etern life believ and the word of the lord wa publish throughout all the region but the jew stir up the devout and honour women and the chief men of the citi and rais persecut against paul and barnaba and expel them out of their coast but thei shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium and the discipl were fill with joi and with the holi ghost and it came to pass in iconium that thei went both togeth into the synagogu of the jew and so spake that a great multitud both of the jew and also of the greek believ but the unbeliev jew stir up the gentil and made their mind evil affect against the brethren long time therefor abod thei speak boldli in the lord which gave testimoni unto the word of hi grace and grant sign and wonder to be done by their hand but the multitud of the citi wa divid and part held with the jew and part with the apostl and when there wa an assault made both of the gentil and also of the jew with their ruler to us them despitefulli and to stone them thei were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derb citi of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about and there thei preach the gospel and there sat a certain man at lystra impot in hi feet be a crippl from hi mother womb who never had walk the same heard paul speak who stedfastli behold him and perceiv that he had faith to be heal said with a loud voic stand upright on thy feet and he leap and walk and when the peopl saw what paul had done thei lift up their voic sai in the speech of lycaonia the god ar come down to us in the like of men and thei call barnaba jupit and paul mercuriu becaus he wa the chief speaker then the priest of jupit which wa befor their citi brought oxen and garland unto the gate and would have done sacrific with the peopl which when the apostl barnaba and paul heard of thei rent their cloth and ran in among the peopl cry out and sai sir why do ye these thing we also ar men of like passion with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vaniti unto the live god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all thing that ar therein who in time past suffer all nation to walk in their own wai nevertheless he left not himself without wit in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruit season fill our heart with food and glad and with these sai scarc restrain thei the peopl that thei had not done sacrific unto them and there came thither certain jew from antioch and iconium who persuad the peopl and have stone paul drew him out of the citi suppos he had been dead howbeit as the discipl stood round about him he rose up and came into the citi and the next dai he depart with barnaba to derb and when thei had preach the gospel to that citi and had taught mani thei return again to lystra and to iconium and antioch confirm the soul of the discipl and exhort them to continu in the faith and that we must through much tribul enter into the kingdom of god and when thei had ordain them elder in everi church and had prai with fast thei commend them to the lord on whom thei believ and after thei had pass throughout pisidia thei came to pamphylia and when thei had preach the word in perga thei went down into attalia and thenc sail to antioch from whenc thei had been recommend to the grace of god for the work which thei fulfil and when thei were come and had gather the church togeth thei rehears all that god had done with them and how he had open the door of faith unto the gentil and there thei abod long time with the discipl and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcis after the manner of mose ye cannot be save when therefor paul and barnaba had no small dissens and disput with them thei determin that paul and barnaba and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostl and elder about thi question and be brought on their wai by the church thei pass through phenic and samaria declar the convers of the gentil and thei caus great joi unto all the brethren and when thei were come to jerusalem thei were receiv of the church and of the apostl and elder and thei declar all thing that god had done with them but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharise which believ sai that it wa need to circumcis them and to command them to keep the law of mose and the apostl and elder came togeth for to consid of thi matter and when there had been much disput peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choic among us that the gentil by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believ and god which knoweth the heart bare them wit give them the holi ghost even as he did unto us and put no differ between us and them purifi their heart by faith now therefor why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the discipl which neither our father nor we were abl to bear but we believ that through the grace of the lord jesu christ we shall be save even as thei then all the multitud kept silenc and gave audienc to barnaba and paul declar what miracl and wonder god had wrought among the gentil by them and after thei had held their peac jame answer sai men and brethren hearken unto me simeon hath declar how god at the first did visit the gentil to take out of them a peopl for hi name and to thi agre the word of the prophet as it is written after thi i will return and will build again the tabernacl of david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruin thereof and i will set it up that the residu of men might seek after the lord and all the gentil upon whom my name is call saith the lord who doeth all these thing known unto god ar all hi work from the begin of the world wherefor my sentenc is that we troubl not them which from among the gentil ar turn to god but that we write unto them that thei abstain from pollut of idol and from fornic and from thing strangl and from blood for mose of old time hath in everi citi them that preach him be read in the synagogu everi sabbath dai then pleas it the apostl and elder with the whole church to send chosen men of their own compani to antioch with paul and barnaba name juda surnam barsaba and sila chief men among the brethren and thei wrote letter by them after thi manner the apostl and elder and brethren send greet unto the brethren which ar of the gentil in antioch and syria and cilicia forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubl you with word subvert your soul sai ye must be circumcis and keep the law to whom we gave no such command it seem good unto us be assembl with on accord to send chosen men unto you with our belov barnaba and paul men that have hazard their live for the name of our lord jesu christ we

abstain from meat offer to idol and from blood and from thing strangl and from fornic from which if ye keep yourselv ye shall do well fare ye well so when thei were dismiss thei came to antioch and when thei had gather the multitud togeth thei deliv the epistl which when thei had read thei rejoic for the consol and juda and sila be prophet also themselv exhort the brethren with mani word and confirm them and after thei had tarri there a space thei were let go in peac from the brethren unto the apostl notwithstand it pleas sila to abid there still paul also and barnaba continu in antioch teach and preach the word of the lord with mani other also and some dai after paul said unto barnaba let us go again and visit our brethren in everi citi where we have preach the word of the lord and see how thei do and barnaba determin to take with them john whose surnam wa mark but paul thought not good to take him with them who depart from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work and the content wa so sharp between them that thei depart asund on from the other and so barnaba took mark and sail unto cypru and paul chose sila and depart be recommend by the brethren unto the grace of god and he went through syria and cilicia confirm the church then came he to derb and lystra and behold a certain discipl wa there name timotheu the son of a certain woman which wa a jewess and believ but hi father wa a greek which wa well report of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium him would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcis him becaus of the jew which were in those quarter for thei knew all that hi father wa a greek and as thei went through the citi thei deliv them the decre for to keep that were ordain of the apostl and elder which were at

stood a man of macedonia and prai him sai come over into macedonia and help us and after he had seen the vision immedi we endeavour to go into macedonia assuredli gather that the lord had call us for to preach the gospel unto them therefor loos from troa we came with a straight cours to samothracia and the next dai to neapoli and from thenc to philippi which is the chief citi of that part of macedonia and a coloni and we were in that citi abid certain dai and on the sabbath we went out of the citi by a river side where prayer wa wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resort thither and a certain woman name lydia a seller of purpl of the citi of thyatira which worship god heard us whose heart the lord open that she attend unto the thing which were spoken of paul and when she wa baptiz and her household she besought us sai if ye have judg me to be faith to the lord come into my hous and abid there and she constrain us and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possess with a spirit of divin met us which brought her master much gain by soothsai the same follow paul and us and cri sai these men ar the servant of the most high god which shew unto us the wai of salvat and thi did she mani dai but paul be griev turn and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesu christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour and when her master saw that the hope of their gain wa gone thei caught paul and sila and drew them into the marketplac unto the ruler and brought them to the magistr sai these men be jew do exceedingli troubl our citi and teach custom which ar not law for us to receiv neither to observ be roman and the multitud rose up togeth against them and the magistr rent off their cloth and command to beat them and when thei had laid mani stripe upon them thei cast them into prison charg the jailor to keep them safe who have receiv such a charg thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stock and at midnight paul and sila prai and sang prais unto god and the prison heard them and suddenli there wa a great earthquak so that the foundat of the prison were shaken and immedi all the door were open and everi on band were loos and the keeper of the prison awak out of hi sleep and see the prison door open he drew out hi sword and would have kill himself suppos that the prison had been fled but paul cri with a loud voic sai do thyself no harm for we ar all here then he call for a light and sprang in and came trembl and fell down befor paul and sila and brought them out and said sir what must i do to be save and thei said believ on the lord jesu christ and thou shalt be save and thy hous and thei spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in hi hous and he took them the same hour of the night and wash their stripe and wa baptiz he and all hi straightwai and when he had brought them into hi hous he set meat befor them and rejoic believ in god with all hi hous and when it wa dai the magistr sent the serjeant sai let those men go and the keeper of the prison told thi sai to paul the magistr have sent to let you go now therefor depart and go in peac but paul said unto them thei have beaten us openli uncondemn be roman and have cast us into prison and now do thei thrust us out privili nai verili but let them come themselv and fetch us out and the serjeant told these word unto the magistr and thei fear when thei heard that thei were roman and thei came and besought them and brought them out and desir them to depart out of the citi and thei went out of the prison and enter into the hous of lydia and when thei had seen the brethren thei comfort them and depart now when thei had pass through amphipoli and apollonia thei came to thessalonica where wa a synagogu of the jew and paul as hi manner wa went in unto them and three sabbath dai reason with them out of the scriptur open and alleg that christ must need have suffer and risen again from the dead and that thi jesu whom i preach unto you is christ and some of them believ and consort with paul and sila and of the devout greek a great multitud and of the chief women not a few but the jew which believ not move with envi took unto them certain lewd fellow of the baser sort and gather a compani and set all the citi on an uproar and assault the hous of jason and sought to bring them out to the peopl and when thei found them not thei drew jason and certain brethren unto the ruler of the citi cry these that have turn the world upsid down ar come hither also whom jason hath receiv and these all do contrari to the decre of caesar sai that there is anoth king on jesu and thei troubl the peopl and the ruler of the citi when thei heard these thing and when thei had taken secur of jason and of the other thei let them go and the brethren immedi sent awai paul and sila by night unto berea who come thither went into the synagogu of the jew these were more nobl than those in thessalonica in that thei receiv the word with all readi of mind and search the scriptur daili whether those thing were so therefor mani of them believ also of honour women which were greek and of men not a few but when the jew of thessalonica had knowledg that the word of god wa preach of paul at berea thei came thither also and stir up the peopl and then immedi the brethren sent awai paul to go as it were to the sea but sila and timotheu abod there still and thei that conduct paul brought him unto athen and receiv a command unto sila and timotheu for to come to him with all speed thei depart now while paul wait for them at athen hi spirit wa stir in him when he saw the citi wholli given to idolatri therefor disput he in the synagogu with the jew and with the devout person and in the market daili with them that met with him then certain philosoph of the epicurean and of the stoick encount him and some said what will thi babbler sai other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strang god becaus he preach unto them jesu and the resurrect and thei took him and brought him unto areopagu sai mai we know what thi new doctrin whereof thou speakest is for thou bringest certain strang thing to our ear we would know therefor what these thing mean for all the athenian and stranger which were there spent their time in noth els but either to tell or to hear some new thing then paul stood in the midst of mar hill and said ye men of athen i perceiv that in all thing ye ar too superstiti for as i pass by and beheld your devot i found an altar with thi inscript to the unknown god whom therefor ye ignorantli worship him declar i unto you god that made the world and all thing therein see that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in templ made with hand neither is worship with men hand as though he need ani thing see he giveth to all life and breath and all thing and hath made of on blood all nation of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determin the time befor appoint and the bound of their habit that thei should seek the lord if hapli thei might feel after him and find him though he be not far from everi on of us for in him we live and move and have our be as certain also of your own poet have said for we ar also hi offspr forasmuch then as we ar the offspr of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man devic and the time of thi ignor god wink at but now commandeth all men everi where to repent becaus he hath appoint a dai in the which he will judg the world in righteous by that man whom he hath ordain whereof he hath given assur unto all men in that he hath rais him from the dead and when thei heard of the resurrect of the dead some mock and other said we will hear thee again of thi matter so paul depart from among them howbeit certain men clave unto him and believ among the which wa dionysiu the areopagit and a woman name damari and other with them after these thing paul depart from athen and came to corinth and found a certain jew name aquila born in pontu late come from itali with hi wife priscilla becaus that claudiu had command all jew to depart from rome and came unto them and becaus he wa of the same craft he abod with them and wrought for by their occup thei were tentmak and he reason in the synagogu everi sabbath and persuad the jew and the greek and when sila and timotheu were come from macedonia paul wa press in the spirit and testifi to the jew that jesu wa christ and when thei oppos themselv and blasphem he shook hi raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own head i am clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentil and he depart thenc and enter into a certain man hous name justu on that worship god whose hous join hard to the synagogu and crispu the chief ruler of the synagogu believ on the lord with all hi hous and mani of the corinthian hear believ and were baptiz then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peac for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much peopl in thi citi and he continu there a year and six month teach the word of god among them and when gallio wa the deputi of achaia the jew made insurrect with on accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat sai thi fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrari to the law and when paul wa now about to open hi mouth gallio said unto the jew if it were a matter of wrong or wick lewd o ye jew reason would that i should bear with you but if it be a question of word and name and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judg of such matter and he drave them from the judgment seat then all the greek took sosthen the chief ruler of the synagogu and beat him befor the judgment seat and gallio care for none of those thing and paul after thi tarri there yet a good while and then took hi leav of the brethren and sail thenc into syria and with him priscilla and aquila have shorn hi head in cenchrea for he had a vow and he came to ephesu and left them there but he himself enter into the synagogu and reason with the jew when thei desir him to tarri longer time with them he consent not but bade them farewel sai i must by all mean keep thi feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return again unto you if god will and he sail from ephesu and when he had land at caesarea and gone up and salut the church he went down to antioch and after he had spent some time there he depart and went over all the countri of galatia and phrygia in order strengthen all the discipl and a certain jew name apollo born at alexandria an eloqu man and mighti in the scriptur came to ephesu thi man wa instruct in the wai of the lord and be fervent in the spirit he spake and taught dilig the thing of the lord know onli the baptism of john and he began to speak boldli in the synagogu whom when aquila and priscilla had heard thei took him unto them and expound unto him the wai of god more perfectli and when he wa dispos to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhort the discipl to receiv him who when he wa come help them much which had believ through grace for he mightili convinc the jew and that publickli shew by the scriptur that jesu wa christ and it came to pass that while apollo wa at corinth paul have pass through the upper coast came to ephesu and find certain discipl he said unto them have ye receiv the holi ghost sinc ye believ and thei said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be ani holi ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptiz and thei said unto john baptism then said paul john verili baptiz with the baptism of repent sai unto the peopl that thei should believ on him which should come after him that is on christ jesu when thei heard thi thei were baptiz in the name of the lord jesu and when paul had laid hi hand upon them the holi ghost came on them and thei spake with tongu and prophesi and all the men were about twelv and he went into the synagogu and spake boldli for the space of three month disput and persuad the thing concern the kingdom of god but when diver were harden and believ not but spake evil of that wai befor the multitud he depart from them and separ the discipl disput daili in the school of on tyrannu and thi continu by the space of two year so that all thei which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesu both jew and greek and god wrought special miracl by the hand of paul so that from hi bodi were brought unto the sick handkerchief or apron and the diseas depart from them and the evil spirit went out of them then certain of the vagabond jew exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirit the name of the lord jesu sai we adjur you by jesu whom paul preacheth and there were seven son of on sceva a jew and chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirit answer and said jesu i know and paul i know but who ar ye and the man in whom the evil spirit wa leap on them and overcam them and prevail against them so that thei fled out of that hous nake and wound and thi wa known to all the jew and greek also dwell at ephesu and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesu wa magnifi and mani that believ came and confess and shew their deed mani of them also which us curiou art brought their book togeth and burn them befor all men and thei count the price of them and found it fifti thousand piec of silver so mightili grew the word of god and prevail after these thing were end paul purpos in the spirit when he had pass through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem sai after i have been there i must also see rome so he sent into macedonia two of them that minist unto him timotheu and erastu but he himself stai in asia for a season and the same time there aros no small stir about that wai for a certain man name demetriu a silversmith which made silver shrine for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen whom he call togeth with the workmen of like occup and said sir ye know that by thi craft we have our wealth moreov ye see and hear that not alon at ephesu but almost throughout all asia thi paul hath persuad and turn awai much peopl sai that thei be no god which ar made with hand so that not onli thi our craft is in danger to be set at nought but also that the templ of the great goddess diana should be despis and her magnific should be destroi whom all asia and the world worshippeth and when thei heard these sai thei were full of wrath and cri out sai great is diana of the ephesian and the whole citi wa fill with confus and have caught gaiu and aristarchu men of macedonia paul companion in travel thei rush with on accord into the theatr and when paul would have enter in unto the peopl the discipl suffer him not and certain of the chief of asia which were hi friend sent unto him desir him that he would not adventur himself into the theatr some therefor cri on thing and some anoth for the assembl wa confus and the more part knew not wherefor thei were come togeth and thei drew alexand out of the multitud the jew put him forward and alexand beckon with the hand and would have made hi defenc unto the peopl but when thei knew that he wa a jew all with on voic about the space of two hour cri out great is diana of the ephesian and when the townclerk had appeas the peopl he said ye men of ephesu what man is there that knoweth not how that the citi of the ephesian is a worshipp of the great goddess diana and of the imag which fell down from jupit see then that these thing cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do noth rashli for ye have brought hither these men which ar neither robber of church nor yet blasphem of your goddess wherefor if demetriu and the craftsmen which ar with him have a matter against ani man the law is open and there ar deputi let them implead on anoth but if ye enquir ani thing concern other matter it shall be determin in a law assembl for we ar in danger to be call in question for thi dai uproar there be no caus wherebi we mai give an account of thi concours and when he had thu spoken he dismiss the assembl and after the uproar wa ceas paul call unto him the discipl and embrac them and depart for to go into macedonia and when he had gone over those part and had given them much exhort he came into greec and there abod three month and when the jew laid wait for him as he wa about to sail into syria he purpos to return through macedonia and there accompani him into asia sopat of berea and of the thessalonian aristarchu and secundu and gaiu of derb and timotheu and of asia tychicu and trophimu these go befor tarri for us at troa and we sail awai from philippi after the dai of unleaven bread and came unto them to troa in five dai where we abod seven dai and upon the first dai of the week when the discipl came togeth to break bread paul preach unto them readi to depart on the morrow and continu hi speech until midnight and there were mani light in the upper chamber where thei were gather togeth and there sat in a window a certain young man name eutychu be fallen into a deep sleep and as paul wa long preach he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and wa taken up dead and paul went down and fell on him and embrac him said troubl not yourselv for hi life is in him when he therefor wa come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talk a long while even till break of dai so he depart and thei brought the young man aliv and were not a littl comfort and we went befor to ship and sail unto asso there intend to take in paul for so had he appoint mind himself to go afoot and when he met with us at asso we took him in and came to mitylen and we sail thenc and came the next dai over against chio and the next dai we arriv at samo and tarri at trogyllium and the next dai we came to miletu for paul had determin to sail by ephesu becaus he would not spend the time in asia for he hast if it were possibl for him to be at jerusalem the dai of pentecost and from miletu he sent to ephesu and call the elder of the church and when thei were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first dai that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all season serv the lord with all humil of mind and with mani tear and temptat which befel me by the ly in wait of the jew and how i kept back noth that wa profit unto you but have shew you and have taught you publickli and from hous to hous testifi both to the jew and also to the greek repent toward god and faith toward our lord jesu christ and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not know the thing that shall befal me there save that the holi ghost witnesseth in everi citi sai that bond and afflict abid me but none of these thing move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my cours with joi and the ministri which i have receiv of the lord jesu to testifi the gospel of the grace of god and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preach the kingdom of god shall see my face no more wherefor i take you to record thi dai that i am pure from the blood of all men for i have not shun to declar unto you all the counsel of god take heed therefor unto yourselv and to all the flock over the which the holi ghost hath made you overs to feed the church of god which he hath purchas with hi own blood for i know thi that after my depart shall grievou wolv enter in among you not spare the flock also of your own selv shall men aris speak pervers thing to draw awai discipl after them therefor watch and rememb that by the space of three year i ceas not to warn everi on night and dai with tear and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of hi grace which is abl to build you up and to give you an inherit among all them which ar sanctifi i have covet no man silver or gold or apparel yea ye yourselv know that these hand have minist unto my necess and to them that were with me i have shew you all thing how that so labour ye ought to support the weak and to rememb the word of the lord jesu how he said it is more bless to give than to receiv and when he had thu spoken he kneel down and prai with them all and thei all wept sore and fell on paul neck and kiss him sorrow most of all for the word which he spake that thei should see hi face no more and thei accompani him unto the ship and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launch we came with a straight cours unto coo and the dai follow unto rhode and from thenc unto patara and find a ship sail over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth now when we had discov cypru we left it on the left hand and sail into syria and land at tyre for there the ship wa to unlad her burden and find discipl we tarri there seven dai who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem and when we had accomplish those dai we depart and went our wai and thei all brought us on our wai with wive and children till we were out of the citi and we kneel down on the shore and prai and when we had taken our leav on of anoth we took ship and thei return home again and when we had finish our cours from tyre we came to ptolemai and salut the brethren and abod with them on dai and the next dai we that were of paul compani depart and came unto caesarea and we enter into the hous of philip the evangelist which wa on of the seven and abod with him and the same man had four daughter virgin which did prophesi and as we tarri there mani dai there came down from judaea a certain prophet name agabu and when he wa come unto us he took paul girdl and bound hi own hand and feet and said thu saith the holi ghost so shall the jew at jerusalem bind the man that owneth thi girdl and shall deliv him into the hand of the gentil and when we heard these thing both we and thei of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem then paul answer what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for i am readi not to be bound onli but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesu and when he would not be persuad we ceas sai the will of the lord be done and after those dai we took up our carriag and went up to jerusalem there went with us also certain of the discipl of caesarea and brought with them on mnason of cypru an old discipl with whom we should lodg and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren receiv us gladli and the dai follow paul went in with us unto jame and all the elder were present and when he had salut them he declar particularli what thing god had wrought among the gentil by hi ministri and when thei heard it thei glorifi the lord and said unto him thou seest brother how mani thousand of jew there ar which believ and thei ar all zealou of the law and thei ar inform of thee that thou teachest all the jew which ar among the gentil to forsak mose sai that thei ought not to circumcis their children neither to walk after the custom what is it therefor the multitud must need come togeth for thei will hear that thou art come do therefor thi that we sai to thee we have four men which have a vow on them them take and purifi thyself with them and be at charg with them that thei mai shave their head and all mai know that those thing whereof thei were inform concern thee ar noth but that thou thyself also walkest orderli and keepest the law as touch the gentil which believ we have written and conclud that thei observ no such thing save onli that thei keep themselv from thing offer to idol and from blood and from strangl and from fornic then paul took the men and the next dai purifi himself with them enter into the templ to signifi the accomplish of the dai of purif until that an offer should be offer for everi on of them and when the seven dai were almost end the jew which were of asia when thei saw him in the templ stir up all the peopl and laid hand on him cry out men of israel help thi is the man that teacheth all men everi where against the peopl and the law and thi place and further brought greek also into the templ and hath pollut thi holi place for thei had seen befor with him in the citi trophimu an ephesian whom thei suppos that paul had brought into the templ and all the citi wa move and the peopl ran togeth and thei took paul and drew him out of the templ and forthwith the door were shut and as thei went about to kill him tide came unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem wa in an uproar who immedi took soldier and centurion and ran down unto them and when thei saw the chief captain and the soldier thei left beat of paul then the chief captain came near and took him and command him to be bound with two chain and demand who he wa and what he had done and some cri on thing some anoth among the multitud and when he could not know the certainti for the tumult he command him to be carri into the castl and when he came upon the stair so it wa that he wa born of the soldier for the violenc of the peopl for the multitud of the peopl follow after cry awai with him and as paul wa to be led into the castl he said unto the chief captain mai i speak unto thee who said canst thou speak greek art not thou that egyptian which befor these dai madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilder four thousand men that were murder but paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsu a citi in cilicia a citizen of no mean citi and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the peopl and when he had given him licenc paul stood on the stair and beckon with the hand unto the peopl and when there wa made a great silenc he spake unto them in the hebrew tongu sai men brethren and father hear ye my defenc which i make now unto you and when thei heard that he spake in the hebrew tongu to them thei kept the more silenc and he saith i am verili a man which am a jew born in tarsu a citi in cilicia yet brought up in thi citi at the feet of gamaliel and taught accord to the perfect manner of the law of the father and wa zealou toward god as ye all ar thi dai and i persecut thi wai unto the death bind and deliv into prison both men and women as also the high priest doth bear me wit and all the estat of the elder from whom also i receiv letter unto the brethren and went to damascu to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punish and it came to pass that as i made my journei and wa come nigh unto damascu about noon suddenli there shone from heaven a great light round about me and i fell unto the ground and heard a voic sai unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me and i answer who art thou lord and he said unto me i am jesu of nazareth whom thou persecutest and thei that were with me saw inde the light and were afraid but thei heard not the voic of him that spake to me and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me aris and go into damascu and there it shall be told thee of all thing which ar appoint for thee to do and when i could not see for the glori of that light be led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascu and on anania a devout man accord to the law have a good report of all the jew which dwelt there came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receiv thy sight and the same hour i look up upon him and he said the god of our father hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know hi will and see that just on and shouldest hear the voic of hi mouth for thou shalt be hi wit unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard and now why tarriest thou aris and be baptiz and wash awai thy sin call on the name of the lord and it came to pass that when i wa come again to jerusalem even while i prai in the templ i wa in a tranc and saw him sai unto me make hast and get thee quickli out of jerusalem for thei will not receiv thy testimoni concern me and i said lord thei know that i imprison and beat in everi synagogu them that believ on thee and when the blood of thy martyr stephen wa shed i also wa stand by and consent unto hi death and kept the raiment of them that slew him and he said unto me depart for i will send thee far henc unto the gentil and thei gave him audienc unto thi word and then lift up their voic and said awai with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should live and as thei cri out and cast off their cloth and threw dust into the air the chief captain command him to be brought into the castl and bade that he should be examin by scourg that he might know wherefor thei cri so against him and as thei bound him with thong paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it law for you to scourg a man that is a roman and uncondemn when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain sai take heed what thou doest for thi man is a roman then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman he said yea and the chief captain answer with a great sum obtain i thi freedom and paul said but i wa free born then straightwai thei depart from him which should have examin him and the chief captain also wa afraid after he knew that he wa a roman and becaus he had bound him on the morrow becaus he would have known the certainti wherefor he wa accus of the jew he loos him from hi band and command the chief priest and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him befor them and paul earnestli behold the council said men and brethren i have live in all good conscienc befor god until thi dai and the high priest anania command them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou white wall for sittest thou to judg me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrari to the law and thei that stood by said revilest thou god high priest then said paul i wist not brethren that he wa the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy peopl but when paul perceiv that the on part were sadduce and the other pharise he cri out in the council men and brethren i am a pharise the son of a pharise of the hope and resurrect of the dead i am call in question and when he had so said there aros a dissens between the pharise and the sadduce and the multitud wa divid for the sadduce sai that there is no resurrect neither angel nor spirit but the pharise confess both and there aros a great cry and the scribe that were of the pharise part aros and strove sai we find no evil in thi man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god and when there aros a great dissens the chief captain fear lest paul should have been pull in piec of them command the soldier to go down and to take him by forc from among them and to bring him into the castl and the night follow the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testifi of me in jerusalem so must thou bear wit also at rome and when it wa dai certain of the jew band togeth and bound themselv under a curs sai that thei would neither eat nor drink till thei had kill paul and thei were more than forti which had made thi conspiraci and thei came to the chief priest and elder and said we have bound ourselv under a great curs that we will eat noth until we have slain paul now therefor ye with the council signifi to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquir someth more perfectli concern him and we or ever he come near ar readi to kill him and when paul sister son heard of their ly in wait he went and enter into the castl and told paul then paul call on of the centurion unto him and said bring thi young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prison call me unto him and prai me to bring thi young man unto thee who hath someth to sai unto thee then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him asid privat and ask him what is that thou hast to tell me and he said the jew have agre to desir thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though thei would enquir somewhat of him more perfectli but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forti men which have bound themselv with an oath that thei will neither eat nor drink till thei have kill him and now ar thei readi look for a promis from thee so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charg him see thou tell no man that thou hast shew these thing to me and he call unto him two centurion sai make readi two hundr soldier to go to caesarea and horsemen threescor and ten and spearmen two hundr at the third hour of the night and provid them beast that thei mai set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor and he wrote a letter after thi manner claudiu lysia unto the most excel governor felix sendeth greet thi man wa taken of the jew and should have been kill of them then came i with an armi and rescu him have understood that he wa a roman and when i would have known the caus wherefor thei accus him i brought him forth into their council whom i perceiv to be accus of question of their law but to have noth laid to hi charg worthi of death or of bond and when it wa told me how that the jew laid wait for the man i sent straightwai to thee and gave command to hi accus also to sai befor thee what thei had against him farewel then the soldier as it wa command them took paul and brought him by night to antipatri on the morrow thei left the horsemen to go with him and return to the castl who when thei came to caesarea and deliv the epistl to the governor present paul also befor him and when the governor had read the letter he ask of what provinc he wa and when he understood that he wa of cilicia i will hear thee said he when thine accus ar also come and he command him to be kept in herod judgment hall and after five dai anania the high priest descend with the elder and with a certain orat name tertullu who inform the governor against paul and when he wa call forth tertullu began to accus him sai see that by thee we enjoi great quiet and that veri worthi deed ar done unto thi nation by thy provid we accept it alwai and in all place most nobl felix with all thank notwithstand that i be not further tediou unto thee i prai thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemenc a few word for we have found thi man a pestil fellow and a mover of sedit among all the jew throughout the world and a ringlead of the sect of the nazaren who also hath gone about to profan the templ whom we took and would have judg accord to our law but the chief captain lysia came upon us and with great violenc took him awai out of our hand command hi accus to come unto thee by examin of whom thyself mayest take knowledg of all these thing whereof we accus him and the jew also assent sai that these thing were so then paul after that the governor had beckon unto him to speak answer forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of mani year a judg unto thi nation i do the more cheerfulli answer for myself becaus that thou mayest understand that there ar yet but twelv dai sinc i went up to jerusalem for to worship and thei neither found me in the templ disput with ani man neither rais up the peopl neither in the synagogu nor in the citi neither can thei prove the thing whereof thei now accus me but thi i confess unto thee that after the wai which thei call heresi so worship i the god of my father believ all thing which ar written in the law and in the prophet and have hope toward god which thei themselv also allow that there shall be a resurrect of the dead both of the just and unjust and herein do i exercis myself to have alwai a conscienc void to offenc toward god and toward men now after mani year i came to bring alm to my nation and offer whereupon certain jew from asia found me purifi in the templ neither with multitud nor with tumult who ought to have been here befor thee and object if thei had ought against me or els let these same here sai if thei have found ani evil do in me while i stood befor the council except it be for thi on voic that i cri stand among them touch the resurrect of the dead i am call in question by you thi dai and when felix heard these thing have more perfect knowledg of that wai he defer them and said when lysia the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter and he command a centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberti and that he should forbid none of hi acquaint to minist or come unto him and after certain dai when felix came with hi wife drusilla which wa a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concern the faith in christ and as he reason of righteous temper and judgment to come felix trembl and answer go thy wai for thi time when i have a conveni season i will call for thee he hope also that monei should have been given him of paul that he might loos him wherefor he sent for him the often and commun with him but after two year porciu festu came into felix room and felix will to shew the jew a pleasur left paul bound now when festu wa come into the provinc after three dai he ascend from caesarea to jerusalem then the high priest and the chief of the jew inform him against paul and besought him and desir favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem lai wait in the wai to kill him but festu answer that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortli thither let them therefor said he which among you ar abl go down with me and accus thi man if there be ani wicked in him and when he had tarri among them more than ten dai he went down unto caesarea and the next dai sit on the judgment seat command paul to be brought and when he wa come the jew which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid mani and grievou complaint against paul which thei could not prove while he answer for himself neither against the law of the jew neither against the templ nor yet against caesar have i offend ani thing at all but festu will to do the jew a pleasur answer paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judg of these thing befor me then said paul i stand at caesar judgment seat where i ought to be judg to the jew have i done no wrong as thou veri well knowest for if i be an offend or have commit ani thing worthi of death i refus not to die but if there be none of these thing whereof these accus me no man mai deliv me unto them i appeal unto caesar then festu when he had confer with the council answer hast thou appeal unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go and after certain dai king agrippa and bernic came unto caesarea to salut festu and when thei had been there mani dai festu declar paul caus unto the king sai there is a certain man left in bond by felix about whom when i wa at jerusalem the chief priest and the elder of the jew inform me desir to have judgment against him to whom i answer it is not the manner of the roman to deliv ani man to die befor that he which is accus have the accus face to face and have licenc to answer for himself concern the crime laid against him therefor when thei were come hither without ani delai on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and command the man to be brought forth against whom when the accus stood up thei brought none accus of such thing as i suppos but had certain question against him of their own superstit and of on jesu which wa dead whom paul affirm to be aliv and becaus i doubt of such manner of question i ask him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judg of these matter but when paul had appeal to be reserv unto the hear of augustu i command him to be kept till i might send him to caesar then agrippa said unto festu i would also hear the man myself to morrow said he thou shalt hear him and on the morrow when agrippa wa come and bernic with great pomp and wa enter into the place of hear with the chief captain and princip men of the citi at festu command paul wa brought forth and festu said king agrippa and all men which ar here present with us ye see thi man about whom all the multitud of the jew have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here cry that he ought not to live ani longer but when i found that he had commit noth worthi of death and that he himself hath appeal to augustu i have determin to send him of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefor i have brought him forth befor you and special befor thee o king agrippa that after examin had i might have somewhat to write for it seemeth to me unreason to send a prison and not withal to signifi the crime laid against him then agrippa said unto paul thou art permit to speak for thyself then paul stretch forth the hand and answer for himself i think myself happi king agrippa becaus i shall answer for myself thi dai befor thee touch all the thing whereof i am accus of the jew especi becaus i know thee to be expert in all custom and question which ar among the jew wherefor i beseech thee to hear me patient my manner of life from my youth which wa at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jew which knew me from the begin if thei would testifi that after the most straitest sect of our religion i live a pharise and now i stand and am judg for the hope of the promis made of god unto our father unto which promis our twelv tribe instantli serv god dai and night hope to come for which hope sake king agrippa i am accus of the jew why should it be thought a thing incred with you that god should rais the dead i verili thought with myself that i ought to do mani thing contrari to the name of jesu of nazareth which thing i also did in jerusalem and mani of the saint did i shut up in prison have receiv author from the chief priest and when thei were put to death i gave my voic against them and i punish them oft in everi synagogu and compel them to blasphem and be exceedingli mad against them i persecut them even unto strang citi whereupon as i went to damascu with author and commiss from the chief priest at middai o king i saw in the wai a light from heaven abov the bright of the sun shine round about me and them which journei with me and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voic speak unto me and sai in the hebrew tongu saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the prick and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesu whom thou persecutest but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appear unto thee for thi purpos to make thee a minist and a wit both of these thing which thou hast seen and of those thing in the which i will appear unto thee deliv thee from the peopl and from the gentil unto whom now i send thee to open their ey and to turn them from dark to light and from the power of satan unto god that thei mai receiv forgiv of sin and inherit among them which ar sanctifi by faith that is in me whereupon o king agrippa i wa not disobedi unto the heavenli vision but shew first unto them of damascu and at jerusalem and throughout all the coast of judaea and then to the gentil that thei should repent and turn to god and do work meet for repent for these caus the jew caught me in the templ and went about to kill me have therefor obtain help of god i continu unto thi dai wit both to small and great sai none other thing than those which the prophet and mose did sai should come that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the peopl and to the gentil and as he thu spake for himself festu said with a loud voic paul thou art besid thyself much learn doth make thee mad but he said i am not mad most nobl festu but speak forth the word of truth and sober for the king knoweth of these thing befor whom also i speak freeli for i am persuad that none of these thing ar hidden from him for thi thing wa not done in a corner king agrippa believest thou the prophet i know that thou believest then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian and paul said i would to god that not onli thou but also all that hear me thi dai were both almost and altogeth such as i am except these bond and when he had thu spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernic and thei that sat with them and when thei were gone asid thei talk between themselv sai thi man doeth noth worthi of death or of bond then said agrippa unto festu thi man might have been set at liberti if he had not appeal unto caesar and when it wa determin that we should sail into itali thei deliv paul and certain other prison unto on name juliu a centurion of augustu band and enter into a ship of adramyttium we launch mean to sail by the coast of asia on aristarchu a macedonian of thessalonica be with us and the next dai we touch at sidon and juliu courteous entreat paul and gave him liberti to go unto hi friend to refresh himself and when we had launch from thenc we sail under cypru becaus the wind were contrari and when we had sail over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a citi of lycia and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sail into itali and he put us therein and when we had sail slowli mani dai and scarc were come over against cnidu the wind not suffer us we sail under crete over against salmon and hardli pass it came unto a place which is call the fair haven nigh whereunto wa the citi of lasea now when much time wa spent and when sail wa now danger becaus the fast wa now alreadi past paul admonish them and said unto them sir i perceiv that thi voyag will be with hurt and much damag not onli of the lade and ship but also of our live nevertheless the centurion believ the master and the owner of the ship more than those thing which were spoken by paul and becaus the haven wa not commodi to winter in the more part advis to depart thenc also if by ani mean thei might attain to phenic and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west and when the south wind blew softli suppos that thei had obtain their purpos loos thenc thei sail close by crete but not long after there aros against it a tempestu wind call euroclydon and when the ship wa caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive and run under a certain island which is call clauda we had much work to come by the boat which when thei had taken up thei us help undergird the ship and fear lest thei should fall into the quicksand strake sail and so were driven and we be exceedingli toss with a tempest the next dai thei lighten the ship and the third dai we cast out with our own hand the tackl of the ship and when neither sun nor star in mani dai appear and no small tempest lai on us all hope that we should be save wa then taken awai but after long abstin paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sir ye should have hearken unto me and not have loos from crete and to have gain thi harm and loss and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of ani man life among you but of the ship for there stood by me thi night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serv sai fear not paul thou must be brought befor caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefor sir be of good cheer for i believ god that it shall be even as it wa told me howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island but when the fourteenth night wa come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deem that thei drew near to some countri and sound and found it twenti fathom and when thei had gone a littl further thei sound again and found it fifteen fathom then fear lest we should have fallen upon rock thei cast four anchor out of the stern and wish for the dai and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when thei had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though thei would have cast anchor out of the foreship paul said to the centurion and to the soldier except these abid in the ship ye cannot be save then the soldier cut off the rope of the boat and let her fall off and while the dai wa come on paul besought them all to take meat sai thi dai is the fourteenth dai that ye have tarri and continu fast have taken noth wherefor i prai you to take some meat for thi is for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of ani of you and when he had thu spoken he took bread and gave thank to god in presenc of them all and when he had broken it he began to eat then were thei all of good cheer and thei also took some meat and we were in all in the ship two hundr threescor and sixteen soul and when thei had eaten enough thei lighten the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea and when it wa dai thei knew not the land but thei discov a certain creek with a shore into the which thei were mind if it were possibl to thrust in the ship and when thei had taken up the anchor thei commit themselv unto the sea and loos the rudder band and hois up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore and fall into a place where two sea met thei ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remain unmov but the hinder part wa broken with the violenc of the wave and the soldier counsel wa to kill the prison lest ani of them should swim out and escap but the centurion will to save paul kept them from their purpos and command that thei which could swim should cast themselv first into the sea and get to land and the rest some on board and some on broken piec of the ship and so it came to pass that thei escap all safe to land and when thei were escap then thei knew that the island wa call melita and the barbar peopl shew us no littl kind for thei kindl a fire and receiv us everi on becaus of the present rain and becaus of the cold and when paul had gather a bundl of stick and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fasten on hi hand and when the barbarian saw the venom beast hang on hi hand thei said among themselv no doubt thi man is a murder whom though he hath escap the sea yet vengeanc suffereth not to live and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm howbeit thei look when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenli but after thei had look a great while and saw no harm come to him thei chang their mind and said that he wa a god in the same quarter were possess of the chief man of the island whose name wa publiu who receiv us and lodg us three dai courteous and it came to pass that the father of publiu lai sick of a fever and of a bloodi flux to whom paul enter in and prai and laid hi hand on him and heal him so when thi wa done other also which had diseas in the island came and were heal who also honour us with mani honour and when we depart thei lade us with such thing as were necessari and after three month we depart in a ship of alexandria which had winter in the isl whose sign wa castor and pollux and land at syracus we tarri there three dai and from thenc we fetch a compass and came to rhegium and after on dai the south wind blew and we came the next dai to puteoli where we found brethren and were desir to tarri with them seven dai and so we went toward rome and from thenc when the brethren heard of us thei came to meet us as far as appii forum and the three tavern whom when paul saw he thank god and took courag and when we came to rome the centurion deliv the prison to the captain of the guard but paul wa suffer to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him and it came to pass that after three dai paul call the chief of the jew togeth and when thei were come togeth he said unto them men and brethren though i have commit noth against the peopl or custom of our father yet wa i deliv prison from jerusalem into the hand of the roman who when thei had examin me would have let me go becaus there wa no caus of death in me but when the jew spake against it i wa constrain to appeal unto caesar not that i had ought to accus my nation of for thi caus therefor have i call for you to see you and to speak with you becaus that for the hope of israel i am bound with thi chain and thei said unto him we neither receiv letter out of judaea concern thee neither ani of the brethren that came shew or spake ani harm of thee but we desir to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concern thi sect we know that everi where it is spoken against and when thei had appoint him a dai there came mani to him into hi lodg to whom he expound and testifi the kingdom of god persuad them concern jesu both out of the law of mose and out of the prophet from morn till even and some believ the thing which were spoken and some believ not and when thei agre not among themselv thei depart after that paul had spoken on word well spake the holi ghost by esaia the prophet unto our father sai go unto thi peopl and sai hear ye shall hear and shall not understand and see ye shall see and not perceiv for the heart of thi peopl is wax gross and their ear ar dull of hear and their ey have thei close lest thei should see with their ey and hear with their ear and understand with their heart and should be convert and i should heal them be it known therefor unto you that the salvat of god is sent unto the gentil and that thei will hear it and when he had said these word the jew depart and had great reason among themselv and paul dwelt two whole year in hi own hire hous and receiv all that came in unto him preach the kingdom of god and teach those thing which concern the lord jesu christ with all confid no man forbid him the epistl of paul the apostl to the roman paul a servant of jesu christ call to be an apostl separ unto the gospel of god which he had promis afor by hi prophet in the holi scriptur concern hi son jesu christ our lord which wa made of the seed of david accord to the flesh and declar to be the son of god with power accord to the spirit of holi by the resurrect from the dead by whom we have receiv grace and apostleship for obedi to the faith among all nation for hi name among whom ar ye also the call of jesu christ to all that be in rome belov of god call to be saint grace to you and peac from god our father and the lord jesu christ first i thank my god through jesu christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world for god is my wit whom i serv with my spirit in the gospel of hi son that without ceas i make mention of you alwai in my prayer make request if by ani mean now at length i might have a prosper journei by the will of god to come unto you for i long to see you that i mai impart unto you some spiritu gift to the end ye mai be establish that is that i mai be comfort togeth with you by the mutual faith both of you and me now i would not have you ignor brethren that oftentim i purpos to come unto you but wa let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentil i am debtor both to the greek and to the barbarian both to the wise and to the unwis so as much as in me is i am readi to preach the gospel to you that ar at rome also for i am not asham of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvat to everi on that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteous of god reveal from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of god is reveal from heaven against all ungodli and unright of men who hold the truth in unright becaus that which mai be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shew it unto them for the invis thing of him from the creation of the world ar clearli seen be understood by the thing that ar made even hi etern power and godhead so that thei ar without excus becaus that when thei knew god thei glorifi him not as god neither were thank but becam vain in their imagin and their foolish heart wa darken profess themselv to be wise thei becam fool and chang the glori of the uncorrupt god into an imag made like to corrupt man and to bird and fourfoot beast and creep thing wherefor god also gave them up to unclean through the lust of their own heart to dishonour their own bodi between themselv who chang the truth of god into a lie and worship and serv the creatur more than the creator who is bless for ever amen for thi caus god gave them up unto vile affect for even their women did chang the natur us into that which is against natur and likewis also the men leav the natur us of the woman burn in their lust on toward anoth men with men work that which is unseemli and receiv in themselv that recomp of their error which wa meet and even as thei did not like to retain god in their knowledg god gave them over to a reprob mind to do those thing which ar not conveni be fill with all unright fornic wicked covet malici full of envi murder debat deceit malign whisper backbit hater of god despit proud boaster inventor of evil thing disobedi to parent without understand covenantbreak without natur affect implac unmerci who know the judgment of god that thei which commit such thing ar worthi of death not onli do the same but have pleasur in them that do them therefor thou art inexcus o man whosoev thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest anoth thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same thing but we ar sure that the judgment of god is accord to truth against them which commit such thing and thinkest thou thi o man that judgest them which do such thing and doest the same that thou shalt escap the judgment of god or despisest thou the rich of hi good and forbear and longsuff not know that the good of god leadeth thee to repent but after thy hard and impenit heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the dai of wrath and revel of the righteou judgment of god who will render to everi man accord to hi deed to them who by patient continu in well do seek for glori and honour and immort etern life but unto them that ar contenti and do not obei the truth but obei unright indign and wrath tribul and anguish upon everi soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentil but glori honour and peac to everi man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentil for there is no respect of person with god for as mani as have sin without law shall also perish without law and as mani as have sin in the law shall be judg by the law for not the hearer of the law ar just befor god but the doer of the law shall be justifi for when the gentil which have not the law do by natur the thing contain in the law these have not the law ar a law unto themselv which shew the work of the law written in their heart their conscienc also bear wit and their thought the mean while accus or els excus on anoth in the dai when god shall judg the secret of men by jesu christ accord to my gospel behold thou art call a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god and knowest hi will and approvest the thing that ar more excel be instruct out of the law and art confid that thou thyself art a guid of the blind a light of them which ar in dark an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babe which hast the form of knowledg and of the truth in the law thou therefor which teachest anoth teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal thou that sayest a man should not commit adulteri dost thou commit adulteri thou that abhorrest idol dost thou commit sacrileg thou that makest thy boast of the law through break the law dishonourest thou god for the name of god is blasphem among the gentil through you as it is written for circumcis verili profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcis is made uncircumcis therefor if the uncircumcis keep the righteous of the law shall not hi uncircumcis be count for circumcis and shall not uncircumcis which is by natur if it fulfil the law judg thee who by the letter and circumcis dost transgress the law for he is not a jew which is on outwardli neither is that circumcis which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew which is on inwardli and circumcis is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose prais is not of men but of god what advantag then hath the jew or what profit is there of circumcis much everi wai chiefli becaus that unto them were commit the oracl of god for what if some did not believ shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect god forbid yea let god be true but everi man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justifi in thy sai and mightest overcom when thou art judg but if our unright commend the righteous of god what shall we sai is god unright who taketh vengeanc i speak as a man god forbid for then how shall god judg the world for if the truth of god hath more abound through my lie unto hi glori why yet am i also judg as a sinner and not rather as we be slander report and as some affirm that we sai let us do evil that good mai come whose damnat is just what then ar we better than thei no in no wise for we have befor prove both jew and gentil that thei ar all under sin as it is written there is none righteou no not on there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god thei ar all gone out of the wai thei ar togeth becom unprofit there is none that doeth good no not on their throat is an open sepulchr with their tongu thei have us deceit the poison of asp is under their lip whose mouth is full of curs and bitter their feet ar swift to shed blood destruct and miseri ar in their wai and the wai of peac have thei not known there is no fear of god befor their ey now we know that what thing soever the law saith it saith to them who ar under the law that everi mouth mai be stop and all the world mai becom guilti befor god therefor by the deed of the law there shall no flesh be justifi in hi sight for by the law is the knowledg of sin but now the righteous of god without the law is manifest be wit by the law and the prophet even the righteous of god which is by faith of jesu christ unto all and upon all them that believ for there is no differ for all have sin and come short of the glori of god be justifi freeli by hi grace through the redempt that is in christ jesu whom god hath set forth to be a propiti through faith in hi blood to declar hi righteous for the remiss of sin that ar past through the forbear of god to declar i sai at thi time hi righteous that he might be just and the justifi of him which believeth in jesu where is boast then it is exclud by what law of work nai but by the law of faith therefor we conclud that a man is justifi by faith without the deed of the law is he the god of the jew onli is he not also of the gentil ye of the gentil also see it is on god which shall justifi the circumcis by faith and uncircumcis through faith do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law what shall we sai then that abraham our father as pertain to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justifi by work he hath whereof to glori but not befor god for what saith the scriptur abraham believ god and it wa count unto him for righteous now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodli hi faith is count for righteous even as david also describeth the blessed of the man unto whom god imputeth righteous without work sai bless ar thei whose iniqu ar forgiven and whose sin ar cover bless is the man to whom the lord will not imput sin cometh thi blessed then upon the circumcis onli or upon the uncircumcis also for we sai that faith wa reckon to abraham for righteous how wa it then reckon when he wa in circumcis or in uncircumcis not in circumcis but in uncircumcis and he receiv the sign of circumcis a seal of the righteous of the faith which he had yet be uncircumcis that he might be the father of all them that believ though thei be not circumcis that righteous might be imput unto them also and the father of circumcis to them who ar not of the circumcis onli but who also walk in the step of that faith of our father abraham which he had be yet uncircumcis for the promis that he should be the heir of the world wa not to abraham or to hi seed through the law but through the righteous of faith for if thei which ar of the law be heir faith is made void and the promis made of none effect becaus the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgress therefor it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promis might be sure to all the seed not to that onli which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of mani nation befor him whom he believ even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those thing which be not as though thei were who against hope believ in hope that he might becom the father of mani nation accord to that which wa spoken so shall thy seed be and be not weak in faith he consid not hi own bodi now dead when he wa about an hundr year old neither yet the dead of sarah womb he stagger not at the promis of god through unbelief but wa strong in faith give glori to god and be fulli persuad that what he had promis he wa abl also to perform and therefor it wa imput to him for righteous now it wa not written for hi sake alon that it wa imput to him but for us also to whom it shall be imput if we believ on him that rais up jesu our lord from the dead who wa deliv for our offenc and wa rais again for our justif therefor be justifi by faith we have peac with god through our lord jesu christ by whom also we have access by faith into thi grace wherein we stand and rejoic in hope of the glori of god and not onli so but we glori in tribul also know that tribul worketh patienc and patienc experi and experi hope and hope maketh not asham becaus the love of god is shed abroad in our heart by the holi ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without strength in due time christ di for the ungodli for scarc for a righteou man will on die yet peradventur for a good man some would even dare to die but god commendeth hi love toward us in that while we were yet sinner christ di for us much more then be now justifi by hi blood we shall be save from wrath through him for if when we were enemi we were reconcil to god by the death of hi son much more be reconcil we shall be save by hi life and not onli so but we also joi in god through our lord jesu christ by whom we have now receiv the aton wherefor as by on man sin enter into the world and death by sin and so death pass upon all men for that all have sin for until the law sin wa in the world but sin is not imput when there is no law nevertheless death reign from adam to mose even over them that had not sin after the similitud of adam transgress who is the figur of him that wa to come but not as the offenc so also is the free gift for if through the offenc of on mani be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by on man jesu christ hath abound unto mani and not as it wa by on that sin so is the gift for the judgment wa by on to condemn but the free gift is of mani offenc unto justif for if by on man offenc death reign by on much more thei which receiv abund of grace and of the gift of righteous shall reign in life by on jesu christ therefor as by the offenc of on judgment came upon all men to condemn even so by the righteous of on the free gift came upon all men unto justif of life for as by on man disobedi mani were made sinner so by the obedi of on shall mani be made righteou moreov the law enter that the offenc might abound but where sin abound grace did much more abound that as sin hath reign unto death even so might grace reign through righteous unto etern life by jesu christ our lord what shall we sai then shall we continu in sin that grace mai abound god forbid how shall we that ar dead to sin live ani longer therein know ye not that so mani of us as were baptiz into jesu christ were baptiz into hi death therefor we ar buri with him by baptism into death that like as christ wa rais up from the dead by the glori of the father even so we also should walk in new of life for if we have been plant togeth in the like of hi death we shall be also in the like of hi resurrect know thi that our old man is crucifi with him that the bodi of sin might be destroi that henceforth we should not serv sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with christ we believ that we shall also live with him know that christ be rais from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he di he di unto sin onc but in that he liveth he liveth unto god likewis reckon ye also yourselv to be dead inde unto sin but aliv unto god through jesu christ our lord let not sin therefor reign in your mortal bodi that ye should obei it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your member as instrument of unright unto sin but yield yourselv unto god as those that ar aliv from the dead and your member as instrument of righteous unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye ar not under the law but under grace what then shall we sin becaus we ar not under the law but under grace god forbid know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselv servant to obei hi servant ye ar to whom ye obei whether of sin unto death or of obedi unto righteous but god be thank that ye were the servant of sin but ye have obei from the heart that form of doctrin which wa deliv you be then made free from sin ye becam the servant of righteous i speak after the manner of men becaus of the infirm of your flesh for as ye have yield your member servant to unclean and to iniqu unto iniqu even so now yield your member servant to righteous unto holi for when ye were the servant of sin ye were free from righteous what fruit had ye then in those thing whereof ye ar now asham for the end of those thing is death but now be made free from sin and becom servant to god ye have your fruit unto holi and the end everlast life for the wage of sin is death but the gift of god is etern life through jesu christ our lord know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loos from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be marri to anoth man she shall be call an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be marri to anoth man wherefor my brethren ye also ar becom dead to the law by the bodi of christ that ye should be marri to anoth even to him who is rais from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the motion of sin which were by the law did work in our member to bring forth fruit unto death but now we ar deliv from the law that be dead wherein we were held that we should serv in new of spirit and not in the old of the letter what shall we sai then is the law sin god forbid nai i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet but sin take occas by the command wrought in me all manner of concupisc for without the law sin wa dead for i wa aliv without the law onc but when the command came sin reviv and i di and the command which wa ordain to life i found to be unto death for sin take occas by the command deceiv me and by it slew me wherefor the law is holi and the command holi and just and good wa then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin work death in me by that which is good that sin by the command might becom exceed sin for we know that the law is spiritu but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see anoth law in my member war against the law of my mind and bring me into captiv to the law of sin which is in my member o wretch man that i am who shall deliv me from the bodi of thi death i thank god through jesu christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serv the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin there is therefor now no condemn to them which ar in christ jesu who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesu hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it wa weak through the flesh god send hi own son in the like of sin flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteous of the law might be fulfil in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for thei that ar after the flesh do mind the thing of the flesh but thei that ar after the spirit the thing of the spirit for to be carnal mind is death but to be spiritu mind is life and peac becaus the carnal mind is enmiti against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither inde can be so then thei that ar in the flesh cannot pleas god but ye ar not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if ani man have not the spirit of christ he is none of hi and if christ be in you the bodi is dead becaus of sin but the spirit is life becaus of righteous but if the spirit of him that rais up jesu from the dead dwell in you he that rais up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodi by hi spirit that dwelleth in you therefor brethren we ar debtor not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortifi the deed of the bodi ye shall live for as mani as ar led by the spirit of god thei ar the son of god for ye have not receiv the spirit of bondag again to fear but ye have receiv the spirit of adopt wherebi we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth wit with our spirit that we ar the children of god and if children then heir heir of god and jointheir with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we mai be also glorifi togeth for i reckon that the suffer of thi present time ar not worthi to be compar with the glori which shall be reveal in us for the earnest expect of the creatur waiteth for the manifest of the son of god for the creatur wa made subject to vaniti not willingli but by reason of him who hath subject the same in hope becaus the creatur itself also shall be deliv from the bondag of corrupt into the gloriou liberti of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain togeth until now and not onli thei but ourselv also which have the firstfruit of the spirit even we ourselv groan within ourselv wait for the adopt to wit the redempt of our bodi for we ar save by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patienc wait for it likewis the spirit also helpeth our infirm for we know not what we should prai for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercess for us with groan which cannot be utter and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit becaus he maketh intercess for the saint accord to the will of god and we know that all thing work togeth for good to them that love god to them who ar the call accord to hi purpos for whom he did foreknow he also did predestin to be conform to the imag of hi son that he might be the firstborn among mani brethren moreov whom he did predestin them he also call and whom he call them he also justifi and whom he justifi them he also glorifi what shall we then sai to these thing if god be for us who can be against us he that spare not hi own son but deliv him up for us all how shall he not with him also freeli give us all thing who shall lai ani thing to the charg of god elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that di yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercess for us who shall separ us from the love of christ shall tribul or distress or persecut or famin or naked or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we ar kill all the dai long we ar account as sheep for the slaughter nai in all these thing we ar more than conqueror through him that love us for i am persuad that neither death nor life nor angel nor princip nor power nor thing present nor thing to come nor height nor depth nor ani other creatur shall be abl to separ us from the love of god which is in christ jesu our lord i sai the truth in christ i lie not my conscienc also bear me wit in the holi ghost that i have great heavi and continu sorrow in my heart for i could wish that myself were accurs from christ for my brethren my kinsmen accord to the flesh who ar israelit to whom pertaineth the adopt and the glori and the coven and the give of the law and the servic of god and the promis whose ar the father and of whom as concern the flesh christ came who is over all god bless for ever amen not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for thei ar not all israel which ar of israel neither becaus thei ar the seed of abraham ar thei all children but in isaac shall thy seed be call that is thei which ar the children of the flesh these ar not the children of god but the children of the promis ar count for the seed for thi is the word of promis at thi time will i come and sarah shall have a son and not onli thi but when rebecca also had conceiv by on even by our father isaac for the children be not yet born neither have done ani good or evil that the purpos of god accord to elect might stand not of work but of him that calleth it wa said unto her the elder shall serv the younger as it is written jacob have i love but esau have i hate what shall we sai then is there unright with god god forbid for he saith to mose i will have merci on whom i will have merci and i will have compass on whom i will have compass so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth merci for the scriptur saith unto pharaoh even for thi same purpos have i rais thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declar throughout all the earth therefor hath he merci on whom he will have merci and whom he will he hardeneth thou wilt sai then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resist hi will nai but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing form sai to him that form it why hast thou made me thu hath not the potter power over the clai of the same lump to make on vessel unto honour and anoth unto dishonour what if god will to shew hi wrath and to make hi power known endur with much longsuff the vessel of wrath fit to destruct and that he might make known the rich of hi glori on the vessel of merci which he had afor prepar unto glori even us whom he hath call not of the jew onli but also of the gentil as he saith also in ose i will call them my peopl which were not my peopl and her belov which wa not belov and it shall come to pass that in the place where it wa said unto them ye ar not my peopl there shall thei be call the children of the live god esaia also crieth concern israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be save for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteous becaus a short work will the lord make upon the earth and as esaia said befor except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha what shall we sai then that the gentil which follow not after righteous have attain to righteous even the righteous which is of faith but israel which follow after the law of righteous hath not attain to the law of righteous wherefor becaus thei sought it not by faith but as it were by the work of the law for thei stumbl at that stumblingston as it is written behold i lai in sion a stumblingston and rock of offenc and whosoev believeth on him shall not be asham brethren my heart desir and prayer to god for israel is that thei might be save for i bear them record that thei have a zeal of god but not accord to knowledg for thei be ignor of god righteous and go about to establish their own righteous have not submit themselv unto the righteous of god for christ is the end of the law for righteous to everi on that believeth for mose describeth the righteous which is of the law that the man which doeth those thing shall live by them but the righteous which is of faith speaketh on thi wise sai not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down from abov or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesu and shalt believ in thine heart that god hath rais him from the dead thou shalt be save for with the heart man believeth unto righteous and with the mouth confess is made unto salvat for the scriptur saith whosoev believeth on him shall not be asham for there is no differ between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoev shall call upon the name of the lord shall be save how then shall thei call on him in whom thei have not believ and how shall thei believ in him of whom thei have not heard and how shall thei hear without a preacher and how shall thei preach except thei be sent as it is written how beauti ar the feet of them that preach the gospel of peac and bring glad tide of good thing but thei have not all obei the gospel for esaia saith lord who hath believ our report so then faith cometh by hear and hear by the word of god but i sai have thei not heard ye verili their sound went into all the earth and their word unto the end of the world but i sai did not israel know first mose saith i will provok you to jealousi by them that ar no peopl and by a foolish nation i will anger you but esaia is veri bold and saith i wa found of them that sought me not i wa made manifest unto them that ask not after me but to israel he saith all dai long i have stretch forth my hand unto a disobedi and gainsai peopl i sai then hath god cast awai hi peopl god forbid for i also am an israelit of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin god hath not cast awai hi peopl which he foreknew wot ye not what the scriptur saith of elia how he maketh intercess to god against israel sai lord thei have kill thy prophet and dig down thine altar and i am left alon and thei seek my life but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserv to myself seven thousand men who have not bow the knee to the imag of baal even so then at thi present time also there is a remnant accord to the elect of grace and if by grace then is it no more of work otherwis grace is no more grace but if it be of work then it is no more grace otherwis work is no more work what then israel hath not obtain that which he seeketh for but the elect hath obtain it and the rest were blind accord as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber ey that thei should not see and ear that thei should not hear unto thi dai and david saith let their tabl be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recomp unto them let their ey be darken that thei mai not see and bow down their back alwai i sai then have thei stumbl that thei should fall god forbid but rather through their fall salvat is come unto the gentil for to provok them to jealousi now if the fall of them be the rich of the world and the diminish of them the rich of the gentil how much more their ful for i speak to you gentil inasmuch as i am the apostl of the gentil i magnifi mine offic if by ani mean i mai provok to emul them which ar my flesh and might save some of them for if the cast awai of them be the reconcil of the world what shall the receiv of them be but life from the dead for if the firstfruit be holi the lump is also holi and if the root be holi so ar the branch and if some of the branch be broken off and thou be a wild oliv tree wert graf in among them and with them partakest of the root and fat of the oliv tree boast not against the branch but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee thou wilt sai then the branch were broken off that i might be graf in well becaus of unbelief thei were broken off and thou standest by faith be not highmind but fear for if god spare not the natur branch take heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefor the good and sever of god on them which fell sever but toward thee good if thou continu in hi good otherwis thou also shalt be cut off and thei also if thei abid not still in unbelief shall be graf in for god is abl to graff them in again for if thou wert cut out of the oliv tree which is wild by natur and wert graf contrari to natur into a good oliv tree how much more shall these which be the natur branch be graf into their own oliv tree for i would not brethren that ye should be ignor of thi mysteri lest ye should be wise in your own conceit that blind in part is happen to israel until the ful of the gentil be come in and so all israel shall be save as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliver and shall turn awai ungodli from jacob for thi is my coven unto them when i shall take awai their sin as concern the gospel thei ar enemi for your sake but as touch the elect thei ar belov for the father sake for the gift and call of god ar without repent for as ye in time past have not believ god yet have now obtain merci through their unbelief even so have these also now not believ that through your merci thei also mai obtain merci for god hath conclud them all in unbelief that he might have merci upon all o the depth of the rich both of the wisdom and knowledg of god how unsearch ar hi judgment and hi wai past find out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been hi counsellor or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompens unto him again for of him and through him and to him ar all thing to whom be glori for ever amen i beseech you therefor brethren by the merci of god that ye present your bodi a live sacrific holi accept unto god which is your reason servic and be not conform to thi world but be ye transform by the renew of your mind that ye mai prove what is that good and accept and perfect will of god for i sai through the grace given unto me to everi man that is among you not to think of himself more highli than he ought to think but to think soberli accord as god hath dealt to everi man the measur of faith for as we have mani member in on bodi and all member have not the same offic so we be mani ar on bodi in christ and everi on member on of anoth have then gift differ accord to the grace that is given to us whether propheci let us prophesi accord to the proport of faith or ministri let us wait on our minist or he that teacheth on teach or he that exhorteth on exhort he that giveth let him do it with simplic he that ruleth with dilig he that sheweth merci with cheer let love be without dissimul abhor that which is evil cleav to that which is good be kindli affect on to anoth with brotherli love in honour prefer on anoth not sloth in busi fervent in spirit serv the lord rejoic in hope patient in tribul continu instant in prayer distribut to the necess of saint given to hospit bless them which persecut you bless and curs not rejoic with them that do rejoic and weep with them that weep be of the same mind on toward anoth mind not high thing but condescend to men of low estat be not wise in your own conceit recompens to no man evil for evil provid thing honest in the sight of all men if it be possibl as much as lieth in you live peaceabl with all men dearli belov aveng not yourselv but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeanc is mine i will repai saith the lord therefor if thine enemi hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so do thou shalt heap coal of fire on hi head be not overcom of evil but overcom evil with good let everi soul be subject unto the higher power for there is no power but of god the power that be ar ordain of god whosoev therefor resisteth the power resisteth the ordin of god and thei that resist shall receiv to themselv damnat for ruler ar not a terror to good work but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have prais of the same for he is the minist of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minist of god a reveng to execut wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefor ye must need be subject not onli for wrath but also for conscienc sake for for thi caus pai ye tribut also for thei ar god minist attend continu upon thi veri thing render therefor to all their due tribut to whom tribut is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour ow no man ani thing but to love on anoth for he that loveth anoth hath fulfil the law for thi thou shalt not commit adulteri thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear fals wit thou shalt not covet and if there be ani other command it is briefli comprehend in thi sai name thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself love worketh no ill to hi neighbour therefor love is the fulfil of the law and that know the time that now it is high time to awak out of sleep for now is our salvat nearer than when we believ the night is far spent the dai is at hand let us therefor cast off the work of dark and let us put on the armour of light let us walk honestli as in the dai not in riot and drunken not in chamber and wanton not in strife and envi but put ye on the lord jesu christ and make not provis for the flesh to fulfil the lust thereof him that is weak in the faith receiv ye but not to doubt disput for on believeth that he mai eat all thing anoth who is weak eateth herb let not him that eateth despis him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judg him that eateth for god hath receiv him who art thou that judgest anoth man servant to hi own master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god is abl to make him stand on man esteemeth on dai abov anoth anoth esteemeth everi dai alik let everi man be fulli persuad in hi own mind he that regardeth the dai regardeth it unto the lord and he that regardeth not the dai to the lord he doth not regard it he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thank and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thank for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefor or die we ar the lord for to thi end christ both di and rose and reviv that he might be lord both of the dead and live but why dost thou judg thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand befor the judgment seat of christ for it is written as i live saith the lord everi knee shall bow to me and everi tongu shall confess to god so then everi on of us shall give account of himself to god let us not therefor judg on anoth ani more but judg thi rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occas to fall in hi brother wai i know and am persuad by the lord jesu that there is noth unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth ani thing to be unclean to him it is unclean but if thy brother be griev with thy meat now walkest thou not charit destroi not him with thy meat for whom christ di let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteous and peac and joi in the holi ghost for he that in these thing serveth christ is accept to god and approv of men let us therefor follow after the thing which make for peac and thing wherewith on mai edifi anoth for meat destroi not the work of god all thing inde ar pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offenc it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor ani thing wherebi thy brother stumbleth or is offend or is made weak hast thou faith have it to thyself befor god happi is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth and he that doubteth is damn if he eat becaus he eateth not of faith for whatsoev is not of faith is sin we then that ar strong ought to bear the infirm of the weak and not to pleas ourselv let everi on of us pleas hi neighbour for hi good to edif for even christ pleas not himself but as it is written the reproach of them that reproach thee fell on me for whatsoev thing were written aforetim were written for our learn that we through patienc and comfort of the scriptur might have hope now the god of patienc and consol grant you to be likemind on toward anoth accord to christ jesu that ye mai with on mind and on mouth glorifi god even the father of our lord jesu christ wherefor receiv ye on anoth as christ also receiv us to the glori of god now i sai that jesu christ wa a minist of the circumcis for the truth of god to confirm the promis made unto the father and that the gentil might glorifi god for hi merci as it is written for thi caus i will confess to thee among the gentil and sing unto thy name and again he saith rejoic ye gentil with hi peopl and again prais the lord all ye gentil and laud him all ye peopl and again esaia saith there shall be a root of jess and he that shall rise to reign over the gentil in him shall the gentil trust now the god of hope fill you with all joi and peac in believ that ye mai abound in hope through the power of the holi ghost and i myself also am persuad of you my brethren that ye also ar full of good fill with all knowledg abl also to admonish on anoth nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldli unto you in some sort

sanctifi by the holi ghost i have therefor whereof i mai glori through jesu christ in those thing which pertain to god for i will not dare to speak of ani of those thing which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentil obedi by word and deed through mighti sign and wonder by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fulli preach the gospel of christ yea so have i strive to preach the gospel not where christ wa name lest i should build upon anoth man foundat but as it is written to whom he wa not spoken of thei shall see and thei that have

all nation for the obedi of faith to god onli wise be glori through jesu christ for ever amen the first epistl of paul the apostl to the corinthian paul call to be an apostl of jesu christ through the will of god and sosthen our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth to them that ar sanctifi in christ jesu call to be saint with all that in everi place call upon the name of jesu christ our lord both their and our grace be unto you and peac from god our father and from the lord jesu christ i thank my god alwai on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesu christ that in everi thing ye ar enrich by him in all utter and in all knowledg even as the testimoni of christ wa confirm in you so that ye come behind in no gift wait for the come of our lord jesu christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye mai be blameless in the dai of our lord jesu christ god is faith by whom ye were call unto the fellowship of hi son jesu christ our lord now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesu christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divis among you but that ye be perfectli join togeth in the same mind and in the same judgment for it hath been declar unto me of you my brethren by them which ar of the hous of chloe that there ar content among you now thi i sai that everi on of you saith i am of paul and i of apollo and i of cepha and i of christ is christ divid wa paul crucifi for you or were ye baptiz in the name of paul i thank god that i baptiz none of you but crispu and gaiu lest ani should sai that i had baptiz in mine own name and i baptiz also the household of stephana besid i know not whether i baptiz ani other for christ sent me not to baptiz but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of word lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect for the preach of the cross is to them that perish foolish but unto us which ar save it is the power of god for it is written i will destroi the wisdom of the wise and will bring to noth the understand of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disput of thi world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of thi world for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleas god by the foolish of preach to save them that believ for the jew requir a sign and the greek seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucifi unto the jew a stumblingblock and unto the greek foolish but unto them which ar call both jew and greek christ the power of god and the wisdom of god becaus the foolish of god is wiser than men and the weak of god is stronger than men for ye see your call brethren how that not mani wise men after the flesh not mani mighti not mani nobl ar call but god hath chosen the foolish thing of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak thing of the world to confound the thing which ar mighti and base thing of the world and thing which ar despis hath god chosen yea and thing which ar not to bring to nought thing that ar that no flesh should glori in hi presenc but of him ar ye in christ jesu who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteous and sanctif and redempt that accord as it is written he that glorieth let him glori in the lord and i brethren when i came to you came not with excel of speech or of wisdom declar unto you the testimoni of god for i determin not to know ani thing among you save jesu christ and him crucifi and i wa with you in weak and in fear and in much trembl and my speech and my preach wa not with entic word of man wisdom but in demonstr of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god howbeit we speak wisdom among them that ar perfect yet not the wisdom of thi world nor of the princ of thi world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of god in a mysteri even the hidden wisdom which god ordain befor the world unto our glori which none of the princ of thi world knew for had thei known it thei would not have crucifi the lord of glori but as it is written ey hath not seen nor ear heard neither have enter into the heart of man the thing which god hath prepar for them that love him but god hath reveal them unto us by hi spirit for the spirit searcheth all thing yea the deep thing of god for what man knoweth the thing of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the thing of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have receiv not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the thing that ar freeli given to us of god which thing also we speak not in the word which man wisdom teacheth but which the holi ghost teacheth compar spiritu thing with spiritu but the natur man receiveth not the thing of the spirit of god for thei ar foolish unto him neither can he know them becaus thei ar spiritu discern but he that is spiritu judgeth all thing yet he himself is judg of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he mai instruct him but we have the mind of christ and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritu but as unto carnal even as unto babe in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not abl to bear it neither yet now ar ye abl for ye ar yet carnal for wherea there is among you envi and strife and divis ar ye not carnal and walk as men for while on saith i am of paul and anoth i am of apollo ar ye not carnal who then is paul and who is apollo but minist by whom ye believ even as the lord gave to everi man i have plant apollo water but god gave the increas so then neither is he that planteth ani thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increas now he that planteth and he that watereth ar on and everi man shall receiv hi own reward accord to hi own labour for we ar labour togeth with god ye ar god husbandri ye ar god build accord to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuild i have laid the foundat and anoth buildeth thereon but let everi man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundat can no man lai than that is laid which is jesu christ now if ani man build upon thi foundat gold silver preciou stone wood hai stubbl everi man work shall be made manifest for the dai shall declar it becaus it shall be reveal by fire and the fire shall try everi man work of what sort it is if ani man work abid which he hath built thereupon he shall receiv a reward if ani man work shall be burn he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be save yet so as by fire know ye not that ye ar the templ of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if ani man defil the templ of god him shall god destroi for the templ of god is holi which templ ye ar let no man deceiv himself if ani man among you seemeth to be wise in thi world let him becom a fool that he mai be wise for the wisdom of thi world is foolish with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own crafti and again the lord knoweth the thought of the wise that thei ar vain therefor let no man glori in men for all thing ar your whether paul or apollo or cepha or the world or life or death or thing present or thing to come all ar your and ye ar christ and christ is god let a man so account of us as of the minist of christ and steward of the mysteri of god moreov it is requir in steward that a man be found faith but with me it is a veri small thing that i should be judg of you or of man judgment yea i judg not mine own self for i know noth by myself yet am i not herebi justifi but he that judgeth me is the lord therefor judg noth befor the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden thing of dark and will make manifest the counsel of the heart and then shall everi man have prais of god and these thing brethren i have in a figur transfer to myself and to apollo for your sake that ye might learn in us not to think of men abov that which is written that no on of you be puf up for on against anoth for who maketh thee to differ from anoth and what hast thou that thou didst not receiv now if thou didst receiv it why dost thou glori as if thou hadst not receiv it now ye ar full now ye ar rich ye have reign as king without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you for i think that god hath set forth us the apostl last as it were appoint to death for we ar made a spectacl unto the world and to angel and to men we ar fool for christ sake but ye ar wise in christ we ar weak but ye ar strong ye ar honour but we ar despis even unto thi present hour we both hunger and thirst and ar nake and ar buffet and have no certain dwellingplac and labour work with our own hand be revil we bless be persecut we suffer it be defam we intreat we ar made as the filth of the world and ar the offscour of all thing unto thi dai i write not these thing to shame you but as my belov son i warn you for though ye have ten thousand instruct in christ yet have ye not mani father for in christ jesu i have begotten you through the gospel wherefor i beseech you be ye follow of me for thi caus have i sent unto you timotheu who is my belov son and faith in the lord who shall bring you into remembr of my wai which be in christ as i teach everi where in everi church now some ar puf up as though i would not come to you but i will come to you shortli if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which ar puf up but the power for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meek it is report commonli that there is fornic among you and such fornic as is not so much as name among the gentil that on should have hi father wife and ye ar puf up and have not rather mourn that he that hath done thi deed might be taken awai from among you for i verili as absent in bodi but present in spirit have judg alreadi as though i were present concern him that hath so done thi deed in the name of our lord jesu christ when ye ar gather togeth and my spirit with the power of our lord jesu christ to deliv such an on unto satan for the destruct of the flesh that the spirit mai be save in the dai of the lord jesu your glori is not good know ye not that a littl leaven leaveneth the whole lump purg out therefor the old leaven that ye mai be a new lump as ye ar unleaven for even christ our passov is sacrif for us therefor let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malic and wicked but with the unleaven bread of sincer and truth i wrote unto you in an epistl not to compani with fornic yet not altogeth with the fornic of thi world or with the covet or extortion or with idolat for then must ye need go out of the world but now i have written unto you not to keep compani if ani man that is call a brother be a fornic or covet or an idolat or a railer or a drunkard or an extortion with such an on no not to eat for what have i to do to judg them also that ar without do not ye judg them that ar within but them that ar without god judgeth therefor put awai from among yourselv that wick person dare ani of you have a matter against anoth go to law befor the unjust and not befor the saint do ye not know that the saint shall judg the world and if the world shall be judg by you ar ye unworthi to judg the smallest matter know ye not that we shall judg angel how much more thing that pertain to thi life if then ye have judgment of thing pertain to thi life set them to judg who ar least esteem in the church i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not on that shall be abl to judg between hi brethren but brother goeth to law with brother and that befor the unbeliev now therefor there is utterli a fault among you becaus ye go to law on with anoth why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselv to be defraud nai ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren know ye not that the unright shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceiv neither fornic nor idolat nor adulter nor effemin nor abus of themselv with mankind nor thiev nor covet nor drunkard nor revil nor extortion shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but ye ar wash but ye ar sanctifi but ye ar justifi in the name of the lord jesu and by the spirit of our god all thing ar law unto me but all thing ar not expedi all thing ar law for me but i will not be brought under the power of ani meat for the belli and the belli for meat but god shall destroi both it and them now the bodi is not for fornic but for the lord and the lord for the bodi and god hath both rais up the lord and will also rais up us by hi own power know ye not that your bodi ar the member of christ shall i then take the member of christ and make them the member of an harlot god forbid what know ye not that he which is join to an harlot is on bodi for two saith he shall be on flesh but he that is join unto the lord is on spirit flee fornic everi sin that a man doeth is without the bodi but he that committeth fornic sinneth against hi own bodi what know ye not that your bodi is the templ of the holi ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye ar not your own for ye ar bought with a price therefor glorifi god in your bodi and in your spirit which ar god now concern the thing whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornic let everi man have hi own wife and let everi woman have her own husband let the husband render unto the wife due benevol and likewis also the wife unto the husband the wife hath not power of her own bodi but the husband and likewis also the husband hath not power of hi own bodi but the wife defraud ye not on the other except it be with consent for a time that ye mai give yourselv to fast and prayer and come togeth again that satan tempt you not for your incontin but i speak thi by permiss and not of command for i would that all men were even as i myself but everi man hath hi proper gift of god on after thi manner and anoth after that i sai therefor to the unmarri and widow it is good for them if thei abid even as i but if thei cannot contain let them marri for it is better to marri than to burn and unto the marri i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart let her remain unmarri or be reconcil to her husband and let not the husband put awai hi wife but to the rest speak i not the lord if ani brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleas to dwell with him let him not put her awai and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleas to dwell with her let her not leav him for the unbeliev husband is sanctifi by the wife and the unbeliev wife is sanctifi by the husband els were your children unclean but now ar thei holi but if the unbeliev depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondag in such case but god hath call us to peac for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife but as god hath distribut to everi man as the lord hath call everi on so let him walk and so ordain i in all church is ani man call be circumcis let him not becom uncircumcis is ani call in uncircumcis let him not be circumcis circumcis is noth and uncircumcis is noth but the keep of the command of god let everi man abid in the same call wherein he wa call art thou call be a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free us it rather for he that is call in the lord be a servant is the lord freeman likewis also he that is call be free is christ servant ye ar bought with a price be not ye the servant of men brethren let everi man wherein he is call therein abid with god now concern virgin i have no command of the lord yet i give my judgment as on that hath obtain merci of the lord to be faith i suppos therefor that thi is good for the present distress i sai that it is good for a man so to be art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loos art thou loos from a wife seek not a wife but and if thou marri thou hast not sin and if a virgin marri she hath not sin nevertheless such shall have troubl in the flesh but i spare you but thi i sai brethren the time is short it remaineth that both thei that have wive be as though thei had none and thei that weep as though thei wept not and thei that rejoic as though thei rejoic not and thei that bui as though thei possess not and thei that us thi world as not abus it for the fashion of thi world passeth awai but i would have you without care he that is unmarri careth for the thing that belong to the lord how he mai pleas the lord but he that is marri careth for the thing that ar of the world how he mai pleas hi wife there is differ also between a wife and a virgin the unmarri woman careth for the thing of the lord that she mai be holi both in bodi and in spirit but she that is marri careth for the thing of the world how she mai pleas her husband and thi i speak for your own profit not that i mai cast a snare upon you but for that which is come and that ye mai attend upon the lord without distract but if ani man think that he behaveth himself uncom toward hi virgin if she pass the flower of her ag and need so requir let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marri nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in hi heart have no necess but hath power over hi own will and hath so decre in hi heart that he will keep hi virgin doeth well so then he that giveth her in marriag doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriag doeth better the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberti to be marri to whom she will onli in the lord but she is happier if she so abid after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god now as touch thing offer unto idol we know that we all have knowledg knowledg puffeth up but chariti edifieth and if ani man think that he knoweth ani thing he knoweth noth yet as he ought to know but if ani man love god the same is known of him as concern therefor the eat of those thing that ar offer in sacrific unto idol we know that an idol is noth in the world and that there is none other god but on for though there be that ar call god whether in heaven or in earth as there be god mani and lord mani but to us there is but on god the father of whom ar all thing and we in him and on lord jesu christ by whom ar all thing and we by him howbeit there is not in everi man that knowledg for some with conscienc of the idol unto thi hour eat it as a thing offer unto an idol and their conscienc be weak is defil but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat ar we the better neither if we eat not ar we the wors but take heed lest by ani mean thi liberti of your becom a stumblingblock to them that ar weak for if ani man see thee which hast knowledg sit at meat in the idol templ shall not the conscienc of him which is weak be embolden to eat those thing which ar offer to idol and through thy knowledg shall the weak brother perish for whom christ di but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscienc ye sin against christ wherefor if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend am i not an apostl am i not free have i not seen jesu christ our lord ar not ye my work in the lord if i be not an apostl unto other yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship ar ye in the lord mine answer to them that do examin me is thi have we not power to eat and to drink have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostl and as the brethren of the lord and cepha or i onli and barnaba have not we power to forbear work who goeth a warfar ani time at hi own charg who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock sai i these thing as a man or saith not the law the same also for it is written in the law of mose thou shalt not muzzl the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen or saith he it altogeth for our sake for our sake no doubt thi is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partak of hi hope if we have sown unto you spiritu thing is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal thing if other be partak of thi power over you ar not we rather nevertheless we have not us thi power but suffer all thing lest we should hinder the gospel of christ do ye not know that thei which minist about holi thing live of the thing of the templ and thei which wait at the altar ar partak with the altar even so hath the lord ordain that thei which preach the gospel should live of the gospel but i have us none of these thing neither have i written these thing that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that ani man should make my glori void for though i preach the gospel i have noth to glori of for necess is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel for if i do thi thing willingli i have a reward but if against my will a dispens of the gospel is commit unto me what is my reward then verili that when i preach the gospel i mai make the gospel of christ without charg that i abus not my power in the gospel for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more and unto the jew i becam as a jew that i might gain the jew to them that ar under the law as under the law that i might gain them that ar under the law to them that ar without law as without law be not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that ar without law to the weak becam i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all thing to all men that i might by all mean save some and thi i do for the gospel sake that i might be partak thereof with you know ye not that thei which run in a race run all but on receiveth the prize so run that ye mai obtain and everi man that striveth for the masteri is temper in all thing now thei do it to obtain a corrupt crown but we an incorrupt i therefor so run not as uncertainli so fight i not as on that beateth the air but i keep under my bodi and bring it into subject lest that by ani mean when i have preach to other i myself should be a castawai moreov brethren i would not that ye should be ignor how that all our father were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and were all baptiz unto mose in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritu meat and did all drink the same spiritu drink for thei drank of that spiritu rock that follow them and that rock wa christ but with mani of them god wa not well pleas for thei were overthrown in the wilder now these thing were our exampl to the intent we should not lust after evil thing as thei also lust neither be ye idolat as were some of them as it is written the peopl sat down to eat and drink and rose up to plai neither let us commit fornic as some of them commit and fell in on dai three and twenti thousand neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempt and were destroi of serpent neither murmur ye as some of them also murmur and were destroi of the destroy now all these thing happen unto them for ensampl and thei ar written for our admonit upon whom the end of the world ar come wherefor let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptat taken you but such as is common to man but god is faith who will not suffer you to be tempt abov that ye ar abl but will with the temptat also make a wai to escap that ye mai be abl to bear it wherefor my dearli belov flee from idolatri i speak as to wise men judg ye what i sai the cup of bless which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the bodi of christ for we be mani ar on bread and on bodi for we ar all partak of that on bread behold israel after the flesh ar not thei which eat of the sacrific partak of the altar what sai i then that the idol is ani thing or that which is offer in sacrific to idol is ani thing but i sai that the thing which the gentil sacrific thei sacrific to devil and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devil ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devil ye cannot be partak of the lord tabl and of the tabl of devil do we provok the lord to jealousi ar we stronger than he all thing ar law for me but all thing ar not expedi all thing ar law for me but all thing edifi not let no man seek hi own but everi man anoth wealth whatsoev is sold in the shambl that eat ask no question for conscienc sake for the earth is the lord and the ful thereof if ani of them that believ not bid you to a feast and ye be dispos to go whatsoev is set befor you eat ask no question for conscienc sake but if ani man sai unto you thi is offer in sacrific unto idol eat not for hi sake that shew it and for conscienc sake for the earth is the lord and the ful thereof conscienc i sai not thine own but of the other for why is my liberti judg of anoth man conscienc for if i by grace be a partak why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thank whether therefor ye eat or drink or whatsoev ye do do all to the glori of god give none offenc neither to the jew nor to the gentil nor to the church of god even as i pleas all men in all thing not seek mine own profit but the profit of mani that thei mai be save be ye follow of me even as i also am of christ now i prais you brethren that ye rememb me in all thing and keep the ordin as i deliv them to you but i would have you know that the head of everi man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god everi man prai or prophesi have hi head cover dishonoureth hi head but everi woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncov dishonoureth her head for that is even all on as if she were shaven for if the woman be not cover let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be cover for a man inde ought not to cover hi head forasmuch as he is the imag and glori of god but the woman is the glori of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither wa the man creat for the woman but the woman for the man for thi caus ought the woman to have power on her head becaus of the angel nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all thing of god judg in yourselv is it come that a woman prai unto god uncov doth not even natur itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glori to her for her hair is given her for a cover but if ani man seem to be contenti we have no such custom neither the church of god now in thi that i declar unto you i prais you not that ye come togeth not for the better but for the wors for first of all when ye come togeth in the church i hear that there be divis among you and i partli believ it for there must be also heresi among you that thei which ar approv mai be made manifest among you when ye come togeth therefor into on place thi is not to eat the lord supper for in eat everi on taketh befor other hi own supper and on is hungri and anoth is drunken what have ye not hous to eat and to drink in or despis ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i sai to you shall i prais you in thi i prais you not for i have receiv of the lord that which also i deliv unto you that the lord jesu the same night in which he wa betrai took bread and when he had given thank he brake it and said take eat thi is my bodi which is broken for you thi do in remembr of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup sai thi cup is the new testament in my blood thi do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembr of me for as often as ye eat thi bread and drink thi cup ye do shew the lord death till he come wherefor whosoev shall eat thi bread and drink thi cup of the lord unworthili shall be guilti of the bodi and blood of the lord but let a man examin himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthili eateth and drinketh damnat to himself not discern the lord bodi for thi caus mani ar weak and sickli among you and mani sleep for if we would judg ourselv we should not be judg but when we ar judg we ar chasten of the lord that we should not be condemn with the world wherefor my brethren when ye come togeth to eat tarri on for anoth and if ani man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not togeth unto condemn and the rest will i set in order when i come now concern spiritu gift brethren i would not have you ignor ye know that ye were gentil carri awai unto these dumb idol even as ye were led wherefor i give you to understand that no man speak by the spirit of god calleth jesu accurs and that no man can sai that jesu is the lord but by the holi ghost now there ar divers of gift but the same spirit and there ar differ of administr but the same lord and there ar divers of oper but it is the same god which worketh all in all but the manifest of the spirit is given to everi man to profit withal for to on is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to anoth the word of knowledg by the same spirit to anoth faith by the same spirit to anoth the gift of heal by the same spirit to anoth the work of miracl to anoth propheci to anoth discern of spirit to anoth diver kind of tongu to anoth the interpret of tongu but all these worketh that on and the selfsam spirit divid to everi man sever as he will for as the bodi is on and hath mani member and all the member of that on bodi be mani ar on bodi so also is christ for by on spirit ar we all baptiz into on bodi whether we be jew or gentil whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into on spirit for the bodi is not on member but mani if the foot shall sai becaus i am not the hand i am not of the bodi is it therefor not of the bodi and if the ear shall sai becaus i am not the ey i am not of the bodi is it therefor not of the bodi if the whole bodi were an ey where were the hear if the whole were hear where were the smell but now hath god set the member everi on of them in the bodi as it hath pleas him and if thei were all on member where were the bodi but now ar thei mani member yet but on bodi and the ey cannot sai unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you nai much more those member of the bodi which seem to be more feebl ar necessari and those member of the bodi which we think to be less honour upon these we bestow more abund honour and our uncom part have more abund comeli for our come part have no need but god hath temper the bodi togeth have given more abund honour to that part which lack that there should be no schism in the bodi but that the member should have the same care on for anoth and whether on member suffer all the member suffer with it or on member be honour all the member rejoic with it now ye ar the bodi of christ and member in particular and god hath set some in the church first apostl secondarili prophet thirdli teacher after that miracl then gift of heal help govern divers of tongu ar all apostl ar all prophet ar all teacher ar all worker of miracl have all the gift of heal do all speak with tongu do all interpret but covet earnestli the best gift and yet shew i unto you a more excel wai though i speak with the tongu of men and of angel and have not chariti i am becom as sound brass or a tinkl cymbal and though i have the gift of propheci and understand all mysteri and all knowledg and though i have all faith so that i could remov mountain and have not chariti i am noth and though i bestow all my good to feed the poor and though i give my bodi to be burn and have not chariti it profiteth me noth chariti suffereth long and is kind chariti envieth not chariti vaunteth not itself is not puf up doth not behav itself unseemli seeketh not her own is not easili provok thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniqu but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all thing believeth all thing hopeth all thing endureth all thing chariti never faileth but whether there be propheci thei shall fail whether there be tongu thei shall ceas whether there be knowledg it shall vanish awai for we know in part and we prophesi in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done awai when i wa a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i becam a man i put awai childish thing for now we see through a glass darkli but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope chariti these three but the greatest of these is chariti follow after chariti and desir spiritu gift but rather that ye mai prophesi for he that speaketh in an unknown tongu speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteri but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edif and exhort and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongu edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church i would that ye all spake with tongu but rather that ye prophesi for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongu except he interpret that the church mai receiv edifi now brethren if i come unto you speak with tongu what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revel or by knowledg or by prophesi or by doctrin and even thing without life give sound whether pipe or harp except thei give a distinct in the sound how shall it be known what is pipe or harp for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepar himself to the battl so likewis ye except ye utter by the tongu word easi to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air there ar it mai be so mani kind of voic in the world and none of them is without signif therefor if i know not the mean of the voic i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me even so ye forasmuch as ye ar zealou of spiritu gift seek that ye mai excel to the edifi of the church wherefor let him that speaketh in an unknown tongu prai that he mai interpret for if i prai in an unknown tongu my spirit prayeth but my understand is unfruit what is it then i will prai with the spirit and i will prai with the understand also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understand also els when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearn sai amen at thy give of thank see he understandeth not what thou sayest for thou verili givest thank well but the other is not edifi i thank my god i speak with tongu more than ye all yet in the church i had rather speak five word with my understand that by my voic i might teach other also than ten thousand word in an unknown tongu brethren be not children in understand howbeit in malic be ye children but in understand be men in the law it is written with men of other tongu and other lip will i speak unto thi peopl and yet for all that will thei not hear me saith the lord wherefor tongu ar for a sign not to them that believ but to them that believ not but prophesi serveth not for them that believ not but for them which believ if therefor the whole church be come togeth into on place and all speak with tongu and there come in those that ar unlearn or unbeliev will thei not sai that ye ar mad but if all prophesi and there come in on that believeth not or on unlearn he is convinc of all he is judg of all and thu ar the secret of hi heart made manifest and so fall down on hi face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth how is it then brethren when ye come togeth everi on of you hath a psalm hath a doctrin hath a tongu hath a revel hath an interpret let all thing be done unto edifi if ani man speak in an unknown tongu let it be by two or at the most by three and that by cours and let on interpret but if there be no interpret let him keep silenc in the church and let him speak to himself and to god let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judg if ani thing be reveal to anoth that sitteth by let the first hold hi peac for ye mai all prophesi on by on that all mai learn and all mai be comfort and the spirit of the prophet ar subject to the prophet for god is not the author of confus but of peac as in all church of the saint let your women keep silenc in the church for it is not permit unto them to speak but thei ar command to be under obedi as also saith the law and if thei will learn ani thing let them ask their husband at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you onli if ani man think himself to be a prophet or spiritu let him acknowledg that the thing that i write unto you ar the command of the lord but if ani man be ignor let him be ignor wherefor brethren covet to prophesi and forbid not to speak with tongu let all thing be done decent and in order moreov brethren i declar unto you the gospel which i preach unto you which also ye have receiv and wherein ye stand by which also ye ar save if ye keep in memori what i preach unto you unless ye have believ in vain for i deliv unto you first of all that which i also receiv how that christ di for our sin accord to the scriptur and that he wa buri and that he rose again the third dai accord to the scriptur and that he wa seen of cepha then of the twelv after that he wa seen of abov five hundr brethren at onc of whom the greater part remain unto thi present but some ar fallen asleep after that he wa seen of jame then of all the apostl and last of all he wa seen of me also as of on born out of due time for i am the least of the apostl that am not meet to be call an apostl becaus i persecut the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and hi grace which wa bestow upon me wa not in vain but i labour more abundantli than thei all yet not i but the grace of god which wa with me therefor whether it were i or thei so we preach and so ye believ now if christ be preach that he rose from the dead how sai some among you that there is no resurrect of the dead but if there be no resurrect of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preach vain and your faith is also vain yea and we ar found fals wit of god becaus we have testifi of god that he rais up christ whom he rais not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not christ rais and if christ be not rais your faith is vain ye ar yet in your sin then thei also which ar fallen asleep in christ ar perish if in thi life onli we have hope in christ we ar of all men most miser but now is christ risen from the dead and becom the firstfruit of them that slept for sinc by man came death by man came also the resurrect of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made aliv but everi man in hi own order christ the firstfruit afterward thei that ar christ at hi come then cometh the end when he shall have deliv up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all author and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemi under hi feet the last enemi that shall be destroi is death for he hath put all thing under hi feet but when he saith all thing ar put under him it is manifest that he is except which did put all thing under him and when all thing shall be subdu unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all thing under him that god mai be all in all els what shall thei do which ar baptiz for the dead if the dead rise not at all why ar thei then baptiz for the dead and why stand we in jeopardi everi hour i protest by your rejoic which i have in christ jesu our lord i die daili if after the manner of men i have fought with beast at ephesu what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we die be not deceiv evil commun corrupt good manner awak to righteous and sin not for some have not the knowledg of god i speak thi to your shame but some man will sai how ar the dead rais up and with what bodi do thei come thou fool that which thou sowest is not quicken except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that bodi that shall be but bare grain it mai chanc of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a bodi as it hath pleas him and to everi seed hi own bodi all flesh is not the same flesh but there is on kind of flesh of men anoth flesh of beast anoth of fish and anoth of bird there ar also celesti bodi and bodi terrestri but the glori of the celesti is on and the glori of the terrestri is anoth there is on glori of the sun and anoth glori of the moon and anoth glori of the star for on star differeth from anoth star in glori so also is the resurrect of the dead it is sown in corrupt it is rais in incorrupt it is sown in dishonour it is rais in glori it is sown in weak it is rais in power it is sown a natur bodi it is rais a spiritu bodi there is a natur bodi and there is a spiritu bodi and so it is written the first man adam wa made a live soul the last adam wa made a quicken spirit howbeit that wa not first which is spiritu but that which is natur and afterward that which is spiritu the first man is of the earth earthi the second man is the lord from heaven as is the earthi such ar thei also that ar earthi and as is the heavenli such ar thei also that ar heavenli and as we have born the imag of the earthi we shall also bear the imag of the heavenli now thi i sai brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corrupt inherit incorrupt behold i shew you a mysteri we shall not all sleep but we shall all be chang in a moment in the twinkl of an ey at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be rais incorrupt and we shall be chang for thi corrupt must put on incorrupt and thi mortal must put on immort so when thi corrupt shall have put on incorrupt and thi mortal shall have put on immort then shall be brought to pass the sai that is written death is swallow up in victori o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victori the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thank be to god which giveth us the victori through our lord jesu christ therefor my belov brethren be ye stedfast unmov alwai abound in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord now concern the collect for the saint as i have given order to the church of galatia even so do ye upon the first dai of the week let everi on of you lai by him in store as god hath prosper him that there be no gather when i come and when i come whomsoev ye shall approv by your letter them will i send to bring your liber unto jerusalem and if it be meet that i go also thei shall go with me now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia and it mai be that i will abid yea and winter with you that ye mai bring me on my journei whithersoev i go for i will not see you now by the wai but i trust to tarri a while with you if the lord permit but i will tarri at ephesu until pentecost for a great door and effectu is open unto me and there ar mani adversari now if timotheu come see that he mai be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do let no man therefor despis him but conduct him forth in peac that he mai come unto me for i look for him with the brethren as touch our brother apollo i greatli desir him to come unto you with the brethren but hi will wa not at all to come at thi time but he will come when he shall have conveni time watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all your thing be done with chariti i beseech you brethren ye know the hous of stephana that it is the firstfruit of achaia and that thei have addict themselv to the ministri of the saint that ye submit yourselv unto such and to everi on that helpeth with us and laboureth i am glad of the come of stephana and fortunatu and achaicu for that which wa lack on your part thei have suppli for thei have refresh my spirit and your therefor acknowledg ye them that ar such the church of asia salut you aquila and priscilla salut you much in the lord with the church that is in their hous all the brethren greet you greet ye on anoth with an holi kiss the salut of me paul with mine own hand if ani man love not the lord jesu christ let him be anathema maranatha the grace of our lord jesu christ be with you my love be with you all in christ jesu amen the second epistl of paul the apostl to the corinthian paul an apostl of jesu christ by the will of god and timothi our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the saint which ar in all achaia grace be to you and peac from god our father and from the lord jesu christ bless be god even the father of our lord jesu christ the father of merci and the god of all comfort who comforteth us in all our tribul that we mai be abl to comfort them which ar in ani troubl by the comfort wherewith we ourselv ar comfort of god for as the suffer of christ abound in us so our consol also aboundeth by christ and whether we be afflict it is for your consol and salvat which is effectu in the endur of the same suffer which we also suffer or whether we be comfort it is for your consol and salvat and our hope of you is stedfast know that as ye ar partak of the suffer so shall ye be also of the consol for we would not brethren have you ignor of our troubl which came to us in asia that we were press out of measur abov strength insomuch that we despair even of life but we had the sentenc of death in ourselv that we should not trust in ourselv but in god which raiseth the dead who deliv us from so great a death and doth deliv in whom we trust that he will yet deliv us ye also help togeth by prayer for us that for the gift bestow upon us by the mean of mani person thank mai be given by mani on our behalf for our rejoic is thi the testimoni of our conscienc that in simplic and godli sincer not with fleshli wisdom but by the grace of god we have had our convers in the world and more abundantli to youward for we write none other thing unto you than what ye read or acknowledg and i trust ye shall acknowledg even to the end as also ye have acknowledg us in part that we ar your rejoic even as ye also ar our in the dai of the lord jesu and in thi confid i wa mind to come unto you befor that ye might have a second benefit and to pass by you into macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my wai toward judaea when i therefor wa thu mind did i us light or the thing that i purpos do i purpos accord to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nai nai but as god is true our word toward you wa not yea and nai for the son of god jesu christ who wa preach among you by us even by me and silvanu and timotheu wa not yea and nai but in him wa yea for all the promis of god in him ar yea and in him amen unto the glori of god by us now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anoint us is god who hath also seal us and given the earnest of the spirit in our heart moreov i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth not for that we have dominion over your faith but ar helper of your joi for by faith ye stand but i determin thi with myself that i would not come again to you in heavi for if i make you sorri who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorri by me and i wrote thi same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoic have confid in you all that my joi is the joi of you all for out of much afflict and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with mani tear not that ye should be griev but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantli unto you but if ani have caus grief he hath not griev me but in part that i mai not overcharg you all suffici to such a man is thi punish which wa inflict of mani so that contrariwis ye ought rather to forgiv him and comfort him lest perhap such a on should be swallow up with overmuch sorrow wherefor i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him for to thi end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedi in all thing to whom ye forgiv ani thing i forgiv also for if i forgav ani thing to whom i forgav it for your sake forgav i it in the person of christ lest satan should get an advantag of us for we ar not ignor of hi devic furthermor when i came to troa to preach christ gospel and a door wa open unto me of the lord i had no rest in my spirit becaus i found not titu my brother but take my leav of them i went from thenc into macedonia now thank be unto god which alwai causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of hi knowledg by us in everi place for we ar unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that ar save and in them that perish to the on we ar the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life and who is suffici for these thing for we ar not as mani which corrupt the word of god but as of sincer but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ do we begin again to commend ourselv or need we as some other epistl of commend to you or letter of commend from you ye ar our epistl written in our heart known and read of all men forasmuch as ye ar manifestli declar to be the epistl of christ minist by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the live god not in tabl of stone but in fleshi tabl of the heart and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we ar suffici of ourselv to think ani thing as of ourselv but our suffici is of god who also hath made us abl minist of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministr of death written and engraven in stone wa gloriou so that the children of israel could not stedfastli behold the face of mose for the glori of hi counten which glori wa to be done awai how shall not the ministr of the spirit be rather gloriou for if the ministr of condemn be glori much more doth the ministr of righteous exce in glori for even that which wa made gloriou had no glori in thi respect by reason of the glori that excelleth for if that which is done awai wa gloriou much more that which remaineth is gloriou see then that we have such hope we us great plain of speech and not as mose which put a vail over hi face that the children of israel could not stedfastli look to the end of that which is abolish but their mind were blind for until thi dai remaineth the same vail untaken awai in the read of the old testament which vail is done awai in christ but even unto thi dai when mose is read the vail is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken awai now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberti but we all with open face behold as in a glass the glori of the lord ar chang into the same imag from glori to glori even as by the spirit of the lord therefor see we have thi ministri as we have receiv merci we faint not but have renounc the hidden thing of dishonesti not walk in crafti nor handl the word of god deceitfulli but by manifest of the truth commend ourselv to everi man conscienc in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that ar lost in whom the god of thi world hath blind the mind of them which believ not lest the light of the gloriou gospel of christ who is the imag of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselv but christ jesu the lord and ourselv your servant for jesu sake for god who command the light to shine out of dark hath shine in our heart to give the light of the knowledg of the glori of god in the face of jesu christ but we have thi treasur in earthen vessel that the excel of the power mai be of god and not of us we ar troubl on everi side yet not distress we ar perplex but not in despair persecut but not forsaken cast down but not destroi alwai bear about in the bodi the dy of the lord jesu that the life also of jesu might be made manifest in our bodi for we which live ar alwai deliv unto death for jesu sake that the life also of jesu might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same spirit of faith accord as it is written i believ and therefor have i spoken we also believ and therefor speak know that he which rais up the lord jesu shall rais up us also by jesu and shall present us with you for all thing ar for your sake that the abund grace might through the thanksgiv of mani redound to the glori of god for which caus we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renew dai by dai for our light afflict which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceed and etern weight of glori while we look not at the thing which ar seen but at the thing which ar not seen for the thing which ar seen ar tempor but the thing which ar not seen ar etern for we know that if our earthli hous of thi tabernacl were dissolv we have a build of god an hous not made with hand etern in the heaven for in thi we groan earnestli desir to be cloth upon with our hous which is from heaven if so be that be cloth we shall not be found nake for we that ar in thi tabernacl do groan be burden not for that we would be uncloth but cloth upon that mortal might be swallow up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfsam thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefor we ar alwai confid know that whilst we ar at home in the bodi we ar absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we ar confid i sai and will rather to be absent from the bodi and to be present with the lord wherefor we labour that whether present or absent we mai be accept of him for we must all appear befor the judgment seat of christ that everi on mai receiv the thing done in hi bodi accord to that he hath done whether it be good or bad know therefor the terror of the lord we persuad men but we ar made manifest unto god and i trust also ar made manifest in your conscienc for we commend not ourselv again unto you but give you occas to glori on our behalf that ye mai have somewhat to answer them which glori in appear and not in heart for whether we be besid ourselv it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your caus for the love of christ constraineth us becaus we thu judg that if on di for all then were all dead and that he di for all that thei which live should not henceforth live unto themselv but unto him which di for them and rose again wherefor henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefor if ani man be in christ he is a new creatur old thing ar pass awai behold all thing ar becom new and all thing ar of god who hath reconcil us to himself by jesu christ and hath given to us the ministri of reconcili to wit that god wa in christ reconcil the world unto himself not imput their trespass unto them and hath commit unto us the word of reconcili now then we ar ambassador for christ as though god did beseech you by us we prai you in christ stead be ye reconcil to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteous of god in him we then as worker togeth with him beseech you also that ye receiv not the grace of god in vain for he saith i have heard thee in a time accept and in the dai of salvat have i succour thee behold now is the accept time behold now is the dai of salvat give no offenc in ani thing that the ministri be not blame but in all thing approv ourselv as the minist of god in much patienc in afflict in necess in distress in stripe in imprison in tumult in labour in watch in fast by pure by knowledg by longsuff by kind by the holi ghost by love unfeign by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteous on the right hand and on the left by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceiv and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dy and behold we live as chasten and not kill as sorrow yet alwai rejoic as poor yet make mani rich as have noth and yet possess all thing o ye corinthian our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarg ye ar not straiten in us but ye ar straiten in your own bowel now for a recomp in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarg be ye not unequ yoke togeth with unbeliev for what fellowship hath righteous with unright and what communion hath light with dark and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the templ of god with idol for ye ar the templ of the live god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and thei shall be my peopl wherefor come out from among them and be ye separ saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receiv you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my son and daughter saith the lord almighti have therefor these promis dearli belov let us cleans ourselv from all filthi of the flesh and spirit perfect holi in the fear of god receiv us we have wrong no man we have corrupt no man we have defraud no man i speak not thi to condemn you for i have said befor that ye ar in our heart to die and live with you great is my bold of speech toward you great is my glori of you i am fill with comfort i am exceed joy in all our tribul for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubl on everi side without were fight within were fear nevertheless god that comforteth those that ar cast down comfort us by the come of titu and not by hi come onli but by the consol wherewith he wa comfort in you when he told us your earnest desir your mourn your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoic the more for though i made you sorri with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceiv that the same epistl hath made you sorri though it were but for a season now i rejoic not that ye were made sorri but that ye sorrow to repent for ye were made sorri after a godli manner that ye might receiv damag by us in noth for godli sorrow worketh repent to salvat not to be repent of but the sorrow of the world worketh death for behold thi selfsam thing that ye sorrow after a godli sort what care it wrought in you yea what clear of yourselv yea what indign yea what fear yea what vehement desir yea what zeal yea what reveng in all thing ye have approv yourselv to be clear in thi matter wherefor though i wrote unto you i did it not for hi caus that had done the wrong nor for hi caus that suffer wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you therefor we were comfort in your comfort yea and exceedingli the more joi we for the joi of titu becaus hi spirit wa refresh by you all for if i have boast ani thing to him of you i am not asham but as we spake all thing to you in truth even so our boast which i made befor titu is found a truth and hi inward affect is more abund toward you whilst he remembereth the obedi of you all how with fear and trembl ye receiv him i rejoic therefor that i have confid in you in all thing moreov brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestow on the church of macedonia how that in a great trial of afflict the abund of their joi and their deep poverti abound unto the rich of their liber for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power thei were will of themselv prai us with much intreati that we would receiv the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the minist to the saint and thi thei did not as we hope but first gave their own selv to the lord and unto us by the will of god insomuch that we desir titu that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also therefor as ye abound in everi thing in faith and utter and knowledg and in all dilig and in your love to us see that ye abound in thi grace also i speak not by command but by occas of the forward of other and to prove the sincer of your love for ye know the grace of our lord jesu christ that though he wa rich yet for your sake he becam poor that ye through hi poverti might be rich and herein i give my advic for thi is expedi for you who have begun befor not onli to do but also to be forward a year ago now therefor perform the do of it that as there wa a readi to will so there mai be a perform also out of that which ye have for if there be first a will mind it is accept accord to that a man hath and not accord to that he hath not for i mean not that other men be eas and ye burden but by an equal that now at thi time your abund mai be a suppli for their want that their abund also mai be a suppli for your want that there mai be equal as it is written he that had gather much had noth over and he that had gather littl had no lack but thank be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titu for you for inde he accept the exhort but be more forward of hi own accord he went unto you and we have sent with him the brother whose prais is in the gospel throughout all the church and not that onli but who wa also chosen of the church to travel with us with thi grace which is administ by us to the glori of the same lord and declar of your readi mind avoid thi that no man should blame us in thi abund which is administ by us provid for honest thing not onli in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentim prove dilig in mani thing but now much more dilig upon the great confid which i have in you whether ani do enquir of titu he is my partner and fellowhelp concern you or our brethren be enquir of thei ar the messeng of the church and the glori of christ wherefor shew ye to them and befor the church the proof of your love and of our boast on your behalf for as touch the minist to the saint it is superflu for me to write to you for i know the forward of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia wa readi a year ago and your zeal hath provok veri mani yet have i sent the brethren lest our boast of you should be in vain in thi behalf that as i said ye mai be readi lest hapli if thei of macedonia come with me and find you unprepar we that we sai not ye should be asham in thi same confid boast therefor i thought it necessari to exhort the brethren that thei would go befor unto you and make up beforehand your bounti whereof ye had notic befor that the same might be readi as a matter of bounti and not as of covet but thi i sai he which soweth sparingli shall reap also sparingli and he which soweth bountifulli shall reap also bountifulli everi man accord as he purposeth in hi heart so let him give not grudgingli or of necess for god loveth a cheer giver and god is abl to make all grace abound toward you that ye alwai have all suffici in all thing mai abound to everi good work as it is written he hath dispers abroad he hath given to the poor hi righteous remaineth for ever now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minist bread for your food and multipli your seed sown and increas the fruit of your righteous be enrich in everi thing to all bounti which causeth through us thanksgiv to god for the administr of thi servic not onli supplieth the want of the saint but is abund also by mani thanksgiv unto god while by the experi of thi ministr thei glorifi god for your profess subject unto the gospel of christ and for your liber distribut unto them and unto all men and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceed grace of god in you thank be unto god for hi unspeak gift now i paul myself beseech you by the meek and gentl of christ who in presenc am base among you but be absent am bold toward you but i beseech you that i mai not be bold when i am present with that confid wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walk accord to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapon of our warfar ar not carnal but mighti through god to the pull down of strong hold cast down imagin and everi high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledg of god and bring into captiv everi thought to the obedi of christ and have in a readi to reveng all disobedi when your obedi is fulfil do ye look on thing after the outward appear if ani man trust to himself that he is christ let him of himself think thi again that as he is christ even so ar we christ for though i should boast somewhat more of our author which the lord hath given us for edif and not for your destruct i should not be asham that i mai not seem as if i would terrifi you by letter for hi letter sai thei ar weighti and power but hi bodili presenc is weak and hi speech contempt let such an on think thi that such as we ar in word by letter when we ar absent such will we be also in deed when we ar present for we dare not make ourselv of the number or compar ourselv with some that commend themselv but thei measur themselv by themselv and compar themselv among themselv ar not wise but we will not boast of thing without our measur but accord to the measur of the rule which god hath distribut to us a measur to reach even unto you for we stretch not ourselv beyond our measur as though we reach not unto you for we ar come as far as to you also in preach the gospel of christ not boast of thing without our measur that is of other men labour but have hope when your faith is increas that we shall be enlarg by you accord to our rule abundantli to preach the gospel in the region beyond you and not to boast in anoth man line of thing made readi to our hand but he that glorieth let him glori in the lord for not he that commendeth himself is approv but whom the lord commendeth would to god ye could bear with me a littl in my folli and inde bear with me for i am jealou over you with godli jealousi for i have espous you to on husband that i mai present you as a chast virgin to christ but i fear lest by ani mean as the serpent beguil ev through hi subtilti so your mind should be corrupt from the simplic that is in christ for if he that cometh preacheth anoth jesu whom we have not preach or if ye receiv anoth spirit which ye have not receiv or anoth gospel which ye have not accept ye might well bear with him for i suppos i wa not a whit behind the veri chiefest apostl but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledg but we have been throughli made manifest among you in all thing have i commit an offenc in abas myself that ye might be exalt becaus i have preach to you the gospel of god freeli i rob other church take wage of them to do you servic and when i wa present with you and want i wa chargeabl to no man for that which wa lack to me the brethren which came from macedonia suppli and in all thing i have kept myself from be burdensom unto you and so will i keep myself as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of thi boast in the region of achaia wherefor becaus i love you not god knoweth but what i do that i will do that i mai cut off occas from them which desir occas that wherein thei glori thei mai be found even as we for such ar fals apostl deceit worker transform themselv into the apostl of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transform into an angel of light therefor it is no great thing if hi minist also be transform as the minist of righteous whose end shall be accord to their work i sai again let no man think me a fool if otherwis yet as a fool receiv me that i mai boast myself a littl that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishli in thi confid of boast see that mani glori after the flesh i will glori also for ye suffer fool gladli see ye yourselv ar wise for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondag if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face i speak as concern reproach as though we had been weak howbeit whereinsoev ani is bold i speak foolishli i am bold also ar thei hebrew so am i ar thei israelit so am i ar thei the seed of abraham so am i ar thei minist of christ i speak as a fool i am more in labour more abund in stripe abov measur in prison more frequent in death oft of the jew five time receiv i forti stripe save on thrice wa i beaten with rod onc wa i stone thrice i suffer shipwreck a night and a dai i have been in the deep in journei often in peril of water in peril of robber in peril by mine own countrymen in peril by the heathen in peril in the citi in peril in the wilder in peril in the sea in peril among fals brethren in weari and pain in watch often in hunger and thirst in fast often in cold and naked besid those thing that ar without that which cometh upon me daili the care of all the church who is weak and i am not weak who is offend and i burn not if i must need glori i will glori of the thing which concern mine infirm the god and father of our lord jesu christ which is bless for evermor knoweth that i lie not in damascu the governor under areta the king kept the citi of the damascen with a garrison desir to apprehend me and through a window in a basket wa i let down by the wall and escap hi hand it is not expedi for me doubtless to glori i will come to vision and revel of the lord i knew a man in christ abov fourteen year ago whether in the bodi i cannot tell or whether out of the bodi i cannot tell god knoweth such an on caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the bodi or out of the bodi i cannot tell god knoweth how that he wa caught up into paradis and heard unspeak word which it is not law for a man to utter of such an on will i glori yet of myself i will not glori but in mine infirm for though i would desir to glori i shall not be a fool for i will sai the truth but now i forbear lest ani man should think of me abov that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest i should be exalt abov measur through the abund of the revel there wa given to me a thorn in the flesh the messeng of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalt abov measur for thi thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is suffici for thee for my strength is made perfect in weak most gladli therefor will i rather glori in my infirm that the power of christ mai rest upon me therefor i take pleasur in infirm in reproach in necess in persecut in distress for christ sake for when i am weak then am i strong i am becom a fool in glori ye have compel me for i ought to have been commend of you for in noth am i behind the veri chiefest apostl though i be noth truli the sign of an apostl were wrought among you in all patienc in sign and wonder and mighti deed for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other church except it be that i myself wa not burdensom to you forgiv me thi wrong behold the third time i am readi to come to you and i will not be burdensom to you for i seek not your but you for the children ought not to lai up for the parent but the parent for the children and i will veri gladli spend and be spent for you though the more abundantli i love you the less i be love but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless be crafti i caught you with guil did i make a gain of you by ani of them whom i sent unto you i desir titu and with him i sent a brother did titu make a gain of you walk we not in the same spirit walk we not in the same step again think ye that we excus ourselv unto you we speak befor god in christ but we do all thing dearli belov for your edifi for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debat envi wrath strife backbit whisper swell tumult and lest when i come again my god will humbl me among you and that i shall bewail mani which have sin alreadi and have not repent of the unclean and fornic and lascivi which thei have commit thi is the third time i am come to you in the mouth of two or three wit shall everi word be establish i told you befor and foretel you as if i were present the second time and be absent now i write to them which heretofor have sin and to all other that if i come again i will not spare sinc ye seek a proof of christ speak in me which to youward is not weak but is mighti in you for though he wa crucifi through weak yet he liveth by the power of god for we also ar weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you examin yourselv whether ye be in the faith prove your own selv know ye not your own selv how that jesu christ is in you except ye be reprob but i trust that ye shall know that we ar not reprob now i prai to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear approv but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprob for we can do noth against the truth but for the truth for we ar glad when we ar weak and ye ar strong and thi also we wish even your perfect therefor i write these thing be absent lest be present i should us sharp accord to the power which the lord hath given me to edif and not to destruct final brethren farewel be perfect be of good comfort be of on mind live in peac and the god of love and peac shall be with you greet on anoth with an holi kiss all the saint salut you the grace of the lord jesu christ and the love of god and the communion of the holi ghost be with you all amen the epistl of paul the apostl to the galatian paul an apostl not of men neither by man but by jesu christ and god the father who rais him from the dead and all the brethren which ar with me unto the church of galatia grace be to you and peac from god the father and from our lord jesu christ who gave himself for our sin that he might deliv us from thi present evil world accord to the will of god and our father to whom be glori for ever and ever amen i marvel that ye ar so soon remov from him that call you into the grace of christ unto anoth gospel which is not anoth but there be some that troubl you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach ani other gospel unto you than that which we have preach unto you let him be accurs as we said befor so sai i now again if ani man preach ani other gospel unto you than that ye have receiv let him be accurs for do i now persuad men or god or do i seek to pleas men for if i yet pleas men i should not be the servant of christ but i certifi you brethren that the gospel which wa preach of me is not after man for i neither receiv it of man neither wa i taught it but by the revel of jesu christ for ye have heard of my convers in time past in the jew religion how that beyond measur i persecut the church of god and wast it and profit in the jew religion abov mani my equal in mine own nation be more exceedingli zealou of the tradit of my father but when it pleas god who separ me from my mother womb and call me by hi grace to reveal hi son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immedi i confer not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostl befor me but i went into arabia and return again unto damascu then after three year i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abod with him fifteen dai but other of the apostl saw i none save jame the lord brother now the thing which i write unto you behold befor god i lie not afterward i came into the region of syria and cilicia and wa unknown by face unto the church of judaea which were in christ but thei had heard onli that he which persecut us in time past now preacheth the faith which onc he destroi and thei glorifi god in me then fourteen year after i went up again to jerusalem with barnaba and took titu with me also and i went up by revel and commun unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentil but privat to them which were of reput lest by ani mean i should run or had run in vain but neither titu who wa with me be a greek wa compel to be circumcis and that becaus of fals brethren unawar brought in who came in privili to spy out our liberti which we have in christ jesu that thei might bring us into bondag to whom we gave place by subject no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continu with you but of these who seem to be somewhat whatsoev thei were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no man person for thei who seem to be somewhat in confer ad noth to me but contrariwis when thei saw that the gospel of the uncircumcis wa commit unto me as the gospel of the circumcis wa unto peter for he that wrought effectu in peter to the apostleship of the circumcis the same wa mighti in me toward the gentil and when jame cepha and john who seem to be pillar perceiv the grace that wa given unto me thei gave to me and barnaba the right hand of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and thei unto the circumcis onli thei would that we should rememb the poor the same which i also wa forward to do but when peter wa come to antioch i withstood him to the face becaus he wa to be blame for befor that certain came from jame he did eat with the gentil but when thei were come he withdrew and separ himself fear them which were of the circumcis and the other jew dissembl likewis with him insomuch that barnaba also wa carri awai with their dissimul but when i saw that thei walk not uprightli accord to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter befor them all if thou be a jew livest after the manner of gentil and not as do the jew why compellest thou the gentil to live as do the jew we who ar jew by natur and not sinner of the gentil know that a man is not justifi by the work of the law but by the faith of jesu christ even we have believ in jesu christ that we might be justifi by the faith of christ and not by the work of the law for by the work of the law shall no flesh be justifi but if while we seek to be justifi by christ we ourselv also ar found sinner is therefor christ the minist of sin god forbid for if i build again the thing which i destroi i make myself a transgressor for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god i am crucifi with christ neverthless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who love me and gave himself for me i do not frustrat the grace of god for if righteous come by the law then christ is dead in vain o foolish galatian who hath bewitch you that ye should not obei the truth befor whose ey jesu christ hath been evid set forth crucifi among you thi onli would i learn of you receiv ye the spirit by the work of the law or by the hear of faith ar ye so foolish have begun in the spirit ar ye now made perfect by the flesh have ye suffer so mani thing in vain if it be yet in vain he therefor that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracl among you doeth he it by the work of the law or by the hear of faith even as abraham believ god and it wa account to him for righteous know ye therefor that thei which ar of faith the same ar the children of abraham and the scriptur forese that god would justifi the heathen through faith preach befor the gospel unto abraham sai in thee shall all nation be bless so then thei which be of faith ar bless with faith abraham for as mani as ar of the work of the law ar under the curs for it is written curs is everi on that continueth not in all thing which ar written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justifi by the law in the sight of god it is evid for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them christ hath redeem us from the curs of the law be made a curs for us for it is written curs is everi on that hangeth on a tree that the bless of abraham might come on the gentil through jesu christ that we might receiv the promis of the spirit through faith brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a man coven yet if it be confirm no man disannulleth or addeth thereto now to abraham and hi seed were the promis made he saith not and to seed as of mani but as of on and to thy seed which is christ and thi i sai that the coven that wa confirm befor of god in christ the law which wa four hundr and thirti year after cannot disannul that it should make the promis of none effect for if the inherit be of the law it is no more of promis but god gave it to abraham by promis wherefor then serveth the law it wa ad becaus of transgress till the seed should come to whom the promis wa made and it wa ordain by angel in the hand of a mediat now a mediat is not a mediat of on but god is on is the law then against the promis of god god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verili righteous should have been by the law but the scriptur hath conclud all under sin that the promis by faith of jesu christ might be given to them that believ but befor faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterward be reveal wherefor the law wa our schoolmast to bring us unto christ that we might be justifi by faith but after that faith is come we ar no longer under a schoolmast for ye ar all the children of god by faith in christ jesu for as mani of you as have been baptiz into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor femal for ye ar all on in christ jesu and if ye be christ then ar ye abraham seed and heir accord to the promis now i sai that the heir as long as he is a child differeth noth from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutor and governor until the time appoint of the father even so we when we were children were in bondag under the element of the world but when the ful of the time wa come god sent forth hi son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receiv the adopt of son and becaus ye ar son god hath sent forth the spirit of hi son into your heart cry abba father wherefor thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did servic unto them which by natur ar no god but now after that ye have known god or rather ar known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarli element whereunto ye desir again to be in bondag ye observ dai and month and time and year i am afraid of you lest i have bestow upon you labour in vain brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye ar ye have not injur me at all ye know how through infirm of the flesh i preach the gospel unto you at the first and my temptat which wa in my flesh ye despis not nor reject but receiv me as an angel of god even as christ jesu where is then the blessed ye spake of for i bear you record that if it had been possibl ye would have pluck out your own ey and have given them to me am i therefor becom your enemi becaus i tell you the truth thei zealous affect you but not well yea thei would exclud you that ye might affect them but it is good to be zealous affect alwai in a good thing and not onli when i am present with you my littl children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be form in you i desir to be present with you now and to chang my voic for i stand in doubt of you tell me ye that desir to be under the law do ye not hear the law for it is written that abraham had two son the on by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman but he who wa of the bondwoman wa born after the flesh but he of the freewoman wa by promis which thing ar an allegori for these ar the two coven the on from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondag which is agar for thi agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondag with her children but jerusalem which is abov is free which is the mother of us all for it is written rejoic thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desol hath mani more children than she which hath an husband now we brethren as isaac wa ar the children of promis but as then he that wa born after the flesh persecut him that wa born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scriptur cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman so then brethren we ar not children of the bondwoman but of the free stand fast therefor in the liberti wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangl again with the yoke of bondag behold i paul sai unto you that if ye be circumcis christ shall profit you noth for i testifi again to everi man that is circumcis that he is a debtor to do the whole law christ is becom of no effect unto you whosoev of you ar justifi by the law ye ar fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteous by faith for in jesu christ neither circumcis availeth ani thing nor uncircumcis but faith which worketh by love ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obei the truth thi persuas cometh not of him that calleth you a littl leaven leaveneth the whole lump i have confid in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwis mind but he that troubleth you shall bear hi judgment whosoev he be and i brethren if i yet preach circumcis why do i yet suffer persecut then is the offenc of the cross ceas i would thei were even cut off which troubl you for brethren ye have been call unto liberti onli us not liberti for an occas to the flesh but by love serv on anoth for all the law is fulfil in on word even in thi thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself but if ye bite and devour on anoth take heed that ye be not consum on of anoth thi i sai then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these ar contrari the on to the other so that ye cannot do the thing that ye would but if ye be led of the spirit ye ar not under the law now the work of the flesh ar manifest which ar these adulteri fornic unclean lascivi idolatri witchcraft hatr varianc emul wrath strife sedit heresi envi murder drunken revel and such like of the which i tell you befor as i have also told you in time past that thei which do such thing shall not inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit of the spirit is love joi peac longsuff gentl good faith meek temper against such there is no law and thei that ar christ have crucifi the flesh with the affect and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desir of vain glori provok on anoth envi on anoth brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which ar spiritu restor such an on in the spirit of meek consid thyself lest thou also be tempt bear ye on anoth burden and so fulfil the law of christ for if a man think himself to be someth when he is noth he deceiveth himself but let everi man prove hi own work and then shall he have rejoic in himself alon and not in anoth for everi man shall bear hi own burden let him that is taught in the word commun unto him that teacheth in all good thing be not deceiv god is not mock for whatsoev a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to hi flesh shall of the flesh reap corrupt but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlast and let us not be weari in well do for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefor opportun let us do good unto all men especi unto them who ar of the household of faith ye see how larg a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand as mani as desir to make a fair shew in the flesh thei constrain you to be circumcis onli lest thei should suffer persecut for the cross of christ for neither thei themselv who ar circumcis keep the law but desir to have you circumcis that thei mai glori in your flesh but god forbid that i should glori save in the cross of our lord jesu christ by whom the world is crucifi unto me and i unto the world for in christ jesu neither circumcis availeth ani thing nor uncircumcis but a new creatur and as mani as walk accord to thi rule peac be on them and merci and upon the israel of god from henceforth let no man troubl me for i bear in my bodi the mark of the lord jesu brethren the grace of our lord jesu christ be with your spirit amen the epistl of paul the apostl to the ephesian paul an apostl of jesu christ by the will of god to the saint which ar at ephesu and to the faith in christ jesu

wherefor i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesu and love unto all the saint ceas not to give thank for you make mention of you in my prayer that the god of our lord jesu christ the father of glori mai give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revel in the knowledg of him the ey of your understand be enlighten that ye mai know what is the hope of hi call and what the rich of the glori of

under hi feet and gave him to be the head over all thing to the church which is hi bodi the ful of him that filleth all in all and you hath he quicken who were dead in trespass and sin wherein in time past ye walk accord to the cours of thi world accord to the princ of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedi among whom also we all had our convers in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfil the desir of the flesh and of the mind and were by natur the children of wrath even as other but god who is rich in merci for hi great love wherewith he love us even when we were dead in sin hath quicken us togeth with christ by grace ye ar save and hath rais us up togeth and made us sit togeth in heavenli place in christ jesu that in the ag to come he might shew the

doubletongu not given to much wine not greedi of filthi lucr hold the mysteri of the faith in a pure conscienc and let these also first be prove then let them us the offic of a deacon be found blameless even so must their wive be grave not slander sober faith in all thing let the deacon be the husband of on wife rule their children and their own hous well for thei that have us the offic of

christ be with your spirit amen the epistl of paul the apostl to the hebrew god who at sundri time and in diver manner spake in time past unto the father by the prophet hath in these last dai spoken unto us by hi son whom he hath appoint heir of all thing by whom also he made the world who be the bright of hi glori and the express imag of hi person and uphold all thing by the word of hi power when he had by himself purg our sin sat down on the right hand of the majesti on high be made so much better than the angel as he hath by inherit obtain a more excel name than thei for unto which of the angel said he at ani time thou art my son thi dai have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angel of god worship him and of the angel he saith who maketh hi angel spirit and hi minist a flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever and ever a sceptr of righteous is the sceptr of thy kingdom thou hast love righteous and hate iniqu therefor god even thy god hath anoint thee with the oil of glad abov thy fellow and thou lord in the begin hast laid the foundat of the earth and the heaven ar the work of thine hand thei shall perish but thou remainest and thei all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vestur shalt thou fold them

minist spirit sent forth to minist for them who shall be heir of salvat therefor we ought to give the more earnest heed to the thing which we have heard lest at ani time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angel wa stedfast and everi transgress and disobedi receiv a just recomp of reward how shall we escap if we neglect so great salvat which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and wa confirm unto us by them that heard him god also bear them wit both with sign and wonder and with diver miracl and gift of the holi ghost accord to hi own will for unto the angel hath he not put in subject the world to come whereof we speak but on in a certain place testifi sai what is man that thou art mind of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou madest him a littl lower than the angel thou crownedst him with glori and honour and didst set him over the work of thy hand thou hast put all thing in subject under hi feet for in that he put all in subject under him he left noth that is not put under him but now we see not yet all thing put under him but we see jesu who wa made a littl lower than the angel for the suffer of death crown with glori and honour that he by the grace of god should tast death for everi man for it becam him for whom ar all thing and by whom ar all thing in bring mani son unto glori to make the captain of their salvat perfect through suffer for both he that sanctifieth and thei who ar sanctifi ar all of on for which caus he is not asham to call them brethren sai i will declar thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing prais unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me forasmuch then as the children ar partak of flesh and blood he also himself likewis took part of the same that through death he might destroi him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliv them who through fear of death were all their lifetim subject to bondag for verili he took not on him the natur of angel but he took on him the seed of abraham wherefor in all thing it behov him to be made like unto hi brethren that he might be a merci and faith high priest in thing pertain to god to make reconcili for the sin of the peopl for in that he himself hath suffer be tempt he is abl to succour them that ar tempt wherefor holi brethren partak of the heavenli call consid the apostl and high priest of our profess christ jesu who wa faith to him that appoint him as also mose wa faith in all hi hous for thi man wa count worthi of more glori than mose inasmuch as he who hath build the hous hath more honour than the hous for everi hous is build by some man but he that built all thing is god and mose verili wa faith in all hi hous as a servant for a testimoni of those thing which were to be spoken after but christ as a son over hi own hous whose hous ar we if we hold fast the confid and the rejoic of the hope firm unto the end wherefor as the holi ghost saith to dai if ye will hear hi voic harden not your heart as in the provoc in the dai of temptat in the wilder when your father tempt me prove me and saw my work forti year wherefor i wa griev with that gener and said thei do alwai err in their heart and thei have not known my wai so i sware in my wrath thei shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in ani of you an evil heart of unbelief in depart from the live god but exhort on anoth daili while it is call to dai lest ani of you be harden through the deceit of sin for we ar made partak of christ if we hold the begin of our confid stedfast unto the end while it is said to dai if ye will hear hi voic harden not your heart as in the provoc for some when thei had heard did provok howbeit not all that came out of egypt by mose but with whom wa he griev forti year wa it not with them that had sin whose carcas fell in the wilder and to whom sware he that thei should not enter into hi rest but to them that believ not so we see that thei could not enter in becaus of unbelief let us therefor fear lest a promis be left us of enter into hi rest ani of you should seem to come short of it for unto us wa the gospel preach as well as unto them but the word preach did not profit them not be mix with faith in them that heard it for we which have believ do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if thei shall enter into my rest although the work were finish from the foundat of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh dai on thi wise and god did rest the seventh dai from all hi work and in thi place again if thei shall enter into my rest see therefor it remaineth that some must enter therein and thei to whom it wa first preach enter not in becaus of unbelief again he limiteth a certain dai sai in david to dai after so long a time as it is said to dai if ye will hear hi voic harden not your heart for if jesu had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of anoth dai there remaineth therefor a rest to the peopl of god for he that is enter into hi rest he also hath ceas from hi own work as god did from hi let us labour therefor to enter into that rest lest ani man fall after the same exampl of unbelief for the word of god is quick and power and sharper than ani twoedg sword pierc even to the divid asund of soul and spirit and of the joint and marrow and is a discern of the thought and intent of the heart neither is there ani creatur that is not manifest in hi sight but all thing ar nake and open unto the ey of him with whom we have to do see then that we have a great high priest that is pass into the heaven jesu the son of god let us hold fast our profess for we have not an high priest which cannot be touch with the feel of our infirm but wa in all point tempt like as we ar yet without sin let us therefor come boldli unto the throne of grace that we mai obtain merci and find grace to help in time of need for everi high priest taken from among men is ordain for men in thing pertain to god that he mai offer both gift and sacrific for sin who can have compass on the ignor and on them that ar out of the wai for that he himself also is compass with infirm and by reason hereof he ought as for the peopl so also for himself to offer for sin and no man taketh thi honour unto himself but he that is call of god as wa aaron so also christ glorifi not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son to dai have i begotten thee as he saith also in anoth place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec who in the dai of hi flesh when he had offer up prayer and supplic with strong cry and tear unto him that wa abl to save him from death and wa heard in that he fear though he were a son yet learn he obedi by the thing which he suffer and be made perfect he becam the author of etern salvat unto all them that obei him call of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec of whom we have mani thing to sai and hard to be utter see ye ar dull of hear for when for the time ye ought to be teacher ye have need that on teach you again which be the first principl of the oracl of god and ar becom such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everi on that useth milk is unskil in the word of righteous for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that ar of full ag even those who by reason of us have their sens exercis to discern both good and evil therefor leav the principl of the doctrin of christ let us go on unto perfect not lai again the foundat of repent from dead work and of faith toward god of the doctrin of baptism and of lai on of hand and of resurrect of the dead and of etern judgment and thi will we do if god permit for it is imposs for those who were onc enlighten and have tast of the heavenli gift and were made partak of the holi ghost and have tast the good word of god and the power of the world to come if thei shall fall awai to renew them again unto repent see thei crucifi to themselv the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herb meet for them by whom it is dress receiveth bless from god but that which beareth thorn and brier is reject and is nigh unto curs whose end is to be burn but belov we ar persuad better thing of you and thing that accompani salvat though we thu speak for god is not unright to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shew toward hi name in that ye have minist to the saint and do minist and we desir that everi on of you do shew the same dilig to the full assur of hope unto the end that ye be not sloth but follow of them who through faith and patienc inherit the promis for when god made promis to abraham becaus he could swear by no greater he sware by himself sai sure bless i will bless thee and multipli i will multipli thee and so after he had patient endur he obtain the promis for men verili swear by the greater and an oath for confirm is to them an end of all strife wherein god will more abundantli to shew unto the heir of promis the immut of hi counsel confirm it by an oath that by two immut thing in which it wa imposs for god to lie we might have a strong consol who have fled for refug to lai hold upon the hope set befor us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil whither the forerunn is for us enter even jesu made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec for thi melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham return from the slaughter of the king and bless him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first be by interpret king of righteous and after that also king of salem which is king of peac without father without mother without descent have neither begin of dai nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continu now consid how great thi man wa unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoil and verili thei that ar of the son of levi who receiv the offic of the priesthood have a command to take tith of the peopl accord to the law that is of their brethren though thei come out of the loin of abraham but he whose descent is not count from them receiv tith of abraham and bless him that had the promis and without all contradict the less is bless of the better and here men that die receiv tith but there he receiveth them of whom it is wit that he liveth and as i mai so sai levi also who receiveth tith pai tith in abraham for he wa yet in the loin of hi father when melchisedec met him if therefor perfect were by the levit priesthood for under it the peopl receiv the law what further need wa there that anoth priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be call after the order of aaron for the priesthood be chang there is made of necess a chang also of the law for he of whom these thing ar spoken pertaineth to anoth tribe of which no man gave attend at the altar for it is evid that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe mose spake noth concern priesthood and it is yet far more evid for that after the similitud of melchisedec there ariseth anoth priest who is made not after the law of a carnal command but after the power of an endless life for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec for there is verili a disannul of the command go befor for the weak and unprofit thereof for the law made noth perfect but the bring in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god and inasmuch as not without an oath he wa made priest for those priest were made without an oath but thi with an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec by so much wa jesu made a sureti of a better testament and thei truli were mani priest becaus thei were not suffer to continu by reason of death but thi man becaus he continueth ever hath an unchang priesthood wherefor he is abl also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him see he ever liveth to make intercess for them for such an high priest becam us who is holi harmless undefil separ from sinner and made higher than the heaven who needeth not daili as those high priest to offer up sacrific first for hi own sin and then for the peopl for thi he did onc when he offer up himself for the law maketh men high priest which have infirm but the word of the oath which wa sinc the law maketh the son who is consecr for evermor now of the thing which we have spoken thi is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesti in the heaven a minist of the sanctuari and of the true tabernacl which the lord pitch and not man for everi high priest is ordain to offer gift and sacrific wherefor it is of necess that thi man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on earth he should not be a priest see that there ar priest that offer gift accord to the law who serv unto the exampl and shadow of heavenli thing as mose wa admonish of god when he wa about to make the tabernacl for see saith he that thou make all thing accord to the pattern shew to thee in the mount but now hath he obtain a more excel ministri by how much also he is the mediat of a better coven which wa establish upon better promis for if that first coven had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second for find fault with them he saith behold the dai come saith the lord when i will make a new coven with the hous of israel and with the hous of judah not accord to the coven that i made with their father in the dai when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt becaus thei continu not in my coven and i regard them not saith the lord for thi is the coven that i will make with the hous of israel after those dai saith the lord i will put my law into their mind and write them in their heart and i will be to them a god and thei shall be to me a peopl and thei shall not teach everi man hi neighbour and everi man hi brother sai know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest for i will be merci to their unright and their sin and their iniqu will i rememb no more in that he saith a new coven he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is readi to vanish awai then verili the first coven had also ordin of divin servic and a worldli sanctuari for there wa a tabernacl made the first wherein wa the candlestick and the tabl and the shewbread which is call the sanctuari and after the second veil the tabernacl which is call the holiest of all which had the golden censer and the ark of the coven overlaid round about with gold wherein wa the golden pot that had manna and aaron rod that bud and the tabl of the coven and over it the cherubim of glori shadow the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularli now when these thing were thu ordain the priest went alwai into the first tabernacl accomplish the servic of god but into the second went the high priest alon onc everi year not without blood which he offer for himself and for the error of the peopl the holi ghost thi signifi that the wai into the holiest of all wa not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacl wa yet stand which wa a figur for the time then present in which were offer both gift and sacrific that could not make him that did the servic perfect as pertain to the conscienc which stood onli in meat and drink and diver wash and carnal ordin impos on them until the time of reform but christ be come an high priest of good thing to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacl not made with hand that is to sai not of thi build neither by the blood of goat and calv but by hi own blood he enter in onc into the holi place have obtain etern redempt for us for if the blood of bull and of goat and the ash of an heifer sprinkl the unclean sanctifieth to the purifi of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the etern spirit offer himself without spot to god purg your conscienc from dead work to serv the live god and for thi caus he is the mediat of the new testament that by mean of death for the redempt of the transgress that were under the first testament thei which ar call might receiv the promis of etern inherit for where a testament is there must also of necess be the death of the testat for a testament is of forc after men ar dead otherwis it is of no strength at all while the testat liveth whereupon neither the first testament wa dedic without blood for when mose had spoken everi precept to all the peopl accord to the law he took the blood of calv and of goat with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkl both the book and all the peopl sai thi is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoin unto you moreov he sprinkl with blood both the tabernacl and all the vessel of the ministri and almost all thing ar by the law purg with blood and without shed of blood is no remiss it wa therefor necessari that the pattern of thing in the heaven should be purifi with these but the heavenli thing themselv with better sacrific than these for christ is not enter into the holi place made with hand which ar the figur of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presenc of god for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holi place everi year with blood of other for then must he often have suffer sinc the foundat of the world but now onc in the end of the world hath he appear to put awai sin by the sacrific of himself and as it is appoint unto men onc to die but after thi the judgment so christ wa onc offer to bear the sin of mani and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvat for the law have a shadow of good thing to come and not the veri imag of the thing can never with those sacrific which thei offer year by year continu make the comer thereunto perfect for then would thei not have ceas to be offer becaus that the worshipp onc purg should have had no more conscienc of sin but in those sacrific there is a remembr again made of sin everi year for it is not possibl that the blood of bull and of goat should take awai sin wherefor when he cometh into the world he saith sacrific and offer thou wouldest not but a bodi hast thou prepar me in burnt offer and sacrific for sin thou hast had no pleasur then said i lo i come in the volum of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god abov when he said sacrific and offer and burnt offer and offer for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasur therein which ar offer by the law then said he lo i come to do thy will o god he taketh awai the first that he mai establish the second by the which will we ar sanctifi through the offer of the bodi of jesu christ onc for all and everi priest standeth daili minist and offer oftentim the same sacrific which can never take awai sin but thi man after he had offer on sacrific for sin for ever sat down on the right hand of god from henceforth expect till hi enemi be made hi footstool for by on offer he hath perfect for ever them that ar sanctifi whereof the holi ghost also is a wit to us for after that he had said befor thi is the coven that i will make with them after those dai saith the lord i will put my law into their heart and in their mind will i write them and their sin and iniqu will i rememb no more now where remiss of these is there is no more offer for sin have therefor brethren bold to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesu by a new and live wai which he hath consecr for us through the veil that is to sai hi flesh and have an high priest over the hous of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assur of faith have our heart sprinkl from an evil conscienc and our bodi wash with pure water let us hold fast the profess of our faith without waver for he is faith that promis and let us consid on anoth to provok unto love and to good work not forsak the assembl of ourselv togeth as the manner of some is but exhort on anoth and so much the more as ye see the dai approach for if we sin wilfulli after that we have receiv the knowledg of the truth there remaineth no more sacrific for sin but a certain fear look for of judgment and fieri indign which shall devour the adversari he that despis mose law di without merci under two or three wit of how much sorer punish suppos ye shall he be thought worthi who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath count the blood of the coven wherewith he wa sanctifi an unholi thing and hath done despit unto the spirit of grace for we know him that hath said vengeanc belongeth unto me i will recompens saith the lord and again the lord shall judg hi peopl it is a fear thing to fall into the hand of the live god but call to remembr the former dai in which after ye were illumin ye endur a great fight of afflict partli whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproach and afflict and partli whilst ye becam companion of them that were so us for ye had compass of me in my bond and took joyfulli the spoil of your good know in yourselv that ye have in heaven a better and an endur substanc cast not awai therefor your confid which hath great recomp of reward for ye have need of patienc that after ye have done the will of god ye might receiv the promis for yet a littl while and he that shall come will come and will not tarri now the just shall live by faith but if ani man draw back my soul shall have no pleasur in him but we ar not of them who draw back unto perdit but of them that believ to the save of the soul now faith is the substanc of thing hope for the evid of thing not seen for by it the elder obtain a good report through faith we understand that the world were frame by the word of god so that thing which ar seen were not made of thing which do appear by faith abel offer unto god a more excel sacrific than cain by which he obtain wit that he wa righteou god testifi of hi gift and by it he be dead yet speaketh by faith enoch wa translat that he should not see death and wa not found becaus god had translat him for befor hi translat he had thi testimoni that he pleas god but without faith it is imposs to pleas him for he that cometh to god must believ that he is and that he is a reward of them that dilig seek him by faith noah be warn of god of thing not seen as yet move with fear prepar an ark to the save of hi hous by the which he condemn the world and becam heir of the righteous which is by faith by faith abraham when he wa call to go out into a place which he should after receiv for an inherit obei and he went out not know whither he went by faith he sojourn in the land of promis as in a strang countri dwell in tabernacl with isaac and jacob the heir with him of the same promis for he look for a citi which hath foundat whose builder and maker is god through faith also sara herself receiv strength to conceiv seed and wa deliv of a child when she wa past ag becaus she judg him faith who had promis therefor sprang there even of on and him as good as dead so mani as the star of the sky in multitud and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumer these all di in faith not have receiv the promis but have seen them afar off and were persuad of them and embrac them and confess that thei were stranger and pilgrim on the earth for thei that sai such thing declar plainli that thei seek a countri and truli if thei had been mind of that countri from whenc thei came out thei might have had opportun to have return but now thei desir a better countri that is an heavenli wherefor god is not asham to be call their god for he hath prepar for them a citi by faith abraham when he wa tri offer up isaac and he that had receiv the promis offer up hi onli begotten son of whom it wa said that in isaac shall thy seed be call account that god wa abl to rais him up even from the dead from whenc also he receiv him in a figur by faith isaac bless jacob and esau concern thing to come by faith jacob when he wa a dy bless both the son of joseph and worship lean upon the top of hi staff by faith joseph when he di made mention of the depart of the children of israel and gave command concern hi bone by faith mose when he wa born wa hid three month of hi parent becaus thei saw he wa a proper child and thei were not afraid of the king command by faith mose when he wa come to year refus to be call the son of pharaoh daughter choos rather to suffer afflict with the peopl of god than to enjoi the pleasur of sin for a season esteem the reproach of christ greater rich than the treasur in egypt for he had respect unto the recomp of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fear the wrath of the king for he endur as see him who is invis through faith he kept the passov and the sprinkl of blood lest he that destroi the firstborn should touch them by faith thei pass through the red sea as by dry land which the egyptian assai to do were drown by faith the wall of jericho fell down after thei were compass about seven dai by faith the harlot rahab perish not with them that believ not when she had receiv the spi with peac and what shall i more sai for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephtha of david also and samuel and of the prophet who through faith subdu kingdom wrought righteous obtain promis stop the mouth of lion quench the violenc of fire escap the edg of the sword out of weak were made strong wax valiant in fight turn to flight the armi of the alien women receiv their dead rais to life again and other were tortur not accept deliver that thei might obtain a better resurrect and other had trial of cruel mock and scourg yea moreov of bond and imprison thei were stone thei were sawn asund were tempt were slain with the sword thei wander about in sheepskin and goatskin be destitut afflict torment of whom the world wa not worthi thei wander in desert and in mountain and in den and cave of the earth and these all have obtain a good report through faith receiv not the promis god have provid some better thing for us that thei without us should not be made perfect wherefor see we also ar compass about with so great a cloud of wit let us lai asid everi weight and the sin which doth so easili beset us and let us run with patienc the race that is set befor us look unto jesu the author and finish of our faith who for the joi that wa set befor him endur the cross despis the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consid him that endur such contradict of sinner against himself lest ye be weari and faint in your mind ye have not yet resist unto blood strive against sin and ye have forgotten the exhort which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despis not thou the chasten of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuk of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth everi son whom he receiveth if ye endur chasten god dealeth with you as with son for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastis whereof all ar partak then ar ye bastard and not son furthermor we have had father of our flesh which correct us and we gave them rever shall we not much rather be in subject unto the father of spirit and live for thei verili for a few dai chasten us after their own pleasur but he for our profit that we might be partak of hi holi now no chasten for the present seemeth to be joyou but grievou nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceabl fruit of righteous unto them which ar exercis therebi wherefor lift up the hand which hang down and the feebl knee and make straight path for your feet lest that which is lame be turn out of the wai but let it rather be heal follow peac with all men and holi without which no man shall see the lord look dilig lest ani man fail of the grace of god lest ani root of bitter spring up troubl you and therebi mani be defil lest there be ani fornic or profan person as esau who for on morsel of meat sold hi birthright for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherit the bless he wa reject for he found no place of repent though he sought it carefulli with tear for ye ar not come unto

children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now ar there mani antichrist wherebi we know that it is the last time thei went out from us but thei were not of us for if thei had been of us thei would no doubt have continu with us but thei went out that thei might be made manifest that thei were not all of us but ye have an unction from the holi on and ye know all thing i have not written unto you becaus ye know not the truth but becaus ye know it and that no lie is of the truth who is a liar but he that denieth that jesu is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son whosoev denieth the son the same hath not the father he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also let that therefor abid in you which ye have heard from the begin if that which ye have heard from the begin shall remain in you ye also shall continu in the son and in the father and thi is the promis that he hath promis us even etern life these thing have i written unto you concern them that seduc you but the anoint which ye have receiv of him abideth in you and ye need not that ani man teach you but as the same anoint teacheth you of all thing and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abid in him and now littl children abid in him that when he shall appear we mai have confid and not be asham befor him at hi come if ye know that he is righteou ye know that everi on that doeth righteous is born of him behold what manner of love the father hath bestow upon us that we should be call the son of god therefor the world knoweth us not becaus it knew him not belov now ar we the son of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and everi man that hath thi hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure whosoev committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgress of the law and ye know that he wa manifest to take awai our sin and in him is no sin whosoev abideth in him sinneth not whosoev sinneth hath not seen him neither known him littl children let no man deceiv you he that doeth righteous is righteou even as he is righteou he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the begin for thi purpos the son of god wa manifest that he might destroi the work of the devil whosoev is born of god doth not commit sin for hi seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin becaus he is born of god in thi the children of god ar manifest and the children of the devil whosoev doeth not righteous is not of god neither he that loveth not hi brother for thi is the messag that ye heard from the begin that we should love on anoth not as cain who wa of that wick on and slew hi brother and wherefor slew he him becaus hi own work were evil and hi brother righteou marvel not my brethren if the world hate you we know that we have pass from death unto life becaus we love the brethren he that loveth not hi brother abideth in death whosoev hateth hi brother is a murder and ye know that no murder hath etern life abid in him herebi perceiv we the love of god becaus he laid down hi life for us and we ought to lai down our live for the brethren but whoso hath thi world good and seeth hi brother have need and shutteth up hi bowel of compass from him how dwelleth the love of god in him my littl children let us not love in word neither in tongu but in deed and in truth and herebi we know that we ar of the truth and shall assur our heart befor him for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all thing belov if our heart condemn us not then have we confid toward god and whatsoev we ask we receiv of him becaus we keep hi command and do those thing that ar pleas in hi sight and thi is hi command that we should believ on the name of hi son jesu christ and love on anoth as he gave us command and he that keepeth hi command dwelleth in him and he in him and herebi we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us belov believ not everi spirit but try the spirit whether thei ar of god becaus mani fals prophet ar gone out into the world herebi know ye the spirit of god everi spirit that confesseth that jesu christ is come in the flesh is of god and everi spirit that confesseth not that jesu christ is come in the flesh is not of god and thi is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now alreadi is it in the world ye ar of god littl children and have overcom them becaus greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world thei ar of the world therefor speak thei of the world and the world heareth them we ar of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us herebi know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error belov let us love on anoth for love is of god and everi on that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love in thi wa manifest the love of god toward us becaus that god sent hi onli begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we love god but that he love us and sent hi son to be the propiti for our sin belov if god so love us we ought also to love on anoth no man hath seen god at ani time if we love on anoth god dwelleth in us and hi love is perfect in us herebi know we that we dwell in him and he in us becaus he hath given us of hi spirit and we have seen and do testifi that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world whosoev shall confess that jesu is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god and we have known and believ the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we mai have bold in the dai of judgment becaus as he is so ar we in thi world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear becaus fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him becaus he first love us if a man sai i love god and hateth hi brother he is a liar for he that loveth not hi brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen and thi command have we from him that he who loveth god love hi brother also whosoev believeth that jesu is the christ is born of god and everi on that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by thi we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep hi command for thi is the love of god that we keep hi command and hi command ar not grievou for whatsoev is born of god overcometh the world and thi is the victori that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesu is the son of god thi is he that came by water and blood even jesu christ not by water onli but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth wit becaus the spirit is truth for there ar three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holi ghost and these three ar on and there ar three that bear wit in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agre in on if we receiv the wit of men the wit of god is greater for thi is the wit of god which he hath testifi of hi son he that believeth on the son of god hath the wit in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar becaus he believeth not the record that god gave of hi son and thi is the record that god hath given to us etern life and thi life is in hi son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life these thing have i written unto you that believ on the name of the son of god that ye mai know that ye have etern life and that ye mai believ on the name of the son of god and thi is the confid that we have in him that if we ask ani thing accord to hi will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoev we ask we know that we have the petit that we desir of him if ani man see hi brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death i do not sai that he shall prai for it all unright is sin and there is a sin not unto death we know that whosoev is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wick on toucheth him not and we know that we ar of god and the whole world lieth in wicked and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understand that we mai know him that is true and we ar in him that is true even in hi son jesu christ thi is the true god and etern life littl children keep yourselv from idol amen the second epistl gener of john the elder unto the elect ladi and her children whom i love in the truth and not i
