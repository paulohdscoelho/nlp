teeth i wa onli wonder wa it late becaus she wish to good thei d take the snottynos twin and their babbi home to the mischief out of that so that wa why she just gave a gentl hint about it be late and when cissi came up edi ask her the time and miss cissi as glib as you like said it wa half past kiss time time to kiss again but edi want to know becaus thei were told to be in earli wait said cissi i ll run ask my uncl peter over there what s the time by hi conundrum so over she went and when he saw her come she could see him take hi hand out of hi pocket get nervou and begin to plai with hi watchchain look up at the church passion natur though he wa gerti could see that he had enorm control over himself on moment he had been there fascin by a loveli that made him gaze and the next moment it wa the quiet gravefac gentleman selfcontrol express in everi line of hi distinguishedlook figur cissi said to excus her would he mind pleas tell her what wa the right time and gerti could see him take out hi watch listen to it and look up and clear hi throat and he said he wa veri sorri hi watch wa stop but he thought it must be after eight becaus the sun wa set hi voic had a cultur ring in it and though he spoke in measur accent there wa a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tone cissi said thank and came back with her tongu out and said uncl said hi waterwork were out of order then thei sang the second vers of the tantum ergo and canon o hanlon got up again and cens the bless sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroi that on of the candl wa just go to set fire to the flower and father conroi got up and settl it all right and she could see the gentleman wind hi watch and listen to the work and she swung her leg more in and out in time it wa get darker but he could see and he wa look all the time that he wa wind the watch or whatev he wa do to it and then he put it back and put hi hand back into hi pocket she felt a kind of a sensat rush all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irrit against her stai that that thing must be come on becaus the last time too wa when she clip her hair on account of the moon hi dark ey fix themselv on her again drink in her everi contour liter worship at her shrine if ever there wa undisguis admir in a man s passion gaze it wa there plain to be seen on that man s face it is for you gertrud macdowel and you know it edi began to get readi to go and it wa high time for her and gerti notic that that littl hint she gave had had the desir effect becaus it wa a long wai along the strand to where there wa the place to push up the pushcar and cissi took off the twin cap and tidi their hair to make herself attract of cours and canon o hanlon stood up with hi cope poke up at hi neck and father conroi hand him the card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti ei and edi and cissi were talk about the time all the time and ask her but gerti could pai them back in their own coin and she just answer with scath polit when edi ask her wa she heartbroken about her best boi throw her over gerti winc sharpli a brief cold blaze shone from her ey that spoke volum of scorn immeasur it hurt o ye it cut deep becaus edi had her own quiet wai of sai thing like that she knew would wound like the confound littl cat she wa gerti s lip part swiftli to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifulli mould it seem on an artist might have dream of she had love him better than he knew lightheart deceiv and fickl like all hi sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there wa in the blue ey a quick sting of tear their ey were probe her mercilessli but with a brave effort she sparkl back in sympathi as she glanc at her new

chuck him asid as if he wa so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear hi silli postcard into a dozen piec and if ever after he dare to presum she could give him on look of measur scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot miss puni littl edi s counten fell to no slight extent and gerti could see by her look as black as thunder that she wa simpli in a tower rage though she hid it the littl kinnatt becaus that shaft had struck home for her petti jealousi and thei both knew that she wa someth aloof apart in anoth sphere that she wa not of

with the bless sacrament in hi hand how move the scene there in the gather twilight the last glimps of erin the touch chime of those even bell and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivi belfri through the dusk hither thither with a tini lost cry and she could see far awai the light of the lighthous so picturesqu she would have love to do with a box of paint becaus it wa easier than to make

she would follow her dream of love the dictat of her heart that told her he wa her all in all the onli man in all the world for her for love wa the master guid noth els matter come what might she would be wild untrammel free canon o hanlon put the bless sacrament back into the tabernacl and genuflect and the choir sang laudat dominum omn gent and then he lock the tabernacl door becaus the
